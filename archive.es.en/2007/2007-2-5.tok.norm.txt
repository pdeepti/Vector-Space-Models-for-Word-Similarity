germany 's supreme court determined monday that police may not secretly hack into suspects ' computers .
some are celebrating the decision as a civil rights victory , but the ruling may not be the last word on the matter . no legal framework for secret police hacking exists at this time , decided germany 's federal court of justice monday in karlsruhe , since searching computer and internet data on a suspect 's computer without their knowledge can not be compared to existing methods of police investigation . the court ruling stated that home searches differed from computer searches because they were always conducted in the presence of the suspect , or at least a witness .
telephone taps could also not be compared with computer hacking , continued the report , because previously saved data files fundamentally differ from live telecommunication . new legal framework may be created the public prosecutor 's office welcomed the decision from karlsruhe as it " established clarity on the scope of the existing investigation process concerning online evidence , which is so important to the investigation , " according to a statement cited by german news agency dpa . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble had been supportive of allowing police to conduct secret searches of computer hard drives and internet records . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble favors police hacking as an investigation method according to reports , it is likely that schäuble will now press for changes to the legal framework of the criminal investigation procedure that would allow for police hacking , which advocates see as particularly helpful in locating and prosecuting terrorists . support from the left jan korte from the left party immediately praised the court decision as a " godsend for civil rights . "
he also criticized schäuble , saying the interior minister should not " keep thinking up new methods of spying and then figure out the legal situation after the fact . " police hacking has been practiced in the past at the state level , often to scan the emails of individual suspects and criminal groups .
a court order was required in these cases and the computers could only be searched while they were running . a supreme court judge affirmed the legality of secret police hacking in february 2006 .
when this judgment was overturned in november , attorney general monika harms appealed .

australia courts top coach for world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could klinsi be swapping long beach for bondi beach ?
rumours abound that german legend jürgen klinsmann has been approached to lead the australian team , after he was spotted holding discussions in los angeles . germany 's world cup coach jürgen klinsmann has been sounded out by australia to lead their 2010 world cup campaign , according to reports in sydney newspaper the sun herald on sunday . klinsmann , who led host nation germany to third place at last year 's world cup , met peter lowy , son of football federation australia chairman frank lowy , for lunch in los angeles last tuesday , the newspaper said . the newspaper quoted one observer who said of the meeting : " real estate was one subject they discussed but coaching opportunities with australia were tossed around .
the meeting was definitely business and not at all a social call . " rumors unconfirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " g 'day klinsi !
fancy a tinny ? "
ffa officials sunday declined to confirm that the meeting had taken place and klinsmann could not be immediately contacted for comment .
but the former german striker is known to favour coaching international football over taking on the day-to-day grind of club duties . " i 'm preparing myself for something new that might come along , " klinsmann said last week .
" it could happen in a month or two , or a year or two .
" you have to be open to a lot of things .
there is not an endlessly long list of job options at this level .
the air is pretty thin up there .
and if it 's the right fit with the family and the right challenge , you go to the country where you might have once never thought you 'd go . " peter lowy runs the us arm of his family 's westfield property group , and according to the sun-herald , he is known to unofficially conduct ffa business when he can .
klinsmann has lived in california with his american wife and children since he retired from playing in 1998 .
he was in discussions with the us soccer federation last year about coaching its national team but ended talks in december when it became clear he would n't have control of team matters . aiming to win in 2010 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup mascot goleo has already made friends down under the ffa wants a full-time replacement for dutchman guus hiddink to take charge of the team before the 2010 world cup qualifiers kick off next year .
australians were thrilled when hiddink coached the socceroos to world cup qualification for the first time in 32 years , and are likely to be searching for a european with a strong track record again .
australia currently ranks 39th with fifa and the ffa is expects to take the team further in 2010 . the sun-herald said under any deal with australia , klinsmann would continue to live in the united states .
he was criticised in germany for not moving home in the lead-up to the world cup , preferring to commute from los angeles . if klinsmann is interested in the job then he is in competition with the socceroo 's assistant coach , australian graham arnold , who has made no secret of wanting the top job .
' if they 're talking to jürgen klinsmann , all i can do is try and make it as difficult as possible for them , ' arnold told australian news agency aap .
' on jürgen klinsmann , he did n't live in germany when he coached germany , he still lived in the united states - and germany is his home country .

the strain found is similar to the hungarian outbreak of asian h5n1 , detected among geese . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 strain was found in hungarian geese in january bernard matthews foods denied the chance of the virus being spread from its hungarian farms to its operations in eastern england . " the fact that we have a hungarian operation is immaterial , " the spokesman told britain 's the guardian newspaper . fourteen eu members were affected by the virus at the peak of the european bird flu crisis in 2005 and 2006 and the discovery of the deadly flu strain in britain has sparked precautionary measures in other european countries as national governments remain concerned about the virus that was last detected in germany in august 2006 . eu tightening fowl controls the british government put in created a three-kilometer -lrb- 1.8-mile -rrb- protection zone and 10-kilometer surveillance area around the bernard matthews farm , europe 's largest turkey farm , to quarantine the outbreak . british chief scientist sir david king played down the chances of the virus spreading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk officials are confident the outbreak has been contained " i 'm really confident this is not going to spread to other poultry holder , " he said . the dutch agriculture ministry announced it was putting extra protective measures in place , norway issued restrictions on the keeping of poultry while france evaluated the risk to its flocks and ireland to put laboratories on alert . poultry farmers in ireland were also told to be extra vigilant in keeping their stocks out of contact with wild birds . " poultry keepers should watch their birds very closely , " northern ireland 's chief veterinary officer bert houston said . europe 's false sense of security world health organization spokesman gregory hartl said countries should be aware that the h5n1 virus could mutate to become transmissible between humans just as easily in europe as in asian or african countries .

germany 's supreme court determined monday that police may not secretly hack into suspects ' computers .
some are celebrating the decision as a civil rights victory , but the ruling may not be the last word on the matter . no legal framework for secret police hacking exists at this time , decided germany 's federal court of justice monday in karlsruhe , since searching computer and internet data on a suspect 's computer without their knowledge can not be compared to existing methods of police investigation . the court ruling stated that home searches differed from computer searches because they were always conducted in the presence of the suspect , or at least a witness .
telephone taps could also not be compared with computer hacking , continued the report , because previously saved data files fundamentally differ from live telecommunication . new legal framework may be created the public prosecutor 's office welcomed the decision from karlsruhe as it " established clarity on the scope of the existing investigation process concerning online evidence , which is so important to the investigation , " according to a statement cited by german news agency dpa . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble had been supportive of allowing police to conduct secret searches of computer hard drives and internet records . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble favors police hacking as an investigation method according to reports , it is likely that schäuble will now press for changes to the legal framework of the criminal investigation procedure that would allow for police hacking , which advocates see as particularly helpful in locating and prosecuting terrorists . support from the left jan korte from the left party immediately praised the court decision as a " godsend for civil rights . "
he also criticized schäuble , saying the interior minister should not " keep thinking up new methods of spying and then figure out the legal situation after the fact . " police hacking has been practiced in the past at the state level , often to scan the emails of individual suspects and criminal groups .
a court order was required in these cases and the computers could only be searched while they were running . a supreme court judge affirmed the legality of secret police hacking in february 2006 .
when this judgment was overturned in november , attorney general monika harms appealed .
monday 's decision rejected harms ' appeal and upheld the november decision . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police turn up the heat on internet sex offenders as arrests for child pornography have increased , the office of criminal investigation in baden-württemberg says it intends to beef up its it-forensics department so no pedophile feels safe or anonymous on the internet .

germany 's supreme court determined monday that police may not secretly hack into suspects ' computers .
some are celebrating the decision as a civil rights victory , but the ruling may not be the last word on the matter . no legal framework for secret police hacking exists at this time , decided germany 's federal court of justice monday in karlsruhe , since searching computer and internet data on a suspect 's computer without their knowledge can not be compared to existing methods of police investigation . the court ruling stated that home searches differed from computer searches because they were always conducted in the presence of the suspect , or at least a witness .
telephone taps could also not be compared with computer hacking , continued the report , because previously saved data files fundamentally differ from live telecommunication . new legal framework may be created the public prosecutor 's office welcomed the decision from karlsruhe as it " established clarity on the scope of the existing investigation process concerning online evidence , which is so important to the investigation , " according to a statement cited by german news agency dpa . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble had been supportive of allowing police to conduct secret searches of computer hard drives and internet records . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble favors police hacking as an investigation method according to reports , it is likely that schäuble will now press for changes to the legal framework of the criminal investigation procedure that would allow for police hacking , which advocates see as particularly helpful in locating and prosecuting terrorists . support from the left jan korte from the left party immediately praised the court decision as a " godsend for civil rights . "
he also criticized schäuble , saying the interior minister should not " keep thinking up new methods of spying and then figure out the legal situation after the fact . " police hacking has been practiced in the past at the state level , often to scan the emails of individual suspects and criminal groups .
a court order was required in these cases and the computers could only be searched while they were running . a supreme court judge affirmed the legality of secret police hacking in february 2006 .

she spoke to dw-world.de about chancellor angela merkel 's initial trip to the mideast . dw-world.de : angela merkel is making her first trip to the arabic world as the german chancellor .
how do you think she will be received ? leslie tramontini : i can imagine that as the german chancellor she will be very positively received because the germans generally have a good image in the arabic world .
i do not think there will be any kind of astonishment when the first female chancellor arrives in the arabic world .
i have always experienced that as a woman i was always most welcome and taken seriously .
i could even imagine that it is an advantage for her . the revival of the mideast quartet is high on merkel 's agenda .
how can merkel push the peace process forward ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's four-day trip began saturday in egypt merkel can try egyptian help , saudi help and support for the revival of some type of peace talks .
we do not necessarily need to talk about this " road map , " but that they just sit down together at one table .
additionally , it is very difficult to bring peace or start peace talks when the parties are so divided .
in view of its historical past , germany must also , in my opinion , tell the israelis if there is going to be peace , you too have to make concessions . the saudi initiative from beirut in march 2002 was excellent .
it said we recognize israel when it pulls back to its 1967 border and when the refugee question is dealt with in a somewhat dignified way .
that would have been a foundation that they could sit down together about .
until that happens , we have to ask ourselves why it was not accepted . what merkel should do is try to collect as much arab support as possible . german initiatives usually are well accepted in the arabic world .
can the eu , under german leadership , take over the us leadership role ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all merkel 's efforts as eu president will need foreign help i think that can be answered with a clear no .
the eu and merkel and steinmeier can try to use germany 's influence to put pressure on .
but nothing , from neither the israeli nor the palestinian side , would ever be put through against the will or without the support of the united states .
the americans have to be a part , that 's a fact that is recognized , possibly grudgingly , by all sides . while militant and peaceful muslims use all their resources to fight their own governments and the west , is there really a chance for peace ? willingness to use violence does not generally go together with peace .
but the willingness to use force is not only coming from the islamic side but also from the israeli army , for example .
the destruction houses is also violence .
as long as both sides think the other only understands the language of violence , i do not see any large hope . aladdin sarhan interviewed leslie tramontini -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel arrives in saudi arabia pressing for middle east peace german chancellor angela merkel flew in to the saudi capital on sunday on the second leg of a middle east tour aimed at coordinating efforts to resume israeli-palestinian peace talks .

she spoke to dw-world.de about chancellor angela merkel 's initial trip to the mideast . dw-world.de : angela merkel is making her first trip to the arabic world as the german chancellor .
how do you think she will be received ? leslie tramontini : i can imagine that as the german chancellor she will be very positively received because the germans generally have a good image in the arabic world .
i do not think there will be any kind of astonishment when the first female chancellor arrives in the arabic world .
i have always experienced that as a woman i was always most welcome and taken seriously .
i could even imagine that it is an advantage for her . the revival of the mideast quartet is high on merkel 's agenda .
how can merkel push the peace process forward ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's four-day trip began saturday in egypt merkel can try egyptian help , saudi help and support for the revival of some type of peace talks .
we do not necessarily need to talk about this " road map , " but that they just sit down together at one table .
additionally , it is very difficult to bring peace or start peace talks when the parties are so divided .
in view of its historical past , germany must also , in my opinion , tell the israelis if there is going to be peace , you too have to make concessions . the saudi initiative from beirut in march 2002 was excellent .
it said we recognize israel when it pulls back to its 1967 border and when the refugee question is dealt with in a somewhat dignified way .
that would have been a foundation that they could sit down together about .
until that happens , we have to ask ourselves why it was not accepted . what merkel should do is try to collect as much arab support as possible . german initiatives usually are well accepted in the arabic world .
can the eu , under german leadership , take over the us leadership role ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all merkel 's efforts as eu president will need foreign help i think that can be answered with a clear no .
the eu and merkel and steinmeier can try to use germany 's influence to put pressure on .
but nothing , from neither the israeli nor the palestinian side , would ever be put through against the will or without the support of the united states .
the americans have to be a part , that 's a fact that is recognized , possibly grudgingly , by all sides . while militant and peaceful muslims use all their resources to fight their own governments and the west , is there really a chance for peace ? willingness to use violence does not generally go together with peace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de lifestyle -pipe- 05.02.2007 hunting in germany stealthily gains in popularity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old guard of germany 's hunting community are being joined by the young guns while hunting in germany has long been seen as part of the country 's conservation program , taking to the forest with arms now attracts germans for other reasons and the activity is growing in popularity . in the uk , it 's the preserve of gamekeepers and the landed gentry ; a countryside tradition of tweed-clad shooting parties and red-blazered hunt masters surrounded by baying beagles .
in the united states , it 's an everyman sport ; all orange vests , elmer fudd hats and embarrassing events involving vice presidents . in both countries , hunting is a way of life , albeit one which is embraced by very different social circles on either side of the atlantic .
but what of germany ?
for those who have ever hunted for fun or necessity , germany 's rolling hills and wild expanses of forest conjure up images of a target-rich environment .
for others , hunting in germany may just be a series of headlines about problem bears and the return of wolves . " hunting in germany can not be compared to that which takes place in great britain or the united states , " said thorsten reinwald , spokesperson for the german hunter 's association -lrb- djv -rrb- .
" it is closer to the british concept of culling .
hunters in germany follow strict quotas for the shooting of particular animals like deer and have a responsibility to contribute to the regeneration of the environment . " hunting in britain and the united states is seen as a sport , whereas the djv promotes the activity as a necessary part of germany 's conservation policy , reinwald said . german hunters avoid publicity 's glare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tally-ho !
hunting in britain has a high media profile hunting in germany remains relatively low-key with discussions on the subject making only rare forays into the media .
it seems that , unless you are in the know , germany 's hunters barely feature in the wider public consciousness and are happy to sit with their hides away from the glare of publicity . germany boasts a hunting population of over 300,000 , of which 90 percent are members of the djv .
almost half of all the hunters in germany come from the sector the djv annual report describes as " employees / workers , " a vague title which does , however , exclude farmers - a group often associated with hunting more than any other . the djv says that 15 percent of german hunters work in farming while a further 27 percent are " self-employed . "
pensioners and the unemployed make up the final 11 percent . an expensive pastime while " employees / workers " could include anyone from bus drivers to bank managers , it suggests that the 47 percent of german hunters , who qualify under this heading , plus those who work for themselves , are of gainful employment .
and they need to be .
hunting in germany does not come cheap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of time , money and training goes into being a hunter a course to fulfill all the criteria and results in the participant being ready to apply for a license -lrb- jagdschein -rrb- can cost in excess of 700 euros -lrb- $ 905 -rrb- . in addition to the financial costs , hunting in germany requires a dedication of the mind as well as one of the pocket as gaining a hunting license is a complicated affair .
to do so , one needs to attend a specialist training course that often requires the would-be hunter to rack up at least 120 hours of practical and theoretical training . as stipulated in federal hunting law , a candidate must pass the hunting examination , which is composed of a written and oral examination and a shooting test with both a shotgun and a rifle .
according to the law , the candidate must show adequate knowledge of a vast selection of topics including game biology and management , hunting management , farming and forestry , firearms law and technique , and gundog handling . exams and laws keep hunting tightly regulated hunters are also subject to strict police checks and will be refused a license if they have been found guilty of any crime involving firearms , ammunition and explosives .
offenses against nature conservation or protection of animal rights or if the applicant is addicted to drugs can lead to license revocation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young , responsible and licensed to kill while the german hunting community champions itself as an inclusive one - open as it is to all law-abiding citizens over the age of 18 who have the time , money and inclination to earn a license - the expenditure , dedication and personal requirements needed to qualify does give the pastime an exclusive feel . for some , having a hunting license becomes a trophy in itself ; a status symbol which allows the bearer to enter another world where like-minded individuals gather to revel in their own achievements and pursue an activity safe in the knowledge that they are among those who have earned the right to hunt . the feeling of community has gone a long way to attracting the new generation of hunters , a breed where the bonding over warm guns and carcasses is as important as the hunting itself . " researchers at the university of bremen have discovered in a study that this is one of the main reasons behind people pursuing a hunting license , " the djv 's thorsten reinwald said .
" hunting brings an intense physical experience and balances the stresses of hectic everyday life . " escaping the pressures of the city to indulge in an activity that is , at its very roots , primal has proved to be something of a lure to an increasing number of young professionals , mostly from corporate management positions .
while hunting provides a safety valve from the stresses of work , it also provides a platform for networking . schmoozing and shooting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new generation gets to blow its own horn " when i started my internship at mckinsey , i often heard the consultants planning hunting trips , " said lars fischer , a visitor to the annual jagd und hund hunting convention held in dortmund .
" there would be excitement whenever someone managed to get a senior manager to come along .
it was never said out loud but everyone knew that having a hunting license was a way to get into certain influential circles .
it inspired me to go for mine . " annabelle gretschner , a museum curator 's assistant from münster at the convention with her partner , has a similar story . " many of the guys i studied with now have their license , " she said .
" very few of them had any interest in hunting at university but now the ones who have management level jobs often go shooting with clients and colleagues .
deals and connections are made out in the wild very much like they used to be on the golf course .

the strain found is similar to the hungarian outbreak of asian h5n1 , detected among geese . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 strain was found in hungarian geese in january bernard matthews foods denied the chance of the virus being spread from its hungarian farms to its operations in eastern england . " the fact that we have a hungarian operation is immaterial , " the spokesman told britain 's the guardian newspaper . fourteen eu members were affected by the virus at the peak of the european bird flu crisis in 2005 and 2006 and the discovery of the deadly flu strain in britain has sparked precautionary measures in other european countries as national governments remain concerned about the virus that was last detected in germany in august 2006 . eu tightening fowl controls the british government put in created a three-kilometer -lrb- 1.8-mile -rrb- protection zone and 10-kilometer surveillance area around the bernard matthews farm , europe 's largest turkey farm , to quarantine the outbreak . british chief scientist sir david king played down the chances of the virus spreading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk officials are confident the outbreak has been contained " i 'm really confident this is not going to spread to other poultry holder , " he said . the dutch agriculture ministry announced it was putting extra protective measures in place , norway issued restrictions on the keeping of poultry while france evaluated the risk to its flocks and ireland to put laboratories on alert . poultry farmers in ireland were also told to be extra vigilant in keeping their stocks out of contact with wild birds . " poultry keepers should watch their birds very closely , " northern ireland 's chief veterinary officer bert houston said . europe 's false sense of security world health organization spokesman gregory hartl said countries should be aware that the h5n1 virus could mutate to become transmissible between humans just as easily in europe as in asian or african countries .
" a mutation could occur anywhere , " hartl said .
" someone was saying in relation to the british outbreak , ' oh , it wo n't happen in europe . '
that 's really a kind of false security that is being built up . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health officials fear the virus could spread to humans the virus , which has killed 142 people in southeast asia and 165 worldwide since resurfacing in 2003 , does not appear to be mutating into a form easily transmissible between humans , according to david nabarro , the un official heading the global fight against avian influenza . more cases likely nabarro , however , added that he expected more cases of the virus to turn up . " i am expecting to see outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in a number of locations over the next three or four months , and i am basing it on what happened last year , " he told the afp news agency . " during the time that i 've been in this job , i have seen no increase in the risk of a pandemic , " nabarro said . farm workers , many of whom are migrants from portugal , and those involved in the cull have been given anti-viral drugs , and none of the affected bird entered the food chain , bernard matthews said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu confirms virulent bird flu strain on british farm the european commission confirmed on saturday that the bird flu virus detected at one of europe 's largest turkey manufactures was the virulent h5n1 strain .

australia courts top coach for world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could klinsi be swapping long beach for bondi beach ?
rumours abound that german legend jürgen klinsmann has been approached to lead the australian team , after he was spotted holding discussions in los angeles . germany 's world cup coach jürgen klinsmann has been sounded out by australia to lead their 2010 world cup campaign , according to reports in sydney newspaper the sun herald on sunday . klinsmann , who led host nation germany to third place at last year 's world cup , met peter lowy , son of football federation australia chairman frank lowy , for lunch in los angeles last tuesday , the newspaper said . the newspaper quoted one observer who said of the meeting : " real estate was one subject they discussed but coaching opportunities with australia were tossed around .

ffa officials sunday declined to confirm that the meeting had taken place and klinsmann could not be immediately contacted for comment .

" it could happen in a month or two , or a year or two .
" you have to be open to a lot of things .

australia currently ranks 39th with fifa and the ffa is expects to take the team further in 2010 . the sun-herald said under any deal with australia , klinsmann would continue to live in the united states .
he was criticised in germany for not moving home in the lead-up to the world cup , preferring to commute from los angeles . if klinsmann is interested in the job then he is in competition with the socceroo 's assistant coach , australian graham arnold , who has made no secret of wanting the top job .

but with 800 years of history between its pages , there 's plenty of room for mystery . commissioned for new cathedral bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monk herimann is the artist behind henry 's gospels henry the lion , prince of what were then the kingdoms of saxony and bavaria , was one of the most powerful rulers of the middle ages and a member of the guelph royal line . fitting with the tradition of the time , he commissioned the book in 1188 in honor of the consecration of the st. mary 's altar in the recently completed cathedral in braunschweig . still wholly intact except for minor wear , the text includes all four of the bible 's holy gospels on 226 parchment pages .
fifty of these pages are colorful , elaborate pictures with gold leaf . the book 's high liturgical purpose was the reason for its ornate design and distinction : passages were read from it during each mass . spotty history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the so-called " evangeliar " in 1984 shortly after its return to germany only bits of the text 's fate after henry 's reign are known .
at some point it landed in prague and in 1861 it was bought by the king of hanover , who wanted to place it in a museum .
when he was dethroned in 1866 , he took the precious text with him to austria . helmar härtel from the herzog august library , where the gospels are now kept , told german television station zdf that they were offered to the king of england in 1945 after world war ii had come to an end .
he refused . the parchments managed to make it to england nevertheless , though the how and why are unclear , and they were auctioned at sotheby 's in 1983 .
since that time , the gospels have been housed in the herzog august library in wolfenbüttel just outside of braunschweig in lower saxony . after march 18 , the 800-year-old pages will be returned to their specially designed climate-controlled safe , taking their history - and mystery - with them . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sneak peek : new german books hit the english market looking for a good book ?

in the united states , it 's an everyman sport ; all orange vests , elmer fudd hats and embarrassing events involving vice presidents . in both countries , hunting is a way of life , albeit one which is embraced by very different social circles on either side of the atlantic .
but what of germany ?
for those who have ever hunted for fun or necessity , germany 's rolling hills and wild expanses of forest conjure up images of a target-rich environment .
for others , hunting in germany may just be a series of headlines about problem bears and the return of wolves . " hunting in germany can not be compared to that which takes place in great britain or the united states , " said thorsten reinwald , spokesperson for the german hunter 's association -lrb- djv -rrb- .
" it is closer to the british concept of culling .
hunters in germany follow strict quotas for the shooting of particular animals like deer and have a responsibility to contribute to the regeneration of the environment . " hunting in britain and the united states is seen as a sport , whereas the djv promotes the activity as a necessary part of germany 's conservation policy , reinwald said . german hunters avoid publicity 's glare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tally-ho !
hunting in britain has a high media profile hunting in germany remains relatively low-key with discussions on the subject making only rare forays into the media .
it seems that , unless you are in the know , germany 's hunters barely feature in the wider public consciousness and are happy to sit with their hides away from the glare of publicity . germany boasts a hunting population of over 300,000 , of which 90 percent are members of the djv .
almost half of all the hunters in germany come from the sector the djv annual report describes as " employees / workers , " a vague title which does , however , exclude farmers - a group often associated with hunting more than any other . the djv says that 15 percent of german hunters work in farming while a further 27 percent are " self-employed . "
pensioners and the unemployed make up the final 11 percent . an expensive pastime while " employees / workers " could include anyone from bus drivers to bank managers , it suggests that the 47 percent of german hunters , who qualify under this heading , plus those who work for themselves , are of gainful employment .
and they need to be .
hunting in germany does not come cheap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of time , money and training goes into being a hunter a course to fulfill all the criteria and results in the participant being ready to apply for a license -lrb- jagdschein -rrb- can cost in excess of 700 euros -lrb- $ 905 -rrb- . in addition to the financial costs , hunting in germany requires a dedication of the mind as well as one of the pocket as gaining a hunting license is a complicated affair .
to do so , one needs to attend a specialist training course that often requires the would-be hunter to rack up at least 120 hours of practical and theoretical training . as stipulated in federal hunting law , a candidate must pass the hunting examination , which is composed of a written and oral examination and a shooting test with both a shotgun and a rifle .
according to the law , the candidate must show adequate knowledge of a vast selection of topics including game biology and management , hunting management , farming and forestry , firearms law and technique , and gundog handling . exams and laws keep hunting tightly regulated hunters are also subject to strict police checks and will be refused a license if they have been found guilty of any crime involving firearms , ammunition and explosives .
offenses against nature conservation or protection of animal rights or if the applicant is addicted to drugs can lead to license revocation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young , responsible and licensed to kill while the german hunting community champions itself as an inclusive one - open as it is to all law-abiding citizens over the age of 18 who have the time , money and inclination to earn a license - the expenditure , dedication and personal requirements needed to qualify does give the pastime an exclusive feel . for some , having a hunting license becomes a trophy in itself ; a status symbol which allows the bearer to enter another world where like-minded individuals gather to revel in their own achievements and pursue an activity safe in the knowledge that they are among those who have earned the right to hunt . the feeling of community has gone a long way to attracting the new generation of hunters , a breed where the bonding over warm guns and carcasses is as important as the hunting itself . " researchers at the university of bremen have discovered in a study that this is one of the main reasons behind people pursuing a hunting license , " the djv 's thorsten reinwald said .
" hunting brings an intense physical experience and balances the stresses of hectic everyday life . " escaping the pressures of the city to indulge in an activity that is , at its very roots , primal has proved to be something of a lure to an increasing number of young professionals , mostly from corporate management positions .

" there would be excitement whenever someone managed to get a senior manager to come along .

in the united states , it 's an everyman sport ; all orange vests , elmer fudd hats and embarrassing events involving vice presidents . in both countries , hunting is a way of life , albeit one which is embraced by very different social circles on either side of the atlantic .
but what of germany ?
for those who have ever hunted for fun or necessity , germany 's rolling hills and wild expanses of forest conjure up images of a target-rich environment .
for others , hunting in germany may just be a series of headlines about problem bears and the return of wolves . " hunting in germany can not be compared to that which takes place in great britain or the united states , " said thorsten reinwald , spokesperson for the german hunter 's association -lrb- djv -rrb- .
" it is closer to the british concept of culling .
hunters in germany follow strict quotas for the shooting of particular animals like deer and have a responsibility to contribute to the regeneration of the environment . " hunting in britain and the united states is seen as a sport , whereas the djv promotes the activity as a necessary part of germany 's conservation policy , reinwald said . german hunters avoid publicity 's glare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tally-ho !
hunting in britain has a high media profile hunting in germany remains relatively low-key with discussions on the subject making only rare forays into the media .
it seems that , unless you are in the know , germany 's hunters barely feature in the wider public consciousness and are happy to sit with their hides away from the glare of publicity . germany boasts a hunting population of over 300,000 , of which 90 percent are members of the djv .
almost half of all the hunters in germany come from the sector the djv annual report describes as " employees / workers , " a vague title which does , however , exclude farmers - a group often associated with hunting more than any other . the djv says that 15 percent of german hunters work in farming while a further 27 percent are " self-employed . "
pensioners and the unemployed make up the final 11 percent . an expensive pastime while " employees / workers " could include anyone from bus drivers to bank managers , it suggests that the 47 percent of german hunters , who qualify under this heading , plus those who work for themselves , are of gainful employment .
and they need to be .
hunting in germany does not come cheap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of time , money and training goes into being a hunter a course to fulfill all the criteria and results in the participant being ready to apply for a license -lrb- jagdschein -rrb- can cost in excess of 700 euros -lrb- $ 905 -rrb- . in addition to the financial costs , hunting in germany requires a dedication of the mind as well as one of the pocket as gaining a hunting license is a complicated affair .
to do so , one needs to attend a specialist training course that often requires the would-be hunter to rack up at least 120 hours of practical and theoretical training . as stipulated in federal hunting law , a candidate must pass the hunting examination , which is composed of a written and oral examination and a shooting test with both a shotgun and a rifle .
according to the law , the candidate must show adequate knowledge of a vast selection of topics including game biology and management , hunting management , farming and forestry , firearms law and technique , and gundog handling . exams and laws keep hunting tightly regulated hunters are also subject to strict police checks and will be refused a license if they have been found guilty of any crime involving firearms , ammunition and explosives .
offenses against nature conservation or protection of animal rights or if the applicant is addicted to drugs can lead to license revocation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young , responsible and licensed to kill while the german hunting community champions itself as an inclusive one - open as it is to all law-abiding citizens over the age of 18 who have the time , money and inclination to earn a license - the expenditure , dedication and personal requirements needed to qualify does give the pastime an exclusive feel . for some , having a hunting license becomes a trophy in itself ; a status symbol which allows the bearer to enter another world where like-minded individuals gather to revel in their own achievements and pursue an activity safe in the knowledge that they are among those who have earned the right to hunt . the feeling of community has gone a long way to attracting the new generation of hunters , a breed where the bonding over warm guns and carcasses is as important as the hunting itself . " researchers at the university of bremen have discovered in a study that this is one of the main reasons behind people pursuing a hunting license , " the djv 's thorsten reinwald said .
" hunting brings an intense physical experience and balances the stresses of hectic everyday life . " escaping the pressures of the city to indulge in an activity that is , at its very roots , primal has proved to be something of a lure to an increasing number of young professionals , mostly from corporate management positions .
while hunting provides a safety valve from the stresses of work , it also provides a platform for networking . schmoozing and shooting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new generation gets to blow its own horn " when i started my internship at mckinsey , i often heard the consultants planning hunting trips , " said lars fischer , a visitor to the annual jagd und hund hunting convention held in dortmund .
" there would be excitement whenever someone managed to get a senior manager to come along .
it was never said out loud but everyone knew that having a hunting license was a way to get into certain influential circles .

australia courts top coach for world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could klinsi be swapping long beach for bondi beach ?
rumours abound that german legend jürgen klinsmann has been approached to lead the australian team , after he was spotted holding discussions in los angeles . germany 's world cup coach jürgen klinsmann has been sounded out by australia to lead their 2010 world cup campaign , according to reports in sydney newspaper the sun herald on sunday . klinsmann , who led host nation germany to third place at last year 's world cup , met peter lowy , son of football federation australia chairman frank lowy , for lunch in los angeles last tuesday , the newspaper said . the newspaper quoted one observer who said of the meeting : " real estate was one subject they discussed but coaching opportunities with australia were tossed around .
the meeting was definitely business and not at all a social call . " rumors unconfirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " g 'day klinsi !
fancy a tinny ? "
ffa officials sunday declined to confirm that the meeting had taken place and klinsmann could not be immediately contacted for comment .
but the former german striker is known to favour coaching international football over taking on the day-to-day grind of club duties . " i 'm preparing myself for something new that might come along , " klinsmann said last week .
" it could happen in a month or two , or a year or two .
" you have to be open to a lot of things .
there is not an endlessly long list of job options at this level .
the air is pretty thin up there .
and if it 's the right fit with the family and the right challenge , you go to the country where you might have once never thought you 'd go . " peter lowy runs the us arm of his family 's westfield property group , and according to the sun-herald , he is known to unofficially conduct ffa business when he can .
klinsmann has lived in california with his american wife and children since he retired from playing in 1998 .
he was in discussions with the us soccer federation last year about coaching its national team but ended talks in december when it became clear he would n't have control of team matters . aiming to win in 2010 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup mascot goleo has already made friends down under the ffa wants a full-time replacement for dutchman guus hiddink to take charge of the team before the 2010 world cup qualifiers kick off next year .
australians were thrilled when hiddink coached the socceroos to world cup qualification for the first time in 32 years , and are likely to be searching for a european with a strong track record again .
australia currently ranks 39th with fifa and the ffa is expects to take the team further in 2010 . the sun-herald said under any deal with australia , klinsmann would continue to live in the united states .
he was criticised in germany for not moving home in the lead-up to the world cup , preferring to commute from los angeles . if klinsmann is interested in the job then he is in competition with the socceroo 's assistant coach , australian graham arnold , who has made no secret of wanting the top job .
' if they 're talking to jürgen klinsmann , all i can do is try and make it as difficult as possible for them , ' arnold told australian news agency aap .
' on jürgen klinsmann , he did n't live in germany when he coached germany , he still lived in the united states - and germany is his home country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 05.02.2007 " merkel should try to collect as much arab support as possible " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel needs support from arab governments to restart the peace process there will be little reason to hope for an end to the israeli-palestinian conflict until the sides are able to once again sit down at one table , middle east expert leslie tramontini told dw-world.de. leslie tramontini is a professor at the university of freiburg and an expert on middle east policy and ethnic conflict .
she spoke to dw-world.de about chancellor angela merkel 's initial trip to the mideast . dw-world.de : angela merkel is making her first trip to the arabic world as the german chancellor .
how do you think she will be received ? leslie tramontini : i can imagine that as the german chancellor she will be very positively received because the germans generally have a good image in the arabic world .
i do not think there will be any kind of astonishment when the first female chancellor arrives in the arabic world .
i have always experienced that as a woman i was always most welcome and taken seriously .
i could even imagine that it is an advantage for her . the revival of the mideast quartet is high on merkel 's agenda .
how can merkel push the peace process forward ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's four-day trip began saturday in egypt merkel can try egyptian help , saudi help and support for the revival of some type of peace talks .
we do not necessarily need to talk about this " road map , " but that they just sit down together at one table .
additionally , it is very difficult to bring peace or start peace talks when the parties are so divided .
in view of its historical past , germany must also , in my opinion , tell the israelis if there is going to be peace , you too have to make concessions . the saudi initiative from beirut in march 2002 was excellent .
it said we recognize israel when it pulls back to its 1967 border and when the refugee question is dealt with in a somewhat dignified way .
that would have been a foundation that they could sit down together about .
until that happens , we have to ask ourselves why it was not accepted . what merkel should do is try to collect as much arab support as possible . german initiatives usually are well accepted in the arabic world .
can the eu , under german leadership , take over the us leadership role ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all merkel 's efforts as eu president will need foreign help i think that can be answered with a clear no .
the eu and merkel and steinmeier can try to use germany 's influence to put pressure on .
but nothing , from neither the israeli nor the palestinian side , would ever be put through against the will or without the support of the united states .
the americans have to be a part , that 's a fact that is recognized , possibly grudgingly , by all sides . while militant and peaceful muslims use all their resources to fight their own governments and the west , is there really a chance for peace ? willingness to use violence does not generally go together with peace .
but the willingness to use force is not only coming from the islamic side but also from the israeli army , for example .
the destruction houses is also violence .
as long as both sides think the other only understands the language of violence , i do not see any large hope . aladdin sarhan interviewed leslie tramontini -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel arrives in saudi arabia pressing for middle east peace german chancellor angela merkel flew in to the saudi capital on sunday on the second leg of a middle east tour aimed at coordinating efforts to resume israeli-palestinian peace talks .
-lrb- 04.02.2007 -rrb- merkel reiterates need to bring israel , palestinians together german chancellor angela merkel on saturday warned of a great threat to the middle east if talks between israel and the palestinians are not pursued , after meeting with king abdullah of jordan .

germany 's supreme court determined monday that police may not secretly hack into suspects ' computers .
some are celebrating the decision as a civil rights victory , but the ruling may not be the last word on the matter . no legal framework for secret police hacking exists at this time , decided germany 's federal court of justice monday in karlsruhe , since searching computer and internet data on a suspect 's computer without their knowledge can not be compared to existing methods of police investigation . the court ruling stated that home searches differed from computer searches because they were always conducted in the presence of the suspect , or at least a witness .
telephone taps could also not be compared with computer hacking , continued the report , because previously saved data files fundamentally differ from live telecommunication . new legal framework may be created the public prosecutor 's office welcomed the decision from karlsruhe as it " established clarity on the scope of the existing investigation process concerning online evidence , which is so important to the investigation , " according to a statement cited by german news agency dpa . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble had been supportive of allowing police to conduct secret searches of computer hard drives and internet records . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble favors police hacking as an investigation method according to reports , it is likely that schäuble will now press for changes to the legal framework of the criminal investigation procedure that would allow for police hacking , which advocates see as particularly helpful in locating and prosecuting terrorists . support from the left jan korte from the left party immediately praised the court decision as a " godsend for civil rights . "
he also criticized schäuble , saying the interior minister should not " keep thinking up new methods of spying and then figure out the legal situation after the fact . " police hacking has been practiced in the past at the state level , often to scan the emails of individual suspects and criminal groups .
a court order was required in these cases and the computers could only be searched while they were running . a supreme court judge affirmed the legality of secret police hacking in february 2006 .

the victims were three men and three women , all believed to be of asian origin . they had been tied up and their bodies were found in different rooms of the lin yue restaurant in sittensen , a town of 10,000 inhabitants near the northern port of hamburg .
the owners of the restaurant and staff members were among the dead . police spokesman thomas teuber said another member of the restaurant staff suffered serious gunshot wounds and was being treated in hospital .
the bodies were found by a 47-year-old man who came to fetch his wife from the restaurant shortly after midnight .
she was among the dead . the motive for the killings was unclear , police said .
there was no evidence that the restaurant had been the target of blackmail and there was no history of chinese mafia activity in lower saxony , the state where it is situated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de lifestyle -pipe- 05.02.2007 hunting in germany stealthily gains in popularity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old guard of germany 's hunting community are being joined by the young guns while hunting in germany has long been seen as part of the country 's conservation program , taking to the forest with arms now attracts germans for other reasons and the activity is growing in popularity . in the uk , it 's the preserve of gamekeepers and the landed gentry ; a countryside tradition of tweed-clad shooting parties and red-blazered hunt masters surrounded by baying beagles .
in the united states , it 's an everyman sport ; all orange vests , elmer fudd hats and embarrassing events involving vice presidents . in both countries , hunting is a way of life , albeit one which is embraced by very different social circles on either side of the atlantic .
but what of germany ?
for those who have ever hunted for fun or necessity , germany 's rolling hills and wild expanses of forest conjure up images of a target-rich environment .
for others , hunting in germany may just be a series of headlines about problem bears and the return of wolves . " hunting in germany can not be compared to that which takes place in great britain or the united states , " said thorsten reinwald , spokesperson for the german hunter 's association -lrb- djv -rrb- .
" it is closer to the british concept of culling .
hunters in germany follow strict quotas for the shooting of particular animals like deer and have a responsibility to contribute to the regeneration of the environment . " hunting in britain and the united states is seen as a sport , whereas the djv promotes the activity as a necessary part of germany 's conservation policy , reinwald said . german hunters avoid publicity 's glare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tally-ho !
hunting in britain has a high media profile hunting in germany remains relatively low-key with discussions on the subject making only rare forays into the media .
it seems that , unless you are in the know , germany 's hunters barely feature in the wider public consciousness and are happy to sit with their hides away from the glare of publicity . germany boasts a hunting population of over 300,000 , of which 90 percent are members of the djv .
almost half of all the hunters in germany come from the sector the djv annual report describes as " employees / workers , " a vague title which does , however , exclude farmers - a group often associated with hunting more than any other . the djv says that 15 percent of german hunters work in farming while a further 27 percent are " self-employed . "
pensioners and the unemployed make up the final 11 percent . an expensive pastime while " employees / workers " could include anyone from bus drivers to bank managers , it suggests that the 47 percent of german hunters , who qualify under this heading , plus those who work for themselves , are of gainful employment .
and they need to be .
hunting in germany does not come cheap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of time , money and training goes into being a hunter a course to fulfill all the criteria and results in the participant being ready to apply for a license -lrb- jagdschein -rrb- can cost in excess of 700 euros -lrb- $ 905 -rrb- . in addition to the financial costs , hunting in germany requires a dedication of the mind as well as one of the pocket as gaining a hunting license is a complicated affair .
to do so , one needs to attend a specialist training course that often requires the would-be hunter to rack up at least 120 hours of practical and theoretical training . as stipulated in federal hunting law , a candidate must pass the hunting examination , which is composed of a written and oral examination and a shooting test with both a shotgun and a rifle .

in the united states , it 's an everyman sport ; all orange vests , elmer fudd hats and embarrassing events involving vice presidents . in both countries , hunting is a way of life , albeit one which is embraced by very different social circles on either side of the atlantic .
but what of germany ?
for those who have ever hunted for fun or necessity , germany 's rolling hills and wild expanses of forest conjure up images of a target-rich environment .
for others , hunting in germany may just be a series of headlines about problem bears and the return of wolves . " hunting in germany can not be compared to that which takes place in great britain or the united states , " said thorsten reinwald , spokesperson for the german hunter 's association -lrb- djv -rrb- .
" it is closer to the british concept of culling .
hunters in germany follow strict quotas for the shooting of particular animals like deer and have a responsibility to contribute to the regeneration of the environment . " hunting in britain and the united states is seen as a sport , whereas the djv promotes the activity as a necessary part of germany 's conservation policy , reinwald said . german hunters avoid publicity 's glare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tally-ho !
hunting in britain has a high media profile hunting in germany remains relatively low-key with discussions on the subject making only rare forays into the media .
it seems that , unless you are in the know , germany 's hunters barely feature in the wider public consciousness and are happy to sit with their hides away from the glare of publicity . germany boasts a hunting population of over 300,000 , of which 90 percent are members of the djv .
almost half of all the hunters in germany come from the sector the djv annual report describes as " employees / workers , " a vague title which does , however , exclude farmers - a group often associated with hunting more than any other . the djv says that 15 percent of german hunters work in farming while a further 27 percent are " self-employed . "
pensioners and the unemployed make up the final 11 percent . an expensive pastime while " employees / workers " could include anyone from bus drivers to bank managers , it suggests that the 47 percent of german hunters , who qualify under this heading , plus those who work for themselves , are of gainful employment .
and they need to be .

to do so , one needs to attend a specialist training course that often requires the would-be hunter to rack up at least 120 hours of practical and theoretical training . as stipulated in federal hunting law , a candidate must pass the hunting examination , which is composed of a written and oral examination and a shooting test with both a shotgun and a rifle .
according to the law , the candidate must show adequate knowledge of a vast selection of topics including game biology and management , hunting management , farming and forestry , firearms law and technique , and gundog handling . exams and laws keep hunting tightly regulated hunters are also subject to strict police checks and will be refused a license if they have been found guilty of any crime involving firearms , ammunition and explosives .

in the united states , it 's an everyman sport ; all orange vests , elmer fudd hats and embarrassing events involving vice presidents . in both countries , hunting is a way of life , albeit one which is embraced by very different social circles on either side of the atlantic .
but what of germany ?
for those who have ever hunted for fun or necessity , germany 's rolling hills and wild expanses of forest conjure up images of a target-rich environment .
for others , hunting in germany may just be a series of headlines about problem bears and the return of wolves . " hunting in germany can not be compared to that which takes place in great britain or the united states , " said thorsten reinwald , spokesperson for the german hunter 's association -lrb- djv -rrb- .
" it is closer to the british concept of culling .
hunters in germany follow strict quotas for the shooting of particular animals like deer and have a responsibility to contribute to the regeneration of the environment . " hunting in britain and the united states is seen as a sport , whereas the djv promotes the activity as a necessary part of germany 's conservation policy , reinwald said . german hunters avoid publicity 's glare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tally-ho !
hunting in britain has a high media profile hunting in germany remains relatively low-key with discussions on the subject making only rare forays into the media .
it seems that , unless you are in the know , germany 's hunters barely feature in the wider public consciousness and are happy to sit with their hides away from the glare of publicity . germany boasts a hunting population of over 300,000 , of which 90 percent are members of the djv .
almost half of all the hunters in germany come from the sector the djv annual report describes as " employees / workers , " a vague title which does , however , exclude farmers - a group often associated with hunting more than any other . the djv says that 15 percent of german hunters work in farming while a further 27 percent are " self-employed . "
pensioners and the unemployed make up the final 11 percent . an expensive pastime while " employees / workers " could include anyone from bus drivers to bank managers , it suggests that the 47 percent of german hunters , who qualify under this heading , plus those who work for themselves , are of gainful employment .
and they need to be .
hunting in germany does not come cheap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of time , money and training goes into being a hunter a course to fulfill all the criteria and results in the participant being ready to apply for a license -lrb- jagdschein -rrb- can cost in excess of 700 euros -lrb- $ 905 -rrb- . in addition to the financial costs , hunting in germany requires a dedication of the mind as well as one of the pocket as gaining a hunting license is a complicated affair .
to do so , one needs to attend a specialist training course that often requires the would-be hunter to rack up at least 120 hours of practical and theoretical training . as stipulated in federal hunting law , a candidate must pass the hunting examination , which is composed of a written and oral examination and a shooting test with both a shotgun and a rifle .
according to the law , the candidate must show adequate knowledge of a vast selection of topics including game biology and management , hunting management , farming and forestry , firearms law and technique , and gundog handling . exams and laws keep hunting tightly regulated hunters are also subject to strict police checks and will be refused a license if they have been found guilty of any crime involving firearms , ammunition and explosives .
offenses against nature conservation or protection of animal rights or if the applicant is addicted to drugs can lead to license revocation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young , responsible and licensed to kill while the german hunting community champions itself as an inclusive one - open as it is to all law-abiding citizens over the age of 18 who have the time , money and inclination to earn a license - the expenditure , dedication and personal requirements needed to qualify does give the pastime an exclusive feel . for some , having a hunting license becomes a trophy in itself ; a status symbol which allows the bearer to enter another world where like-minded individuals gather to revel in their own achievements and pursue an activity safe in the knowledge that they are among those who have earned the right to hunt . the feeling of community has gone a long way to attracting the new generation of hunters , a breed where the bonding over warm guns and carcasses is as important as the hunting itself . " researchers at the university of bremen have discovered in a study that this is one of the main reasons behind people pursuing a hunting license , " the djv 's thorsten reinwald said .
" hunting brings an intense physical experience and balances the stresses of hectic everyday life . " escaping the pressures of the city to indulge in an activity that is , at its very roots , primal has proved to be something of a lure to an increasing number of young professionals , mostly from corporate management positions .
while hunting provides a safety valve from the stresses of work , it also provides a platform for networking . schmoozing and shooting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new generation gets to blow its own horn " when i started my internship at mckinsey , i often heard the consultants planning hunting trips , " said lars fischer , a visitor to the annual jagd und hund hunting convention held in dortmund .
" there would be excitement whenever someone managed to get a senior manager to come along .
it was never said out loud but everyone knew that having a hunting license was a way to get into certain influential circles .
it inspired me to go for mine . " annabelle gretschner , a museum curator 's assistant from münster at the convention with her partner , has a similar story . " many of the guys i studied with now have their license , " she said .
" very few of them had any interest in hunting at university but now the ones who have management level jobs often go shooting with clients and colleagues .
deals and connections are made out in the wild very much like they used to be on the golf course .

" it could happen in a month or two , or a year or two .
" you have to be open to a lot of things .

australia currently ranks 39th with fifa and the ffa is expects to take the team further in 2010 . the sun-herald said under any deal with australia , klinsmann would continue to live in the united states .
he was criticised in germany for not moving home in the lead-up to the world cup , preferring to commute from los angeles . if klinsmann is interested in the job then he is in competition with the socceroo 's assistant coach , australian graham arnold , who has made no secret of wanting the top job .
' if they 're talking to jürgen klinsmann , all i can do is try and make it as difficult as possible for them , ' arnold told australian news agency aap .

australia courts top coach for world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could klinsi be swapping long beach for bondi beach ?
rumours abound that german legend jürgen klinsmann has been approached to lead the australian team , after he was spotted holding discussions in los angeles . germany 's world cup coach jürgen klinsmann has been sounded out by australia to lead their 2010 world cup campaign , according to reports in sydney newspaper the sun herald on sunday . klinsmann , who led host nation germany to third place at last year 's world cup , met peter lowy , son of football federation australia chairman frank lowy , for lunch in los angeles last tuesday , the newspaper said . the newspaper quoted one observer who said of the meeting : " real estate was one subject they discussed but coaching opportunities with australia were tossed around .
the meeting was definitely business and not at all a social call . " rumors unconfirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " g 'day klinsi !
fancy a tinny ? "
ffa officials sunday declined to confirm that the meeting had taken place and klinsmann could not be immediately contacted for comment .
but the former german striker is known to favour coaching international football over taking on the day-to-day grind of club duties . " i 'm preparing myself for something new that might come along , " klinsmann said last week .
" it could happen in a month or two , or a year or two .
" you have to be open to a lot of things .
there is not an endlessly long list of job options at this level .
the air is pretty thin up there .
and if it 's the right fit with the family and the right challenge , you go to the country where you might have once never thought you 'd go . " peter lowy runs the us arm of his family 's westfield property group , and according to the sun-herald , he is known to unofficially conduct ffa business when he can .
klinsmann has lived in california with his american wife and children since he retired from playing in 1998 .
he was in discussions with the us soccer federation last year about coaching its national team but ended talks in december when it became clear he would n't have control of team matters . aiming to win in 2010 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup mascot goleo has already made friends down under the ffa wants a full-time replacement for dutchman guus hiddink to take charge of the team before the 2010 world cup qualifiers kick off next year .
australians were thrilled when hiddink coached the socceroos to world cup qualification for the first time in 32 years , and are likely to be searching for a european with a strong track record again .
australia currently ranks 39th with fifa and the ffa is expects to take the team further in 2010 . the sun-herald said under any deal with australia , klinsmann would continue to live in the united states .
he was criticised in germany for not moving home in the lead-up to the world cup , preferring to commute from los angeles . if klinsmann is interested in the job then he is in competition with the socceroo 's assistant coach , australian graham arnold , who has made no secret of wanting the top job .
' if they 're talking to jürgen klinsmann , all i can do is try and make it as difficult as possible for them , ' arnold told australian news agency aap .
' on jürgen klinsmann , he did n't live in germany when he coached germany , he still lived in the united states - and germany is his home country .

she spoke to dw-world.de about chancellor angela merkel 's initial trip to the mideast . dw-world.de : angela merkel is making her first trip to the arabic world as the german chancellor .
how do you think she will be received ? leslie tramontini : i can imagine that as the german chancellor she will be very positively received because the germans generally have a good image in the arabic world .
i do not think there will be any kind of astonishment when the first female chancellor arrives in the arabic world .
i have always experienced that as a woman i was always most welcome and taken seriously .
i could even imagine that it is an advantage for her . the revival of the mideast quartet is high on merkel 's agenda .
how can merkel push the peace process forward ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's four-day trip began saturday in egypt merkel can try egyptian help , saudi help and support for the revival of some type of peace talks .
we do not necessarily need to talk about this " road map , " but that they just sit down together at one table .
additionally , it is very difficult to bring peace or start peace talks when the parties are so divided .
in view of its historical past , germany must also , in my opinion , tell the israelis if there is going to be peace , you too have to make concessions . the saudi initiative from beirut in march 2002 was excellent .
it said we recognize israel when it pulls back to its 1967 border and when the refugee question is dealt with in a somewhat dignified way .
that would have been a foundation that they could sit down together about .
until that happens , we have to ask ourselves why it was not accepted . what merkel should do is try to collect as much arab support as possible . german initiatives usually are well accepted in the arabic world .
can the eu , under german leadership , take over the us leadership role ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all merkel 's efforts as eu president will need foreign help i think that can be answered with a clear no .
the eu and merkel and steinmeier can try to use germany 's influence to put pressure on .
but nothing , from neither the israeli nor the palestinian side , would ever be put through against the will or without the support of the united states .
the americans have to be a part , that 's a fact that is recognized , possibly grudgingly , by all sides . while militant and peaceful muslims use all their resources to fight their own governments and the west , is there really a chance for peace ? willingness to use violence does not generally go together with peace .
but the willingness to use force is not only coming from the islamic side but also from the israeli army , for example .
the destruction houses is also violence .
as long as both sides think the other only understands the language of violence , i do not see any large hope . aladdin sarhan interviewed leslie tramontini -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel arrives in saudi arabia pressing for middle east peace german chancellor angela merkel flew in to the saudi capital on sunday on the second leg of a middle east tour aimed at coordinating efforts to resume israeli-palestinian peace talks .
-lrb- 04.02.2007 -rrb- merkel reiterates need to bring israel , palestinians together german chancellor angela merkel on saturday warned of a great threat to the middle east if talks between israel and the palestinians are not pursued , after meeting with king abdullah of jordan .

germany 's supreme court determined monday that police may not secretly hack into suspects ' computers .
some are celebrating the decision as a civil rights victory , but the ruling may not be the last word on the matter . no legal framework for secret police hacking exists at this time , decided germany 's federal court of justice monday in karlsruhe , since searching computer and internet data on a suspect 's computer without their knowledge can not be compared to existing methods of police investigation . the court ruling stated that home searches differed from computer searches because they were always conducted in the presence of the suspect , or at least a witness .
telephone taps could also not be compared with computer hacking , continued the report , because previously saved data files fundamentally differ from live telecommunication . new legal framework may be created the public prosecutor 's office welcomed the decision from karlsruhe as it " established clarity on the scope of the existing investigation process concerning online evidence , which is so important to the investigation , " according to a statement cited by german news agency dpa . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble had been supportive of allowing police to conduct secret searches of computer hard drives and internet records . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble favors police hacking as an investigation method according to reports , it is likely that schäuble will now press for changes to the legal framework of the criminal investigation procedure that would allow for police hacking , which advocates see as particularly helpful in locating and prosecuting terrorists . support from the left jan korte from the left party immediately praised the court decision as a " godsend for civil rights . "
he also criticized schäuble , saying the interior minister should not " keep thinking up new methods of spying and then figure out the legal situation after the fact . " police hacking has been practiced in the past at the state level , often to scan the emails of individual suspects and criminal groups .

germany 's supreme court determined monday that police may not secretly hack into suspects ' computers .
some are celebrating the decision as a civil rights victory , but the ruling may not be the last word on the matter . no legal framework for secret police hacking exists at this time , decided germany 's federal court of justice monday in karlsruhe , since searching computer and internet data on a suspect 's computer without their knowledge can not be compared to existing methods of police investigation . the court ruling stated that home searches differed from computer searches because they were always conducted in the presence of the suspect , or at least a witness .
telephone taps could also not be compared with computer hacking , continued the report , because previously saved data files fundamentally differ from live telecommunication . new legal framework may be created the public prosecutor 's office welcomed the decision from karlsruhe as it " established clarity on the scope of the existing investigation process concerning online evidence , which is so important to the investigation , " according to a statement cited by german news agency dpa . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble had been supportive of allowing police to conduct secret searches of computer hard drives and internet records . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble favors police hacking as an investigation method according to reports , it is likely that schäuble will now press for changes to the legal framework of the criminal investigation procedure that would allow for police hacking , which advocates see as particularly helpful in locating and prosecuting terrorists . support from the left jan korte from the left party immediately praised the court decision as a " godsend for civil rights .

" we need better reconnaissance to counter terrorist attacks in a timely manner , " the minister told the welt am sonntag newspaper . jung also said he would not rule out sending german special forces wherever they are required saying germany " would naturally help , even in other regions " of afghanistan as it already has by providing nato with transportation and radio technology . decision expected this week bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops and jets could be in action in afghanistan by spring the german cabinet is set wednesday to debate and possibly decide on whether to permit the country 's tornado reconnaissance jets to fly patrols in southern afghanistan , as requested by nato and the afghan government . the planes could arrive in afghanistan by the end of march if the deployment is approved by both the german government and parliament . germany currently has nearly 2,900 soldiers engaged in reconstruction efforts in the relatively safe northern region of afghanistan , and nato , which leads the international military deployment to afghanistan , has repeatedly requested germany expand its afghan mission . the bundeswehr would have to send at least 500 additional soldiers to afghanistan to maintain the tornado jets if they are to fly missions in the country 's south .
nato has pressed for the jets as part of a planned spring offensive against taliban forces . the afghan foreign minister rangin spanta told deutschlandfunk radio the german jets would be a major contribution in the fight against terrorism in his country saying " europe is a direct neighbor of the terror network " in his country .
however , he also added that it was up to the german government whether to send the planes . a risky mission 3,800 meters high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tornados flying up to 3,800 meters would still face thrteats in reply to questions from the opposition 's free-market liberal free democratic party , the government said the german jets would be put at risk if sent on reconnaissance missions , the welt am sonntag reported . " flying into manpads sphere of operation could be required for tactical reasons , " the report said , referring to the shoulder-fired man portable air defense systems that were often used in afghanistan 's war against the soviets . opposition left party leader oskar lafontaine criticized chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats for its policy in afghanistan . " the administration is doing everything it can to get germany directly involved in the war in afghanistan , " he said sunday in berlin .
" this path puts german soldiers ' lives in danger and brings terrorism into the country . " greens party security affairs expert winfried nachtwei said his party would look at the government 's entire plan for afghanistan before making a decision on whether to put the tornados under nato control . " the military can not be allowed to be in the forefront , " he told bremen 's kurier am sonntag .
" civilian construction has to take precedence .

but with 800 years of history between its pages , there 's plenty of room for mystery . commissioned for new cathedral bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monk herimann is the artist behind henry 's gospels henry the lion , prince of what were then the kingdoms of saxony and bavaria , was one of the most powerful rulers of the middle ages and a member of the guelph royal line . fitting with the tradition of the time , he commissioned the book in 1188 in honor of the consecration of the st. mary 's altar in the recently completed cathedral in braunschweig . still wholly intact except for minor wear , the text includes all four of the bible 's holy gospels on 226 parchment pages .
fifty of these pages are colorful , elaborate pictures with gold leaf . the book 's high liturgical purpose was the reason for its ornate design and distinction : passages were read from it during each mass . spotty history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the so-called " evangeliar " in 1984 shortly after its return to germany only bits of the text 's fate after henry 's reign are known .

" we will do everything in our power to ensure the talks are successful , " merkel said , adding the eu would stay in close contact with saudi arabia , which is hosting the meeting . merkel said she was happy that king abdullah , whom she met earlier in riyadh , had signalled he was prepared " to attempt to bring the opposing parties in the palestinian conflict together .

elswhere , teams will now have to play behind closed doors . the block sale of tickets to away fans will also be stopped and police officers will be able to arrest people without a warrant in cases of soccer violence for up to 48 hours following a crime . italian interior minister guilano amato announced the decision on monday shortly after the funeral of a sicilian police officer killed after a soccer match on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers carrying raciti 's coffin on monday filippo raciti 's coffin , carried by policemen and draped in an italian flag , was greeted by a long applause as it entered catania 's main cathedral , which was packed with officials , relatives , soccer players and scores of ordinary people . raciti 's death had prompted sports officials to suspend all league soccer matches over the weekend . the 38-year-old policeman was killed outside the angelo massimino stadium friday during clashes between fans and police following a match between sicilian rivals catania and palermo . an autopsy revealed that he sustained lethal injuries to his abdomen , possibly resulting from being kicked or being hit by a stone , minutes before being targeted by an explosive device . italy " shocked and moved " prime minister romano prodi told raciti 's widow and two children that his death had " shocked and moved italy .

germany 's supreme court determined monday that police may not secretly hack into suspects ' computers .
some are celebrating the decision as a civil rights victory , but the ruling may not be the last word on the matter . no legal framework for secret police hacking exists at this time , decided germany 's federal court of justice monday in karlsruhe , since searching computer and internet data on a suspect 's computer without their knowledge can not be compared to existing methods of police investigation . the court ruling stated that home searches differed from computer searches because they were always conducted in the presence of the suspect , or at least a witness .
telephone taps could also not be compared with computer hacking , continued the report , because previously saved data files fundamentally differ from live telecommunication . new legal framework may be created the public prosecutor 's office welcomed the decision from karlsruhe as it " established clarity on the scope of the existing investigation process concerning online evidence , which is so important to the investigation , " according to a statement cited by german news agency dpa . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble had been supportive of allowing police to conduct secret searches of computer hard drives and internet records . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble favors police hacking as an investigation method according to reports , it is likely that schäuble will now press for changes to the legal framework of the criminal investigation procedure that would allow for police hacking , which advocates see as particularly helpful in locating and prosecuting terrorists . support from the left jan korte from the left party immediately praised the court decision as a " godsend for civil rights . "
he also criticized schäuble , saying the interior minister should not " keep thinking up new methods of spying and then figure out the legal situation after the fact . " police hacking has been practiced in the past at the state level , often to scan the emails of individual suspects and criminal groups .

germany 's supreme court determined monday that police may not secretly hack into suspects ' computers .
some are celebrating the decision as a civil rights victory , but the ruling may not be the last word on the matter . no legal framework for secret police hacking exists at this time , decided germany 's federal court of justice monday in karlsruhe , since searching computer and internet data on a suspect 's computer without their knowledge can not be compared to existing methods of police investigation . the court ruling stated that home searches differed from computer searches because they were always conducted in the presence of the suspect , or at least a witness .
telephone taps could also not be compared with computer hacking , continued the report , because previously saved data files fundamentally differ from live telecommunication . new legal framework may be created the public prosecutor 's office welcomed the decision from karlsruhe as it " established clarity on the scope of the existing investigation process concerning online evidence , which is so important to the investigation , " according to a statement cited by german news agency dpa . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble had been supportive of allowing police to conduct secret searches of computer hard drives and internet records . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble favors police hacking as an investigation method according to reports , it is likely that schäuble will now press for changes to the legal framework of the criminal investigation procedure that would allow for police hacking , which advocates see as particularly helpful in locating and prosecuting terrorists . support from the left jan korte from the left party immediately praised the court decision as a " godsend for civil rights . "
he also criticized schäuble , saying the interior minister should not " keep thinking up new methods of spying and then figure out the legal situation after the fact . " police hacking has been practiced in the past at the state level , often to scan the emails of individual suspects and criminal groups .
a court order was required in these cases and the computers could only be searched while they were running . a supreme court judge affirmed the legality of secret police hacking in february 2006 .

she spoke to dw-world.de about chancellor angela merkel 's initial trip to the mideast . dw-world.de : angela merkel is making her first trip to the arabic world as the german chancellor .
how do you think she will be received ? leslie tramontini : i can imagine that as the german chancellor she will be very positively received because the germans generally have a good image in the arabic world .
i do not think there will be any kind of astonishment when the first female chancellor arrives in the arabic world .
i have always experienced that as a woman i was always most welcome and taken seriously .
i could even imagine that it is an advantage for her . the revival of the mideast quartet is high on merkel 's agenda .
how can merkel push the peace process forward ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's four-day trip began saturday in egypt merkel can try egyptian help , saudi help and support for the revival of some type of peace talks .
we do not necessarily need to talk about this " road map , " but that they just sit down together at one table .
additionally , it is very difficult to bring peace or start peace talks when the parties are so divided .
in view of its historical past , germany must also , in my opinion , tell the israelis if there is going to be peace , you too have to make concessions . the saudi initiative from beirut in march 2002 was excellent .
it said we recognize israel when it pulls back to its 1967 border and when the refugee question is dealt with in a somewhat dignified way .
that would have been a foundation that they could sit down together about .
until that happens , we have to ask ourselves why it was not accepted . what merkel should do is try to collect as much arab support as possible . german initiatives usually are well accepted in the arabic world .
can the eu , under german leadership , take over the us leadership role ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all merkel 's efforts as eu president will need foreign help i think that can be answered with a clear no .
the eu and merkel and steinmeier can try to use germany 's influence to put pressure on .
but nothing , from neither the israeli nor the palestinian side , would ever be put through against the will or without the support of the united states .
the americans have to be a part , that 's a fact that is recognized , possibly grudgingly , by all sides . while militant and peaceful muslims use all their resources to fight their own governments and the west , is there really a chance for peace ? willingness to use violence does not generally go together with peace .
but the willingness to use force is not only coming from the islamic side but also from the israeli army , for example .
the destruction houses is also violence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de lifestyle -pipe- 05.02.2007 hunting in germany stealthily gains in popularity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old guard of germany 's hunting community are being joined by the young guns while hunting in germany has long been seen as part of the country 's conservation program , taking to the forest with arms now attracts germans for other reasons and the activity is growing in popularity . in the uk , it 's the preserve of gamekeepers and the landed gentry ; a countryside tradition of tweed-clad shooting parties and red-blazered hunt masters surrounded by baying beagles .
in the united states , it 's an everyman sport ; all orange vests , elmer fudd hats and embarrassing events involving vice presidents . in both countries , hunting is a way of life , albeit one which is embraced by very different social circles on either side of the atlantic .
but what of germany ?
for those who have ever hunted for fun or necessity , germany 's rolling hills and wild expanses of forest conjure up images of a target-rich environment .
for others , hunting in germany may just be a series of headlines about problem bears and the return of wolves . " hunting in germany can not be compared to that which takes place in great britain or the united states , " said thorsten reinwald , spokesperson for the german hunter 's association -lrb- djv -rrb- .
" it is closer to the british concept of culling .
hunters in germany follow strict quotas for the shooting of particular animals like deer and have a responsibility to contribute to the regeneration of the environment . " hunting in britain and the united states is seen as a sport , whereas the djv promotes the activity as a necessary part of germany 's conservation policy , reinwald said . german hunters avoid publicity 's glare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tally-ho !
hunting in britain has a high media profile hunting in germany remains relatively low-key with discussions on the subject making only rare forays into the media .
it seems that , unless you are in the know , germany 's hunters barely feature in the wider public consciousness and are happy to sit with their hides away from the glare of publicity . germany boasts a hunting population of over 300,000 , of which 90 percent are members of the djv .
almost half of all the hunters in germany come from the sector the djv annual report describes as " employees / workers , " a vague title which does , however , exclude farmers - a group often associated with hunting more than any other . the djv says that 15 percent of german hunters work in farming while a further 27 percent are " self-employed . "
pensioners and the unemployed make up the final 11 percent . an expensive pastime while " employees / workers " could include anyone from bus drivers to bank managers , it suggests that the 47 percent of german hunters , who qualify under this heading , plus those who work for themselves , are of gainful employment .
and they need to be .
hunting in germany does not come cheap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of time , money and training goes into being a hunter a course to fulfill all the criteria and results in the participant being ready to apply for a license -lrb- jagdschein -rrb- can cost in excess of 700 euros -lrb- $ 905 -rrb- . in addition to the financial costs , hunting in germany requires a dedication of the mind as well as one of the pocket as gaining a hunting license is a complicated affair .
to do so , one needs to attend a specialist training course that often requires the would-be hunter to rack up at least 120 hours of practical and theoretical training . as stipulated in federal hunting law , a candidate must pass the hunting examination , which is composed of a written and oral examination and a shooting test with both a shotgun and a rifle .
according to the law , the candidate must show adequate knowledge of a vast selection of topics including game biology and management , hunting management , farming and forestry , firearms law and technique , and gundog handling . exams and laws keep hunting tightly regulated hunters are also subject to strict police checks and will be refused a license if they have been found guilty of any crime involving firearms , ammunition and explosives .
offenses against nature conservation or protection of animal rights or if the applicant is addicted to drugs can lead to license revocation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young , responsible and licensed to kill while the german hunting community champions itself as an inclusive one - open as it is to all law-abiding citizens over the age of 18 who have the time , money and inclination to earn a license - the expenditure , dedication and personal requirements needed to qualify does give the pastime an exclusive feel . for some , having a hunting license becomes a trophy in itself ; a status symbol which allows the bearer to enter another world where like-minded individuals gather to revel in their own achievements and pursue an activity safe in the knowledge that they are among those who have earned the right to hunt . the feeling of community has gone a long way to attracting the new generation of hunters , a breed where the bonding over warm guns and carcasses is as important as the hunting itself . " researchers at the university of bremen have discovered in a study that this is one of the main reasons behind people pursuing a hunting license , " the djv 's thorsten reinwald said .
" hunting brings an intense physical experience and balances the stresses of hectic everyday life . " escaping the pressures of the city to indulge in an activity that is , at its very roots , primal has proved to be something of a lure to an increasing number of young professionals , mostly from corporate management positions .
while hunting provides a safety valve from the stresses of work , it also provides a platform for networking . schmoozing and shooting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new generation gets to blow its own horn " when i started my internship at mckinsey , i often heard the consultants planning hunting trips , " said lars fischer , a visitor to the annual jagd und hund hunting convention held in dortmund .
" there would be excitement whenever someone managed to get a senior manager to come along .
it was never said out loud but everyone knew that having a hunting license was a way to get into certain influential circles .
it inspired me to go for mine . " annabelle gretschner , a museum curator 's assistant from münster at the convention with her partner , has a similar story . " many of the guys i studied with now have their license , " she said .
" very few of them had any interest in hunting at university but now the ones who have management level jobs often go shooting with clients and colleagues .
deals and connections are made out in the wild very much like they used to be on the golf course . " so , while hunting in germany appears to serve the main purpose of keeping down the numbers of certain wild animals as part of an environmental agenda , some of those who hunt are reaping their own benefits while advancing the activity 's popularity among a new generation . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reevaluates gun laws after school shooting germany has some of the most strict firearms laws in the world .

almost half of all the hunters in germany come from the sector the djv annual report describes as " employees / workers , " a vague title which does , however , exclude farmers - a group often associated with hunting more than any other . the djv says that 15 percent of german hunters work in farming while a further 27 percent are " self-employed .

australia courts top coach for world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could klinsi be swapping long beach for bondi beach ?
rumours abound that german legend jürgen klinsmann has been approached to lead the australian team , after he was spotted holding discussions in los angeles . germany 's world cup coach jürgen klinsmann has been sounded out by australia to lead their 2010 world cup campaign , according to reports in sydney newspaper the sun herald on sunday . klinsmann , who led host nation germany to third place at last year 's world cup , met peter lowy , son of football federation australia chairman frank lowy , for lunch in los angeles last tuesday , the newspaper said . the newspaper quoted one observer who said of the meeting : " real estate was one subject they discussed but coaching opportunities with australia were tossed around .
the meeting was definitely business and not at all a social call . " rumors unconfirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " g 'day klinsi !
fancy a tinny ? "
ffa officials sunday declined to confirm that the meeting had taken place and klinsmann could not be immediately contacted for comment .
but the former german striker is known to favour coaching international football over taking on the day-to-day grind of club duties . " i 'm preparing myself for something new that might come along , " klinsmann said last week .
" it could happen in a month or two , or a year or two .
" you have to be open to a lot of things .
there is not an endlessly long list of job options at this level .
the air is pretty thin up there .
and if it 's the right fit with the family and the right challenge , you go to the country where you might have once never thought you 'd go . " peter lowy runs the us arm of his family 's westfield property group , and according to the sun-herald , he is known to unofficially conduct ffa business when he can .
klinsmann has lived in california with his american wife and children since he retired from playing in 1998 .
he was in discussions with the us soccer federation last year about coaching its national team but ended talks in december when it became clear he would n't have control of team matters . aiming to win in 2010 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup mascot goleo has already made friends down under the ffa wants a full-time replacement for dutchman guus hiddink to take charge of the team before the 2010 world cup qualifiers kick off next year .
australians were thrilled when hiddink coached the socceroos to world cup qualification for the first time in 32 years , and are likely to be searching for a european with a strong track record again .
australia currently ranks 39th with fifa and the ffa is expects to take the team further in 2010 . the sun-herald said under any deal with australia , klinsmann would continue to live in the united states .
he was criticised in germany for not moving home in the lead-up to the world cup , preferring to commute from los angeles . if klinsmann is interested in the job then he is in competition with the socceroo 's assistant coach , australian graham arnold , who has made no secret of wanting the top job .
' if they 're talking to jürgen klinsmann , all i can do is try and make it as difficult as possible for them , ' arnold told australian news agency aap .

in the united states , it 's an everyman sport ; all orange vests , elmer fudd hats and embarrassing events involving vice presidents . in both countries , hunting is a way of life , albeit one which is embraced by very different social circles on either side of the atlantic .
but what of germany ?
for those who have ever hunted for fun or necessity , germany 's rolling hills and wild expanses of forest conjure up images of a target-rich environment .
for others , hunting in germany may just be a series of headlines about problem bears and the return of wolves . " hunting in germany can not be compared to that which takes place in great britain or the united states , " said thorsten reinwald , spokesperson for the german hunter 's association -lrb- djv -rrb- .
" it is closer to the british concept of culling .
hunters in germany follow strict quotas for the shooting of particular animals like deer and have a responsibility to contribute to the regeneration of the environment . " hunting in britain and the united states is seen as a sport , whereas the djv promotes the activity as a necessary part of germany 's conservation policy , reinwald said . german hunters avoid publicity 's glare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tally-ho !
hunting in britain has a high media profile hunting in germany remains relatively low-key with discussions on the subject making only rare forays into the media .
it seems that , unless you are in the know , germany 's hunters barely feature in the wider public consciousness and are happy to sit with their hides away from the glare of publicity . germany boasts a hunting population of over 300,000 , of which 90 percent are members of the djv .
almost half of all the hunters in germany come from the sector the djv annual report describes as " employees / workers , " a vague title which does , however , exclude farmers - a group often associated with hunting more than any other . the djv says that 15 percent of german hunters work in farming while a further 27 percent are " self-employed . "
pensioners and the unemployed make up the final 11 percent . an expensive pastime while " employees / workers " could include anyone from bus drivers to bank managers , it suggests that the 47 percent of german hunters , who qualify under this heading , plus those who work for themselves , are of gainful employment .
and they need to be .
hunting in germany does not come cheap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of time , money and training goes into being a hunter a course to fulfill all the criteria and results in the participant being ready to apply for a license -lrb- jagdschein -rrb- can cost in excess of 700 euros -lrb- $ 905 -rrb- . in addition to the financial costs , hunting in germany requires a dedication of the mind as well as one of the pocket as gaining a hunting license is a complicated affair .
to do so , one needs to attend a specialist training course that often requires the would-be hunter to rack up at least 120 hours of practical and theoretical training . as stipulated in federal hunting law , a candidate must pass the hunting examination , which is composed of a written and oral examination and a shooting test with both a shotgun and a rifle .
according to the law , the candidate must show adequate knowledge of a vast selection of topics including game biology and management , hunting management , farming and forestry , firearms law and technique , and gundog handling . exams and laws keep hunting tightly regulated hunters are also subject to strict police checks and will be refused a license if they have been found guilty of any crime involving firearms , ammunition and explosives .
offenses against nature conservation or protection of animal rights or if the applicant is addicted to drugs can lead to license revocation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young , responsible and licensed to kill while the german hunting community champions itself as an inclusive one - open as it is to all law-abiding citizens over the age of 18 who have the time , money and inclination to earn a license - the expenditure , dedication and personal requirements needed to qualify does give the pastime an exclusive feel . for some , having a hunting license becomes a trophy in itself ; a status symbol which allows the bearer to enter another world where like-minded individuals gather to revel in their own achievements and pursue an activity safe in the knowledge that they are among those who have earned the right to hunt . the feeling of community has gone a long way to attracting the new generation of hunters , a breed where the bonding over warm guns and carcasses is as important as the hunting itself . " researchers at the university of bremen have discovered in a study that this is one of the main reasons behind people pursuing a hunting license , " the djv 's thorsten reinwald said .
" hunting brings an intense physical experience and balances the stresses of hectic everyday life . " escaping the pressures of the city to indulge in an activity that is , at its very roots , primal has proved to be something of a lure to an increasing number of young professionals , mostly from corporate management positions .
while hunting provides a safety valve from the stresses of work , it also provides a platform for networking . schmoozing and shooting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new generation gets to blow its own horn " when i started my internship at mckinsey , i often heard the consultants planning hunting trips , " said lars fischer , a visitor to the annual jagd und hund hunting convention held in dortmund .
" there would be excitement whenever someone managed to get a senior manager to come along .
it was never said out loud but everyone knew that having a hunting license was a way to get into certain influential circles .
it inspired me to go for mine . " annabelle gretschner , a museum curator 's assistant from münster at the convention with her partner , has a similar story . " many of the guys i studied with now have their license , " she said .
" very few of them had any interest in hunting at university but now the ones who have management level jobs often go shooting with clients and colleagues .
deals and connections are made out in the wild very much like they used to be on the golf course .

rumours abound that german legend jürgen klinsmann has been approached to lead the australian team , after he was spotted holding discussions in los angeles . germany 's world cup coach jürgen klinsmann has been sounded out by australia to lead their 2010 world cup campaign , according to reports in sydney newspaper the sun herald on sunday . klinsmann , who led host nation germany to third place at last year 's world cup , met peter lowy , son of football federation australia chairman frank lowy , for lunch in los angeles last tuesday , the newspaper said . the newspaper quoted one observer who said of the meeting : " real estate was one subject they discussed but coaching opportunities with australia were tossed around .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de lifestyle -pipe- 05.02.2007 hunting in germany stealthily gains in popularity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old guard of germany 's hunting community are being joined by the young guns while hunting in germany has long been seen as part of the country 's conservation program , taking to the forest with arms now attracts germans for other reasons and the activity is growing in popularity . in the uk , it 's the preserve of gamekeepers and the landed gentry ; a countryside tradition of tweed-clad shooting parties and red-blazered hunt masters surrounded by baying beagles .
in the united states , it 's an everyman sport ; all orange vests , elmer fudd hats and embarrassing events involving vice presidents . in both countries , hunting is a way of life , albeit one which is embraced by very different social circles on either side of the atlantic .
but what of germany ?
for those who have ever hunted for fun or necessity , germany 's rolling hills and wild expanses of forest conjure up images of a target-rich environment .
for others , hunting in germany may just be a series of headlines about problem bears and the return of wolves . " hunting in germany can not be compared to that which takes place in great britain or the united states , " said thorsten reinwald , spokesperson for the german hunter 's association -lrb- djv -rrb- .
" it is closer to the british concept of culling .
hunters in germany follow strict quotas for the shooting of particular animals like deer and have a responsibility to contribute to the regeneration of the environment . " hunting in britain and the united states is seen as a sport , whereas the djv promotes the activity as a necessary part of germany 's conservation policy , reinwald said . german hunters avoid publicity 's glare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tally-ho !
hunting in britain has a high media profile hunting in germany remains relatively low-key with discussions on the subject making only rare forays into the media .
it seems that , unless you are in the know , germany 's hunters barely feature in the wider public consciousness and are happy to sit with their hides away from the glare of publicity . germany boasts a hunting population of over 300,000 , of which 90 percent are members of the djv .
almost half of all the hunters in germany come from the sector the djv annual report describes as " employees / workers , " a vague title which does , however , exclude farmers - a group often associated with hunting more than any other . the djv says that 15 percent of german hunters work in farming while a further 27 percent are " self-employed . "
pensioners and the unemployed make up the final 11 percent . an expensive pastime while " employees / workers " could include anyone from bus drivers to bank managers , it suggests that the 47 percent of german hunters , who qualify under this heading , plus those who work for themselves , are of gainful employment .
and they need to be .
hunting in germany does not come cheap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of time , money and training goes into being a hunter a course to fulfill all the criteria and results in the participant being ready to apply for a license -lrb- jagdschein -rrb- can cost in excess of 700 euros -lrb- $ 905 -rrb- . in addition to the financial costs , hunting in germany requires a dedication of the mind as well as one of the pocket as gaining a hunting license is a complicated affair .
to do so , one needs to attend a specialist training course that often requires the would-be hunter to rack up at least 120 hours of practical and theoretical training . as stipulated in federal hunting law , a candidate must pass the hunting examination , which is composed of a written and oral examination and a shooting test with both a shotgun and a rifle .
according to the law , the candidate must show adequate knowledge of a vast selection of topics including game biology and management , hunting management , farming and forestry , firearms law and technique , and gundog handling . exams and laws keep hunting tightly regulated hunters are also subject to strict police checks and will be refused a license if they have been found guilty of any crime involving firearms , ammunition and explosives .
offenses against nature conservation or protection of animal rights or if the applicant is addicted to drugs can lead to license revocation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young , responsible and licensed to kill while the german hunting community champions itself as an inclusive one - open as it is to all law-abiding citizens over the age of 18 who have the time , money and inclination to earn a license - the expenditure , dedication and personal requirements needed to qualify does give the pastime an exclusive feel . for some , having a hunting license becomes a trophy in itself ; a status symbol which allows the bearer to enter another world where like-minded individuals gather to revel in their own achievements and pursue an activity safe in the knowledge that they are among those who have earned the right to hunt . the feeling of community has gone a long way to attracting the new generation of hunters , a breed where the bonding over warm guns and carcasses is as important as the hunting itself . " researchers at the university of bremen have discovered in a study that this is one of the main reasons behind people pursuing a hunting license , " the djv 's thorsten reinwald said .
" hunting brings an intense physical experience and balances the stresses of hectic everyday life . " escaping the pressures of the city to indulge in an activity that is , at its very roots , primal has proved to be something of a lure to an increasing number of young professionals , mostly from corporate management positions .
while hunting provides a safety valve from the stresses of work , it also provides a platform for networking . schmoozing and shooting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new generation gets to blow its own horn " when i started my internship at mckinsey , i often heard the consultants planning hunting trips , " said lars fischer , a visitor to the annual jagd und hund hunting convention held in dortmund .
" there would be excitement whenever someone managed to get a senior manager to come along .
it was never said out loud but everyone knew that having a hunting license was a way to get into certain influential circles .
it inspired me to go for mine . " annabelle gretschner , a museum curator 's assistant from münster at the convention with her partner , has a similar story . " many of the guys i studied with now have their license , " she said .
" very few of them had any interest in hunting at university but now the ones who have management level jobs often go shooting with clients and colleagues .
deals and connections are made out in the wild very much like they used to be on the golf course . " so , while hunting in germany appears to serve the main purpose of keeping down the numbers of certain wild animals as part of an environmental agenda , some of those who hunt are reaping their own benefits while advancing the activity 's popularity among a new generation . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reevaluates gun laws after school shooting germany has some of the most strict firearms laws in the world .

" we need better reconnaissance to counter terrorist attacks in a timely manner , " the minister told the welt am sonntag newspaper . jung also said he would not rule out sending german special forces wherever they are required saying germany " would naturally help , even in other regions " of afghanistan as it already has by providing nato with transportation and radio technology . decision expected this week bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops and jets could be in action in afghanistan by spring the german cabinet is set wednesday to debate and possibly decide on whether to permit the country 's tornado reconnaissance jets to fly patrols in southern afghanistan , as requested by nato and the afghan government . the planes could arrive in afghanistan by the end of march if the deployment is approved by both the german government and parliament . germany currently has nearly 2,900 soldiers engaged in reconstruction efforts in the relatively safe northern region of afghanistan , and nato , which leads the international military deployment to afghanistan , has repeatedly requested germany expand its afghan mission . the bundeswehr would have to send at least 500 additional soldiers to afghanistan to maintain the tornado jets if they are to fly missions in the country 's south .
nato has pressed for the jets as part of a planned spring offensive against taliban forces . the afghan foreign minister rangin spanta told deutschlandfunk radio the german jets would be a major contribution in the fight against terrorism in his country saying " europe is a direct neighbor of the terror network " in his country .
however , he also added that it was up to the german government whether to send the planes . a risky mission 3,800 meters high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tornados flying up to 3,800 meters would still face thrteats in reply to questions from the opposition 's free-market liberal free democratic party , the government said the german jets would be put at risk if sent on reconnaissance missions , the welt am sonntag reported . " flying into manpads sphere of operation could be required for tactical reasons , " the report said , referring to the shoulder-fired man portable air defense systems that were often used in afghanistan 's war against the soviets . opposition left party leader oskar lafontaine criticized chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats for its policy in afghanistan . " the administration is doing everything it can to get germany directly involved in the war in afghanistan , " he said sunday in berlin .
" this path puts german soldiers ' lives in danger and brings terrorism into the country . " greens party security affairs expert winfried nachtwei said his party would look at the government 's entire plan for afghanistan before making a decision on whether to put the tornados under nato control . " the military can not be allowed to be in the forefront , " he told bremen 's kurier am sonntag .

the strain found is similar to the hungarian outbreak of asian h5n1 , detected among geese . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 strain was found in hungarian geese in january bernard matthews foods denied the chance of the virus being spread from its hungarian farms to its operations in eastern england . " the fact that we have a hungarian operation is immaterial , " the spokesman told britain 's the guardian newspaper . fourteen eu members were affected by the virus at the peak of the european bird flu crisis in 2005 and 2006 and the discovery of the deadly flu strain in britain has sparked precautionary measures in other european countries as national governments remain concerned about the virus that was last detected in germany in august 2006 . eu tightening fowl controls the british government put in created a three-kilometer -lrb- 1.8-mile -rrb- protection zone and 10-kilometer surveillance area around the bernard matthews farm , europe 's largest turkey farm , to quarantine the outbreak . british chief scientist sir david king played down the chances of the virus spreading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk officials are confident the outbreak has been contained " i 'm really confident this is not going to spread to other poultry holder , " he said . the dutch agriculture ministry announced it was putting extra protective measures in place , norway issued restrictions on the keeping of poultry while france evaluated the risk to its flocks and ireland to put laboratories on alert . poultry farmers in ireland were also told to be extra vigilant in keeping their stocks out of contact with wild birds . " poultry keepers should watch their birds very closely , " northern ireland 's chief veterinary officer bert houston said . europe 's false sense of security world health organization spokesman gregory hartl said countries should be aware that the h5n1 virus could mutate to become transmissible between humans just as easily in europe as in asian or african countries .
" a mutation could occur anywhere , " hartl said .
" someone was saying in relation to the british outbreak , ' oh , it wo n't happen in europe . '
that 's really a kind of false security that is being built up . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health officials fear the virus could spread to humans the virus , which has killed 142 people in southeast asia and 165 worldwide since resurfacing in 2003 , does not appear to be mutating into a form easily transmissible between humans , according to david nabarro , the un official heading the global fight against avian influenza . more cases likely nabarro , however , added that he expected more cases of the virus to turn up .

the strain found is similar to the hungarian outbreak of asian h5n1 , detected among geese . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 strain was found in hungarian geese in january bernard matthews foods denied the chance of the virus being spread from its hungarian farms to its operations in eastern england . " the fact that we have a hungarian operation is immaterial , " the spokesman told britain 's the guardian newspaper . fourteen eu members were affected by the virus at the peak of the european bird flu crisis in 2005 and 2006 and the discovery of the deadly flu strain in britain has sparked precautionary measures in other european countries as national governments remain concerned about the virus that was last detected in germany in august 2006 . eu tightening fowl controls the british government put in created a three-kilometer -lrb- 1.8-mile -rrb- protection zone and 10-kilometer surveillance area around the bernard matthews farm , europe 's largest turkey farm , to quarantine the outbreak . british chief scientist sir david king played down the chances of the virus spreading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk officials are confident the outbreak has been contained " i 'm really confident this is not going to spread to other poultry holder , " he said . the dutch agriculture ministry announced it was putting extra protective measures in place , norway issued restrictions on the keeping of poultry while france evaluated the risk to its flocks and ireland to put laboratories on alert . poultry farmers in ireland were also told to be extra vigilant in keeping their stocks out of contact with wild birds . " poultry keepers should watch their birds very closely , " northern ireland 's chief veterinary officer bert houston said . europe 's false sense of security world health organization spokesman gregory hartl said countries should be aware that the h5n1 virus could mutate to become transmissible between humans just as easily in europe as in asian or african countries .
" a mutation could occur anywhere , " hartl said .
" someone was saying in relation to the british outbreak , ' oh , it wo n't happen in europe . '
that 's really a kind of false security that is being built up . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health officials fear the virus could spread to humans the virus , which has killed 142 people in southeast asia and 165 worldwide since resurfacing in 2003 , does not appear to be mutating into a form easily transmissible between humans , according to david nabarro , the un official heading the global fight against avian influenza . more cases likely nabarro , however , added that he expected more cases of the virus to turn up . " i am expecting to see outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in a number of locations over the next three or four months , and i am basing it on what happened last year , " he told the afp news agency . " during the time that i 've been in this job , i have seen no increase in the risk of a pandemic , " nabarro said . farm workers , many of whom are migrants from portugal , and those involved in the cull have been given anti-viral drugs , and none of the affected bird entered the food chain , bernard matthews said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu confirms virulent bird flu strain on british farm the european commission confirmed on saturday that the bird flu virus detected at one of europe 's largest turkey manufactures was the virulent h5n1 strain .

" the fact that we have a hungarian operation is immaterial , " the spokesman told britain 's the guardian newspaper . fourteen eu members were affected by the virus at the peak of the european bird flu crisis in 2005 and 2006 and the discovery of the deadly flu strain in britain has sparked precautionary measures in other european countries as national governments remain concerned about the virus that was last detected in germany in august 2006 . eu tightening fowl controls the british government put in created a three-kilometer -lrb- 1.8-mile -rrb- protection zone and 10-kilometer surveillance area around the bernard matthews farm , europe 's largest turkey farm , to quarantine the outbreak . british chief scientist sir david king played down the chances of the virus spreading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk officials are confident the outbreak has been contained " i 'm really confident this is not going to spread to other poultry holder , " he said . the dutch agriculture ministry announced it was putting extra protective measures in place , norway issued restrictions on the keeping of poultry while france evaluated the risk to its flocks and ireland to put laboratories on alert . poultry farmers in ireland were also told to be extra vigilant in keeping their stocks out of contact with wild birds . " poultry keepers should watch their birds very closely , " northern ireland 's chief veterinary officer bert houston said . europe 's false sense of security world health organization spokesman gregory hartl said countries should be aware that the h5n1 virus could mutate to become transmissible between humans just as easily in europe as in asian or african countries .
" a mutation could occur anywhere , " hartl said .
" someone was saying in relation to the british outbreak , ' oh , it wo n't happen in europe . '
that 's really a kind of false security that is being built up . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health officials fear the virus could spread to humans the virus , which has killed 142 people in southeast asia and 165 worldwide since resurfacing in 2003 , does not appear to be mutating into a form easily transmissible between humans , according to david nabarro , the un official heading the global fight against avian influenza . more cases likely nabarro , however , added that he expected more cases of the virus to turn up . " i am expecting to see outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in a number of locations over the next three or four months , and i am basing it on what happened last year , " he told the afp news agency . " during the time that i 've been in this job , i have seen no increase in the risk of a pandemic , " nabarro said . farm workers , many of whom are migrants from portugal , and those involved in the cull have been given anti-viral drugs , and none of the affected bird entered the food chain , bernard matthews said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu confirms virulent bird flu strain on british farm the european commission confirmed on saturday that the bird flu virus detected at one of europe 's largest turkey manufactures was the virulent h5n1 strain .

in the united states , it 's an everyman sport ; all orange vests , elmer fudd hats and embarrassing events involving vice presidents . in both countries , hunting is a way of life , albeit one which is embraced by very different social circles on either side of the atlantic .
but what of germany ?
for those who have ever hunted for fun or necessity , germany 's rolling hills and wild expanses of forest conjure up images of a target-rich environment .
for others , hunting in germany may just be a series of headlines about problem bears and the return of wolves . " hunting in germany can not be compared to that which takes place in great britain or the united states , " said thorsten reinwald , spokesperson for the german hunter 's association -lrb- djv -rrb- .
" it is closer to the british concept of culling .
hunters in germany follow strict quotas for the shooting of particular animals like deer and have a responsibility to contribute to the regeneration of the environment . " hunting in britain and the united states is seen as a sport , whereas the djv promotes the activity as a necessary part of germany 's conservation policy , reinwald said . german hunters avoid publicity 's glare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tally-ho !
hunting in britain has a high media profile hunting in germany remains relatively low-key with discussions on the subject making only rare forays into the media .
it seems that , unless you are in the know , germany 's hunters barely feature in the wider public consciousness and are happy to sit with their hides away from the glare of publicity . germany boasts a hunting population of over 300,000 , of which 90 percent are members of the djv .
almost half of all the hunters in germany come from the sector the djv annual report describes as " employees / workers , " a vague title which does , however , exclude farmers - a group often associated with hunting more than any other . the djv says that 15 percent of german hunters work in farming while a further 27 percent are " self-employed . "
pensioners and the unemployed make up the final 11 percent . an expensive pastime while " employees / workers " could include anyone from bus drivers to bank managers , it suggests that the 47 percent of german hunters , who qualify under this heading , plus those who work for themselves , are of gainful employment .
and they need to be .
hunting in germany does not come cheap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of time , money and training goes into being a hunter a course to fulfill all the criteria and results in the participant being ready to apply for a license -lrb- jagdschein -rrb- can cost in excess of 700 euros -lrb- $ 905 -rrb- . in addition to the financial costs , hunting in germany requires a dedication of the mind as well as one of the pocket as gaining a hunting license is a complicated affair .
to do so , one needs to attend a specialist training course that often requires the would-be hunter to rack up at least 120 hours of practical and theoretical training . as stipulated in federal hunting law , a candidate must pass the hunting examination , which is composed of a written and oral examination and a shooting test with both a shotgun and a rifle .
according to the law , the candidate must show adequate knowledge of a vast selection of topics including game biology and management , hunting management , farming and forestry , firearms law and technique , and gundog handling . exams and laws keep hunting tightly regulated hunters are also subject to strict police checks and will be refused a license if they have been found guilty of any crime involving firearms , ammunition and explosives .
offenses against nature conservation or protection of animal rights or if the applicant is addicted to drugs can lead to license revocation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young , responsible and licensed to kill while the german hunting community champions itself as an inclusive one - open as it is to all law-abiding citizens over the age of 18 who have the time , money and inclination to earn a license - the expenditure , dedication and personal requirements needed to qualify does give the pastime an exclusive feel . for some , having a hunting license becomes a trophy in itself ; a status symbol which allows the bearer to enter another world where like-minded individuals gather to revel in their own achievements and pursue an activity safe in the knowledge that they are among those who have earned the right to hunt . the feeling of community has gone a long way to attracting the new generation of hunters , a breed where the bonding over warm guns and carcasses is as important as the hunting itself . " researchers at the university of bremen have discovered in a study that this is one of the main reasons behind people pursuing a hunting license , " the djv 's thorsten reinwald said .
" hunting brings an intense physical experience and balances the stresses of hectic everyday life . " escaping the pressures of the city to indulge in an activity that is , at its very roots , primal has proved to be something of a lure to an increasing number of young professionals , mostly from corporate management positions .
while hunting provides a safety valve from the stresses of work , it also provides a platform for networking . schmoozing and shooting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new generation gets to blow its own horn " when i started my internship at mckinsey , i often heard the consultants planning hunting trips , " said lars fischer , a visitor to the annual jagd und hund hunting convention held in dortmund .
" there would be excitement whenever someone managed to get a senior manager to come along .
it was never said out loud but everyone knew that having a hunting license was a way to get into certain influential circles .
it inspired me to go for mine . " annabelle gretschner , a museum curator 's assistant from münster at the convention with her partner , has a similar story . " many of the guys i studied with now have their license , " she said .
" very few of them had any interest in hunting at university but now the ones who have management level jobs often go shooting with clients and colleagues .
deals and connections are made out in the wild very much like they used to be on the golf course . " so , while hunting in germany appears to serve the main purpose of keeping down the numbers of certain wild animals as part of an environmental agenda , some of those who hunt are reaping their own benefits while advancing the activity 's popularity among a new generation . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reevaluates gun laws after school shooting germany has some of the most strict firearms laws in the world .

almost half of all the hunters in germany come from the sector the djv annual report describes as " employees / workers , " a vague title which does , however , exclude farmers - a group often associated with hunting more than any other . the djv says that 15 percent of german hunters work in farming while a further 27 percent are " self-employed . "
pensioners and the unemployed make up the final 11 percent . an expensive pastime while " employees / workers " could include anyone from bus drivers to bank managers , it suggests that the 47 percent of german hunters , who qualify under this heading , plus those who work for themselves , are of gainful employment .
and they need to be .

to do so , one needs to attend a specialist training course that often requires the would-be hunter to rack up at least 120 hours of practical and theoretical training . as stipulated in federal hunting law , a candidate must pass the hunting examination , which is composed of a written and oral examination and a shooting test with both a shotgun and a rifle .
according to the law , the candidate must show adequate knowledge of a vast selection of topics including game biology and management , hunting management , farming and forestry , firearms law and technique , and gundog handling . exams and laws keep hunting tightly regulated hunters are also subject to strict police checks and will be refused a license if they have been found guilty of any crime involving firearms , ammunition and explosives .

in the united states , it 's an everyman sport ; all orange vests , elmer fudd hats and embarrassing events involving vice presidents . in both countries , hunting is a way of life , albeit one which is embraced by very different social circles on either side of the atlantic .
but what of germany ?
for those who have ever hunted for fun or necessity , germany 's rolling hills and wild expanses of forest conjure up images of a target-rich environment .
for others , hunting in germany may just be a series of headlines about problem bears and the return of wolves . " hunting in germany can not be compared to that which takes place in great britain or the united states , " said thorsten reinwald , spokesperson for the german hunter 's association -lrb- djv -rrb- .
" it is closer to the british concept of culling .
hunters in germany follow strict quotas for the shooting of particular animals like deer and have a responsibility to contribute to the regeneration of the environment . " hunting in britain and the united states is seen as a sport , whereas the djv promotes the activity as a necessary part of germany 's conservation policy , reinwald said . german hunters avoid publicity 's glare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tally-ho !

they are suspected of membership of the ' revolutionary cells ' , a group held responsible for at least 295 attacks between 1973 and 1995 .
they have been bailed and are yet to be charged . federal prosecutors confirmed sunday that two suspected members of a german left-wing militant group which took part in some of the most notorious hostage dramas of the 1970s have surrendered to authorities after 19 years on the run . federal state prosecutors in karlsruhe made the statement after a report in der spiegel magazine that the pair , who surrendered to police in december , are suspected members of the group " revolutionary cells . " the revolutionary cells emerged in the 1970s from the extreme movements which also spawned the better-known red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , also known as the baader-meinhof gang .

australia courts top coach for world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could klinsi be swapping long beach for bondi beach ?
rumours abound that german legend jürgen klinsmann has been approached to lead the australian team , after he was spotted holding discussions in los angeles . germany 's world cup coach jürgen klinsmann has been sounded out by australia to lead their 2010 world cup campaign , according to reports in sydney newspaper the sun herald on sunday . klinsmann , who led host nation germany to third place at last year 's world cup , met peter lowy , son of football federation australia chairman frank lowy , for lunch in los angeles last tuesday , the newspaper said . the newspaper quoted one observer who said of the meeting : " real estate was one subject they discussed but coaching opportunities with australia were tossed around .
the meeting was definitely business and not at all a social call . " rumors unconfirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " g 'day klinsi !
fancy a tinny ? "
ffa officials sunday declined to confirm that the meeting had taken place and klinsmann could not be immediately contacted for comment .
but the former german striker is known to favour coaching international football over taking on the day-to-day grind of club duties . " i 'm preparing myself for something new that might come along , " klinsmann said last week .
" it could happen in a month or two , or a year or two .
" you have to be open to a lot of things .
there is not an endlessly long list of job options at this level .
the air is pretty thin up there .
and if it 's the right fit with the family and the right challenge , you go to the country where you might have once never thought you 'd go . " peter lowy runs the us arm of his family 's westfield property group , and according to the sun-herald , he is known to unofficially conduct ffa business when he can .
klinsmann has lived in california with his american wife and children since he retired from playing in 1998 .
he was in discussions with the us soccer federation last year about coaching its national team but ended talks in december when it became clear he would n't have control of team matters . aiming to win in 2010 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup mascot goleo has already made friends down under the ffa wants a full-time replacement for dutchman guus hiddink to take charge of the team before the 2010 world cup qualifiers kick off next year .
australians were thrilled when hiddink coached the socceroos to world cup qualification for the first time in 32 years , and are likely to be searching for a european with a strong track record again .
australia currently ranks 39th with fifa and the ffa is expects to take the team further in 2010 . the sun-herald said under any deal with australia , klinsmann would continue to live in the united states .
he was criticised in germany for not moving home in the lead-up to the world cup , preferring to commute from los angeles . if klinsmann is interested in the job then he is in competition with the socceroo 's assistant coach , australian graham arnold , who has made no secret of wanting the top job .
' if they 're talking to jürgen klinsmann , all i can do is try and make it as difficult as possible for them , ' arnold told australian news agency aap .
' on jürgen klinsmann , he did n't live in germany when he coached germany , he still lived in the united states - and germany is his home country .

but with 800 years of history between its pages , there 's plenty of room for mystery . commissioned for new cathedral bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monk herimann is the artist behind henry 's gospels henry the lion , prince of what were then the kingdoms of saxony and bavaria , was one of the most powerful rulers of the middle ages and a member of the guelph royal line . fitting with the tradition of the time , he commissioned the book in 1188 in honor of the consecration of the st. mary 's altar in the recently completed cathedral in braunschweig . still wholly intact except for minor wear , the text includes all four of the bible 's holy gospels on 226 parchment pages .
fifty of these pages are colorful , elaborate pictures with gold leaf . the book 's high liturgical purpose was the reason for its ornate design and distinction : passages were read from it during each mass . spotty history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the so-called " evangeliar " in 1984 shortly after its return to germany only bits of the text 's fate after henry 's reign are known .
at some point it landed in prague and in 1861 it was bought by the king of hanover , who wanted to place it in a museum .
when he was dethroned in 1866 , he took the precious text with him to austria . helmar härtel from the herzog august library , where the gospels are now kept , told german television station zdf that they were offered to the king of england in 1945 after world war ii had come to an end .
he refused . the parchments managed to make it to england nevertheless , though the how and why are unclear , and they were auctioned at sotheby 's in 1983 .
since that time , the gospels have been housed in the herzog august library in wolfenbüttel just outside of braunschweig in lower saxony . after march 18 , the 800-year-old pages will be returned to their specially designed climate-controlled safe , taking their history - and mystery - with them . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sneak peek : new german books hit the english market looking for a good book ?

" we need better reconnaissance to counter terrorist attacks in a timely manner , " the minister told the welt am sonntag newspaper . jung also said he would not rule out sending german special forces wherever they are required saying germany " would naturally help , even in other regions " of afghanistan as it already has by providing nato with transportation and radio technology . decision expected this week bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops and jets could be in action in afghanistan by spring the german cabinet is set wednesday to debate and possibly decide on whether to permit the country 's tornado reconnaissance jets to fly patrols in southern afghanistan , as requested by nato and the afghan government . the planes could arrive in afghanistan by the end of march if the deployment is approved by both the german government and parliament . germany currently has nearly 2,900 soldiers engaged in reconstruction efforts in the relatively safe northern region of afghanistan , and nato , which leads the international military deployment to afghanistan , has repeatedly requested germany expand its afghan mission . the bundeswehr would have to send at least 500 additional soldiers to afghanistan to maintain the tornado jets if they are to fly missions in the country 's south .
nato has pressed for the jets as part of a planned spring offensive against taliban forces . the afghan foreign minister rangin spanta told deutschlandfunk radio the german jets would be a major contribution in the fight against terrorism in his country saying " europe is a direct neighbor of the terror network " in his country .
however , he also added that it was up to the german government whether to send the planes . a risky mission 3,800 meters high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tornados flying up to 3,800 meters would still face thrteats in reply to questions from the opposition 's free-market liberal free democratic party , the government said the german jets would be put at risk if sent on reconnaissance missions , the welt am sonntag reported . " flying into manpads sphere of operation could be required for tactical reasons , " the report said , referring to the shoulder-fired man portable air defense systems that were often used in afghanistan 's war against the soviets . opposition left party leader oskar lafontaine criticized chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of christian and social democrats for its policy in afghanistan . " the administration is doing everything it can to get germany directly involved in the war in afghanistan , " he said sunday in berlin .
" this path puts german soldiers ' lives in danger and brings terrorism into the country . " greens party security affairs expert winfried nachtwei said his party would look at the government 's entire plan for afghanistan before making a decision on whether to put the tornados under nato control . " the military can not be allowed to be in the forefront , " he told bremen 's kurier am sonntag .

germany 's supreme court determined monday that police may not secretly hack into suspects ' computers .
some are celebrating the decision as a civil rights victory , but the ruling may not be the last word on the matter . no legal framework for secret police hacking exists at this time , decided germany 's federal court of justice monday in karlsruhe , since searching computer and internet data on a suspect 's computer without their knowledge can not be compared to existing methods of police investigation . the court ruling stated that home searches differed from computer searches because they were always conducted in the presence of the suspect , or at least a witness .
telephone taps could also not be compared with computer hacking , continued the report , because previously saved data files fundamentally differ from live telecommunication . new legal framework may be created the public prosecutor 's office welcomed the decision from karlsruhe as it " established clarity on the scope of the existing investigation process concerning online evidence , which is so important to the investigation , " according to a statement cited by german news agency dpa . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble had been supportive of allowing police to conduct secret searches of computer hard drives and internet records . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble favors police hacking as an investigation method according to reports , it is likely that schäuble will now press for changes to the legal framework of the criminal investigation procedure that would allow for police hacking , which advocates see as particularly helpful in locating and prosecuting terrorists . support from the left jan korte from the left party immediately praised the court decision as a " godsend for civil rights . "
he also criticized schäuble , saying the interior minister should not " keep thinking up new methods of spying and then figure out the legal situation after the fact . " police hacking has been practiced in the past at the state level , often to scan the emails of individual suspects and criminal groups .
a court order was required in these cases and the computers could only be searched while they were running . a supreme court judge affirmed the legality of secret police hacking in february 2006 .

germany 's supreme court determined monday that police may not secretly hack into suspects ' computers .
some are celebrating the decision as a civil rights victory , but the ruling may not be the last word on the matter . no legal framework for secret police hacking exists at this time , decided germany 's federal court of justice monday in karlsruhe , since searching computer and internet data on a suspect 's computer without their knowledge can not be compared to existing methods of police investigation . the court ruling stated that home searches differed from computer searches because they were always conducted in the presence of the suspect , or at least a witness .
telephone taps could also not be compared with computer hacking , continued the report , because previously saved data files fundamentally differ from live telecommunication . new legal framework may be created the public prosecutor 's office welcomed the decision from karlsruhe as it " established clarity on the scope of the existing investigation process concerning online evidence , which is so important to the investigation , " according to a statement cited by german news agency dpa . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble had been supportive of allowing police to conduct secret searches of computer hard drives and internet records . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble favors police hacking as an investigation method according to reports , it is likely that schäuble will now press for changes to the legal framework of the criminal investigation procedure that would allow for police hacking , which advocates see as particularly helpful in locating and prosecuting terrorists . support from the left jan korte from the left party immediately praised the court decision as a " godsend for civil rights . "
he also criticized schäuble , saying the interior minister should not " keep thinking up new methods of spying and then figure out the legal situation after the fact . " police hacking has been practiced in the past at the state level , often to scan the emails of individual suspects and criminal groups .

she spoke to dw-world.de about chancellor angela merkel 's initial trip to the mideast . dw-world.de : angela merkel is making her first trip to the arabic world as the german chancellor .
how do you think she will be received ? leslie tramontini : i can imagine that as the german chancellor she will be very positively received because the germans generally have a good image in the arabic world .
i do not think there will be any kind of astonishment when the first female chancellor arrives in the arabic world .
i have always experienced that as a woman i was always most welcome and taken seriously .
i could even imagine that it is an advantage for her . the revival of the mideast quartet is high on merkel 's agenda .
how can merkel push the peace process forward ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's four-day trip began saturday in egypt merkel can try egyptian help , saudi help and support for the revival of some type of peace talks .
we do not necessarily need to talk about this " road map , " but that they just sit down together at one table .
additionally , it is very difficult to bring peace or start peace talks when the parties are so divided .
in view of its historical past , germany must also , in my opinion , tell the israelis if there is going to be peace , you too have to make concessions . the saudi initiative from beirut in march 2002 was excellent .
it said we recognize israel when it pulls back to its 1967 border and when the refugee question is dealt with in a somewhat dignified way .
that would have been a foundation that they could sit down together about .
until that happens , we have to ask ourselves why it was not accepted . what merkel should do is try to collect as much arab support as possible . german initiatives usually are well accepted in the arabic world .
can the eu , under german leadership , take over the us leadership role ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all merkel 's efforts as eu president will need foreign help i think that can be answered with a clear no .
the eu and merkel and steinmeier can try to use germany 's influence to put pressure on .
but nothing , from neither the israeli nor the palestinian side , would ever be put through against the will or without the support of the united states .
the americans have to be a part , that 's a fact that is recognized , possibly grudgingly , by all sides . while militant and peaceful muslims use all their resources to fight their own governments and the west , is there really a chance for peace ? willingness to use violence does not generally go together with peace .
but the willingness to use force is not only coming from the islamic side but also from the israeli army , for example .

she spoke to dw-world.de about chancellor angela merkel 's initial trip to the mideast . dw-world.de : angela merkel is making her first trip to the arabic world as the german chancellor .
how do you think she will be received ? leslie tramontini : i can imagine that as the german chancellor she will be very positively received because the germans generally have a good image in the arabic world .
i do not think there will be any kind of astonishment when the first female chancellor arrives in the arabic world .
i have always experienced that as a woman i was always most welcome and taken seriously .
i could even imagine that it is an advantage for her . the revival of the mideast quartet is high on merkel 's agenda .
how can merkel push the peace process forward ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's four-day trip began saturday in egypt merkel can try egyptian help , saudi help and support for the revival of some type of peace talks .
we do not necessarily need to talk about this " road map , " but that they just sit down together at one table .
additionally , it is very difficult to bring peace or start peace talks when the parties are so divided .
in view of its historical past , germany must also , in my opinion , tell the israelis if there is going to be peace , you too have to make concessions . the saudi initiative from beirut in march 2002 was excellent .
it said we recognize israel when it pulls back to its 1967 border and when the refugee question is dealt with in a somewhat dignified way .
that would have been a foundation that they could sit down together about .
until that happens , we have to ask ourselves why it was not accepted . what merkel should do is try to collect as much arab support as possible . german initiatives usually are well accepted in the arabic world .
can the eu , under german leadership , take over the us leadership role ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all merkel 's efforts as eu president will need foreign help i think that can be answered with a clear no .
the eu and merkel and steinmeier can try to use germany 's influence to put pressure on .
but nothing , from neither the israeli nor the palestinian side , would ever be put through against the will or without the support of the united states .
the americans have to be a part , that 's a fact that is recognized , possibly grudgingly , by all sides . while militant and peaceful muslims use all their resources to fight their own governments and the west , is there really a chance for peace ? willingness to use violence does not generally go together with peace .
but the willingness to use force is not only coming from the islamic side but also from the israeli army , for example .
the destruction houses is also violence .

australia courts top coach for world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could klinsi be swapping long beach for bondi beach ?
rumours abound that german legend jürgen klinsmann has been approached to lead the australian team , after he was spotted holding discussions in los angeles . germany 's world cup coach jürgen klinsmann has been sounded out by australia to lead their 2010 world cup campaign , according to reports in sydney newspaper the sun herald on sunday . klinsmann , who led host nation germany to third place at last year 's world cup , met peter lowy , son of football federation australia chairman frank lowy , for lunch in los angeles last tuesday , the newspaper said . the newspaper quoted one observer who said of the meeting : " real estate was one subject they discussed but coaching opportunities with australia were tossed around .
the meeting was definitely business and not at all a social call . " rumors unconfirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " g 'day klinsi !
fancy a tinny ? "
ffa officials sunday declined to confirm that the meeting had taken place and klinsmann could not be immediately contacted for comment .
but the former german striker is known to favour coaching international football over taking on the day-to-day grind of club duties . " i 'm preparing myself for something new that might come along , " klinsmann said last week .
" it could happen in a month or two , or a year or two .
" you have to be open to a lot of things .
there is not an endlessly long list of job options at this level .

the strain found is similar to the hungarian outbreak of asian h5n1 , detected among geese . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 strain was found in hungarian geese in january bernard matthews foods denied the chance of the virus being spread from its hungarian farms to its operations in eastern england . " the fact that we have a hungarian operation is immaterial , " the spokesman told britain 's the guardian newspaper . fourteen eu members were affected by the virus at the peak of the european bird flu crisis in 2005 and 2006 and the discovery of the deadly flu strain in britain has sparked precautionary measures in other european countries as national governments remain concerned about the virus that was last detected in germany in august 2006 . eu tightening fowl controls the british government put in created a three-kilometer -lrb- 1.8-mile -rrb- protection zone and 10-kilometer surveillance area around the bernard matthews farm , europe 's largest turkey farm , to quarantine the outbreak . british chief scientist sir david king played down the chances of the virus spreading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk officials are confident the outbreak has been contained " i 'm really confident this is not going to spread to other poultry holder , " he said . the dutch agriculture ministry announced it was putting extra protective measures in place , norway issued restrictions on the keeping of poultry while france evaluated the risk to its flocks and ireland to put laboratories on alert . poultry farmers in ireland were also told to be extra vigilant in keeping their stocks out of contact with wild birds . " poultry keepers should watch their birds very closely , " northern ireland 's chief veterinary officer bert houston said . europe 's false sense of security world health organization spokesman gregory hartl said countries should be aware that the h5n1 virus could mutate to become transmissible between humans just as easily in europe as in asian or african countries .
" a mutation could occur anywhere , " hartl said .
" someone was saying in relation to the british outbreak , ' oh , it wo n't happen in europe . '
that 's really a kind of false security that is being built up . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health officials fear the virus could spread to humans the virus , which has killed 142 people in southeast asia and 165 worldwide since resurfacing in 2003 , does not appear to be mutating into a form easily transmissible between humans , according to david nabarro , the un official heading the global fight against avian influenza . more cases likely nabarro , however , added that he expected more cases of the virus to turn up . " i am expecting to see outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in a number of locations over the next three or four months , and i am basing it on what happened last year , " he told the afp news agency . " during the time that i 've been in this job , i have seen no increase in the risk of a pandemic , " nabarro said . farm workers , many of whom are migrants from portugal , and those involved in the cull have been given anti-viral drugs , and none of the affected bird entered the food chain , bernard matthews said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu confirms virulent bird flu strain on british farm the european commission confirmed on saturday that the bird flu virus detected at one of europe 's largest turkey manufactures was the virulent h5n1 strain .

but with 800 years of history between its pages , there 's plenty of room for mystery . commissioned for new cathedral bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monk herimann is the artist behind henry 's gospels henry the lion , prince of what were then the kingdoms of saxony and bavaria , was one of the most powerful rulers of the middle ages and a member of the guelph royal line . fitting with the tradition of the time , he commissioned the book in 1188 in honor of the consecration of the st. mary 's altar in the recently completed cathedral in braunschweig . still wholly intact except for minor wear , the text includes all four of the bible 's holy gospels on 226 parchment pages .
fifty of these pages are colorful , elaborate pictures with gold leaf . the book 's high liturgical purpose was the reason for its ornate design and distinction : passages were read from it during each mass . spotty history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the so-called " evangeliar " in 1984 shortly after its return to germany only bits of the text 's fate after henry 's reign are known .

in the united states , it 's an everyman sport ; all orange vests , elmer fudd hats and embarrassing events involving vice presidents . in both countries , hunting is a way of life , albeit one which is embraced by very different social circles on either side of the atlantic .
but what of germany ?
for those who have ever hunted for fun or necessity , germany 's rolling hills and wild expanses of forest conjure up images of a target-rich environment .
for others , hunting in germany may just be a series of headlines about problem bears and the return of wolves . " hunting in germany can not be compared to that which takes place in great britain or the united states , " said thorsten reinwald , spokesperson for the german hunter 's association -lrb- djv -rrb- .
" it is closer to the british concept of culling .
hunters in germany follow strict quotas for the shooting of particular animals like deer and have a responsibility to contribute to the regeneration of the environment . " hunting in britain and the united states is seen as a sport , whereas the djv promotes the activity as a necessary part of germany 's conservation policy , reinwald said . german hunters avoid publicity 's glare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tally-ho !
hunting in britain has a high media profile hunting in germany remains relatively low-key with discussions on the subject making only rare forays into the media .
it seems that , unless you are in the know , germany 's hunters barely feature in the wider public consciousness and are happy to sit with their hides away from the glare of publicity . germany boasts a hunting population of over 300,000 , of which 90 percent are members of the djv .
almost half of all the hunters in germany come from the sector the djv annual report describes as " employees / workers , " a vague title which does , however , exclude farmers - a group often associated with hunting more than any other . the djv says that 15 percent of german hunters work in farming while a further 27 percent are " self-employed . "
pensioners and the unemployed make up the final 11 percent . an expensive pastime while " employees / workers " could include anyone from bus drivers to bank managers , it suggests that the 47 percent of german hunters , who qualify under this heading , plus those who work for themselves , are of gainful employment .

hunting in germany does not come cheap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of time , money and training goes into being a hunter a course to fulfill all the criteria and results in the participant being ready to apply for a license -lrb- jagdschein -rrb- can cost in excess of 700 euros -lrb- $ 905 -rrb- . in addition to the financial costs , hunting in germany requires a dedication of the mind as well as one of the pocket as gaining a hunting license is a complicated affair .
to do so , one needs to attend a specialist training course that often requires the would-be hunter to rack up at least 120 hours of practical and theoretical training . as stipulated in federal hunting law , a candidate must pass the hunting examination , which is composed of a written and oral examination and a shooting test with both a shotgun and a rifle .
according to the law , the candidate must show adequate knowledge of a vast selection of topics including game biology and management , hunting management , farming and forestry , firearms law and technique , and gundog handling . exams and laws keep hunting tightly regulated hunters are also subject to strict police checks and will be refused a license if they have been found guilty of any crime involving firearms , ammunition and explosives .
offenses against nature conservation or protection of animal rights or if the applicant is addicted to drugs can lead to license revocation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young , responsible and licensed to kill while the german hunting community champions itself as an inclusive one - open as it is to all law-abiding citizens over the age of 18 who have the time , money and inclination to earn a license - the expenditure , dedication and personal requirements needed to qualify does give the pastime an exclusive feel . for some , having a hunting license becomes a trophy in itself ; a status symbol which allows the bearer to enter another world where like-minded individuals gather to revel in their own achievements and pursue an activity safe in the knowledge that they are among those who have earned the right to hunt . the feeling of community has gone a long way to attracting the new generation of hunters , a breed where the bonding over warm guns and carcasses is as important as the hunting itself . " researchers at the university of bremen have discovered in a study that this is one of the main reasons behind people pursuing a hunting license , " the djv 's thorsten reinwald said .
" hunting brings an intense physical experience and balances the stresses of hectic everyday life . " escaping the pressures of the city to indulge in an activity that is , at its very roots , primal has proved to be something of a lure to an increasing number of young professionals , mostly from corporate management positions .

it seems that , unless you are in the know , germany 's hunters barely feature in the wider public consciousness and are happy to sit with their hides away from the glare of publicity . germany boasts a hunting population of over 300,000 , of which 90 percent are members of the djv .
almost half of all the hunters in germany come from the sector the djv annual report describes as " employees / workers , " a vague title which does , however , exclude farmers - a group often associated with hunting more than any other . the djv says that 15 percent of german hunters work in farming while a further 27 percent are " self-employed . "
pensioners and the unemployed make up the final 11 percent . an expensive pastime while " employees / workers " could include anyone from bus drivers to bank managers , it suggests that the 47 percent of german hunters , who qualify under this heading , plus those who work for themselves , are of gainful employment .

to do so , one needs to attend a specialist training course that often requires the would-be hunter to rack up at least 120 hours of practical and theoretical training . as stipulated in federal hunting law , a candidate must pass the hunting examination , which is composed of a written and oral examination and a shooting test with both a shotgun and a rifle .
according to the law , the candidate must show adequate knowledge of a vast selection of topics including game biology and management , hunting management , farming and forestry , firearms law and technique , and gundog handling . exams and laws keep hunting tightly regulated hunters are also subject to strict police checks and will be refused a license if they have been found guilty of any crime involving firearms , ammunition and explosives .

in the united states , it 's an everyman sport ; all orange vests , elmer fudd hats and embarrassing events involving vice presidents . in both countries , hunting is a way of life , albeit one which is embraced by very different social circles on either side of the atlantic .
but what of germany ?
for those who have ever hunted for fun or necessity , germany 's rolling hills and wild expanses of forest conjure up images of a target-rich environment .
for others , hunting in germany may just be a series of headlines about problem bears and the return of wolves . " hunting in germany can not be compared to that which takes place in great britain or the united states , " said thorsten reinwald , spokesperson for the german hunter 's association -lrb- djv -rrb- .
" it is closer to the british concept of culling .
hunters in germany follow strict quotas for the shooting of particular animals like deer and have a responsibility to contribute to the regeneration of the environment .

germany 's supreme court determined monday that police may not secretly hack into suspects ' computers .
some are celebrating the decision as a civil rights victory , but the ruling may not be the last word on the matter . no legal framework for secret police hacking exists at this time , decided germany 's federal court of justice monday in karlsruhe , since searching computer and internet data on a suspect 's computer without their knowledge can not be compared to existing methods of police investigation . the court ruling stated that home searches differed from computer searches because they were always conducted in the presence of the suspect , or at least a witness .
telephone taps could also not be compared with computer hacking , continued the report , because previously saved data files fundamentally differ from live telecommunication . new legal framework may be created the public prosecutor 's office welcomed the decision from karlsruhe as it " established clarity on the scope of the existing investigation process concerning online evidence , which is so important to the investigation , " according to a statement cited by german news agency dpa . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble had been supportive of allowing police to conduct secret searches of computer hard drives and internet records . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble favors police hacking as an investigation method according to reports , it is likely that schäuble will now press for changes to the legal framework of the criminal investigation procedure that would allow for police hacking , which advocates see as particularly helpful in locating and prosecuting terrorists . support from the left jan korte from the left party immediately praised the court decision as a " godsend for civil rights .

germany 's supreme court determined monday that police may not secretly hack into suspects ' computers .
some are celebrating the decision as a civil rights victory , but the ruling may not be the last word on the matter . no legal framework for secret police hacking exists at this time , decided germany 's federal court of justice monday in karlsruhe , since searching computer and internet data on a suspect 's computer without their knowledge can not be compared to existing methods of police investigation . the court ruling stated that home searches differed from computer searches because they were always conducted in the presence of the suspect , or at least a witness .
telephone taps could also not be compared with computer hacking , continued the report , because previously saved data files fundamentally differ from live telecommunication . new legal framework may be created the public prosecutor 's office welcomed the decision from karlsruhe as it " established clarity on the scope of the existing investigation process concerning online evidence , which is so important to the investigation , " according to a statement cited by german news agency dpa . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble had been supportive of allowing police to conduct secret searches of computer hard drives and internet records . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble favors police hacking as an investigation method according to reports , it is likely that schäuble will now press for changes to the legal framework of the criminal investigation procedure that would allow for police hacking , which advocates see as particularly helpful in locating and prosecuting terrorists . support from the left jan korte from the left party immediately praised the court decision as a " godsend for civil rights . "
he also criticized schäuble , saying the interior minister should not " keep thinking up new methods of spying and then figure out the legal situation after the fact . " police hacking has been practiced in the past at the state level , often to scan the emails of individual suspects and criminal groups .
a court order was required in these cases and the computers could only be searched while they were running . a supreme court judge affirmed the legality of secret police hacking in february 2006 .
when this judgment was overturned in november , attorney general monika harms appealed .
monday 's decision rejected harms ' appeal and upheld the november decision . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police turn up the heat on internet sex offenders as arrests for child pornography have increased , the office of criminal investigation in baden-württemberg says it intends to beef up its it-forensics department so no pedophile feels safe or anonymous on the internet .

she spoke to dw-world.de about chancellor angela merkel 's initial trip to the mideast . dw-world.de : angela merkel is making her first trip to the arabic world as the german chancellor .
how do you think she will be received ? leslie tramontini : i can imagine that as the german chancellor she will be very positively received because the germans generally have a good image in the arabic world .
i do not think there will be any kind of astonishment when the first female chancellor arrives in the arabic world .
i have always experienced that as a woman i was always most welcome and taken seriously .
i could even imagine that it is an advantage for her . the revival of the mideast quartet is high on merkel 's agenda .
how can merkel push the peace process forward ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's four-day trip began saturday in egypt merkel can try egyptian help , saudi help and support for the revival of some type of peace talks .
we do not necessarily need to talk about this " road map , " but that they just sit down together at one table .
additionally , it is very difficult to bring peace or start peace talks when the parties are so divided .
in view of its historical past , germany must also , in my opinion , tell the israelis if there is going to be peace , you too have to make concessions . the saudi initiative from beirut in march 2002 was excellent .
it said we recognize israel when it pulls back to its 1967 border and when the refugee question is dealt with in a somewhat dignified way .
that would have been a foundation that they could sit down together about .
until that happens , we have to ask ourselves why it was not accepted . what merkel should do is try to collect as much arab support as possible . german initiatives usually are well accepted in the arabic world .
can the eu , under german leadership , take over the us leadership role ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all merkel 's efforts as eu president will need foreign help i think that can be answered with a clear no .
the eu and merkel and steinmeier can try to use germany 's influence to put pressure on .
but nothing , from neither the israeli nor the palestinian side , would ever be put through against the will or without the support of the united states .
the americans have to be a part , that 's a fact that is recognized , possibly grudgingly , by all sides . while militant and peaceful muslims use all their resources to fight their own governments and the west , is there really a chance for peace ? willingness to use violence does not generally go together with peace .
but the willingness to use force is not only coming from the islamic side but also from the israeli army , for example .
the destruction houses is also violence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 05.02.2007 " merkel should try to collect as much arab support as possible " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel needs support from arab governments to restart the peace process there will be little reason to hope for an end to the israeli-palestinian conflict until the sides are able to once again sit down at one table , middle east expert leslie tramontini told dw-world.de. leslie tramontini is a professor at the university of freiburg and an expert on middle east policy and ethnic conflict .
she spoke to dw-world.de about chancellor angela merkel 's initial trip to the mideast . dw-world.de : angela merkel is making her first trip to the arabic world as the german chancellor .
how do you think she will be received ? leslie tramontini : i can imagine that as the german chancellor she will be very positively received because the germans generally have a good image in the arabic world .
i do not think there will be any kind of astonishment when the first female chancellor arrives in the arabic world .
i have always experienced that as a woman i was always most welcome and taken seriously .
i could even imagine that it is an advantage for her . the revival of the mideast quartet is high on merkel 's agenda .
how can merkel push the peace process forward ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's four-day trip began saturday in egypt merkel can try egyptian help , saudi help and support for the revival of some type of peace talks .
we do not necessarily need to talk about this " road map , " but that they just sit down together at one table .
additionally , it is very difficult to bring peace or start peace talks when the parties are so divided .
in view of its historical past , germany must also , in my opinion , tell the israelis if there is going to be peace , you too have to make concessions . the saudi initiative from beirut in march 2002 was excellent .
it said we recognize israel when it pulls back to its 1967 border and when the refugee question is dealt with in a somewhat dignified way .
that would have been a foundation that they could sit down together about .
until that happens , we have to ask ourselves why it was not accepted . what merkel should do is try to collect as much arab support as possible . german initiatives usually are well accepted in the arabic world .
can the eu , under german leadership , take over the us leadership role ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all merkel 's efforts as eu president will need foreign help i think that can be answered with a clear no .
the eu and merkel and steinmeier can try to use germany 's influence to put pressure on .
but nothing , from neither the israeli nor the palestinian side , would ever be put through against the will or without the support of the united states .
the americans have to be a part , that 's a fact that is recognized , possibly grudgingly , by all sides . while militant and peaceful muslims use all their resources to fight their own governments and the west , is there really a chance for peace ? willingness to use violence does not generally go together with peace .
but the willingness to use force is not only coming from the islamic side but also from the israeli army , for example .
the destruction houses is also violence .
as long as both sides think the other only understands the language of violence , i do not see any large hope . aladdin sarhan interviewed leslie tramontini -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel arrives in saudi arabia pressing for middle east peace german chancellor angela merkel flew in to the saudi capital on sunday on the second leg of a middle east tour aimed at coordinating efforts to resume israeli-palestinian peace talks .

australia courts top coach for world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could klinsi be swapping long beach for bondi beach ?
rumours abound that german legend jürgen klinsmann has been approached to lead the australian team , after he was spotted holding discussions in los angeles . germany 's world cup coach jürgen klinsmann has been sounded out by australia to lead their 2010 world cup campaign , according to reports in sydney newspaper the sun herald on sunday . klinsmann , who led host nation germany to third place at last year 's world cup , met peter lowy , son of football federation australia chairman frank lowy , for lunch in los angeles last tuesday , the newspaper said . the newspaper quoted one observer who said of the meeting : " real estate was one subject they discussed but coaching opportunities with australia were tossed around .
the meeting was definitely business and not at all a social call . " rumors unconfirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " g 'day klinsi !
fancy a tinny ? "
ffa officials sunday declined to confirm that the meeting had taken place and klinsmann could not be immediately contacted for comment .
but the former german striker is known to favour coaching international football over taking on the day-to-day grind of club duties . " i 'm preparing myself for something new that might come along , " klinsmann said last week .
" it could happen in a month or two , or a year or two .
" you have to be open to a lot of things .
there is not an endlessly long list of job options at this level .
the air is pretty thin up there .
and if it 's the right fit with the family and the right challenge , you go to the country where you might have once never thought you 'd go . " peter lowy runs the us arm of his family 's westfield property group , and according to the sun-herald , he is known to unofficially conduct ffa business when he can .
klinsmann has lived in california with his american wife and children since he retired from playing in 1998 .
he was in discussions with the us soccer federation last year about coaching its national team but ended talks in december when it became clear he would n't have control of team matters . aiming to win in 2010 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup mascot goleo has already made friends down under the ffa wants a full-time replacement for dutchman guus hiddink to take charge of the team before the 2010 world cup qualifiers kick off next year .
australians were thrilled when hiddink coached the socceroos to world cup qualification for the first time in 32 years , and are likely to be searching for a european with a strong track record again .
australia currently ranks 39th with fifa and the ffa is expects to take the team further in 2010 . the sun-herald said under any deal with australia , klinsmann would continue to live in the united states .
he was criticised in germany for not moving home in the lead-up to the world cup , preferring to commute from los angeles . if klinsmann is interested in the job then he is in competition with the socceroo 's assistant coach , australian graham arnold , who has made no secret of wanting the top job .
' if they 're talking to jürgen klinsmann , all i can do is try and make it as difficult as possible for them , ' arnold told australian news agency aap .
' on jürgen klinsmann , he did n't live in germany when he coached germany , he still lived in the united states - and germany is his home country .

" poultry keepers should watch their birds very closely , " northern ireland 's chief veterinary officer bert houston said . europe 's false sense of security world health organization spokesman gregory hartl said countries should be aware that the h5n1 virus could mutate to become transmissible between humans just as easily in europe as in asian or african countries .
" a mutation could occur anywhere , " hartl said .
" someone was saying in relation to the british outbreak , ' oh , it wo n't happen in europe . '
that 's really a kind of false security that is being built up .

" i am expecting to see outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in a number of locations over the next three or four months , and i am basing it on what happened last year , " he told the afp news agency . " during the time that i 've been in this job , i have seen no increase in the risk of a pandemic , " nabarro said . farm workers , many of whom are migrants from portugal , and those involved in the cull have been given anti-viral drugs , and none of the affected bird entered the food chain , bernard matthews said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu confirms virulent bird flu strain on british farm the european commission confirmed on saturday that the bird flu virus detected at one of europe 's largest turkey manufactures was the virulent h5n1 strain .

mr chidambaram told bbc world service that if economic growth continued , india could end poverty by 2040 .
india would play its part in the post-kyoto negotiations on climate change , he said , though he insisted that " we have a right to grow " .
mr chidambaram also vowed to protect poor farmers from the ravages of free trade in agriculture .
poverty and growth mr chidambaram , who became finance minister in 2004 after the congress party unexpectedly won the general election , has presided over an indian economy which is currently growing at 9 % per year , almost as fast as china .
he told the bbc that his task was " to ensure not only growth but that this growth is inclusive growth " which reaches india 's 250m poor people .
mr chidambaram said that " growth is the best antidote to poverty " .
" growth gives incomes to people with jobs , throws up jobs for those who are not employed , " he said .
" therefore growth is imperative , but it is not sufficient in a country ... where a significant number live in poverty . "
the finance minister said it would take until 2040 to wipe out " abject poverty " but he was confident that if growth continued to be strong , it would happen .
" we will not have the abject poverty that afflicts about 25 % of india 's population .
people will have homes , work , food , clothing , and access to education and medical care . "
climate change with negotiations entering a delicate phase on climate change , the position of india and china - who were not given any pollution targets in the kyoto round of talks - is being closely watched . "
if the developed countries with their subsidised agriculture seek access to india 's market , it will of course immiserise our farming population , and we will never let that happen " palaniappan chidambaram mr chidambaram said that the west was being unfair to india by demanding sharp cuts in emissions just as india 's economy was taking off .
" when the developed world was growing , no one asked them : why are you consuming so much energy , why did n't you slow down ? " he said .
" the point is , we have the right to grow , just as much as the us and europe had a right to grow in the 19th and 20th centuries . "
but he said that india was willing " to take our share of responsibility , provided we have access to clean technologies and clean development mechanisms . "
trade the finance minister said that india 's openness to the forces of globalisation had helped stimulate growth , but that there were winners and losers .
" the positive aspects of globalisation will be greater capital flows , more trade , more jobs in the services sector , more exports , " he said .
india 's it services sector has become a global leader in outsourcing , and earns $ 25bn a year which boosts india 's foreign exchange reserves .
the finance minister said it was a myth that india 's advantage was its cheap labour .
" the point is , india 's labour is skilled , and today we are a major hub of manufacturing , " he said .
" we even export mercedes benz cars made in india back to germany . "
but mr chidambaram accepted that there were also potential losers , especially in the agricultural sector , which still employs the majority of the workforce .
" the negative aspects which we are guarding against are the impact on agriculture , " he said .
" agriculture in india today is a livelihood issue , which is why , when we go to the wto , we do not look at agriculture simply as a trading issue , we have to protect the livelihood of millions of people , " he added .
and the finance minister said india would stand firm .
" if the developed countries continue to subsidise agriculture and then seek access to india 's market , it will of course immiserise our farming population , and we will never let that happen . "
his remarks on this score will not be seen as helpful for the resumption of world trade talks , which have been stalled since the summer over the issue of agricultural subsidies .
infrastructure woes some economists worry that india will not be able to sustain its high rate of economic growth unless it can dramatically improve its ageing infrastructure .
but mr chidambaram said that foreign investment could help overcome the infrastructure gap , provided that india " continues to observe fiscal prudence ... ensures that there is an enabling environment for investors , both foreign and domestic ... and ensure that these investments are made widely and managed wisely . "
and the markets seem to agree with him .
india 's international credit rating was recently upgraded by credit agencies , and foreign investment has been surging into the country - although india is still a long way behind china on that score .
mr chidambaram was interviewed by mike williams for " the interview " , broadcast on bbc world service on 3/4 february .

" the point is , india 's labour is skilled , and today we are a major hub of manufacturing , " he said .
" we even export mercedes benz cars made in india back to germany . "
but mr chidambaram accepted that there were also potential losers , especially in the agricultural sector , which still employs the majority of the workforce .
" the negative aspects which we are guarding against are the impact on agriculture , " he said .
" agriculture in india today is a livelihood issue , which is why , when we go to the wto , we do not look at agriculture simply as a trading issue , we have to protect the livelihood of millions of people , " he added .
and the finance minister said india would stand firm .
" if the developed countries continue to subsidise agriculture and then seek access to india 's market , it will of course immiserise our farming population , and we will never let that happen . "
his remarks on this score will not be seen as helpful for the resumption of world trade talks , which have been stalled since the summer over the issue of agricultural subsidies .
infrastructure woes some economists worry that india will not be able to sustain its high rate of economic growth unless it can dramatically improve its ageing infrastructure .
but mr chidambaram said that foreign investment could help overcome the infrastructure gap , provided that india " continues to observe fiscal prudence ... ensures that there is an enabling environment for investors , both foreign and domestic ... and ensure that these investments are made widely and managed wisely . "
and the markets seem to agree with him .
india 's international credit rating was recently upgraded by credit agencies , and foreign investment has been surging into the country - although india is still a long way behind china on that score .
mr chidambaram was interviewed by mike williams for " the interview " , broadcast on bbc world service on 3/4 february .

the population of the city is expected to grow by 40,000 people this month , and every month for years to come .
the municipality of chongqing , which includes a chunk of surrounding countryside , already has a population of 31 million .
that is more than half the number of people who live in britain .

a grim mixture of mist and man-made pollution usually makes it difficult to see very far in this sprawling metropolis on the banks of the yangtse river .
but even in the gloom i count fifty huge construction sites before we are halfway to our hotel .
the population of the city is expected to grow by 40,000 people this month , and every month for years to come .
the municipality of chongqing , which includes a chunk of surrounding countryside , already has a population of 31 million .
that is more than half the number of people who live in britain .
and there seems almost no limit to chongqing 's ambition for future growth .
good wages this is china 's new economic frontier .
the country 's extraordinary development began in the coastal cities , powered by a seemingly limitless supply of cheap labour .
but as costs and wages have risen in those areas , businesses are looking west for new , cheaper places to operate .
chongqing lies more than a thousand miles inland .
and the city authorities - ever eager to attract new investment - claim that wage rates for many jobs here are half of those in some of the coastal cities .
but chongqing still has no difficulty in attracting new migrants from the vast rural hinterland of china 's south west .
many come hoping to get work in a factory .
i was introduced to a young assembly worker , newly arrived from a tiny village .
his pay is £ 80 a month .
and although he admitted that he had found the transition to city life quite difficult , the money was far more than he could hope to earn at home .
beast of burden less well educated migrants - or less lucky ones - may end up working as " bang bang men " .
you see them everywhere in chongqing , carrying everything from building materials to shop supplies or tourists ' suitcases .
the " bang bang " is a stout pole , which is placed across the shoulders .
a load is attached by rope and carried up the city 's steep lanes and alleys by the human beast of burden .
i was taken to a tiny flat crammed with bunk beds , home to more than 20 " bang bang " men , to hear about their working lives .
for example , how heavy are the loads ?
often more than a hundred kilos , a young man told me .
and what do you weigh yourself , i asked - 58 kilos , he told me .
after much conferring , they reckoned that typical earnings for a " bang bang man " were about £ 40 a month .
most of them said that they were able to send money home to their families in the countryside .
and they were looking forward to chinese new year , on 18 february .
it is the only time when most of china 's 150 million migrant workers get a chance to go back to their families in the rural areas .
mass migration but although the work looked back-breaking to me , the " bang bang men " i met were a cheerful lot .
and , incidentally , quite knowledgeable about english premiership football .
-lrb- one of them told me that arsenal 's young star cesc fabregas was his favourite player . -rrb-
perhaps the optimistic spirit of chongqing was best summed up for me by yin ming shan , the founder of the lifan motorcycle and car-making business in the city 's suburbs .
he was jailed in the early 1960s for holding politically " incorrect " views .
then he survived chairman mao 's cultural revolution , when to be even a little richer than your neighbours would lead to forcible " re-education " in the impoverished chinese countryside .

chung mong-koo , 68 , was accused of amassing a multi-million dollar slush fund for personal use and to pay lobbyists and politicians .
a spokesman for south korea 's top auto maker said the ruling was disappointing and that an appeal would be filed .
the court allowed chung to remain on bail while he fights the appeal .
before the verdict , analysts said the conviction could harm south korea 's car sector and the wider economy .
' grave crimes ' chung was accused of embezzling 103.4bn won -lrb- $ 110m ; £ 56m -rrb- from company affiliates .
some of the money was allegedly used to pay off politicians and government officials , and also help smooth the way for chung 's son to take control of the auto group .

he said chung 's action 's were " clearly criminal " .
prosecutors - who had sought a six-year sentence - had argued during the trial that chung 's crimes were " grave " .
but judge kim said the lesser sentence was given taking into account chung 's " big contributions to the development of the country 's economy " and also his involvement in charity .
chung 's lawyers had argued that the chairman should be granted a suspended sentence because of the damage a jail term might mean to south korea 's economy .
they had also cited health reasons .
chung looked grim as the verdict was read and later walked silently from the courtroom .
he previously asked for leniency and promised to improve the firm 's corporate governance .
hyundai motor company said it would appeal .
" we are greatly disappointed by the court ruling today , " company spokesman jake jang said .
shares tumble the trial has been closely watched in south korea , where it has been seen as a test of the court 's commitment to tackle corporate corruption , the bbc 's charles scanlon in seoul says .
in the past the courts have treated similar cases with great leniency , but there has been growing pressure from the government and the public to impose stiffer penalties , he adds .
before the ruling , experts said the conviction could harm south korea 's car sector .
hyundai has faced worker unrest the imprisonment could " have a grave impact on the industry as well as the national economy " , said yong-dae-in , an analyst with goodmorning shinhan securities .

anxiety symptoms and stress have followed active service for many people through many conflicts , and left untreated they have fundamentally damaged the lives of countless ex-service men and women .
today post traumatic stress disorder -lrb- ptsd -rrb- is a recognised condition suffered by many who have been on active service with the armed forces .
post traumatic stress disorder is a recognised condition the term is used to describe a range of psychological symptoms people may experience following a traumatic event , which is outside the normal human experience .
the atrocities witnessed during conflict , the fear and the killing , are outside normal human experience .
the men and women of the british armed forces have been in conflict somewhere almost continuously .
since world war ii they have seen active service in malaya , the falklands , the gulf , the balkans , sierra leone and of course , northern ireland , arguably the most difficult and dangerous of all .
every one of these conflicts has resulted in psychiatric injury .
and such damage may take years , even decades to come to the surface .
the intensity of the current conflicts in iraq and afghanistan is putting servicemen and women under heavier psychological pressure than ever before .
more than 100,000 british troops have been or are serving in iraq .
already , more than 2,000 have sought help for psychological problems on their return .
mental health with 15-20,000 more currently in afghanistan , the numbers with ptsd or other mental health disabilities are likely to grow .
ministry of defence figures suggest that around 2 % of all serving personnel will end up with these problems , and for the first time the mod has admitted the numbers are growing .
the symptoms are common to almost all ex-service personnel who suffer from ptsd .
they include sleeplessness , flashbacks , nightmares , mood swings , intense uncontrollable anger and anxieties that colour every moment of their lives .
sufferers may turn to alcohol or drugs ; they may lose their families , who find themselves unable to cope with the unpredictability ; they may become homeless ; they may attempt suicide .
the condition may last for a lifetime .
symptoms include intense uncontrollable anger many have seen their friends and colleagues shot or blown up ; many survived the same things themselves and suffer from survivor guilt ; many have observed unspeakable outrages which they were powerless to prevent and many have been deeply traumatised by the act of killing .
while still in service many try to hide their symptoms , as any evidence of weakness or fragility is frowned on , but people may be treated in military hospitals .
once discharged , their care is the responsibility of the nhs , which , under huge pressures coping with mental health issues itself , does not have the specific expertise needed to deal with ex-service personnel .
people coming back from iraq are complaining that they 're not fully supported by the government and ca n't get the help they need .
ptsd is treatable , although by the time many who need it actually get it , the condition has become deeply embedded .
help and treatment are available through the service charities .
psychological damage ssafa , the royal british legion and erskine can all point people in the right direction , and the ex-services mental welfare society , also known as combat stress , only cares for those with psychological damage .
treatment is partly funded by the government , but only if the veteran needing it has a war pension , with a certain percentage of that attributable to mental health .
for those without that , the cost is shared between themselves and the voluntary sector .
many feel they are stigmatized both by the condition , and because they see themselves as charity cases .
as involvement in the current conflicts continue , the need for treatment can only continue to grow .
and the appointment of derek twigg , mp , as veterans minister , should lead to more being done for the men and women who have gone to war in our name .

post traumatic stress disorder is a recognised condition the term is used to describe a range of psychological symptoms people may experience following a traumatic event , which is outside the normal human experience .

the symptoms are common to almost all ex-service personnel who suffer from ptsd .

net , or post-tax , profits for the period rose to 47.7 million euros -lrb- £ 31.4m -rrb- , up from 36.8m euros in the same period a year earlier .
it also carried 19 % more passengers than in the same period in 2005 .
ryanair said that hedging its fuel bills for 2007/8 meant it could save 60m euros a year .
its bill for fuel in the final quarter of 2006 was 52 % higher than a year ago - at 175m euros .
' unfair ' in its results statement , ryanair chief executive michael o 'leary reiterated his attack on the recent increase in passenger duty people pay when taking flights from the uk as " regressive , unfair and penal " .
he also repeated his view about " the recent hysteria " over the impact of flying on climate change which he said was " misguided and misplaced " .
" aviation accounts for less than 1.6 % of greenhouse gas emissions and we expect , in time , that the media and the government will focus on the causes of 98 % of greenhouse gas emissions " , he said .
ryanair added that since it had begun charging customers for each item of baggage they checked in , more passengers were travelling with hand luggage only .

the interviewer is mike williams .
indian finance minister " we have the right to grow , just as much as the us and europe had a right to grow in the 19th century " palaniappan chidambaram williams : hello and welcome , i 'm mike williams .
my guest today comes from a country that 's home to more than a billion people - india .
it 's the world 's largest democracy , its economy is the second fastest growing in the world .
but despite all of this a third or more of india 's people live in poverty and my guest has the job of managing its economy .
palaniappan chidambaram welcome to the interview .
chidambaram : thank you .
williams : india 's finance minister - that 's a pretty massive job you have , you 've got a big task have n't you .
chidambaram : it 's a challenging task .
williams : what 's most challenging ?
chidambaram : to ensure that the economy grows at no less than 8 % a year .
williams : that 's quite ambitious , that 's i think second only to china is n't it - only china is growing faster than india .
why does growth matter ?
chidambaram : growth is the best antidote to poverty .
growth gives incomes to people who are employed , throws up jobs for those who are not employed .
therefore growth is imperative .
but growth obviously is not sufficient in a country that you introduced a minute ago as a country where a significant proportion lives in poverty the growth must be inclusive growth .
so the task of the government - the task of the finance minister - is to ensure not only growth but that this growth is inclusive growth .
williams : we 'll talk a little bit more about that a little later .
but i suppose my first question is can you sustain this growth , it 's a very , very ambitious target - 8 % or more - can you do it ?
chidambaram : i think we can , we have to do the right things and avoid doing the wrong things .
now what are the right things ?
the right things are one : continue to observe fiscal prudence .
two : ensure that people save and invest and that there is an enabling environment for investors , both domestic and foreign .
and number three : ensure that these investments are made widely , managed wisely , so that they give a return .
if these principles are observed i do n't think it 's difficult in india to sustain a growth rate of no less than 8 % , pushing 9 % , and aiming to go beyond .
williams : you mentioned foreign investment , why do n't foreigners want to invest in india , because they do n't do they - at the moment direct phone investments stands at only 1 % of gdp .
in china , one of your main economic rivals i suppose , the figure 's nine times that ?
chidambaram : well the comparisons are not quite appropriate .
the way china counts fdi is different from the way india counts fdi .
besides overseas chinese investments from hong kong and taiwan are also counted .
be that as it may i can see that china gets much larger doses of foreign investment .
but the foreign investment that will flow into india is also dependent upon our capacity to absorb it .
and our capacity to absorb foreign investment will depend upon our willingness to open up more sectors which are regulated , open them up to foreign investment .
our current account deficit is still very modest - 1.3 % of gdp - we need to expand the current account deficit and absorb foreign direct investment .
this year , for example , 2006-07 , fdi inflows are running 50 % higher than last year .
williams : and do you think foreign investments are scared of the politics of india , are worried about a return to the heavy hand of the state on the economy ?
chidambaram : not at all , no foreign investor in recent years has expressed that worry to me .
what they want to know is whether more sectors which are rather tightly regulated will be available to them .
williams : do n't you risk annoying indians at home when you start liberalising these sectors , when you start opening them up to foreigners , is n't that a political problem for you at home ?
chidambaram : there are some sections which are wary about foreign investment but by and large i think the political establishment , irrespective of the political party , because every political party is running some state government or another , recognises the place of foreign investment .
besides outward foreign investment from india , from indian companies , and the acquisitions made by indian companies have also helped to change the mindset in india .
williams : can india cope with the growth that you say you want , you say you can achieve , what about the country 's infrastructure - its roads , its bridges , its ports , urban centres which ca n't sustain the pace of this growth ?
chidambaram : you 're right but in a sense the deficiencies have been exposed by the rapid rate of growth .
if we were growing at 4 or 5 % these roads , these ports , these airports , would be considered adequate .
so it 's a chicken and egg - we need the growth but the deficiencies of infrastructure become more glaring , therefore we need to grow our infrastructure at the same pace as we grow the rest of the economy , which is why we are putting in a lot of money and we are attracting a lot of money into airports , sea ports , roads , railway , telecommunication , power , petroleum exploration .
williams : tell me about power , do you think you 're going to be able to find the energy supplies to sustain ... ?
chidambaram : there 's an 8 % gap - there 's an 8 % gap between demand and supply today .
i think we 'll overcome this gap in the next five years .
we have just done -lsb- indistinct word -rsb- and ultra mega power project policy and we have given out bids for two such projects by 31st december , we will give out two more by 31st march .
we have no option - we have to overcome this demand / supply gap in power .
williams what do you think when you hear wealthy westerners saying that you should n't do that , you need to curb your energy use to protect the environment ?
chidambaram : well i politely reject that criticism .
when the rest of the world , the developed world , was growing nobody asked them why are you consuming so much energy , nobody asks them today why did n't you slow down and why did n't you consume less energy .
the point is we have a right to grow , just as much as the us and europe had a right to grow in the 19 - in the 20th century .
we have a right to grow , we have a right to consume energy , our carbon emissions are still among the lowest in the world , yet we are willing , as i 've said before , to take our share of responsibility , provided we have access to clean technologies and clean development mechanisms .
williams : you say you answer them politely but does it make you a bit angry when you hear westerners talking to you about your responsibility to the planet ?
chidambaram : no , i think one can be polite and firm .
williams : do you ever look back at your childhood perhaps and say why on earth did i enter politics ?
chidambaram : no , i did as a matter of choice .
i was inspired to enter politics when mrs indira gandhi emerged as the leader .
i came into parliament when mr rajiv gandhi had assumed the office of prime minister .
these are two leaders i respect greatly .
and i 'm in politics but i 'm also secure in the fact that politics is not all that i can do in this world - i can practise law , i can lecture , i can write , i can travel .
williams : and you grew up - you grew up as a businessman really , did n't you , in a business family .
i 'm told that you 're a chettiyar - i hope i said that properly ...
chidambaram : that 's right .
williams : now i have to admit that i do n't know much about the indian caste system , i did n't even know that there was such a thing as a business caste - the chettiyars .
for those like me who do n't understand the system how did that evolve ?
chidambaram : well how did the caste system evolve ?
williams : well particularly the position of the chettiyars , i mean where did the chettiyars come from ?
chidambaram : well the chettiyars are a very small business community but there are hundreds of such communities in different parts of india who are essentially businessmen , as opposed to farmers - traders as opposed to farmers .
the chettiyars are a small business community , they travelled overseas to burma , to malaysia , to sri lanka , to singapore and set up businesses there , largely banking and trading .
so i was born in that community but i have never regarded caste as an important factor , i 've rejected caste .
williams : do you think that being brought up in that tradition though helped you to get to where you are , you must have been surrounded by the vocabulary of trade , of economics , of business when you were younger ?
chidambaram : i think the only thing that that did to me was to send me to business school in harvard rather than law school .
if i had a choice i would have gone to the law school but i went to the business school .
but when i returned from business school i did n't do business i went to practise law .
williams : you trained as a lawyer then , as you said , went to harvard in the united states .
what was it like as an indian studying for an mba in harvard in the 1960s , what do you remember of those times ?
chidambaram : oh we were a rather small and exclusive tribe at that moment , we were four indians in that class , two of them had come from india , the other two were indians who were living in the united states because their parents were living there .
it was quite a challenge - coming from a different school and education system where i suppose by and large one learnt by rote .
harvard business school challenged you to think , to analyse , to argue your positions .
it was quite a challenge but i enjoyed myself .
basically i had a law degree and my aspiration was to be a lawyer .
williams : what do you think you brought back from the united states to india and to indian politics , do you think it made you the reformist that , i think it 's fair to describe you as ?
chidambaram : no when i returned from harvard business school i was still pretty much wedded to socialism .
so harvard business school did not change my political affiliation .
what harvard business school taught me was that accept nothing as a given , challenge everything , ask for data , ask for reason and arguments and be prepared to receive counter arguments .
harvard business school made you think and reason rather than accept conventional wisdom .
williams : you said you returned home as a socialist , you would n't call yourself a socialist now would you ?
chidambaram : no i 've explained that in a recent interview .
i say if you want to define a socialist as one who believes in socialist goals - more equity , more social justice , more opportunity for everyone , care of the aged , care of the disabled , a special place for children and women - yes i 'm a socialist .
but if you ask me do i believe in socialist methods - state controlled policies , state driven economy - i do n't any longer , i believe that a well regulated market is the best guarantor that you will achieve your goals .
williams : let 's talk about your goals , where you came from politically .
it was rajiv gandhi , i believe , who gave you your first big political break in 1984 , tell us how that happened .
chidambaram : well i knew mrs indira gandhi reasonably well , she was very fond of me .
i used to translate her speeches from english to tamil when she visited tamil nadu .
i was the leader of the youth congress in my state when she was the leader of the party .
then i became a general secretary of my state party .
but my first big break , in the sense that i contested an election and entered parliament , was after rajiv gandhi took over , after the tragic assignation of his mother .
we met on september 16th 1984 when he was visiting tamil nadu .
i translated a speech into tamil , then we started chatting and he asked me about delhi , we started chatting about the forthcoming elections - his mother was alive at that time - and the prospects in tamil nadu .
that 's how we got to know each other .
then i got the ticket and i was in parliament .
williams : for people who do n't know india well , just who are the gandhis , how important is that family to the country historically ?
chidambaram : oh they 're very important .
unquestionably the most loved indian of his time was pandit jawaharlal nehru .
mahatma gandhi was of course revered - near god .
but the man who was loved most was pandit jawaharlal nehru and as long as he lived he had complete sway over the people of india .
therefore he had a special place - he has a special place - in india .
his daughter , mrs indira gandhi , and then after her , her son - rajiv gandhi - also enjoyed a great deal of affection .
you see there are many indian political leaders who inspire respect or fear , there are very few who command genuine affection and love - the gandhis are among them .
williams : rajiv gandhi was assassinated on his way to see you , to campaign in your constituency .
chidambaram : he would have been there the next day , he was assassinated the previous night .
williams : how did you hear the news ?
chidambaram : when i was in a village making an election speech , i was told to rush to my campaign headquarters because there was no telephone in that village - i got a message .
i rushed to the campaign headquarters and i got the news over the telephone .
the radio was broadcasting that rajiv gandhi had been killed .
williams : and how did that affect you ?
chidambaram : very , very deeply , a small part of me died at that moment .
if things had gone according to plan i would have been with him on that day , i 'd have been say two feet away from him , it was the only meeting where i was not next to him as a translator , he was visiting tamil nadu , it was 300 kilometres away from my constituency and i had excused myself from that one meeting , promising to join him the next day at the first meeting .
so that 's it .
williams : since you accept , i think , a great debt to the gandhi dynasty and its congress party , what made you decide to turn your back on them and join a breakaway faction ... ?
chidambaram : no we did n't turn our back on the gandhis , we did n't even turn our back on the congress party , we turned our back on a decision made by the then congress leadership to forge a particular alliance with another party , which we detested in tamil nadu , and therefore the bulk of the congress party in tamil nadu broke away and formed a regional party .
but to all intents and purposes we were the congress party in tamil nadu .
williams : so anybody who says - and i 'm sure there are people who do - who say that you turned your back on the gandhis and on congress you 'd dispute that ?
chidambaram : it was completely wrong .
during that period we continued to maintain close relationship with the congress party in delhi , with the gandhis , i continued to be on the rajiv gandhi foundation , i continued to be the head of the foundation .
we were protesting a bad decision taken by the then leadership of the congress party which did not include mrs sonia gandhi .
williams : your son - karti - a businessman - he called that decision - this decision to breakaway - whatever word you 'd like to use - as an extremely big event in your life , changing the direction of your life - is he right ?
chidambaram : well i think he describes it in more enthusiastic terms .
it was a difficult decision to take but a decision which was right and proved to be right .
in the election that followed our alliance swept the polls - we won every one of the seats .
williams : and it certainly gave your political career a boost - you became the minister of finance for the first time .
what was it like when you first took that post , it must have been rather daunting ?
chidambaram : well not quite - i had been promised minister earlier and i 'd worked with the then finance minister dr manmohan singh .
i was of course daunted by the fact that in a coalition , the first genuine coalition government in india , i had become the finance minister .
but the prime minister , then , mr deve gowda , gave me a large degree of liberty and latitude to continue with reformist policies .
williams : you 're doing the job for a second time now and i 've read a great many profiles of you , preparing for this interview , and you 've been called , on a number of occasions , a star .
now ...
chidambaram : a star of what ?
williams : well a star - a star of financial management .
i 've also read quotes by some of your political opponents and i 'm sure you wo n't be surprised to find that they dispute that .
but where do you think this star status comes from , do you think you deserve it ?
chidambaram : no , i do n't aspire to a star status .
i 'm doing a job and i think the government is doing a reasonably good job if you measure in terms of growth .
we have delivered now 7.5 % , 8.4 % and the first half of the current fiscal year 9.1 % .
now that certainly entitles the government to take some credit for doing a good job .
williams : i have a quote , another quote , from your son , karti , which i 'd like to put to you .
he says that you 're unforgiving of failure , very quick on the uptake and at times you do n't appreciate that others do n't get it at once - do you think that 's a fair character judgement from your son - is that what you 're like ?
chidambaram : it was perhaps fair , now i accept more and more that there will be different points of view and some people will not perform as well as you would like them to perform .
williams : that sounds rather - well still rather demanding , are you a demanding man ?
chidambaram : in this job one has to be stern and demanding .
there are any number of people to tell me how to spend money , nobody to tell me how to raise money .
one has to be stern in this job as i 'm sure chancellor gordon brown will tell you .
williams : you 're listening to the interview on the bbc world service .
i 'm mike williams and i 'm glad you could join me and my guest today the finance minister of india palaniappan chidambaram .
mr chidambaram you 've done very well for the indian middle classes , in fact some would argue that you 've helped to invent them , to create them , but poverty remains a stain on your country does n't it .
chidambaram : it is but that proportion is declining , it will continue to decline .
the faster we grow and the more inclusive that growth is , the decline in poverty will be rapid .
i 'm confident we can wipe out poverty by 2040 .
williams : twenty forty - wipe out poverty ?
chidambaram : i think so .
williams : how do you measure that , what do you mean by wipe out poverty ?
chidambaram : well that we will not have the abject poverty that we see , that afflicts about 25 % of india 's population .
people will have homes , work , food , clothing , access to education and medical care .
most indians would have these well before 2040 but i think abject poverty will be wiped out by 2040 .
williams : well it 's a bold - bold promise .
let 's see how you might do it .
you 've always maintained that the best way to combat mass poverty is through free market reforms - why ?
surely the economic reforms that we 've seen so far have actually widened the gap between the richest and the poorest in india ?
chidambaram : let me assume that the gap has widened , perhaps it has .
at the same time those at the bottom of the pyramid have also seen improvement in their lives .
williams : but still some - a third of a million - sorry , forgive me , some third of a billion live in abject poverty .
chidambaram : yeah about 250 million live in poverty .
and the only way that they can be lifted out of poverty is to ensure that they have education , access to healthcare , skills and therefore make them employable or at least self-employed .
that will happen if the economy grows .
the economy does not grow there 's not too much you can share .
williams : but you believe that the effects of that growth will trickle down to the very poorest because what you 've helped to do is to create - well i think there 's something like 300 billionaires now in india , with a vast collective wealth , yet life expectancy is seven years less than china , the un says that infant mortality rates in india are worse than china or even sri lanka - is that the brave new world that you want to create ?
chidambaram : you have to look at these figures and compare them with what they were 10 years ago , what they were 15 years ago .
it is economic growth which has made these figures better today than what they were 15 years ago .
why compare india with china ?
why compare india with sri lanka ?
each country has a different set of problems , a different set of challenges .
the appropriate question to ask is are we coping with these challenges in the best way that we can ?
i believe we are .
can we do more ?
of course we can do more .
we can do more if we use our resources wisely and get the best for every rupee .
when we build a road , when we build homes for poor people , when we roll out a rural health mission , when we roll out the universalisation of education .
i find there is so much waste and leakage .
if i can plug those leakages we will roll out these services far more quickly and far more efficiently to the people who need these services .
williams : do n't you find it painfully slow ?
chidambaram : it is slow but things are improving .
there are differences between state and state , for example the southern states are growing at a very rapid rate and the delivery of services in southern states has improved tremendously .
the western states are also doing very well - punjab and haryana have very low levels of poverty , punjab , for example , is only about 6 % people below the poverty line .
now himachal , delhi , the poverty ratios are very low .
it 's really the hinterland of india , the landlocked states - rajasthan , bihar , uttar pradesh , madhya pradesh , jhark and chhattisgarh where we have a serious problem .
the problem 's really a problem of governance .
we do provide a lot of money but unless governance in these states improve you will not find a major assault on poverty .
even the eastern states are catching up now - orissa , bengal - are all catching up now .
williams : what kind of country is india , what kind of economy does it have - is it a rural country , it is a manufacturing country , is it a service economy - what is it ?
chidambaram : if you go by the traditional classification 54 % of gdp comes from services , 25-26 % comes from industry , the remainder - about 20 % -21 % - comes from agriculture .
williams : that 's now , what about 5-10 years time ?
chidambaram : five , ten years time the services sector will grow and occupy a larger space , industry will perhaps move up a couple of notches , agriculture will move down maybe 3 or 4 % .
but please remember the bulk of the working population is dependent on agriculture which is why it 's important to pay attention to agriculture .
williams : what effect do you think that globalisation is having and will have on indians ?
chidambaram : both positive and negative .
the positive aspects of globalisation will be greater capital flows , greater investment , more trade , more jobs in the services sector , more exports - all that will be positive .
the negative aspects , against which we are guarding against , are the impact on agriculture .
agriculture in india today is a livelihood issue , which is why when we go to the wto we do not look upon agriculture as simply a trading issue , it is a livelihood issue , we have to protect the livelihood of millions of people .
williams : are you worried that globalisation exposes indians to exploitation ?
chidambaram : no not to exploitation , unless we are on our guard , we are on our guard , if the western countries , the developed countries , continue to subsidise agriculture and then seek access to india 's market it will of course immiserise our farming population , we will never let that happen .
williams : when it comes to bringing your population out of poverty your unique selling point , and this is true of other developing nations too , is the cheap labour , now that 's the paradox which you ca n't overcome - the more they earn the less attractive they are to people investing .
chidambaram : much of this is myth , that india 's labour is cheap and therefore we have an advantage .
well china 's labour must therefore be cheaper .
the point is india 's labour is skilled , we are today a major hub for manufacturing - we export textiles , chemicals , pharmaceuticals , leather goods , steel , machine tools , automobile parts , cars - we export mercedes benz cars made in india back to germany .
therefore please do n't believe the story that india 's labour is cheap and that gives us advantage .
india 's labour is indeed cheaper than labour costs elsewhere in the world but india 's labour is also skilled and our comparative advantage comes from a number of factors , one among them being relatively cheaper labour .
williams : do you think that india is undervalued by the world , underestimated as a nation ?
chidambaram : it was , i do n't believe it is anymore .
williams : would you like to see perhaps a seat on the security council , a seat at the top table of international politics ?
chidambaram : i think we 're entitled to - our population , our location , our discharge of responsibilities given to us in the past by the united nations , our role as a peacekeeper and a peacemaker and our economic size i think entitles us to a place on the security council .
williams : do you think a lot of indian politics over the last decades have been devoted to - if not that specific aim - at least raising india 's position in a world of international politics ?
chidambaram : i think our growth story has captured the imagination of the world .
williams : but do you think that indians have felt undervalued in the past ?
chidambaram : they were but i think indians are very confident now , indians travel round the world and come back and tell me that they are heard with respect and they have a place at the high table in most conferences and meetings .
williams : what about you personally - would you like a seat at the top table of indian politics , well you 've already got a seat but how about prime minister chidambaram ?
chidambaram : i 'm quite happy to be finance minister , there are many other things in life to do than be in politics and be a minister .
williams : palaniappan chidambaram thank you very much for talking to all the listeners of the bbc world service and to me here on the interview , thank you very much .

the interviewer is mike williams .
indian finance minister we have the right to grow , just as much as the us and europe had a right to grow in the 19th century palaniappan chidambaram williams : hello and welcome , i 'm mike williams .
my guest today comes from a country that 's home to more than a billion people - india .
it 's the world 's largest democracy , its economy is the second fastest growing in the world .
but despite all of this a third or more of india 's people live in poverty and my guest has the job of managing its economy .
palaniappan chidambaram welcome to the interview .
chidambaram : thank you .
williams : india 's finance minister - that 's a pretty massive job you have , you 've got a big task have n't you .
chidambaram : it 's a challenging task .
williams : what 's most challenging ?
chidambaram : to ensure that the economy grows at no less than 8 % a year .
williams : that 's quite ambitious , that 's i think second only to china is n't it - only china is growing faster than india .
why does growth matter ?
chidambaram : growth is the best antidote to poverty .
growth gives incomes to people who are employed , throws up jobs for those who are not employed .
therefore growth is imperative .
but growth obviously is not sufficient in a country that you introduced a minute ago as a country where a significant proportion lives in poverty the growth must be inclusive growth .
so the task of the government - the task of the finance minister - is to ensure not only growth but that this growth is inclusive growth .
williams : we 'll talk a little bit more about that a little later .
but i suppose my first question is can you sustain this growth , it 's a very , very ambitious target - 8 % or more - can you do it ?
chidambaram : i think we can , we have to do the right things and avoid doing the wrong things .
now what are the right things ?
the right things are one : continue to observe fiscal prudence .
two : ensure that people save and invest and that there is an enabling environment for investors , both domestic and foreign .
and number three : ensure that these investments are made widely , managed wisely , so that they give a return .
if these principles are observed i do n't think it 's difficult in india to sustain a growth rate of no less than 8 % , pushing 9 % , and aiming to go beyond .
williams : you mentioned foreign investment , why do n't foreigners want to invest in india , because they do n't do they - at the moment direct phone investments stands at only 1 % of gdp .
in china , one of your main economic rivals i suppose , the figure 's nine times that ?
chidambaram : well the comparisons are not quite appropriate .
the way china counts fdi is different from the way india counts fdi .
besides overseas chinese investments from hong kong and taiwan are also counted .
be that as it may i can see that china gets much larger doses of foreign investment .
but the foreign investment that will flow into india is also dependent upon our capacity to absorb it .
and our capacity to absorb foreign investment will depend upon our willingness to open up more sectors which are regulated , open them up to foreign investment .
our current account deficit is still very modest - 1.3 % of gdp - we need to expand the current account deficit and absorb foreign direct investment .
this year , for example , 2006-07 , fdi inflows are running 50 % higher than last year .
williams : and do you think foreign investments are scared of the politics of india , are worried about a return to the heavy hand of the state on the economy ?
chidambaram : not at all , no foreign investor in recent years has expressed that worry to me .
what they want to know is whether more sectors which are rather tightly regulated will be available to them .
williams : do n't you risk annoying indians at home when you start liberalising these sectors , when you start opening them up to foreigners , is n't that a political problem for you at home ?
chidambaram : there are some sections which are wary about foreign investment but by and large i think the political establishment , irrespective of the political party , because every political party is running some state government or another , recognises the place of foreign investment .
besides outward foreign investment from india , from indian companies , and the acquisitions made by indian companies have also helped to change the mindset in india .
williams : can india cope with the growth that you say you want , you say you can achieve , what about the country 's infrastructure - its roads , its bridges , its ports , urban centres which ca n't sustain the pace of this growth ?
chidambaram : you 're right but in a sense the deficiencies have been exposed by the rapid rate of growth .
if we were growing at 4 or 5 % these roads , these ports , these airports , would be considered adequate .
so it 's a chicken and egg - we need the growth but the deficiencies of infrastructure become more glaring , therefore we need to grow our infrastructure at the same pace as we grow the rest of the economy , which is why we are putting in a lot of money and we are attracting a lot of money into airports , sea ports , roads , railway , telecommunication , power , petroleum exploration .
williams : tell me about power , do you think you 're going to be able to find the energy supplies to sustain ... ?
chidambaram : there 's an 8 % gap - there 's an 8 % gap between demand and supply today .
i think we 'll overcome this gap in the next five years .
we have just done -lsb- indistinct word -rsb- and ultra mega power project policy and we have given out bids for two such projects by 31st december , we will give out two more by 31st march .
we have no option - we have to overcome this demand / supply gap in power .
williams what do you think when you hear wealthy westerners saying that you should n't do that , you need to curb your energy use to protect the environment ?
chidambaram : well i politely reject that criticism .
when the rest of the world , the developed world , was growing nobody asked them why are you consuming so much energy , nobody asks them today why did n't you slow down and why did n't you consume less energy .
the point is we have a right to grow , just as much as the us and europe had a right to grow in the 19 - in the 20th century .
we have a right to grow , we have a right to consume energy , our carbon emissions are still among the lowest in the world , yet we are willing , as i 've said before , to take our share of responsibility , provided we have access to clean technologies and clean development mechanisms .
williams : you say you answer them politely but does it make you a bit angry when you hear westerners talking to you about your responsibility to the planet ?
chidambaram : no , i think one can be polite and firm .
williams : do you ever look back at your childhood perhaps and say why on earth did i enter politics ?
chidambaram : no , i did as a matter of choice .
i was inspired to enter politics when mrs indira gandhi emerged as the leader .
i came into parliament when mr rajiv gandhi had assumed the office of prime minister .
these are two leaders i respect greatly .
and i 'm in politics but i 'm also secure in the fact that politics is not all that i can do in this world - i can practise law , i can lecture , i can write , i can travel .
williams : and you grew up - you grew up as a businessman really , did n't you , in a business family .
i 'm told that you 're a chettiyar - i hope i said that properly ...
chidambaram : that 's right .
williams : now i have to admit that i do n't know much about the indian caste system , i did n't even know that there was such a thing as a business caste - the chettiyars .
for those like me who do n't understand the system how did that evolve ?
chidambaram : well how did the caste system evolve ?
williams : well particularly the position of the chettiyars , i mean where did the chettiyars come from ?
chidambaram : well the chettiyars are a very small business community but there are hundreds of such communities in different parts of india who are essentially businessmen , as opposed to farmers - traders as opposed to farmers .
the chettiyars are a small business community , they travelled overseas to burma , to malaysia , to sri lanka , to singapore and set up businesses there , largely banking and trading .
so i was born in that community but i have never regarded caste as an important factor , i 've rejected caste .
williams : do you think that being brought up in that tradition though helped you to get to where you are , you must have been surrounded by the vocabulary of trade , of economics , of business when you were younger ?
chidambaram : i think the only thing that that did to me was to send me to business school in harvard rather than law school .
if i had a choice i would have gone to the law school but i went to the business school .
but when i returned from business school i did n't do business i went to practise law .
williams : you trained as a lawyer then , as you said , went to harvard in the united states .
what was it like as an indian studying for an mba in harvard in the 1960s , what do you remember of those times ?
chidambaram : oh we were a rather small and exclusive tribe at that moment , we were four indians in that class , two of them had come from india , the other two were indians who were living in the united states because their parents were living there .
it was quite a challenge - coming from a different school and education system where i suppose by and large one learnt by rote .
harvard business school challenged you to think , to analyse , to argue your positions .
it was quite a challenge but i enjoyed myself .
basically i had a law degree and my aspiration was to be a lawyer .
williams : what do you think you brought back from the united states to india and to indian politics , do you think it made you the reformist that , i think it 's fair to describe you as ?
chidambaram : no when i returned from harvard business school i was still pretty much wedded to socialism .
so harvard business school did not change my political affiliation .
what harvard business school taught me was that accept nothing as a given , challenge everything , ask for data , ask for reason and arguments and be prepared to receive counter arguments .
harvard business school made you think and reason rather than accept conventional wisdom .
williams : you said you returned home as a socialist , you would n't call yourself a socialist now would you ?
chidambaram : no i 've explained that in a recent interview .
i say if you want to define a socialist as one who believes in socialist goals - more equity , more social justice , more opportunity for everyone , care of the aged , care of the disabled , a special place for children and women - yes i 'm a socialist .
but if you ask me do i believe in socialist methods - state controlled policies , state driven economy - i do n't any longer , i believe that a well regulated market is the best guarantor that you will achieve your goals .
williams : let 's talk about your goals , where you came from politically .
it was rajiv gandhi , i believe , who gave you your first big political break in 1984 , tell us how that happened .
chidambaram : well i knew mrs indira gandhi reasonably well , she was very fond of me .
i used to translate her speeches from english to tamil when she visited tamil nadu .
i was the leader of the youth congress in my state when she was the leader of the party .
then i became a general secretary of my state party .
but my first big break , in the sense that i contested an election and entered parliament , was after rajiv gandhi took over , after the tragic assignation of his mother .
we met on september 16th 1984 when he was visiting tamil nadu .
i translated a speech into tamil , then we started chatting and he asked me about delhi , we started chatting about the forthcoming elections - his mother was alive at that time - and the prospects in tamil nadu .
that 's how we got to know each other .
then i got the ticket and i was in parliament .
williams : for people who do n't know india well , just who are the gandhis , how important is that family to the country historically ?
chidambaram : oh they 're very important .
unquestionably the most loved indian of his time was pandit jawaharlal nehru .
mahatma gandhi was of course revered - near god .
but the man who was loved most was pandit jawaharlal nehru and as long as he lived he had complete sway over the people of india .
therefore he had a special place - he has a special place - in india .
his daughter , mrs indira gandhi , and then after her , her son - rajiv gandhi - also enjoyed a great deal of affection .
you see there are many indian political leaders who inspire respect or fear , there are very few who command genuine affection and love - the gandhis are among them .
williams : rajiv gandhi was assassinated on his way to see you , to campaign in your constituency .
chidambaram : he would have been there the next day , he was assassinated the previous night .
williams : how did you hear the news ?
chidambaram : when i was in a village making an election speech , i was told to rush to my campaign headquarters because there was no telephone in that village - i got a message .
i rushed to the campaign headquarters and i got the news over the telephone .
the radio was broadcasting that rajiv gandhi had been killed .
williams : and how did that affect you ?
chidambaram : very , very deeply , a small part of me died at that moment .
if things had gone according to plan i would have been with him on that day , i 'd have been say two feet away from him , it was the only meeting where i was not next to him as a translator , he was visiting tamil nadu , it was 300 kilometres away from my constituency and i had excused myself from that one meeting , promising to join him the next day at the first meeting .
so that 's it .
williams : since you accept , i think , a great debt to the gandhi dynasty and its congress party , what made you decide to turn your back on them and join a breakaway faction ... ?
chidambaram : no we did n't turn our back on the gandhis , we did n't even turn our back on the congress party , we turned our back on a decision made by the then congress leadership to forge a particular alliance with another party , which we detested in tamil nadu , and therefore the bulk of the congress party in tamil nadu broke away and formed a regional party .
but to all intents and purposes we were the congress party in tamil nadu .
williams : so anybody who says - and i 'm sure there are people who do - who say that you turned your back on the gandhis and on congress you 'd dispute that ?
chidambaram : it was completely wrong .
during that period we continued to maintain close relationship with the congress party in delhi , with the gandhis , i continued to be on the rajiv gandhi foundation , i continued to be the head of the foundation .
we were protesting a bad decision taken by the then leadership of the congress party which did not include mrs sonia gandhi .
williams : your son - karti - a businessman - he called that decision - this decision to breakaway - whatever word you 'd like to use - as an extremely big event in your life , changing the direction of your life - is he right ?
chidambaram : well i think he describes it in more enthusiastic terms .
it was a difficult decision to take but a decision which was right and proved to be right .
in the election that followed our alliance swept the polls - we won every one of the seats .
williams : and it certainly gave your political career a boost - you became the minister of finance for the first time .
what was it like when you first took that post , it must have been rather daunting ?
chidambaram : well not quite - i had been promised minister earlier and i 'd worked with the then finance minister dr manmohan singh .
i was of course daunted by the fact that in a coalition , the first genuine coalition government in india , i had become the finance minister .
but the prime minister , then , mr deve gowda , gave me a large degree of liberty and latitude to continue with reformist policies .
williams : you 're doing the job for a second time now and i 've read a great many profiles of you , preparing for this interview , and you 've been called , on a number of occasions , a star .
now ...
chidambaram : a star of what ?
williams : well a star - a star of financial management .
i 've also read quotes by some of your political opponents and i 'm sure you wo n't be surprised to find that they dispute that .
but where do you think this star status comes from , do you think you deserve it ?
chidambaram : no , i do n't aspire to a star status .
i 'm doing a job and i think the government is doing a reasonably good job if you measure in terms of growth .
we have delivered now 7.5 % , 8.4 % and the first half of the current fiscal year 9.1 % .
now that certainly entitles the government to take some credit for doing a good job .
williams : i have a quote , another quote , from your son , karti , which i 'd like to put to you .
he says that you 're unforgiving of failure , very quick on the uptake and at times you do n't appreciate that others do n't get it at once - do you think that 's a fair character judgement from your son - is that what you 're like ?
chidambaram : it was perhaps fair , now i accept more and more that there will be different points of view and some people will not perform as well as you would like them to perform .
williams : that sounds rather - well still rather demanding , are you a demanding man ?
chidambaram : in this job one has to be stern and demanding .
there are any number of people to tell me how to spend money , nobody to tell me how to raise money .
one has to be stern in this job as i 'm sure chancellor gordon brown will tell you .
williams : you 're listening to the interview on the bbc world service .
i 'm mike williams and i 'm glad you could join me and my guest today the finance minister of india palaniappan chidambaram .
mr chidambaram you 've done very well for the indian middle classes , in fact some would argue that you 've helped to invent them , to create them , but poverty remains a stain on your country does n't it .
chidambaram : it is but that proportion is declining , it will continue to decline .
the faster we grow and the more inclusive that growth is , the decline in poverty will be rapid .
i 'm confident we can wipe out poverty by 2040 .
williams : twenty forty - wipe out poverty ?
chidambaram : i think so .
williams : how do you measure that , what do you mean by wipe out poverty ?
chidambaram : well that we will not have the abject poverty that we see , that afflicts about 25 % of india 's population .
people will have homes , work , food , clothing , access to education and medical care .
most indians would have these well before 2040 but i think abject poverty will be wiped out by 2040 .
williams : well it 's a bold - bold promise .
let 's see how you might do it .
you 've always maintained that the best way to combat mass poverty is through free market reforms - why ?
surely the economic reforms that we 've seen so far have actually widened the gap between the richest and the poorest in india ?
chidambaram : let me assume that the gap has widened , perhaps it has .
at the same time those at the bottom of the pyramid have also seen improvement in their lives .
williams : but still some - a third of a million - sorry , forgive me , some third of a billion live in abject poverty .
chidambaram : yeah about 250 million live in poverty .
and the only way that they can be lifted out of poverty is to ensure that they have education , access to healthcare , skills and therefore make them employable or at least self-employed .
that will happen if the economy grows .
the economy does not grow there 's not too much you can share .
williams : but you believe that the effects of that growth will trickle down to the very poorest because what you 've helped to do is to create - well i think there 's something like 300 billionaires now in india , with a vast collective wealth , yet life expectancy is seven years less than china , the un says that infant mortality rates in india are worse than china or even sri lanka - is that the brave new world that you want to create ?
chidambaram : you have to look at these figures and compare them with what they were 10 years ago , what they were 15 years ago .
it is economic growth which has made these figures better today than what they were 15 years ago .
why compare india with china ?
why compare india with sri lanka ?
each country has a different set of problems , a different set of challenges .
the appropriate question to ask is are we coping with these challenges in the best way that we can ?
i believe we are .
can we do more ?
of course we can do more .
we can do more if we use our resources wisely and get the best for every rupee .
when we build a road , when we build homes for poor people , when we roll out a rural health mission , when we roll out the universalisation of education .
i find there is so much waste and leakage .
if i can plug those leakages we will roll out these services far more quickly and far more efficiently to the people who need these services .
williams : do n't you find it painfully slow ?
chidambaram : it is slow but things are improving .
there are differences between state and state , for example the southern states are growing at a very rapid rate and the delivery of services in southern states has improved tremendously .
the western states are also doing very well - punjab and haryana have very low levels of poverty , punjab , for example , is only about 6 % people below the poverty line .
now himachal , delhi , the poverty ratios are very low .
it 's really the hinterland of india , the landlocked states - rajasthan , bihar , uttar pradesh , madhya pradesh , jhark and chhattisgarh where we have a serious problem .
the problem 's really a problem of governance .
we do provide a lot of money but unless governance in these states improve you will not find a major assault on poverty .
even the eastern states are catching up now - orissa , bengal - are all catching up now .
williams : what kind of country is india , what kind of economy does it have - is it a rural country , it is a manufacturing country , is it a service economy - what is it ?
chidambaram : if you go by the traditional classification 54 % of gdp comes from services , 25-26 % comes from industry , the remainder - about 20 % -21 % - comes from agriculture .
williams : that 's now , what about 5-10 years time ?
chidambaram : five , ten years time the services sector will grow and occupy a larger space , industry will perhaps move up a couple of notches , agriculture will move down maybe 3 or 4 % .
but please remember the bulk of the working population is dependent on agriculture which is why it 's important to pay attention to agriculture .
williams : what effect do you think that globalisation is having and will have on indians ?
chidambaram : both positive and negative .
the positive aspects of globalisation will be greater capital flows , greater investment , more trade , more jobs in the services sector , more exports - all that will be positive .
the negative aspects , against which we are guarding against , are the impact on agriculture .
agriculture in india today is a livelihood issue , which is why when we go to the wto we do not look upon agriculture as simply a trading issue , it is a livelihood issue , we have to protect the livelihood of millions of people .
williams : are you worried that globalisation exposes indians to exploitation ?
chidambaram : no not to exploitation , unless we are on our guard , we are on our guard , if the western countries , the developed countries , continue to subsidise agriculture and then seek access to india 's market it will of course immiserise our farming population , we will never let that happen .
williams : when it comes to bringing your population out of poverty your unique selling point , and this is true of other developing nations too , is the cheap labour , now that 's the paradox which you ca n't overcome - the more they earn the less attractive they are to people investing .
chidambaram : much of this is myth , that india 's labour is cheap and therefore we have an advantage .
well china 's labour must therefore be cheaper .
the point is india 's labour is skilled , we are today a major hub for manufacturing - we export textiles , chemicals , pharmaceuticals , leather goods , steel , machine tools , automobile parts , cars - we export mercedes benz cars made in india back to germany .
therefore please do n't believe the story that india 's labour is cheap and that gives us advantage .
india 's labour is indeed cheaper than labour costs elsewhere in the world but india 's labour is also skilled and our comparative advantage comes from a number of factors , one among them being relatively cheaper labour .
williams : do you think that india is undervalued by the world , underestimated as a nation ?
chidambaram : it was , i do n't believe it is anymore .
williams : would you like to see perhaps a seat on the security council , a seat at the top table of international politics ?
chidambaram : i think we 're entitled to - our population , our location , our discharge of responsibilities given to us in the past by the united nations , our role as a peacekeeper and a peacemaker and our economic size i think entitles us to a place on the security council .
williams : do you think a lot of indian politics over the last decades have been devoted to - if not that specific aim - at least raising india 's position in a world of international politics ?
chidambaram : i think our growth story has captured the imagination of the world .
williams : but do you think that indians have felt undervalued in the past ?
chidambaram : they were but i think indians are very confident now , indians travel round the world and come back and tell me that they are heard with respect and they have a place at the high table in most conferences and meetings .
williams : what about you personally - would you like a seat at the top table of indian politics , well you 've already got a seat but how about prime minister chidambaram ?
chidambaram : i 'm quite happy to be finance minister , there are many other things in life to do than be in politics and be a minister .
williams : palaniappan chidambaram thank you very much for talking to all the listeners of the bbc world service and to me here on the interview , thank you very much .

the interviewer is mike williams .
indian finance minister we have the right to grow , just as much as the us and europe had a right to grow in the 19th century palaniappan chidambaram williams : hello and welcome , i 'm mike williams .
my guest today comes from a country that 's home to more than a billion people - india .
it 's the world 's largest democracy , its economy is the second fastest growing in the world .
but despite all of this a third or more of india 's people live in poverty and my guest has the job of managing its economy .
palaniappan chidambaram welcome to the interview .
chidambaram : thank you .
williams : india 's finance minister - that 's a pretty massive job you have , you 've got a big task have n't you .
chidambaram : it 's a challenging task .
williams : what 's most challenging ?
chidambaram : to ensure that the economy grows at no less than 8 % a year .
williams : that 's quite ambitious , that 's i think second only to china is n't it - only china is growing faster than india .
why does growth matter ?
chidambaram : growth is the best antidote to poverty .
growth gives incomes to people who are employed , throws up jobs for those who are not employed .
therefore growth is imperative .
but growth obviously is not sufficient in a country that you introduced a minute ago as a country where a significant proportion lives in poverty the growth must be inclusive growth .
so the task of the government - the task of the finance minister - is to ensure not only growth but that this growth is inclusive growth .
williams : we 'll talk a little bit more about that a little later .
but i suppose my first question is can you sustain this growth , it 's a very , very ambitious target - 8 % or more - can you do it ?
chidambaram : i think we can , we have to do the right things and avoid doing the wrong things .
now what are the right things ?
the right things are one : continue to observe fiscal prudence .
two : ensure that people save and invest and that there is an enabling environment for investors , both domestic and foreign .
and number three : ensure that these investments are made widely , managed wisely , so that they give a return .
if these principles are observed i do n't think it 's difficult in india to sustain a growth rate of no less than 8 % , pushing 9 % , and aiming to go beyond .
williams : you mentioned foreign investment , why do n't foreigners want to invest in india , because they do n't do they - at the moment direct phone investments stands at only 1 % of gdp .
in china , one of your main economic rivals i suppose , the figure 's nine times that ?
chidambaram : well the comparisons are not quite appropriate .
the way china counts fdi is different from the way india counts fdi .
besides overseas chinese investments from hong kong and taiwan are also counted .
be that as it may i can see that china gets much larger doses of foreign investment .
but the foreign investment that will flow into india is also dependent upon our capacity to absorb it .
and our capacity to absorb foreign investment will depend upon our willingness to open up more sectors which are regulated , open them up to foreign investment .
our current account deficit is still very modest - 1.3 % of gdp - we need to expand the current account deficit and absorb foreign direct investment .
this year , for example , 2006-07 , fdi inflows are running 50 % higher than last year .
williams : and do you think foreign investments are scared of the politics of india , are worried about a return to the heavy hand of the state on the economy ?
chidambaram : not at all , no foreign investor in recent years has expressed that worry to me .
what they want to know is whether more sectors which are rather tightly regulated will be available to them .
williams : do n't you risk annoying indians at home when you start liberalising these sectors , when you start opening them up to foreigners , is n't that a political problem for you at home ?
chidambaram : there are some sections which are wary about foreign investment but by and large i think the political establishment , irrespective of the political party , because every political party is running some state government or another , recognises the place of foreign investment .
besides outward foreign investment from india , from indian companies , and the acquisitions made by indian companies have also helped to change the mindset in india .
williams : can india cope with the growth that you say you want , you say you can achieve , what about the country 's infrastructure - its roads , its bridges , its ports , urban centres which ca n't sustain the pace of this growth ?
chidambaram : you 're right but in a sense the deficiencies have been exposed by the rapid rate of growth .
if we were growing at 4 or 5 % these roads , these ports , these airports , would be considered adequate .
so it 's a chicken and egg - we need the growth but the deficiencies of infrastructure become more glaring , therefore we need to grow our infrastructure at the same pace as we grow the rest of the economy , which is why we are putting in a lot of money and we are attracting a lot of money into airports , sea ports , roads , railway , telecommunication , power , petroleum exploration .
williams : tell me about power , do you think you 're going to be able to find the energy supplies to sustain ... ?
chidambaram : there 's an 8 % gap - there 's an 8 % gap between demand and supply today .
i think we 'll overcome this gap in the next five years .
we have just done -lsb- indistinct word -rsb- and ultra mega power project policy and we have given out bids for two such projects by 31st december , we will give out two more by 31st march .
we have no option - we have to overcome this demand / supply gap in power .
williams what do you think when you hear wealthy westerners saying that you should n't do that , you need to curb your energy use to protect the environment ?
chidambaram : well i politely reject that criticism .
when the rest of the world , the developed world , was growing nobody asked them why are you consuming so much energy , nobody asks them today why did n't you slow down and why did n't you consume less energy .
the point is we have a right to grow , just as much as the us and europe had a right to grow in the 19 - in the 20th century .
we have a right to grow , we have a right to consume energy , our carbon emissions are still among the lowest in the world , yet we are willing , as i 've said before , to take our share of responsibility , provided we have access to clean technologies and clean development mechanisms .
williams : you say you answer them politely but does it make you a bit angry when you hear westerners talking to you about your responsibility to the planet ?
chidambaram : no , i think one can be polite and firm .
williams : do you ever look back at your childhood perhaps and say why on earth did i enter politics ?
chidambaram : no , i did as a matter of choice .
i was inspired to enter politics when mrs indira gandhi emerged as the leader .
i came into parliament when mr rajiv gandhi had assumed the office of prime minister .
these are two leaders i respect greatly .
and i 'm in politics but i 'm also secure in the fact that politics is not all that i can do in this world - i can practise law , i can lecture , i can write , i can travel .
williams : and you grew up - you grew up as a businessman really , did n't you , in a business family .
i 'm told that you 're a chettiyar - i hope i said that properly ...
chidambaram : that 's right .
williams : now i have to admit that i do n't know much about the indian caste system , i did n't even know that there was such a thing as a business caste - the chettiyars .
for those like me who do n't understand the system how did that evolve ?
chidambaram : well how did the caste system evolve ?
williams : well particularly the position of the chettiyars , i mean where did the chettiyars come from ?
chidambaram : well the chettiyars are a very small business community but there are hundreds of such communities in different parts of india who are essentially businessmen , as opposed to farmers - traders as opposed to farmers .
the chettiyars are a small business community , they travelled overseas to burma , to malaysia , to sri lanka , to singapore and set up businesses there , largely banking and trading .
so i was born in that community but i have never regarded caste as an important factor , i 've rejected caste .
williams : do you think that being brought up in that tradition though helped you to get to where you are , you must have been surrounded by the vocabulary of trade , of economics , of business when you were younger ?
chidambaram : i think the only thing that that did to me was to send me to business school in harvard rather than law school .
if i had a choice i would have gone to the law school but i went to the business school .
but when i returned from business school i did n't do business i went to practise law .
williams : you trained as a lawyer then , as you said , went to harvard in the united states .
what was it like as an indian studying for an mba in harvard in the 1960s , what do you remember of those times ?

it was quite a challenge - coming from a different school and education system where i suppose by and large one learnt by rote .
harvard business school challenged you to think , to analyse , to argue your positions .
it was quite a challenge but i enjoyed myself .
basically i had a law degree and my aspiration was to be a lawyer .
williams : what do you think you brought back from the united states to india and to indian politics , do you think it made you the reformist that , i think it 's fair to describe you as ?
chidambaram : no when i returned from harvard business school i was still pretty much wedded to socialism .
so harvard business school did not change my political affiliation .
what harvard business school taught me was that accept nothing as a given , challenge everything , ask for data , ask for reason and arguments and be prepared to receive counter arguments .
harvard business school made you think and reason rather than accept conventional wisdom .
williams : you said you returned home as a socialist , you would n't call yourself a socialist now would you ?
chidambaram : no i 've explained that in a recent interview .
i say if you want to define a socialist as one who believes in socialist goals - more equity , more social justice , more opportunity for everyone , care of the aged , care of the disabled , a special place for children and women - yes i 'm a socialist .
but if you ask me do i believe in socialist methods - state controlled policies , state driven economy - i do n't any longer , i believe that a well regulated market is the best guarantor that you will achieve your goals .
williams : let 's talk about your goals , where you came from politically .
it was rajiv gandhi , i believe , who gave you your first big political break in 1984 , tell us how that happened .
chidambaram : well i knew mrs indira gandhi reasonably well , she was very fond of me .
i used to translate her speeches from english to tamil when she visited tamil nadu .
i was the leader of the youth congress in my state when she was the leader of the party .

that 's how we got to know each other .
then i got the ticket and i was in parliament .
williams : for people who do n't know india well , just who are the gandhis , how important is that family to the country historically ?
chidambaram : oh they 're very important .
unquestionably the most loved indian of his time was pandit jawaharlal nehru .
mahatma gandhi was of course revered - near god .
but the man who was loved most was pandit jawaharlal nehru and as long as he lived he had complete sway over the people of india .
therefore he had a special place - he has a special place - in india .
his daughter , mrs indira gandhi , and then after her , her son - rajiv gandhi - also enjoyed a great deal of affection .
you see there are many indian political leaders who inspire respect or fear , there are very few who command genuine affection and love - the gandhis are among them .
williams : rajiv gandhi was assassinated on his way to see you , to campaign in your constituency .
chidambaram : he would have been there the next day , he was assassinated the previous night .
williams : how did you hear the news ?
chidambaram : when i was in a village making an election speech , i was told to rush to my campaign headquarters because there was no telephone in that village - i got a message .
i rushed to the campaign headquarters and i got the news over the telephone .
the radio was broadcasting that rajiv gandhi had been killed .
williams : and how did that affect you ?
chidambaram : very , very deeply , a small part of me died at that moment .
if things had gone according to plan i would have been with him on that day , i 'd have been say two feet away from him , it was the only meeting where i was not next to him as a translator , he was visiting tamil nadu , it was 300 kilometres away from my constituency and i had excused myself from that one meeting , promising to join him the next day at the first meeting .
so that 's it .
williams : since you accept , i think , a great debt to the gandhi dynasty and its congress party , what made you decide to turn your back on them and join a breakaway faction ... ?
chidambaram : no we did n't turn our back on the gandhis , we did n't even turn our back on the congress party , we turned our back on a decision made by the then congress leadership to forge a particular alliance with another party , which we detested in tamil nadu , and therefore the bulk of the congress party in tamil nadu broke away and formed a regional party .
but to all intents and purposes we were the congress party in tamil nadu .
williams : so anybody who says - and i 'm sure there are people who do - who say that you turned your back on the gandhis and on congress you 'd dispute that ?
chidambaram : it was completely wrong .
during that period we continued to maintain close relationship with the congress party in delhi , with the gandhis , i continued to be on the rajiv gandhi foundation , i continued to be the head of the foundation .
we were protesting a bad decision taken by the then leadership of the congress party which did not include mrs sonia gandhi .
williams : your son - karti - a businessman - he called that decision - this decision to breakaway - whatever word you 'd like to use - as an extremely big event in your life , changing the direction of your life - is he right ?
chidambaram : well i think he describes it in more enthusiastic terms .
it was a difficult decision to take but a decision which was right and proved to be right .
in the election that followed our alliance swept the polls - we won every one of the seats .
williams : and it certainly gave your political career a boost - you became the minister of finance for the first time .
what was it like when you first took that post , it must have been rather daunting ?
chidambaram : well not quite - i had been promised minister earlier and i 'd worked with the then finance minister dr manmohan singh .
i was of course daunted by the fact that in a coalition , the first genuine coalition government in india , i had become the finance minister .
but the prime minister , then , mr deve gowda , gave me a large degree of liberty and latitude to continue with reformist policies .
williams : you 're doing the job for a second time now and i 've read a great many profiles of you , preparing for this interview , and you 've been called , on a number of occasions , a star .
now ...
chidambaram : a star of what ?
williams : well a star - a star of financial management .
i 've also read quotes by some of your political opponents and i 'm sure you wo n't be surprised to find that they dispute that .
but where do you think this star status comes from , do you think you deserve it ?
chidambaram : no , i do n't aspire to a star status .
i 'm doing a job and i think the government is doing a reasonably good job if you measure in terms of growth .
we have delivered now 7.5 % , 8.4 % and the first half of the current fiscal year 9.1 % .
now that certainly entitles the government to take some credit for doing a good job .
williams : i have a quote , another quote , from your son , karti , which i 'd like to put to you .
he says that you 're unforgiving of failure , very quick on the uptake and at times you do n't appreciate that others do n't get it at once - do you think that 's a fair character judgement from your son - is that what you 're like ?
chidambaram : it was perhaps fair , now i accept more and more that there will be different points of view and some people will not perform as well as you would like them to perform .
williams : that sounds rather - well still rather demanding , are you a demanding man ?
chidambaram : in this job one has to be stern and demanding .
there are any number of people to tell me how to spend money , nobody to tell me how to raise money .
one has to be stern in this job as i 'm sure chancellor gordon brown will tell you .
williams : you 're listening to the interview on the bbc world service .
i 'm mike williams and i 'm glad you could join me and my guest today the finance minister of india palaniappan chidambaram .
mr chidambaram you 've done very well for the indian middle classes , in fact some would argue that you 've helped to invent them , to create them , but poverty remains a stain on your country does n't it .
chidambaram : it is but that proportion is declining , it will continue to decline .
the faster we grow and the more inclusive that growth is , the decline in poverty will be rapid .
i 'm confident we can wipe out poverty by 2040 .
williams : twenty forty - wipe out poverty ?
chidambaram : i think so .
williams : how do you measure that , what do you mean by wipe out poverty ?
chidambaram : well that we will not have the abject poverty that we see , that afflicts about 25 % of india 's population .
people will have homes , work , food , clothing , access to education and medical care .
most indians would have these well before 2040 but i think abject poverty will be wiped out by 2040 .
williams : well it 's a bold - bold promise .
let 's see how you might do it .
you 've always maintained that the best way to combat mass poverty is through free market reforms - why ?
surely the economic reforms that we 've seen so far have actually widened the gap between the richest and the poorest in india ?
chidambaram : let me assume that the gap has widened , perhaps it has .
at the same time those at the bottom of the pyramid have also seen improvement in their lives .
williams : but still some - a third of a million - sorry , forgive me , some third of a billion live in abject poverty .
chidambaram : yeah about 250 million live in poverty .
and the only way that they can be lifted out of poverty is to ensure that they have education , access to healthcare , skills and therefore make them employable or at least self-employed .
that will happen if the economy grows .
the economy does not grow there 's not too much you can share .
williams : but you believe that the effects of that growth will trickle down to the very poorest because what you 've helped to do is to create - well i think there 's something like 300 billionaires now in india , with a vast collective wealth , yet life expectancy is seven years less than china , the un says that infant mortality rates in india are worse than china or even sri lanka - is that the brave new world that you want to create ?
chidambaram : you have to look at these figures and compare them with what they were 10 years ago , what they were 15 years ago .
it is economic growth which has made these figures better today than what they were 15 years ago .
why compare india with china ?
why compare india with sri lanka ?
each country has a different set of problems , a different set of challenges .
the appropriate question to ask is are we coping with these challenges in the best way that we can ?
i believe we are .
can we do more ?
of course we can do more .
we can do more if we use our resources wisely and get the best for every rupee .
when we build a road , when we build homes for poor people , when we roll out a rural health mission , when we roll out the universalisation of education .
i find there is so much waste and leakage .
if i can plug those leakages we will roll out these services far more quickly and far more efficiently to the people who need these services .
williams : do n't you find it painfully slow ?
chidambaram : it is slow but things are improving .
there are differences between state and state , for example the southern states are growing at a very rapid rate and the delivery of services in southern states has improved tremendously .
the western states are also doing very well - punjab and haryana have very low levels of poverty , punjab , for example , is only about 6 % people below the poverty line .
now himachal , delhi , the poverty ratios are very low .
it 's really the hinterland of india , the landlocked states - rajasthan , bihar , uttar pradesh , madhya pradesh , jhark and chhattisgarh where we have a serious problem .
the problem 's really a problem of governance .
we do provide a lot of money but unless governance in these states improve you will not find a major assault on poverty .
even the eastern states are catching up now - orissa , bengal - are all catching up now .
williams : what kind of country is india , what kind of economy does it have - is it a rural country , it is a manufacturing country , is it a service economy - what is it ?
chidambaram : if you go by the traditional classification 54 % of gdp comes from services , 25-26 % comes from industry , the remainder - about 20 % -21 % - comes from agriculture .
williams : that 's now , what about 5-10 years time ?
chidambaram : five , ten years time the services sector will grow and occupy a larger space , industry will perhaps move up a couple of notches , agriculture will move down maybe 3 or 4 % .
but please remember the bulk of the working population is dependent on agriculture which is why it 's important to pay attention to agriculture .
williams : what effect do you think that globalisation is having and will have on indians ?
chidambaram : both positive and negative .
the positive aspects of globalisation will be greater capital flows , greater investment , more trade , more jobs in the services sector , more exports - all that will be positive .
the negative aspects , against which we are guarding against , are the impact on agriculture .
agriculture in india today is a livelihood issue , which is why when we go to the wto we do not look upon agriculture as simply a trading issue , it is a livelihood issue , we have to protect the livelihood of millions of people .
williams : are you worried that globalisation exposes indians to exploitation ?
chidambaram : no not to exploitation , unless we are on our guard , we are on our guard , if the western countries , the developed countries , continue to subsidise agriculture and then seek access to india 's market it will of course immiserise our farming population , we will never let that happen .
williams : when it comes to bringing your population out of poverty your unique selling point , and this is true of other developing nations too , is the cheap labour , now that 's the paradox which you ca n't overcome - the more they earn the less attractive they are to people investing .
chidambaram : much of this is myth , that india 's labour is cheap and therefore we have an advantage .
well china 's labour must therefore be cheaper .
the point is india 's labour is skilled , we are today a major hub for manufacturing - we export textiles , chemicals , pharmaceuticals , leather goods , steel , machine tools , automobile parts , cars - we export mercedes benz cars made in india back to germany .
therefore please do n't believe the story that india 's labour is cheap and that gives us advantage .
india 's labour is indeed cheaper than labour costs elsewhere in the world but india 's labour is also skilled and our comparative advantage comes from a number of factors , one among them being relatively cheaper labour .
williams : do you think that india is undervalued by the world , underestimated as a nation ?
chidambaram : it was , i do n't believe it is anymore .
williams : would you like to see perhaps a seat on the security council , a seat at the top table of international politics ?
chidambaram : i think we 're entitled to - our population , our location , our discharge of responsibilities given to us in the past by the united nations , our role as a peacekeeper and a peacemaker and our economic size i think entitles us to a place on the security council .
williams : do you think a lot of indian politics over the last decades have been devoted to - if not that specific aim - at least raising india 's position in a world of international politics ?
chidambaram : i think our growth story has captured the imagination of the world .
williams : but do you think that indians have felt undervalued in the past ?
chidambaram : they were but i think indians are very confident now , indians travel round the world and come back and tell me that they are heard with respect and they have a place at the high table in most conferences and meetings .
williams : what about you personally - would you like a seat at the top table of indian politics , well you 've already got a seat but how about prime minister chidambaram ?
chidambaram : i 'm quite happy to be finance minister , there are many other things in life to do than be in politics and be a minister .
williams : palaniappan chidambaram thank you very much for talking to all the listeners of the bbc world service and to me here on the interview , thank you very much .

the interviewer is mike williams .
indian finance minister we have the right to grow , just as much as the us and europe had a right to grow in the 19th century palaniappan chidambaram williams : hello and welcome , i 'm mike williams .
my guest today comes from a country that 's home to more than a billion people - india .
it 's the world 's largest democracy , its economy is the second fastest growing in the world .
but despite all of this a third or more of india 's people live in poverty and my guest has the job of managing its economy .
palaniappan chidambaram welcome to the interview .
chidambaram : thank you .
williams : india 's finance minister - that 's a pretty massive job you have , you 've got a big task have n't you .
chidambaram : it 's a challenging task .
williams : what 's most challenging ?
chidambaram : to ensure that the economy grows at no less than 8 % a year .
williams : that 's quite ambitious , that 's i think second only to china is n't it - only china is growing faster than india .
why does growth matter ?
chidambaram : growth is the best antidote to poverty .
growth gives incomes to people who are employed , throws up jobs for those who are not employed .
therefore growth is imperative .
but growth obviously is not sufficient in a country that you introduced a minute ago as a country where a significant proportion lives in poverty the growth must be inclusive growth .
so the task of the government - the task of the finance minister - is to ensure not only growth but that this growth is inclusive growth .
williams : we 'll talk a little bit more about that a little later .
but i suppose my first question is can you sustain this growth , it 's a very , very ambitious target - 8 % or more - can you do it ?
chidambaram : i think we can , we have to do the right things and avoid doing the wrong things .
now what are the right things ?
the right things are one : continue to observe fiscal prudence .
two : ensure that people save and invest and that there is an enabling environment for investors , both domestic and foreign .
and number three : ensure that these investments are made widely , managed wisely , so that they give a return .
if these principles are observed i do n't think it 's difficult in india to sustain a growth rate of no less than 8 % , pushing 9 % , and aiming to go beyond .
williams : you mentioned foreign investment , why do n't foreigners want to invest in india , because they do n't do they - at the moment direct phone investments stands at only 1 % of gdp .
in china , one of your main economic rivals i suppose , the figure 's nine times that ?
chidambaram : well the comparisons are not quite appropriate .
the way china counts fdi is different from the way india counts fdi .
besides overseas chinese investments from hong kong and taiwan are also counted .
be that as it may i can see that china gets much larger doses of foreign investment .
but the foreign investment that will flow into india is also dependent upon our capacity to absorb it .
and our capacity to absorb foreign investment will depend upon our willingness to open up more sectors which are regulated , open them up to foreign investment .
our current account deficit is still very modest - 1.3 % of gdp - we need to expand the current account deficit and absorb foreign direct investment .
this year , for example , 2006-07 , fdi inflows are running 50 % higher than last year .
williams : and do you think foreign investments are scared of the politics of india , are worried about a return to the heavy hand of the state on the economy ?
chidambaram : not at all , no foreign investor in recent years has expressed that worry to me .
what they want to know is whether more sectors which are rather tightly regulated will be available to them .
williams : do n't you risk annoying indians at home when you start liberalising these sectors , when you start opening them up to foreigners , is n't that a political problem for you at home ?
chidambaram : there are some sections which are wary about foreign investment but by and large i think the political establishment , irrespective of the political party , because every political party is running some state government or another , recognises the place of foreign investment .
besides outward foreign investment from india , from indian companies , and the acquisitions made by indian companies have also helped to change the mindset in india .
williams : can india cope with the growth that you say you want , you say you can achieve , what about the country 's infrastructure - its roads , its bridges , its ports , urban centres which ca n't sustain the pace of this growth ?
chidambaram : you 're right but in a sense the deficiencies have been exposed by the rapid rate of growth .
if we were growing at 4 or 5 % these roads , these ports , these airports , would be considered adequate .
so it 's a chicken and egg - we need the growth but the deficiencies of infrastructure become more glaring , therefore we need to grow our infrastructure at the same pace as we grow the rest of the economy , which is why we are putting in a lot of money and we are attracting a lot of money into airports , sea ports , roads , railway , telecommunication , power , petroleum exploration .
williams : tell me about power , do you think you 're going to be able to find the energy supplies to sustain ... ?
chidambaram : there 's an 8 % gap - there 's an 8 % gap between demand and supply today .
i think we 'll overcome this gap in the next five years .
we have just done -lsb- indistinct word -rsb- and ultra mega power project policy and we have given out bids for two such projects by 31st december , we will give out two more by 31st march .
we have no option - we have to overcome this demand / supply gap in power .
williams what do you think when you hear wealthy westerners saying that you should n't do that , you need to curb your energy use to protect the environment ?
chidambaram : well i politely reject that criticism .
when the rest of the world , the developed world , was growing nobody asked them why are you consuming so much energy , nobody asks them today why did n't you slow down and why did n't you consume less energy .
the point is we have a right to grow , just as much as the us and europe had a right to grow in the 19 - in the 20th century .
we have a right to grow , we have a right to consume energy , our carbon emissions are still among the lowest in the world , yet we are willing , as i 've said before , to take our share of responsibility , provided we have access to clean technologies and clean development mechanisms .
williams : you say you answer them politely but does it make you a bit angry when you hear westerners talking to you about your responsibility to the planet ?
chidambaram : no , i think one can be polite and firm .
williams : do you ever look back at your childhood perhaps and say why on earth did i enter politics ?
chidambaram : no , i did as a matter of choice .
i was inspired to enter politics when mrs indira gandhi emerged as the leader .
i came into parliament when mr rajiv gandhi had assumed the office of prime minister .
these are two leaders i respect greatly .
and i 'm in politics but i 'm also secure in the fact that politics is not all that i can do in this world - i can practise law , i can lecture , i can write , i can travel .
williams : and you grew up - you grew up as a businessman really , did n't you , in a business family .
i 'm told that you 're a chettiyar - i hope i said that properly ...
chidambaram : that 's right .
williams : now i have to admit that i do n't know much about the indian caste system , i did n't even know that there was such a thing as a business caste - the chettiyars .
for those like me who do n't understand the system how did that evolve ?
chidambaram : well how did the caste system evolve ?
williams : well particularly the position of the chettiyars , i mean where did the chettiyars come from ?
chidambaram : well the chettiyars are a very small business community but there are hundreds of such communities in different parts of india who are essentially businessmen , as opposed to farmers - traders as opposed to farmers .
the chettiyars are a small business community , they travelled overseas to burma , to malaysia , to sri lanka , to singapore and set up businesses there , largely banking and trading .
so i was born in that community but i have never regarded caste as an important factor , i 've rejected caste .
williams : do you think that being brought up in that tradition though helped you to get to where you are , you must have been surrounded by the vocabulary of trade , of economics , of business when you were younger ?
chidambaram : i think the only thing that that did to me was to send me to business school in harvard rather than law school .
if i had a choice i would have gone to the law school but i went to the business school .
but when i returned from business school i did n't do business i went to practise law .
williams : you trained as a lawyer then , as you said , went to harvard in the united states .
what was it like as an indian studying for an mba in harvard in the 1960s , what do you remember of those times ?
chidambaram : oh we were a rather small and exclusive tribe at that moment , we were four indians in that class , two of them had come from india , the other two were indians who were living in the united states because their parents were living there .
it was quite a challenge - coming from a different school and education system where i suppose by and large one learnt by rote .
harvard business school challenged you to think , to analyse , to argue your positions .
it was quite a challenge but i enjoyed myself .
basically i had a law degree and my aspiration was to be a lawyer .
williams : what do you think you brought back from the united states to india and to indian politics , do you think it made you the reformist that , i think it 's fair to describe you as ?
chidambaram : no when i returned from harvard business school i was still pretty much wedded to socialism .
so harvard business school did not change my political affiliation .
what harvard business school taught me was that accept nothing as a given , challenge everything , ask for data , ask for reason and arguments and be prepared to receive counter arguments .
harvard business school made you think and reason rather than accept conventional wisdom .
williams : you said you returned home as a socialist , you would n't call yourself a socialist now would you ?
chidambaram : no i 've explained that in a recent interview .
i say if you want to define a socialist as one who believes in socialist goals - more equity , more social justice , more opportunity for everyone , care of the aged , care of the disabled , a special place for children and women - yes i 'm a socialist .
but if you ask me do i believe in socialist methods - state controlled policies , state driven economy - i do n't any longer , i believe that a well regulated market is the best guarantor that you will achieve your goals .
williams : let 's talk about your goals , where you came from politically .
it was rajiv gandhi , i believe , who gave you your first big political break in 1984 , tell us how that happened .
chidambaram : well i knew mrs indira gandhi reasonably well , she was very fond of me .
i used to translate her speeches from english to tamil when she visited tamil nadu .
i was the leader of the youth congress in my state when she was the leader of the party .
then i became a general secretary of my state party .
but my first big break , in the sense that i contested an election and entered parliament , was after rajiv gandhi took over , after the tragic assignation of his mother .
we met on september 16th 1984 when he was visiting tamil nadu .
i translated a speech into tamil , then we started chatting and he asked me about delhi , we started chatting about the forthcoming elections - his mother was alive at that time - and the prospects in tamil nadu .
that 's how we got to know each other .
then i got the ticket and i was in parliament .
williams : for people who do n't know india well , just who are the gandhis , how important is that family to the country historically ?
chidambaram : oh they 're very important .
unquestionably the most loved indian of his time was pandit jawaharlal nehru .
mahatma gandhi was of course revered - near god .
but the man who was loved most was pandit jawaharlal nehru and as long as he lived he had complete sway over the people of india .
therefore he had a special place - he has a special place - in india .
his daughter , mrs indira gandhi , and then after her , her son - rajiv gandhi - also enjoyed a great deal of affection .
you see there are many indian political leaders who inspire respect or fear , there are very few who command genuine affection and love - the gandhis are among them .
williams : rajiv gandhi was assassinated on his way to see you , to campaign in your constituency .
chidambaram : he would have been there the next day , he was assassinated the previous night .
williams : how did you hear the news ?
chidambaram : when i was in a village making an election speech , i was told to rush to my campaign headquarters because there was no telephone in that village - i got a message .
i rushed to the campaign headquarters and i got the news over the telephone .
the radio was broadcasting that rajiv gandhi had been killed .
williams : and how did that affect you ?
chidambaram : very , very deeply , a small part of me died at that moment .
if things had gone according to plan i would have been with him on that day , i 'd have been say two feet away from him , it was the only meeting where i was not next to him as a translator , he was visiting tamil nadu , it was 300 kilometres away from my constituency and i had excused myself from that one meeting , promising to join him the next day at the first meeting .
so that 's it .
williams : since you accept , i think , a great debt to the gandhi dynasty and its congress party , what made you decide to turn your back on them and join a breakaway faction ... ?
chidambaram : no we did n't turn our back on the gandhis , we did n't even turn our back on the congress party , we turned our back on a decision made by the then congress leadership to forge a particular alliance with another party , which we detested in tamil nadu , and therefore the bulk of the congress party in tamil nadu broke away and formed a regional party .
but to all intents and purposes we were the congress party in tamil nadu .
williams : so anybody who says - and i 'm sure there are people who do - who say that you turned your back on the gandhis and on congress you 'd dispute that ?
chidambaram : it was completely wrong .
during that period we continued to maintain close relationship with the congress party in delhi , with the gandhis , i continued to be on the rajiv gandhi foundation , i continued to be the head of the foundation .
we were protesting a bad decision taken by the then leadership of the congress party which did not include mrs sonia gandhi .
williams : your son - karti - a businessman - he called that decision - this decision to breakaway - whatever word you 'd like to use - as an extremely big event in your life , changing the direction of your life - is he right ?
chidambaram : well i think he describes it in more enthusiastic terms .
it was a difficult decision to take but a decision which was right and proved to be right .
in the election that followed our alliance swept the polls - we won every one of the seats .
williams : and it certainly gave your political career a boost - you became the minister of finance for the first time .
what was it like when you first took that post , it must have been rather daunting ?
chidambaram : well not quite - i had been promised minister earlier and i 'd worked with the then finance minister dr manmohan singh .
i was of course daunted by the fact that in a coalition , the first genuine coalition government in india , i had become the finance minister .
but the prime minister , then , mr deve gowda , gave me a large degree of liberty and latitude to continue with reformist policies .
williams : you 're doing the job for a second time now and i 've read a great many profiles of you , preparing for this interview , and you 've been called , on a number of occasions , a star .
now ...
chidambaram : a star of what ?
williams : well a star - a star of financial management .
i 've also read quotes by some of your political opponents and i 'm sure you wo n't be surprised to find that they dispute that .
but where do you think this star status comes from , do you think you deserve it ?
chidambaram : no , i do n't aspire to a star status .
i 'm doing a job and i think the government is doing a reasonably good job if you measure in terms of growth .
we have delivered now 7.5 % , 8.4 % and the first half of the current fiscal year 9.1 % .
now that certainly entitles the government to take some credit for doing a good job .
williams : i have a quote , another quote , from your son , karti , which i 'd like to put to you .
he says that you 're unforgiving of failure , very quick on the uptake and at times you do n't appreciate that others do n't get it at once - do you think that 's a fair character judgement from your son - is that what you 're like ?
chidambaram : it was perhaps fair , now i accept more and more that there will be different points of view and some people will not perform as well as you would like them to perform .
williams : that sounds rather - well still rather demanding , are you a demanding man ?
chidambaram : in this job one has to be stern and demanding .
there are any number of people to tell me how to spend money , nobody to tell me how to raise money .
one has to be stern in this job as i 'm sure chancellor gordon brown will tell you .
williams : you 're listening to the interview on the bbc world service .
i 'm mike williams and i 'm glad you could join me and my guest today the finance minister of india palaniappan chidambaram .
mr chidambaram you 've done very well for the indian middle classes , in fact some would argue that you 've helped to invent them , to create them , but poverty remains a stain on your country does n't it .
chidambaram : it is but that proportion is declining , it will continue to decline .
the faster we grow and the more inclusive that growth is , the decline in poverty will be rapid .
i 'm confident we can wipe out poverty by 2040 .
williams : twenty forty - wipe out poverty ?
chidambaram : i think so .
williams : how do you measure that , what do you mean by wipe out poverty ?
chidambaram : well that we will not have the abject poverty that we see , that afflicts about 25 % of india 's population .
people will have homes , work , food , clothing , access to education and medical care .
most indians would have these well before 2040 but i think abject poverty will be wiped out by 2040 .
williams : well it 's a bold - bold promise .
let 's see how you might do it .
you 've always maintained that the best way to combat mass poverty is through free market reforms - why ?
surely the economic reforms that we 've seen so far have actually widened the gap between the richest and the poorest in india ?
chidambaram : let me assume that the gap has widened , perhaps it has .
at the same time those at the bottom of the pyramid have also seen improvement in their lives .
williams : but still some - a third of a million - sorry , forgive me , some third of a billion live in abject poverty .
chidambaram : yeah about 250 million live in poverty .
and the only way that they can be lifted out of poverty is to ensure that they have education , access to healthcare , skills and therefore make them employable or at least self-employed .
that will happen if the economy grows .
the economy does not grow there 's not too much you can share .
williams : but you believe that the effects of that growth will trickle down to the very poorest because what you 've helped to do is to create - well i think there 's something like 300 billionaires now in india , with a vast collective wealth , yet life expectancy is seven years less than china , the un says that infant mortality rates in india are worse than china or even sri lanka - is that the brave new world that you want to create ?
chidambaram : you have to look at these figures and compare them with what they were 10 years ago , what they were 15 years ago .
it is economic growth which has made these figures better today than what they were 15 years ago .
why compare india with china ?
why compare india with sri lanka ?
each country has a different set of problems , a different set of challenges .
the appropriate question to ask is are we coping with these challenges in the best way that we can ?
i believe we are .
can we do more ?
of course we can do more .
we can do more if we use our resources wisely and get the best for every rupee .
when we build a road , when we build homes for poor people , when we roll out a rural health mission , when we roll out the universalisation of education .
i find there is so much waste and leakage .
if i can plug those leakages we will roll out these services far more quickly and far more efficiently to the people who need these services .
williams : do n't you find it painfully slow ?
chidambaram : it is slow but things are improving .
there are differences between state and state , for example the southern states are growing at a very rapid rate and the delivery of services in southern states has improved tremendously .
the western states are also doing very well - punjab and haryana have very low levels of poverty , punjab , for example , is only about 6 % people below the poverty line .
now himachal , delhi , the poverty ratios are very low .
it 's really the hinterland of india , the landlocked states - rajasthan , bihar , uttar pradesh , madhya pradesh , jhark and chhattisgarh where we have a serious problem .
the problem 's really a problem of governance .
we do provide a lot of money but unless governance in these states improve you will not find a major assault on poverty .
even the eastern states are catching up now - orissa , bengal - are all catching up now .
williams : what kind of country is india , what kind of economy does it have - is it a rural country , it is a manufacturing country , is it a service economy - what is it ?
chidambaram : if you go by the traditional classification 54 % of gdp comes from services , 25-26 % comes from industry , the remainder - about 20 % -21 % - comes from agriculture .
williams : that 's now , what about 5-10 years time ?
chidambaram : five , ten years time the services sector will grow and occupy a larger space , industry will perhaps move up a couple of notches , agriculture will move down maybe 3 or 4 % .
but please remember the bulk of the working population is dependent on agriculture which is why it 's important to pay attention to agriculture .
williams : what effect do you think that globalisation is having and will have on indians ?
chidambaram : both positive and negative .
the positive aspects of globalisation will be greater capital flows , greater investment , more trade , more jobs in the services sector , more exports - all that will be positive .
the negative aspects , against which we are guarding against , are the impact on agriculture .
agriculture in india today is a livelihood issue , which is why when we go to the wto we do not look upon agriculture as simply a trading issue , it is a livelihood issue , we have to protect the livelihood of millions of people .
williams : are you worried that globalisation exposes indians to exploitation ?
chidambaram : no not to exploitation , unless we are on our guard , we are on our guard , if the western countries , the developed countries , continue to subsidise agriculture and then seek access to india 's market it will of course immiserise our farming population , we will never let that happen .
williams : when it comes to bringing your population out of poverty your unique selling point , and this is true of other developing nations too , is the cheap labour , now that 's the paradox which you ca n't overcome - the more they earn the less attractive they are to people investing .
chidambaram : much of this is myth , that india 's labour is cheap and therefore we have an advantage .
well china 's labour must therefore be cheaper .
the point is india 's labour is skilled , we are today a major hub for manufacturing - we export textiles , chemicals , pharmaceuticals , leather goods , steel , machine tools , automobile parts , cars - we export mercedes benz cars made in india back to germany .
therefore please do n't believe the story that india 's labour is cheap and that gives us advantage .
india 's labour is indeed cheaper than labour costs elsewhere in the world but india 's labour is also skilled and our comparative advantage comes from a number of factors , one among them being relatively cheaper labour .
williams : do you think that india is undervalued by the world , underestimated as a nation ?
chidambaram : it was , i do n't believe it is anymore .
williams : would you like to see perhaps a seat on the security council , a seat at the top table of international politics ?
chidambaram : i think we 're entitled to - our population , our location , our discharge of responsibilities given to us in the past by the united nations , our role as a peacekeeper and a peacemaker and our economic size i think entitles us to a place on the security council .
williams : do you think a lot of indian politics over the last decades have been devoted to - if not that specific aim - at least raising india 's position in a world of international politics ?
chidambaram : i think our growth story has captured the imagination of the world .
williams : but do you think that indians have felt undervalued in the past ?
chidambaram : they were but i think indians are very confident now , indians travel round the world and come back and tell me that they are heard with respect and they have a place at the high table in most conferences and meetings .
williams : what about you personally - would you like a seat at the top table of indian politics , well you 've already got a seat but how about prime minister chidambaram ?
chidambaram : i 'm quite happy to be finance minister , there are many other things in life to do than be in politics and be a minister .
williams : palaniappan chidambaram thank you very much for talking to all the listeners of the bbc world service and to me here on the interview , thank you very much .

the interviewer is mike williams .
indian finance minister we have the right to grow , just as much as the us and europe had a right to grow in the 19th century palaniappan chidambaram williams : hello and welcome , i 'm mike williams .
my guest today comes from a country that 's home to more than a billion people - india .
it 's the world 's largest democracy , its economy is the second fastest growing in the world .
but despite all of this a third or more of india 's people live in poverty and my guest has the job of managing its economy .
palaniappan chidambaram welcome to the interview .
chidambaram : thank you .
williams : india 's finance minister - that 's a pretty massive job you have , you 've got a big task have n't you .
chidambaram : it 's a challenging task .
williams : what 's most challenging ?
chidambaram : to ensure that the economy grows at no less than 8 % a year .
williams : that 's quite ambitious , that 's i think second only to china is n't it - only china is growing faster than india .
why does growth matter ?
chidambaram : growth is the best antidote to poverty .
growth gives incomes to people who are employed , throws up jobs for those who are not employed .
therefore growth is imperative .
but growth obviously is not sufficient in a country that you introduced a minute ago as a country where a significant proportion lives in poverty the growth must be inclusive growth .
so the task of the government - the task of the finance minister - is to ensure not only growth but that this growth is inclusive growth .
williams : we 'll talk a little bit more about that a little later .
but i suppose my first question is can you sustain this growth , it 's a very , very ambitious target - 8 % or more - can you do it ?
chidambaram : i think we can , we have to do the right things and avoid doing the wrong things .
now what are the right things ?
the right things are one : continue to observe fiscal prudence .
two : ensure that people save and invest and that there is an enabling environment for investors , both domestic and foreign .
and number three : ensure that these investments are made widely , managed wisely , so that they give a return .
if these principles are observed i do n't think it 's difficult in india to sustain a growth rate of no less than 8 % , pushing 9 % , and aiming to go beyond .
williams : you mentioned foreign investment , why do n't foreigners want to invest in india , because they do n't do they - at the moment direct phone investments stands at only 1 % of gdp .
in china , one of your main economic rivals i suppose , the figure 's nine times that ?
chidambaram : well the comparisons are not quite appropriate .
the way china counts fdi is different from the way india counts fdi .
besides overseas chinese investments from hong kong and taiwan are also counted .
be that as it may i can see that china gets much larger doses of foreign investment .
but the foreign investment that will flow into india is also dependent upon our capacity to absorb it .
and our capacity to absorb foreign investment will depend upon our willingness to open up more sectors which are regulated , open them up to foreign investment .
our current account deficit is still very modest - 1.3 % of gdp - we need to expand the current account deficit and absorb foreign direct investment .
this year , for example , 2006-07 , fdi inflows are running 50 % higher than last year .
williams : and do you think foreign investments are scared of the politics of india , are worried about a return to the heavy hand of the state on the economy ?
chidambaram : not at all , no foreign investor in recent years has expressed that worry to me .
what they want to know is whether more sectors which are rather tightly regulated will be available to them .
williams : do n't you risk annoying indians at home when you start liberalising these sectors , when you start opening them up to foreigners , is n't that a political problem for you at home ?
chidambaram : there are some sections which are wary about foreign investment but by and large i think the political establishment , irrespective of the political party , because every political party is running some state government or another , recognises the place of foreign investment .
besides outward foreign investment from india , from indian companies , and the acquisitions made by indian companies have also helped to change the mindset in india .
williams : can india cope with the growth that you say you want , you say you can achieve , what about the country 's infrastructure - its roads , its bridges , its ports , urban centres which ca n't sustain the pace of this growth ?
chidambaram : you 're right but in a sense the deficiencies have been exposed by the rapid rate of growth .
if we were growing at 4 or 5 % these roads , these ports , these airports , would be considered adequate .
so it 's a chicken and egg - we need the growth but the deficiencies of infrastructure become more glaring , therefore we need to grow our infrastructure at the same pace as we grow the rest of the economy , which is why we are putting in a lot of money and we are attracting a lot of money into airports , sea ports , roads , railway , telecommunication , power , petroleum exploration .
williams : tell me about power , do you think you 're going to be able to find the energy supplies to sustain ... ?
chidambaram : there 's an 8 % gap - there 's an 8 % gap between demand and supply today .
i think we 'll overcome this gap in the next five years .
we have just done -lsb- indistinct word -rsb- and ultra mega power project policy and we have given out bids for two such projects by 31st december , we will give out two more by 31st march .
we have no option - we have to overcome this demand / supply gap in power .
williams what do you think when you hear wealthy westerners saying that you should n't do that , you need to curb your energy use to protect the environment ?
chidambaram : well i politely reject that criticism .
when the rest of the world , the developed world , was growing nobody asked them why are you consuming so much energy , nobody asks them today why did n't you slow down and why did n't you consume less energy .
the point is we have a right to grow , just as much as the us and europe had a right to grow in the 19 - in the 20th century .
we have a right to grow , we have a right to consume energy , our carbon emissions are still among the lowest in the world , yet we are willing , as i 've said before , to take our share of responsibility , provided we have access to clean technologies and clean development mechanisms .
williams : you say you answer them politely but does it make you a bit angry when you hear westerners talking to you about your responsibility to the planet ?
chidambaram : no , i think one can be polite and firm .
williams : do you ever look back at your childhood perhaps and say why on earth did i enter politics ?
chidambaram : no , i did as a matter of choice .
i was inspired to enter politics when mrs indira gandhi emerged as the leader .
i came into parliament when mr rajiv gandhi had assumed the office of prime minister .
these are two leaders i respect greatly .
and i 'm in politics but i 'm also secure in the fact that politics is not all that i can do in this world - i can practise law , i can lecture , i can write , i can travel .
williams : and you grew up - you grew up as a businessman really , did n't you , in a business family .
i 'm told that you 're a chettiyar - i hope i said that properly ...
chidambaram : that 's right .
williams : now i have to admit that i do n't know much about the indian caste system , i did n't even know that there was such a thing as a business caste - the chettiyars .
for those like me who do n't understand the system how did that evolve ?
chidambaram : well how did the caste system evolve ?
williams : well particularly the position of the chettiyars , i mean where did the chettiyars come from ?
chidambaram : well the chettiyars are a very small business community but there are hundreds of such communities in different parts of india who are essentially businessmen , as opposed to farmers - traders as opposed to farmers .
the chettiyars are a small business community , they travelled overseas to burma , to malaysia , to sri lanka , to singapore and set up businesses there , largely banking and trading .
so i was born in that community but i have never regarded caste as an important factor , i 've rejected caste .
williams : do you think that being brought up in that tradition though helped you to get to where you are , you must have been surrounded by the vocabulary of trade , of economics , of business when you were younger ?
chidambaram : i think the only thing that that did to me was to send me to business school in harvard rather than law school .
if i had a choice i would have gone to the law school but i went to the business school .
but when i returned from business school i did n't do business i went to practise law .
williams : you trained as a lawyer then , as you said , went to harvard in the united states .
what was it like as an indian studying for an mba in harvard in the 1960s , what do you remember of those times ?
chidambaram : oh we were a rather small and exclusive tribe at that moment , we were four indians in that class , two of them had come from india , the other two were indians who were living in the united states because their parents were living there .
it was quite a challenge - coming from a different school and education system where i suppose by and large one learnt by rote .
harvard business school challenged you to think , to analyse , to argue your positions .
it was quite a challenge but i enjoyed myself .
basically i had a law degree and my aspiration was to be a lawyer .
williams : what do you think you brought back from the united states to india and to indian politics , do you think it made you the reformist that , i think it 's fair to describe you as ?
chidambaram : no when i returned from harvard business school i was still pretty much wedded to socialism .
so harvard business school did not change my political affiliation .
what harvard business school taught me was that accept nothing as a given , challenge everything , ask for data , ask for reason and arguments and be prepared to receive counter arguments .
harvard business school made you think and reason rather than accept conventional wisdom .
williams : you said you returned home as a socialist , you would n't call yourself a socialist now would you ?
chidambaram : no i 've explained that in a recent interview .
i say if you want to define a socialist as one who believes in socialist goals - more equity , more social justice , more opportunity for everyone , care of the aged , care of the disabled , a special place for children and women - yes i 'm a socialist .
but if you ask me do i believe in socialist methods - state controlled policies , state driven economy - i do n't any longer , i believe that a well regulated market is the best guarantor that you will achieve your goals .
williams : let 's talk about your goals , where you came from politically .
it was rajiv gandhi , i believe , who gave you your first big political break in 1984 , tell us how that happened .
chidambaram : well i knew mrs indira gandhi reasonably well , she was very fond of me .
i used to translate her speeches from english to tamil when she visited tamil nadu .
i was the leader of the youth congress in my state when she was the leader of the party .
then i became a general secretary of my state party .
but my first big break , in the sense that i contested an election and entered parliament , was after rajiv gandhi took over , after the tragic assignation of his mother .
we met on september 16th 1984 when he was visiting tamil nadu .
i translated a speech into tamil , then we started chatting and he asked me about delhi , we started chatting about the forthcoming elections - his mother was alive at that time - and the prospects in tamil nadu .
that 's how we got to know each other .
then i got the ticket and i was in parliament .
williams : for people who do n't know india well , just who are the gandhis , how important is that family to the country historically ?
chidambaram : oh they 're very important .
unquestionably the most loved indian of his time was pandit jawaharlal nehru .
mahatma gandhi was of course revered - near god .
but the man who was loved most was pandit jawaharlal nehru and as long as he lived he had complete sway over the people of india .
therefore he had a special place - he has a special place - in india .
his daughter , mrs indira gandhi , and then after her , her son - rajiv gandhi - also enjoyed a great deal of affection .
you see there are many indian political leaders who inspire respect or fear , there are very few who command genuine affection and love - the gandhis are among them .
williams : rajiv gandhi was assassinated on his way to see you , to campaign in your constituency .
chidambaram : he would have been there the next day , he was assassinated the previous night .
williams : how did you hear the news ?
chidambaram : when i was in a village making an election speech , i was told to rush to my campaign headquarters because there was no telephone in that village - i got a message .
i rushed to the campaign headquarters and i got the news over the telephone .
the radio was broadcasting that rajiv gandhi had been killed .
williams : and how did that affect you ?
chidambaram : very , very deeply , a small part of me died at that moment .
if things had gone according to plan i would have been with him on that day , i 'd have been say two feet away from him , it was the only meeting where i was not next to him as a translator , he was visiting tamil nadu , it was 300 kilometres away from my constituency and i had excused myself from that one meeting , promising to join him the next day at the first meeting .
so that 's it .
williams : since you accept , i think , a great debt to the gandhi dynasty and its congress party , what made you decide to turn your back on them and join a breakaway faction ... ?
chidambaram : no we did n't turn our back on the gandhis , we did n't even turn our back on the congress party , we turned our back on a decision made by the then congress leadership to forge a particular alliance with another party , which we detested in tamil nadu , and therefore the bulk of the congress party in tamil nadu broke away and formed a regional party .
but to all intents and purposes we were the congress party in tamil nadu .
williams : so anybody who says - and i 'm sure there are people who do - who say that you turned your back on the gandhis and on congress you 'd dispute that ?
chidambaram : it was completely wrong .
during that period we continued to maintain close relationship with the congress party in delhi , with the gandhis , i continued to be on the rajiv gandhi foundation , i continued to be the head of the foundation .
we were protesting a bad decision taken by the then leadership of the congress party which did not include mrs sonia gandhi .
williams : your son - karti - a businessman - he called that decision - this decision to breakaway - whatever word you 'd like to use - as an extremely big event in your life , changing the direction of your life - is he right ?
chidambaram : well i think he describes it in more enthusiastic terms .
it was a difficult decision to take but a decision which was right and proved to be right .
in the election that followed our alliance swept the polls - we won every one of the seats .
williams : and it certainly gave your political career a boost - you became the minister of finance for the first time .
what was it like when you first took that post , it must have been rather daunting ?
chidambaram : well not quite - i had been promised minister earlier and i 'd worked with the then finance minister dr manmohan singh .
i was of course daunted by the fact that in a coalition , the first genuine coalition government in india , i had become the finance minister .
but the prime minister , then , mr deve gowda , gave me a large degree of liberty and latitude to continue with reformist policies .
williams : you 're doing the job for a second time now and i 've read a great many profiles of you , preparing for this interview , and you 've been called , on a number of occasions , a star .
now ...
chidambaram : a star of what ?
williams : well a star - a star of financial management .
i 've also read quotes by some of your political opponents and i 'm sure you wo n't be surprised to find that they dispute that .
but where do you think this star status comes from , do you think you deserve it ?
chidambaram : no , i do n't aspire to a star status .
i 'm doing a job and i think the government is doing a reasonably good job if you measure in terms of growth .
we have delivered now 7.5 % , 8.4 % and the first half of the current fiscal year 9.1 % .
now that certainly entitles the government to take some credit for doing a good job .
williams : i have a quote , another quote , from your son , karti , which i 'd like to put to you .
he says that you 're unforgiving of failure , very quick on the uptake and at times you do n't appreciate that others do n't get it at once - do you think that 's a fair character judgement from your son - is that what you 're like ?
chidambaram : it was perhaps fair , now i accept more and more that there will be different points of view and some people will not perform as well as you would like them to perform .
williams : that sounds rather - well still rather demanding , are you a demanding man ?
chidambaram : in this job one has to be stern and demanding .
there are any number of people to tell me how to spend money , nobody to tell me how to raise money .
one has to be stern in this job as i 'm sure chancellor gordon brown will tell you .
williams : you 're listening to the interview on the bbc world service .
i 'm mike williams and i 'm glad you could join me and my guest today the finance minister of india palaniappan chidambaram .
mr chidambaram you 've done very well for the indian middle classes , in fact some would argue that you 've helped to invent them , to create them , but poverty remains a stain on your country does n't it .
chidambaram : it is but that proportion is declining , it will continue to decline .
the faster we grow and the more inclusive that growth is , the decline in poverty will be rapid .
i 'm confident we can wipe out poverty by 2040 .
williams : twenty forty - wipe out poverty ?
chidambaram : i think so .
williams : how do you measure that , what do you mean by wipe out poverty ?
chidambaram : well that we will not have the abject poverty that we see , that afflicts about 25 % of india 's population .
people will have homes , work , food , clothing , access to education and medical care .
most indians would have these well before 2040 but i think abject poverty will be wiped out by 2040 .
williams : well it 's a bold - bold promise .
let 's see how you might do it .
you 've always maintained that the best way to combat mass poverty is through free market reforms - why ?
surely the economic reforms that we 've seen so far have actually widened the gap between the richest and the poorest in india ?
chidambaram : let me assume that the gap has widened , perhaps it has .
at the same time those at the bottom of the pyramid have also seen improvement in their lives .
williams : but still some - a third of a million - sorry , forgive me , some third of a billion live in abject poverty .
chidambaram : yeah about 250 million live in poverty .
and the only way that they can be lifted out of poverty is to ensure that they have education , access to healthcare , skills and therefore make them employable or at least self-employed .
that will happen if the economy grows .
the economy does not grow there 's not too much you can share .
williams : but you believe that the effects of that growth will trickle down to the very poorest because what you 've helped to do is to create - well i think there 's something like 300 billionaires now in india , with a vast collective wealth , yet life expectancy is seven years less than china , the un says that infant mortality rates in india are worse than china or even sri lanka - is that the brave new world that you want to create ?
chidambaram : you have to look at these figures and compare them with what they were 10 years ago , what they were 15 years ago .
it is economic growth which has made these figures better today than what they were 15 years ago .
why compare india with china ?
why compare india with sri lanka ?
each country has a different set of problems , a different set of challenges .
the appropriate question to ask is are we coping with these challenges in the best way that we can ?
i believe we are .
can we do more ?
of course we can do more .
we can do more if we use our resources wisely and get the best for every rupee .
when we build a road , when we build homes for poor people , when we roll out a rural health mission , when we roll out the universalisation of education .
i find there is so much waste and leakage .
if i can plug those leakages we will roll out these services far more quickly and far more efficiently to the people who need these services .
williams : do n't you find it painfully slow ?
chidambaram : it is slow but things are improving .
there are differences between state and state , for example the southern states are growing at a very rapid rate and the delivery of services in southern states has improved tremendously .
the western states are also doing very well - punjab and haryana have very low levels of poverty , punjab , for example , is only about 6 % people below the poverty line .
now himachal , delhi , the poverty ratios are very low .
it 's really the hinterland of india , the landlocked states - rajasthan , bihar , uttar pradesh , madhya pradesh , jhark and chhattisgarh where we have a serious problem .
the problem 's really a problem of governance .
we do provide a lot of money but unless governance in these states improve you will not find a major assault on poverty .
even the eastern states are catching up now - orissa , bengal - are all catching up now .
williams : what kind of country is india , what kind of economy does it have - is it a rural country , it is a manufacturing country , is it a service economy - what is it ?
chidambaram : if you go by the traditional classification 54 % of gdp comes from services , 25-26 % comes from industry , the remainder - about 20 % -21 % - comes from agriculture .
williams : that 's now , what about 5-10 years time ?
chidambaram : five , ten years time the services sector will grow and occupy a larger space , industry will perhaps move up a couple of notches , agriculture will move down maybe 3 or 4 % .
but please remember the bulk of the working population is dependent on agriculture which is why it 's important to pay attention to agriculture .
williams : what effect do you think that globalisation is having and will have on indians ?
chidambaram : both positive and negative .
the positive aspects of globalisation will be greater capital flows , greater investment , more trade , more jobs in the services sector , more exports - all that will be positive .
the negative aspects , against which we are guarding against , are the impact on agriculture .
agriculture in india today is a livelihood issue , which is why when we go to the wto we do not look upon agriculture as simply a trading issue , it is a livelihood issue , we have to protect the livelihood of millions of people .
williams : are you worried that globalisation exposes indians to exploitation ?
chidambaram : no not to exploitation , unless we are on our guard , we are on our guard , if the western countries , the developed countries , continue to subsidise agriculture and then seek access to india 's market it will of course immiserise our farming population , we will never let that happen .
williams : when it comes to bringing your population out of poverty your unique selling point , and this is true of other developing nations too , is the cheap labour , now that 's the paradox which you ca n't overcome - the more they earn the less attractive they are to people investing .
chidambaram : much of this is myth , that india 's labour is cheap and therefore we have an advantage .
well china 's labour must therefore be cheaper .
the point is india 's labour is skilled , we are today a major hub for manufacturing - we export textiles , chemicals , pharmaceuticals , leather goods , steel , machine tools , automobile parts , cars - we export mercedes benz cars made in india back to germany .
therefore please do n't believe the story that india 's labour is cheap and that gives us advantage .
india 's labour is indeed cheaper than labour costs elsewhere in the world but india 's labour is also skilled and our comparative advantage comes from a number of factors , one among them being relatively cheaper labour .
williams : do you think that india is undervalued by the world , underestimated as a nation ?
chidambaram : it was , i do n't believe it is anymore .
williams : would you like to see perhaps a seat on the security council , a seat at the top table of international politics ?
chidambaram : i think we 're entitled to - our population , our location , our discharge of responsibilities given to us in the past by the united nations , our role as a peacekeeper and a peacemaker and our economic size i think entitles us to a place on the security council .
williams : do you think a lot of indian politics over the last decades have been devoted to - if not that specific aim - at least raising india 's position in a world of international politics ?
chidambaram : i think our growth story has captured the imagination of the world .
williams : but do you think that indians have felt undervalued in the past ?
chidambaram : they were but i think indians are very confident now , indians travel round the world and come back and tell me that they are heard with respect and they have a place at the high table in most conferences and meetings .
williams : what about you personally - would you like a seat at the top table of indian politics , well you 've already got a seat but how about prime minister chidambaram ?
chidambaram : i 'm quite happy to be finance minister , there are many other things in life to do than be in politics and be a minister .
williams : palaniappan chidambaram thank you very much for talking to all the listeners of the bbc world service and to me here on the interview , thank you very much .

the two lawyers , nguyen van dai and le thi cong nhan , who are both democracy activists , were arrested on saturday , other activists say .
they were held for two days while their homes and offices were searched .
efforts by vietnam 's small democracy movement to spread their message seem to have worried the authorities .
democracy activists in hanoi say the two lawyers were taken away by police on saturday as they held a discussion in mr dai 's office on human rights law .
last month they organised a similar workshop for a few university students - thought to have been the first public human rights training event in vietnam .
step too far the two were released on sunday night but then ordered to report to a police station the following morning for further interrogation .
the vietnamese government says dissidents use the label of " democracy " to distort the situation in the country .
but so far they have tolerated the small and illegal democracy movement - although individuals have complained of police harassment .
however , this attempt to recruit new supporters seems to have been a step too far for the authorities .
around 2,000 people have declared themselves to be supporters of vietnam 's democracy movement - a tiny fraction of the country 's population .
there are several different groups which have often had differences - although in the past year they have worked more closely together .
their existence is never mentioned in the local press and most vietnamese do not even know that they exist .

the two lawyers , nguyen van dai and le thi cong nhan , who are both democracy activists , were arrested on saturday , other activists say .
they were held for two days while their homes and offices were searched .
efforts by vietnam 's small democracy movement to spread their message seem to have worried the authorities .
democracy activists in hanoi say the two lawyers were taken away by police on saturday as they held a discussion in mr dai 's office on human rights law .
last month they organised a similar workshop for a few university students - thought to have been the first public human rights training event in vietnam .
step too far the two were released on sunday night but then ordered to report to a police station the following morning for further interrogation .
the vietnamese government says dissidents use the label of " democracy " to distort the situation in the country .
but so far they have tolerated the small and illegal democracy movement - although individuals have complained of police harassment .
however , this attempt to recruit new supporters seems to have been a step too far for the authorities .
around 2,000 people have declared themselves to be supporters of vietnam 's democracy movement - a tiny fraction of the country 's population .

the stethoscope helped one doctor detect tb in the very early 1800s , in the wake of the french revolution , a group of energetic and influential medics based mainly around paris , became the pioneers of modern medicine .
their aim was to reform medicine along the lines that physics and chemistry had been developed in the course of the 18th century - to give it a scientific basis .
medicine was now to be based on experiment and observation , and to rely on the senses rather than the imagination when looking for causes .
in other words , they gave medicine a typically enlightenment treatment .
and their reforms were very successful , in part because they could work together , rather than as isolated individuals .
parisian ' guinea pigs ' the white heat of the french revolution allowed individuals to question the basis of everything , not just political structures but every part of life .
and it put in power the men who could apply that to medicine .
some of the advances came at a heavy cost .
the chemist antoine fourcroy announced to france 's new law-making body , the convention in 1794 how medicine would be taught : " little reading , much seeing and much doing will be the foundation of the new teaching which your committee proposes .
" practising the art , observing at the bedside , all that was missing , will now be the principal part of instruction . "
and paris , with its dense population was an ideal place for the advances to take place .
the hospitals of paris were the great sheltering places for the poor , homeless and sick .
they turned them into exclusively medical institutions , and used the thousands of poor people in them as their guinea-pigs .
post mortem clues doctors carefully watched the course of their patients ' diseases .
jean-nicolas corvisart was able to detect aneurysms in arteries as well as observing and recording visible symptoms they carried out manual examinations , along with newer techniques .
at the hospital of la charité , the physician jean-nicolas corvisart pioneered tapping on the chest to analyse heart disease .
one of his pupils , théophile laennec invented the stethoscope and was able to diagnose consumption .
he said : " i began to suspect that the phenomenon could be due to cavities in the lungs produced by the softening of the tubercules .
" as most of the patients who presented this phenomenon died at the hospital , i was able to confirm at autopsy that my suspicion was correct . "
the widespread use of post mortems allowed the scientific classification of disease for the first time .
along with the symptoms , the doctors were able to see what had been going on inside bodies during the course of the illness .
they also created laboratories , as the physicists and chemists had done , and in them they tested and tortured nature to try to work out how animal and human bodies work and how and why they malfunction , sacrificing millions of animals to this cause .
' big-bang ' their ideas spread across europe and to america , with medical schools established alongside hospitals .
but some of the advances came at a heavy cost .
at the imperial general hospital in vienna , a young obstetrician called ignaz semmelweis was struggling to understand a dramatic rise in deaths from childbed fever .
early versions of the stethoscope he studied the symptoms of the patients and carried out autopsy after autopsy .
eventually and tragically he discovered he himself was transporting the condition .
but semmelweis was effectively introducing into medicine a new meaning for " cause " in disease that none of his contemporaries shared and which would later transform medical thinking and practice .
later in the 19th century investigators , such as louis pasteur established laboratories to investigate the minute causes of infectious disease : the germs .
the result was new and reliable forms of diagnosis , a far better understanding of the workings of the human body and its weaknesses , and cures for diseases as well as ways - especially with vaccines - of protecting people from illnesses in the first place .
the events of the french revolution triggered a big-bang which completely transformed medicine .
the foundations laid by laennec , corvisart and others opened the door to allow scientists to discover much more about how and why people become ill and what can be done to treat and cure them .
the making of modern medicine is on radio 4 every weekday at 1545 gmt from monday 5 february to friday 16 march .

"
the key phrase is " all learners " : the gifted , the disabled , the asylum seeker , the child with special needs , the looked after child ; a list that extends to include any diversity .
that diversity can be multi-layered and present yet more complications .
a pupil can be at once gifted and talented and looked after , disabled and talented in some subjects while having special need in others .
we seek a curriculum that caters for all ; if nothing else it needs to be flexible .
we live in a changing society with greater expectations for our young , so the role and organisation of schooling will need to change too .
at the heart of that process is the curriculum .
tension the skills young people will need in the unfolding world are very different from those that were seen as essential when mass schooling began in the late 1800s or even when a curriculum for the nation was established in the late 1980s .
qualities such as social and cultural flexibility , self reliance , a strong positive sense of self and an ability to tolerate difference , the capacity to cope with change , a feeling for justice and fairness are all put forward as essential for young adults of the future .
couple this list with necessary skills , including literacy and numeracy which will more than ever be at the core , and the need to move on from the current curriculum becomes apparent . "
many believe in maintaining a system for their children that a generation ago served themselves well " or does it ?
for many , there is a tension between the development of skills and the pursuit of academic excellence .
firstly , is the achievement of high academic standards in english and mathematics the logical extension of functional literacy and numeracy , or are different sets of skills and understandings involved ?
secondly , are the sort of lessons and learning experiences necessary to develop academic excellence also capable of promoting the underlying skills ?
does one have to be sacrificed in order to achieve the other ?
we have to teach our young something and well-taught subject disciplines can be the vehicle for all of the skills and qualities that they need .
our biggest curriculum challenge is to sustain a desire to learn whilst providing the skills and qualities necessary for young people to influence their own lives .
in the next 20 years of adulthood , the learning outlook will be a vital quality for successful lives and a strong economy .
in all this the curriculum needs to evolve .
exhilaration this does not mean dismantling the whole structure but creating a climate where responsive revision is a natural approach in a fast changing world .
subject disciplines should stay , but they should be the resource with which we open up learning opportunities and create a sense of purpose for learning .
if these are the possibilities , why is change so hesitant ?
there are several reasons .
many believe in maintaining a system for their children that a generation ago served themselves well , but through this there is a danger that genuine reform is at risk of seeming " soft " rather than rigorous .
the learner should enjoy the challenge of the difficult problem and the exhilaration of success .
pupils need more understanding and clarity about the purpose and value of education and learning .
standards this needs to be coupled with a shared emphasis on " doing better " , raising standards in literacy , numeracy and ict as well as in areas such as personal development . "
it is the construction of the curriculum into a coherent whole that will excite the thirst for learning in all the pupils " the curriculum subjects need to emphasise the possible routes through schooling and the application of specific learning in the world beyond .
the curriculum should better emphasise and make explicit study and learning in terms of diversity , choice , need and specialism .
this means upholding standards through stringent analysis of need within assessments , ensuring challenge and depth , requiring learners to demonstrate application , synthesis , understanding and originality .
it means rejuvenating content within the curriculum to use subject disciplines to develop skills and personal qualities in context , and demonstrate links between the traditional and emerging subjects .
wider school curriculum this will help the nation to sustain an economy by making apparent , as a natural part of the subjects , the mathematics of engineering , the physics of construction and the chemistry of health .
at qca , we want to help schools to design a coherent curriculum experience for their own pupils , within clear parameters .
it is the construction of the curriculum into a coherent whole that will excite the thirst for learning in all the pupils - a universal element to which schools would add uniqueness appropriate to their own circumstances .
the outcomes for children would be central , and the learning experience for the pupil would be strong both at the time and in their future life .
we might hope that the proposals that we are publishing today will make us all proud of our modern , world-class curriculum .
i would encourage teachers , parents , pupils and anyone with an interest in education to let us know their views and help us to shape the future of learning .

"
the key phrase is " all learners " : the gifted , the disabled , the asylum seeker , the child with special needs , the looked after child ; a list that extends to include any diversity .
that diversity can be multi-layered and present yet more complications .
a pupil can be at once gifted and talented and looked after , disabled and talented in some subjects while having special need in others .
we seek a curriculum that caters for all ; if nothing else it needs to be flexible .
we live in a changing society with greater expectations for our young , so the role and organisation of schooling will need to change too .
at the heart of that process is the curriculum .
tension the skills young people will need in the unfolding world are very different from those that were seen as essential when mass schooling began in the late 1800s or even when a curriculum for the nation was established in the late 1980s .
qualities such as social and cultural flexibility , self reliance , a strong positive sense of self and an ability to tolerate difference , the capacity to cope with change , a feeling for justice and fairness are all put forward as essential for young adults of the future .
couple this list with necessary skills , including literacy and numeracy which will more than ever be at the core , and the need to move on from the current curriculum becomes apparent .
many believe in maintaining a system for their children that a generation ago served themselves well or does it ?
for many , there is a tension between the development of skills and the pursuit of academic excellence .
firstly , is the achievement of high academic standards in english and mathematics the logical extension of functional literacy and numeracy , or are different sets of skills and understandings involved ?
secondly , are the sort of lessons and learning experiences necessary to develop academic excellence also capable of promoting the underlying skills ?
does one have to be sacrificed in order to achieve the other ?
we have to teach our young something and well-taught subject disciplines can be the vehicle for all of the skills and qualities that they need .
our biggest curriculum challenge is to sustain a desire to learn whilst providing the skills and qualities necessary for young people to influence their own lives .
in the next 20 years of adulthood , the learning outlook will be a vital quality for successful lives and a strong economy .
in all this the curriculum needs to evolve .
exhilaration this does not mean dismantling the whole structure but creating a climate where responsive revision is a natural approach in a fast changing world .
subject disciplines should stay , but they should be the resource with which we open up learning opportunities and create a sense of purpose for learning .
if these are the possibilities , why is change so hesitant ?
there are several reasons .
many believe in maintaining a system for their children that a generation ago served themselves well , but through this there is a danger that genuine reform is at risk of seeming " soft " rather than rigorous .
the learner should enjoy the challenge of the difficult problem and the exhilaration of success .
pupils need more understanding and clarity about the purpose and value of education and learning .
standards this needs to be coupled with a shared emphasis on " doing better " , raising standards in literacy , numeracy and ict as well as in areas such as personal development .

the key phrase is " all learners " : the gifted , the disabled , the asylum seeker , the child with special needs , the looked after child ; a list that extends to include any diversity .
that diversity can be multi-layered and present yet more complications .
a pupil can be at once gifted and talented and looked after , disabled and talented in some subjects while having special need in others .
we seek a curriculum that caters for all ; if nothing else it needs to be flexible .
we live in a changing society with greater expectations for our young , so the role and organisation of schooling will need to change too .
at the heart of that process is the curriculum .
tension the skills young people will need in the unfolding world are very different from those that were seen as essential when mass schooling began in the late 1800s or even when a curriculum for the nation was established in the late 1980s .
qualities such as social and cultural flexibility , self reliance , a strong positive sense of self and an ability to tolerate difference , the capacity to cope with change , a feeling for justice and fairness are all put forward as essential for young adults of the future .
couple this list with necessary skills , including literacy and numeracy which will more than ever be at the core , and the need to move on from the current curriculum becomes apparent .
many believe in maintaining a system for their children that a generation ago served themselves well or does it ?
for many , there is a tension between the development of skills and the pursuit of academic excellence .
firstly , is the achievement of high academic standards in english and mathematics the logical extension of functional literacy and numeracy , or are different sets of skills and understandings involved ?
secondly , are the sort of lessons and learning experiences necessary to develop academic excellence also capable of promoting the underlying skills ?
does one have to be sacrificed in order to achieve the other ?
we have to teach our young something and well-taught subject disciplines can be the vehicle for all of the skills and qualities that they need .

" military action is not likely to be a short , sharp engagement but could have a profound effect on the region , with shock waves felt far beyond , " the report says .
it goes on to say the british government is " well positioned to articulate objections to military action " and that it should " not lose this opportunity to advocate for direct us engagement " .
but ms fitzsimons , chief executive of the britain-israel communications and research centre , told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " what we are talking about here is iran reaching the ability on an industrial scale to manufacture highly enriched uranium . "

sir richard dalton , the british ambassador to iran until last year , backed the calls for increased diplomacy .
" recourse to military action - other than in legitimate self-defence - is not only unlikely to work but would be a disaster for iran , the region and quite possibly the world , " he said .
military warnings liberal democrat foreign affairs spokesman michael moore said : " this is a timely and significant report .
" it highlights the need for the international community to be more aware of the potentially disastrous consequences of military action against iran . "
but the conservatives said it was important to " keep all options on the table " .

the clackmannanshire council initiative is believed to be the first run by a local authority in britain .
new research from dundee university suggests learning philosophy raises children 's iq by up to 6.5 points and improves their emotional intelligence .
the study tracked progress of secondary school pupils in clackmannanshire who received philosophy lessons in primary .
self-esteem philosophy can be described as rational investigation of existence , ethics and knowledge , experts said .
teachers use stimuli such as a story or picture to encourage learners to think about things at a deeper level .
they ask children simple , open-ended questions such as " how do you know that ?
what shows that ? " .
paul cleghorn , the head teacher who spearheaded the school philosophy launch in clackmannanshire primary schools six years ago , said starting the subject early in life had a profound effect on young people 's behaviour .
he said : " the critical thing about it is that it allows the youngster to move to a level where informed choice can be made .
" it is not about the surface level information about something .
" for example in health education , let 's say smoking or drugs education , if it is on a factual level youngsters are smart enough to give the right answers but that does not actually impact on their behaviour and the choices they make . "
" it shows that the time children spend in exploring philosophical concepts ... is a good long term investment for their future " dr steve trickey the dundee university research tracked the progress in secondary school of a control group and the children in clackmannanshire who learnt philosophy in primary .
it indicates it does have a long term impact .
professor keith topping and dr steve trickey said that the self-esteem of pupils and confidence rose .
pupils were more aware of their own and the feelings of others and classroom behaviour improved , the research said .
