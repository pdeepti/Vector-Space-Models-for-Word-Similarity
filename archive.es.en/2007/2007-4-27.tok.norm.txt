" the first step will still have to be to clarify exactly what president -lrb- vladimir -rrb- putin meant , " chief nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters , when asked how the alliance would respond to the apparent move .
" i have seen quotes from presidential advisors saying : ' well , we only mean in six months ' , i have heard some else tell me that he subsequently said they only mean in one year , " he said .
" there will clearly be a discussion within nato , there will clearly be a discussion between capitals and the russian federation on what they mean . "
making his last state of the nation speech in moscow , putin said thursday that russia could pull out of the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty until all of nato 's current members ratified it .
" it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence ... until it has been ratified by all nato countries without exception , " he said .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said the 26 member countries had received the news with " concern , grave concern , disappointment and deep regret because the allies are of the opinion that the cfe treaty is one of the cornerstones of european security . "
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for calm .
" the arithmetic of the cold war , with its numbers of armed vehicles , missiles and troops on each side , just does n't add up any more , " he said .
" we must avoid an escalation . "
europeans call for calm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's steinmeier calls for more dialogue " what we need is not less disarmament and fewer arms controls , we need more , " said steinmeier , whose once-divided country was the frontline for the cold war .
in berlin government spokesman thomas steg called for continued dialogue , while adding that " we are strongly convinced that threats do not help . "
in france foreign ministry spokesman jean-baptiste mattei called for russia to go back on its decision , calling the cfe treaty " a cornerstone of security in europe . "
he said that debate on the treaty and the us anti-missile plan that triggered putin 's move should continue in the nato-russia joint council to overcome moscow 's suspicions .
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 in paris by the countries of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- and the former warsaw pact to limit military hardware in the region .
it was adapted in istanbul in 1999 following the collapse of the warsaw pact , in order to limit deployments on a country-by-country basis .
nato states have refused to ratify the new pact on the grounds that moscow has failed to honour commitments made in istanbul to withdraw russian forces from the former soviet republics of georgia and moldova .
increased threat of mutually assured destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's tone has become more belligerent in recent days president putin reiterated his belliegernt stance when he warned of an increased threat of mutually assured destruction in a meeting about the planned us missile shield with czech president vaclav klaus .
" the increase of the threat of mutual harm to one another , and possibly of destruction , will grow many times over , " putin said , adding the system 's proposed bases in the czech republic and poland would violate europe 's security apparatus .
although the us plans have been known for years , russia has increased its rhetoric in recent months after the czech republic and poland , eastern european countries moscow considers its sphere of influence , entered talks to house elements on their territory .
us defence secretary robert gates visited putin and other officials in moscow earlier this week to invite russia to join the project , but apparently made little progress .
washington says the shield is designed to protect against threats from iran and north korea and that its 10 interceptor missiles could not defend against russia 's thousands of warheads .
russia claims to be real target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russians consider the missile system to be a threat russia has said it is the target of the shield , and putin told klaus he was ready to invite specialists from the czech republic and poland to show neither iran nor north korea had missile systems demanding the defence system .
washington , for its part , says both north korea and iran either have or are trying to acquire atomic bombs and could in 10 years ' time have missiles that threaten europe .
klaus told russian news agencies after his talks with putin that he had been unable to explain the czech arguments for the shield .
" i assured the president the czech side did n't have the slightest intention for the radar bases -lrb- proposed for czech territory -rrb- to become a threat to russia , " klaus said .
" that 's understandable - the czech republic wo n't control the stations , " putin was quoted as saying in response .
in a meeting where putin reminded klaus his country received 75 per cent of its natural gas from energy-rich moscow and had recently signed an agreement lasting till 2035 , putin told the czech leader the shield was similar to putting nuclear missiles on european territory .
putin said he hoped the czech republic would advance russian-eu relations as european union president in 2009 .
" i have a very wide circle of questions and problems and we are glad for the opportunity to exchange opinions , " he added .
but regarding the shield , he added that " as head of state i would have to say yes , relations will worsen . "
" we wo n't raise an hysteria over this , we 'll simply take the necessary measures , " the russian leader said . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia threatens pullout from landmark arms treaty president vladimir putin on thursday threatened russian withdrawal from a landmark cold war-era arms treaty limiting military forces in europe , raising the stakes in an already tense security dispute with the west .

" there will clearly be a discussion within nato , there will clearly be a discussion between capitals and the russian federation on what they mean . "
making his last state of the nation speech in moscow , putin said thursday that russia could pull out of the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty until all of nato 's current members ratified it .
" it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence ... until it has been ratified by all nato countries without exception , " he said .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said the 26 member countries had received the news with " concern , grave concern , disappointment and deep regret because the allies are of the opinion that the cfe treaty is one of the cornerstones of european security . "
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for calm .

europeans call for calm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's steinmeier calls for more dialogue " what we need is not less disarmament and fewer arms controls , we need more , " said steinmeier , whose once-divided country was the frontline for the cold war .

in france foreign ministry spokesman jean-baptiste mattei called for russia to go back on its decision , calling the cfe treaty " a cornerstone of security in europe . "
he said that debate on the treaty and the us anti-missile plan that triggered putin 's move should continue in the nato-russia joint council to overcome moscow 's suspicions .
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 in paris by the countries of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- and the former warsaw pact to limit military hardware in the region .
it was adapted in istanbul in 1999 following the collapse of the warsaw pact , in order to limit deployments on a country-by-country basis .
nato states have refused to ratify the new pact on the grounds that moscow has failed to honour commitments made in istanbul to withdraw russian forces from the former soviet republics of georgia and moldova .

washington , for its part , says both north korea and iran either have or are trying to acquire atomic bombs and could in 10 years ' time have missiles that threaten europe .
klaus told russian news agencies after his talks with putin that he had been unable to explain the czech arguments for the shield .

" the first step will still have to be to clarify exactly what president -lrb- vladimir -rrb- putin meant , " chief nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters , when asked how the alliance would respond to the apparent move .
" i have seen quotes from presidential advisors saying : ' well , we only mean in six months ' , i have heard some else tell me that he subsequently said they only mean in one year , " he said .
" there will clearly be a discussion within nato , there will clearly be a discussion between capitals and the russian federation on what they mean . "
making his last state of the nation speech in moscow , putin said thursday that russia could pull out of the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty until all of nato 's current members ratified it .
" it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence ... until it has been ratified by all nato countries without exception , " he said .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said the 26 member countries had received the news with " concern , grave concern , disappointment and deep regret because the allies are of the opinion that the cfe treaty is one of the cornerstones of european security . "
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for calm .
" the arithmetic of the cold war , with its numbers of armed vehicles , missiles and troops on each side , just does n't add up any more , " he said .
" we must avoid an escalation . "
europeans call for calm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's steinmeier calls for more dialogue " what we need is not less disarmament and fewer arms controls , we need more , " said steinmeier , whose once-divided country was the frontline for the cold war .
in berlin government spokesman thomas steg called for continued dialogue , while adding that " we are strongly convinced that threats do not help . "
in france foreign ministry spokesman jean-baptiste mattei called for russia to go back on its decision , calling the cfe treaty " a cornerstone of security in europe . "
he said that debate on the treaty and the us anti-missile plan that triggered putin 's move should continue in the nato-russia joint council to overcome moscow 's suspicions .
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 in paris by the countries of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- and the former warsaw pact to limit military hardware in the region .
it was adapted in istanbul in 1999 following the collapse of the warsaw pact , in order to limit deployments on a country-by-country basis .
nato states have refused to ratify the new pact on the grounds that moscow has failed to honour commitments made in istanbul to withdraw russian forces from the former soviet republics of georgia and moldova .
increased threat of mutually assured destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's tone has become more belligerent in recent days president putin reiterated his belliegernt stance when he warned of an increased threat of mutually assured destruction in a meeting about the planned us missile shield with czech president vaclav klaus .
" the increase of the threat of mutual harm to one another , and possibly of destruction , will grow many times over , " putin said , adding the system 's proposed bases in the czech republic and poland would violate europe 's security apparatus .
although the us plans have been known for years , russia has increased its rhetoric in recent months after the czech republic and poland , eastern european countries moscow considers its sphere of influence , entered talks to house elements on their territory .
us defence secretary robert gates visited putin and other officials in moscow earlier this week to invite russia to join the project , but apparently made little progress .
washington says the shield is designed to protect against threats from iran and north korea and that its 10 interceptor missiles could not defend against russia 's thousands of warheads .
russia claims to be real target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russians consider the missile system to be a threat russia has said it is the target of the shield , and putin told klaus he was ready to invite specialists from the czech republic and poland to show neither iran nor north korea had missile systems demanding the defence system .
washington , for its part , says both north korea and iran either have or are trying to acquire atomic bombs and could in 10 years ' time have missiles that threaten europe .
klaus told russian news agencies after his talks with putin that he had been unable to explain the czech arguments for the shield .

although he is widely seen as the architect of turkey 's eu bid , they object to his islamist past and the fact that his wife wears the muslim headscarf . to them , the prospect of a president with an islamist background is proof of religion steadily creeping into politics and public life .
the government 's supporters , meanwhile , respond with charges of crisis-mongering and flouting democracy in a country where surveys show people increasingly identify with islam . amid these growing concerns , thousands of people rallied in ankara in recent weeks against erdogan and his party . boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations in ankara meanwhile , opposition parties boycotted the poll friday and declared the vote invalid . the main opposition party republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- had threatened a boycott and said it would challenge the result in the constitutional court if the session convened with less than two-thirds of the legislators taking part - hoping thereby to isolate the akp by convincing other opposition mps to boycott the session .
the plan was then to petition the constitutional court to scrap the first-round vote , thus blocking the election process and forcing early elections . " i urge all elected deputies to come and do their democratic political duty .
we are facing one of the most important days of our democratic life , " erdogan had said in a last-minute appeal to deputies to attend the parliament vote friday . " let us not fall into the trap of those who are trying to drag turkey back to the customs of the past , to those periods of political paralysis , " he added .
" despite our differences , the result of our democratic rivalry , we are ... the representatives of the same nation , " he said .
" attending the general assembly and voting - be it for or against - is a duty given to us by the people . " but as the vote began , the number fell short of a 367-member threshold and the chp confirmed it would challenge the vote in court .
according to the reuters news agency , there were 360 deputies in the chamber for the vote , clearing the way for the main opposition to ask the constitutional court to annul the vote . the akp now faces the biggest crisis of its near five-year rule .

although he is widely seen as the architect of turkey 's eu bid , they object to his islamist past and the fact that his wife wears the muslim headscarf . to them , the prospect of a president with an islamist background is proof of religion steadily creeping into politics and public life .
the government 's supporters , meanwhile , respond with charges of crisis-mongering and flouting democracy in a country where surveys show people increasingly identify with islam . amid these growing concerns , thousands of people rallied in ankara in recent weeks against erdogan and his party . boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations in ankara meanwhile , opposition parties boycotted the poll friday and declared the vote invalid . the main opposition party republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- had threatened a boycott and said it would challenge the result in the constitutional court if the session convened with less than two-thirds of the legislators taking part - hoping thereby to isolate the akp by convincing other opposition mps to boycott the session .
the plan was then to petition the constitutional court to scrap the first-round vote , thus blocking the election process and forcing early elections . " i urge all elected deputies to come and do their democratic political duty .
we are facing one of the most important days of our democratic life , " erdogan had said in a last-minute appeal to deputies to attend the parliament vote friday . " let us not fall into the trap of those who are trying to drag turkey back to the customs of the past , to those periods of political paralysis , " he added .
" despite our differences , the result of our democratic rivalry , we are ... the representatives of the same nation , " he said .
" attending the general assembly and voting - be it for or against - is a duty given to us by the people . " but as the vote began , the number fell short of a 367-member threshold and the chp confirmed it would challenge the vote in court .
according to the reuters news agency , there were 360 deputies in the chamber for the vote , clearing the way for the main opposition to ask the constitutional court to annul the vote . the akp now faces the biggest crisis of its near five-year rule .
if the court upholds the opposition appeal , erdogan will have to call a snap general election within 90 days . the candidates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul oversaw turkey 's eu bid the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , holds a solid majority in the 550-member assembly to secure gul 's election , but only in the later stages of the vote . the only other candidate , dissident akp deputy ersonmez yarbay , stands no chance of election . the akp currently controls nearly two-thirds of the legislative assembly , or 352 seats , despite winning only 34 percent of the popular vote - a quirk of turkey 's electoral system . the party has disowned its islamist roots , pledged commitment to the secular system and secured the opening of membership talks with the european union . but some of its actions , such as attempts to criminalize adultery , isolate alcohol-serving establishments in special zones and encourage koranic courses , have fuelled suspicions of its islamist ambitions . in what was seen as a last-minute maneuver to garner support , the akp said friday it was ready to consider several constitutional reforms advocated by the centre-right motherland party -lrb- anap -rrb- in the hope of luring its 20 deputies to vote . the moderate gul was picked as akp candidate following unprecedented mass protests against erdogan , a highly popular but controversial politician who had been widely expected to run . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish foreign minister abdullah gül to run for president turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has named foreign minister abdullah gül as the ruling party 's candidate for president , ending speculation that erdogan , a former islamist , would stand himself .

the call came as an eu report highlighted ongoing human rights failings in various countries . germany needs to use its presidency of the eu to take a strong stance against the failings of russia and china in regards to human rights , activists said at a meeting in berlin .
the leaders of three russian non-governmental organizations pressed the eu to address what they said was a deteriorating rights situation in russia under president vladimir putin .
the activists gathered in berlin at the invitation of new york-based human rights watch and amnesty international on thursday .
the head of the centre for the development of democracy and human rights , yuri dzhibladze , accused germany of turning a blind eye to rights violations in russia so as not to jeopardize its economic ties , in particular in the energy sector .
" we believe that germany is under performing in its role of leader in europe in working with russia , " dzhibladze told reporters , ahead of eu-russia human rights consultations on may 3 in berlin , before the may 18 eu-russia summit .
germany needs to " speak up " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should put political pressure on putin , activists say the chairwoman of demos centre for information and research , tanya lokshina , cited a bloody police crackdown against opposition activists and a sharp rise in racist attacks as symptomatic of a harsher climate for dissent .
" all the european countries ought to stand up for russian civil society , but germany should be leading the way , " lokshina said .
" with the putin government trying to suppress all dissent , we need you now more than ever . "
oleg orlov , the head of memorial , one of russia 's oldest human rights groups , said europe had the power to help turn the tide in russia .
" speaking out on human rights in russia wo n't threaten europe 's energy supply but it would really help to curb the government 's crackdown , " orlov said .
" russian civil society is under attack and we need germany to speak up . "
the activists also criticised the planning of next week 's meeting in berlin , saying that no russian human rights groups had been invited .
eu criticizes putin 's government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian reporter anna politkovskaya 's murder points to human rights problems under putin the meeting in berlin coincided with the release of the eu parliament 's annual human rights report .
the parliament in strasbourg strongly criticised the russian government over human rights , regretting that the eu has had " only limited success in bringing about policy change as a result of raising difficult issues . "
the report attacked russian legislation limiting the activities of ngos and that journalists and human rights defenders have been threatened .
it also highlighted the murder of russian journalist anna politkovskaya and allegations of russian involvement in the poisoning of former russian agent alexander litvinenko in london .
serious concerns about china in addition to russia , the eu raised concern about turkey , iran and china .
china 's human rights record is a matter of " serious concern " and should thus " receive more focus in the build-up to the beijing olympic games , " parliament members said , emphasising the need to strengthen and improve dialogue on the issue between the eu and china .
members urged the european commission and member states " to raise the question of tibet " in talks with the beijing government , adding that trade relations with china should be contingent upon human rights reform .
china has ruled tibet since 1951 , since troops were sent to " liberate " the region .
subsequent uprisings have been violently supressed .
china on thursday warned visiting foreigners against engaging in activities that threaten the nation 's unity , as a rights group demanded the release of four americans detained for a pro-tibet protest .
" limited progress " in other countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's record was criticized by the eu the report also noted a deterioration of the human rights situation in iran , including " the intensification of the repression against human rights defenders . "
the report also voiced concern over the " limited progress " on human rights issues in turkey and encouraged the ankara government to change article 301 of its penal code , which outlaws the denigration of " turkishness . "
it raises concerns over religious freedoms and minority rights , including for the kurds in the southeast of the country .
the eu itself does not escape censure in the parliamentary report which says the union should have taken " more unilateral action " to persuade the sudanese government to accept an international peacekeeping force in darfur .
parliament members want " a plan of specific , targeted sanctions to be imposed on the khartoum regime ... in the event of non-compliance with the demands of the international community . "

the call came as an eu report highlighted ongoing human rights failings in various countries . germany needs to use its presidency of the eu to take a strong stance against the failings of russia and china in regards to human rights , activists said at a meeting in berlin .
the leaders of three russian non-governmental organizations pressed the eu to address what they said was a deteriorating rights situation in russia under president vladimir putin .
the activists gathered in berlin at the invitation of new york-based human rights watch and amnesty international on thursday .
the head of the centre for the development of democracy and human rights , yuri dzhibladze , accused germany of turning a blind eye to rights violations in russia so as not to jeopardize its economic ties , in particular in the energy sector .
" we believe that germany is under performing in its role of leader in europe in working with russia , " dzhibladze told reporters , ahead of eu-russia human rights consultations on may 3 in berlin , before the may 18 eu-russia summit .
germany needs to " speak up " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should put political pressure on putin , activists say the chairwoman of demos centre for information and research , tanya lokshina , cited a bloody police crackdown against opposition activists and a sharp rise in racist attacks as symptomatic of a harsher climate for dissent .
" all the european countries ought to stand up for russian civil society , but germany should be leading the way , " lokshina said .
" with the putin government trying to suppress all dissent , we need you now more than ever . "
oleg orlov , the head of memorial , one of russia 's oldest human rights groups , said europe had the power to help turn the tide in russia .
" speaking out on human rights in russia wo n't threaten europe 's energy supply but it would really help to curb the government 's crackdown , " orlov said .
" russian civil society is under attack and we need germany to speak up . "
the activists also criticised the planning of next week 's meeting in berlin , saying that no russian human rights groups had been invited .
eu criticizes putin 's government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian reporter anna politkovskaya 's murder points to human rights problems under putin the meeting in berlin coincided with the release of the eu parliament 's annual human rights report .
the parliament in strasbourg strongly criticised the russian government over human rights , regretting that the eu has had " only limited success in bringing about policy change as a result of raising difficult issues . "
the report attacked russian legislation limiting the activities of ngos and that journalists and human rights defenders have been threatened .
it also highlighted the murder of russian journalist anna politkovskaya and allegations of russian involvement in the poisoning of former russian agent alexander litvinenko in london .
serious concerns about china in addition to russia , the eu raised concern about turkey , iran and china .
china 's human rights record is a matter of " serious concern " and should thus " receive more focus in the build-up to the beijing olympic games , " parliament members said , emphasising the need to strengthen and improve dialogue on the issue between the eu and china .
members urged the european commission and member states " to raise the question of tibet " in talks with the beijing government , adding that trade relations with china should be contingent upon human rights reform .
china has ruled tibet since 1951 , since troops were sent to " liberate " the region .
subsequent uprisings have been violently supressed .
china on thursday warned visiting foreigners against engaging in activities that threaten the nation 's unity , as a rights group demanded the release of four americans detained for a pro-tibet protest .
" limited progress " in other countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's record was criticized by the eu the report also noted a deterioration of the human rights situation in iran , including " the intensification of the repression against human rights defenders . "
the report also voiced concern over the " limited progress " on human rights issues in turkey and encouraged the ankara government to change article 301 of its penal code , which outlaws the denigration of " turkishness . "
it raises concerns over religious freedoms and minority rights , including for the kurds in the southeast of the country .
the eu itself does not escape censure in the parliamentary report which says the union should have taken " more unilateral action " to persuade the sudanese government to accept an international peacekeeping force in darfur .
parliament members want " a plan of specific , targeted sanctions to be imposed on the khartoum regime ... in the event of non-compliance with the demands of the international community . "
the parliament also called on the eu to urge the us government to " charge or release " its guantanamo detainees " in accordance with international law .

" i would like to see bochum win the match and schalke lift the trophy , " said peter neururer , who has coached both teams in the past .
schalke have not lost in five trips to bochum , winning four and drawing once .
but bochum boast the bundesliga top scorer in theofanis gekas , who is ready to add to his 18 goals before a summer move to bayer leverkusen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cutouts will be replaced with the real thing if schalke win the next four matches schalke are aware of the danger , with sports director andreas müller expecting the match to be trickier than the game in a fortnight at their biggest regional rival borussia dortmund .
" a lot of people are talking about the dortmund match , but bochum could be much tougher for us , " müller said .
" we have to win the last four games . "
schalke lead the way with 62 points from werder bremen -lrb- 60 -rrb- and vfb stuttgart -lrb- 58 -rrb- , and ca n't afford to drop points if they really want to lift the trophy for the first time since 1958 .
" i do n't think we will relinquish the lead , " schalke playmaker lincoln said .
" but if we do we are strong enough to reclaim it . "
schalke coach mirko slomka said his side must concentrate on winning their last four games - against bochum , nuremberg , dortmund and arminia bielefeld - to make the title safe .
" it 's not a question of waiting for one of the others to slip up , we just have to put on a good performance ourselves , " he said .
relegation free-for-all continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz 's zidan is in the middle of the battle to avoid relegation in 11th place , bochum , are just three points clear of the drop zone and in a fierce fight against relegation involving more than half of the league 's 18 teams .
former champions borussia mönchengladbach are the only club all but beyond hope eight points away from safety .

germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble remains in favor of the controversial practice , but will wait for a legal ruling . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble faced massive criticism this week after it was revealed that german intelligence agencies were secretly snooping on terrorism suspects via the internet . schäuble has ordered a temporary halt to the practice .
" there is a moratorium , " a spokeswoman for the interior ministry confirmed in the financial times deutschland newspaper on friday .
intelligence agencies have monitored suspects ' computers via the internet for two years , according to members of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee .
privacy concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics question the legality of internet snooping representatives from all political parties questioned the legality of the practice .
critics say the secret searches violate article 13 of the german basic law , which governs privacy .
schäuble , of the christian democratic union , has suggested the government consider expanding article 13 to allow it .
but the government does n't want to go ahead with the monitoring until a clear legal foundation is provided , schäuble told parliament .
until then , the monitoring will stop , he said .
schäuble faced criticism from within his party and from coalition partners in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the interior experts for the cdu / csu , hans-peter uhl and ralf göbel , called the intelligence agency searches were " legally questionable . "
the measures are necessary , but require a " sustainable legal basis , " they said in a statement .
important intelligence tool bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say spying is an important tool in fighting terrorism schäuble has called for a change in the law , saying the monitoring is an important intelligence tool and that the practice should continue .
a special law already exists in the german state of north rhine-westphalia which allows computers to be searched without their owners ' knowledge .

germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble remains in favor of the controversial practice , but will wait for a legal ruling . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble faced massive criticism this week after it was revealed that german intelligence agencies were secretly snooping on terrorism suspects via the internet . schäuble has ordered a temporary halt to the practice .
" there is a moratorium , " a spokeswoman for the interior ministry confirmed in the financial times deutschland newspaper on friday .
intelligence agencies have monitored suspects ' computers via the internet for two years , according to members of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee .
privacy concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics question the legality of internet snooping representatives from all political parties questioned the legality of the practice .
critics say the secret searches violate article 13 of the german basic law , which governs privacy .
schäuble , of the christian democratic union , has suggested the government consider expanding article 13 to allow it .
but the government does n't want to go ahead with the monitoring until a clear legal foundation is provided , schäuble told parliament .
until then , the monitoring will stop , he said .
schäuble faced criticism from within his party and from coalition partners in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the interior experts for the cdu / csu , hans-peter uhl and ralf göbel , called the intelligence agency searches were " legally questionable . "
the measures are necessary , but require a " sustainable legal basis , " they said in a statement .
important intelligence tool bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say spying is an important tool in fighting terrorism schäuble has called for a change in the law , saying the monitoring is an important intelligence tool and that the practice should continue .
a special law already exists in the german state of north rhine-westphalia which allows computers to be searched without their owners ' knowledge .
the chancellor 's office insists that terrorism makes examining pc hard drives necessary .
it also said computer monitoring played a role in deployment planning in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , according to parliament records .
germany 's interior intelligence agency , the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- has been accessing private data via the internet since june , 2005 .
the prior interior minister , otto schily , altered regulations to allow it .
according to the chancellor 's office , a decision by the german federal court in january , 2007 , which allowed for online data searches to be prosecuted , does not apply to the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
but politicians argue that schily 's regulations do not provide a sustainable legal foundation for internet spying .
skepticism remains politicians from other parties have maintained skepticism over the necessity of the program and have expressed concern that it violates privacy .
berlin 's state interior minister , ehrhart körting , said the practice was not very efficient , because it catches only the least sophisticated computer users who do n't know how to defend against so-called trojan programs . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german intelligence must stop computer spying , lawmakers say intelligence agencies said they have been monitoring suspects ' computers via the internet , but lawmakers called for an immediate stop to the controversial practice .

he said the government should halt plans for greater access to phone and internet records .

granted the composer 's name does have selling power , but is there room in the region for another classical venue ? " it will be a one-of-a-kind concert hall , " said karin hempel-soos , spokesperson for bonn ’ s culture council and driving force behind the plans for a new festival concert hall in germany ’ s former capital .
the estimated 60 to 80 million euro -lrb- $ 81-108 million -rrb- hall is meant to draw top-notch performers and put bonn - and beethoven - in the big leagues , along with salzburg and mozart , and bayreuth and wagner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house in bonn is now a museum it may be completed as early as 2011 , well in time for the composer ’ s 250th birthday in 2020 .
a design contest for the building is said to be in the works , and according to bonn ’ s daily general-anzeiger , the who ’ s-who of architecture are being taken into consideration : tadao ando , frank gehry , jacques herzog , pierre de meuron and thomas van den valentyn , for example . critics , however , are wondering whether the glamorous hall , top artists and a big-name mascot will be enough to attract the most important ingredient - enough music lovers to fill the planned 1,400 seats .
“ there ’ s a lot of competition for the concert hall in bonn , ” wrote the city ’ s daily paper . an oversaturated music market ? within the past few years , western germany ’ s rhine and ruhr valley regions have invested millions of both public and private funds in constructing new classical music venues and renovating older ones .
all of them are within an hour ’ s drive from bonn .
in duisburg the mercatorhalle has been transformed into a massive 150 million-euro -lrb- $ 204 million -rrb- complex that includes a 1,750-seat concert hall as well as a shopping mall , casino and conference center .
it opened on april 21 .
dortmund , minutes away from duisburg , opened a new 50 million euro , 1,550-seat concert hall in 2002 .
essen renovated its philharmonic in 2004 and düsseldorf modernized its world-renowned tonhalle in 2005 .
bochum , also in the ruhr valley , is planning to complete a 29.3 million euro concert hall in 2010 in honor of the region ’ s distinction that year as europe ’ s culture capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this statue on bonn 's central square reminds passersby of the city 's connection to beethoven the cologne philharmonic , considered to be one of the most beautiful concert halls in the world , is barely a half-hour drive from bonn .
" per year , 90,000 tickets to the cologne philharmonic are sold to bonn residents because they don ’ t have anything like that in bonn , " said hempel-soos .
she also estimated that there were around a million potential concert-goers in the area directly surrounding bonn . they won ’ t go to dortmund or duisburg , she said , because bonn will offer something completely different - world-class in everything from the building to the performers . questioning priorities for her , it ’ s matter-of-fact that the composer should be honored in his birthplace - and with much more than the less-than-modern beethoven hall , built in 1959 , the smaller chamber music house , museum and numerous monuments that already adorn the city . still , some are asking whether it ’ s wise to build an additional venue instead of using a fraction of the money to pay for renovations to other cultural institutions .
bonn ’ s theater , for example , where operas , ballets and some plays are performed , could use a 20 million euro overhaul , according to the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger . it ’ s not the city of bonn that will be cutting a check for the new venue , however .
though nothing has been put in ink quite yet , three major german companies headquartered in bonn - deutsche telekom , deutsche post and postbank - are on deck to finance 100 percent of the construction costs . after the project is completed , a partially public foundation will be set up to ensure that the level of artistic quality remains high .
after all , big-name musicians aren ’ t cheaper by the dozen .
employee benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's existing beethoven hall , built in 1959 , is wanting in acoustics and aesthetics as a sponsor , the postbank is counting on the magnetic power of the legendary hall to-be .
" it is important to the company that bonn is an attractive city for its employees , " said postbank spokesperson joachim strunk , who added that it ’ s a way to encourage employee retention .
telekom ’ s commitment to the elite project , however , coincides with the current negotiations over cutting pay and increasing work time for 50,000 of its employees , who may not necessarily be enthusiastic about the multi-million euro deal .
with beethoven as the helm , organizers have set their sights way beyond bonn , however .
" it is critical that the artistic program is at a first-class level , in order to make an international name for bonn as the city of beethoven , " said strunk .
for hempel-soos , the formula for making bonn the city of beethoven is simple : " when the best musicians in the world come to bonn , the audiences will come too .

granted the composer 's name does have selling power , but is there room in the region for another classical venue ? " it will be a one-of-a-kind concert hall , " said karin hempel-soos , spokesperson for bonn ’ s culture council and driving force behind the plans for a new festival concert hall in germany ’ s former capital .
the estimated 60 to 80 million euro -lrb- $ 81-108 million -rrb- hall is meant to draw top-notch performers and put bonn - and beethoven - in the big leagues , along with salzburg and mozart , and bayreuth and wagner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house in bonn is now a museum it may be completed as early as 2011 , well in time for the composer ’ s 250th birthday in 2020 .
a design contest for the building is said to be in the works , and according to bonn ’ s daily general-anzeiger , the who ’ s-who of architecture are being taken into consideration : tadao ando , frank gehry , jacques herzog , pierre de meuron and thomas van den valentyn , for example . critics , however , are wondering whether the glamorous hall , top artists and a big-name mascot will be enough to attract the most important ingredient - enough music lovers to fill the planned 1,400 seats .
“ there ’ s a lot of competition for the concert hall in bonn , ” wrote the city ’ s daily paper . an oversaturated music market ? within the past few years , western germany ’ s rhine and ruhr valley regions have invested millions of both public and private funds in constructing new classical music venues and renovating older ones .
all of them are within an hour ’ s drive from bonn .
in duisburg the mercatorhalle has been transformed into a massive 150 million-euro -lrb- $ 204 million -rrb- complex that includes a 1,750-seat concert hall as well as a shopping mall , casino and conference center .
it opened on april 21 .
dortmund , minutes away from duisburg , opened a new 50 million euro , 1,550-seat concert hall in 2002 .
essen renovated its philharmonic in 2004 and düsseldorf modernized its world-renowned tonhalle in 2005 .
bochum , also in the ruhr valley , is planning to complete a 29.3 million euro concert hall in 2010 in honor of the region ’ s distinction that year as europe ’ s culture capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this statue on bonn 's central square reminds passersby of the city 's connection to beethoven the cologne philharmonic , considered to be one of the most beautiful concert halls in the world , is barely a half-hour drive from bonn .
" per year , 90,000 tickets to the cologne philharmonic are sold to bonn residents because they don ’ t have anything like that in bonn , " said hempel-soos .
she also estimated that there were around a million potential concert-goers in the area directly surrounding bonn . they won ’ t go to dortmund or duisburg , she said , because bonn will offer something completely different - world-class in everything from the building to the performers . questioning priorities for her , it ’ s matter-of-fact that the composer should be honored in his birthplace - and with much more than the less-than-modern beethoven hall , built in 1959 , the smaller chamber music house , museum and numerous monuments that already adorn the city . still , some are asking whether it ’ s wise to build an additional venue instead of using a fraction of the money to pay for renovations to other cultural institutions .
bonn ’ s theater , for example , where operas , ballets and some plays are performed , could use a 20 million euro overhaul , according to the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger . it ’ s not the city of bonn that will be cutting a check for the new venue , however .
though nothing has been put in ink quite yet , three major german companies headquartered in bonn - deutsche telekom , deutsche post and postbank - are on deck to finance 100 percent of the construction costs . after the project is completed , a partially public foundation will be set up to ensure that the level of artistic quality remains high .
after all , big-name musicians aren ’ t cheaper by the dozen .
employee benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's existing beethoven hall , built in 1959 , is wanting in acoustics and aesthetics as a sponsor , the postbank is counting on the magnetic power of the legendary hall to-be .
" it is important to the company that bonn is an attractive city for its employees , " said postbank spokesperson joachim strunk , who added that it ’ s a way to encourage employee retention .
telekom ’ s commitment to the elite project , however , coincides with the current negotiations over cutting pay and increasing work time for 50,000 of its employees , who may not necessarily be enthusiastic about the multi-million euro deal .
with beethoven as the helm , organizers have set their sights way beyond bonn , however .
" it is critical that the artistic program is at a first-class level , in order to make an international name for bonn as the city of beethoven , " said strunk .
for hempel-soos , the formula for making bonn the city of beethoven is simple : " when the best musicians in the world come to bonn , the audiences will come too . " kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain takes center stage at beethovenfest the beethovenfest , bonn 's annual tribute to its most famous son , will this year focus on the composer 's numerous links with britain .

the original constitution has been ratified by 18 of the 27 eu member states but was kicked into the political long grass in 2005 when french and dutch voters rejected it in national referendums .
the german eu presidency , which has arranged bilateral consultations with member states over an intensive two-week period from april 23 to may 4 , is making every effort " to restrict changes to what is absolutely necessary to reach an overall agreement and ensure ratification in all member states , " according to the questionnaire 's introduction .

the original constitution has been ratified by 18 of the 27 eu member states but was kicked into the political long grass in 2005 when french and dutch voters rejected it in national referendums .
the german eu presidency , which has arranged bilateral consultations with member states over an intensive two-week period from april 23 to may 4 , is making every effort " to restrict changes to what is absolutely necessary to reach an overall agreement and ensure ratification in all member states , " according to the questionnaire 's introduction .
among the most euroskeptic nations are the netherlands and britain .
british prime minister tony blair said last friday that his country no longer needs to hold a referendum on any new european union treaty , a move welcomed by eu leaders battling to replace the bloc 's near-dead constitution .
blair said the eu treaty he favors to replace the failed one would not require a british referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in brussels were relieved by blair 's comments " if it 's not a constitutional treaty , so that it alters the basic relationship between europe and the member states , then there is n't the same case for a referendum , " he told papers including britain 's financial times .
lowest common denominator in the introduction to its questionnaire , the german presidency says that a european summit on june 21-22 should decide to open " an intergovernmental conference with a very precise and limited mandate " on the constitution , with the aim of getting it ratified by all members before the next european parliamentary elections in 2009 .

granted the composer 's name does have selling power , but is there room in the region for another classical venue ? " it will be a one-of-a-kind concert hall , " said karin hempel-soos , spokesperson for bonn ’ s culture council and driving force behind the plans for a new festival concert hall in germany ’ s former capital .
the estimated 60 to 80 million euro -lrb- $ 81-108 million -rrb- hall is meant to draw top-notch performers and put bonn - and beethoven - in the big leagues , along with salzburg and mozart , and bayreuth and wagner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house in bonn is now a museum it may be completed as early as 2011 , well in time for the composer ’ s 250th birthday in 2020 .
a design contest for the building is said to be in the works , and according to bonn ’ s daily general-anzeiger , the who ’ s-who of architecture are being taken into consideration : tadao ando , frank gehry , jacques herzog , pierre de meuron and thomas van den valentyn , for example . critics , however , are wondering whether the glamorous hall , top artists and a big-name mascot will be enough to attract the most important ingredient - enough music lovers to fill the planned 1,400 seats .
“ there ’ s a lot of competition for the concert hall in bonn , ” wrote the city ’ s daily paper . an oversaturated music market ? within the past few years , western germany ’ s rhine and ruhr valley regions have invested millions of both public and private funds in constructing new classical music venues and renovating older ones .
all of them are within an hour ’ s drive from bonn .
in duisburg the mercatorhalle has been transformed into a massive 150 million-euro -lrb- $ 204 million -rrb- complex that includes a 1,750-seat concert hall as well as a shopping mall , casino and conference center .
it opened on april 21 .
dortmund , minutes away from duisburg , opened a new 50 million euro , 1,550-seat concert hall in 2002 .
essen renovated its philharmonic in 2004 and düsseldorf modernized its world-renowned tonhalle in 2005 .
bochum , also in the ruhr valley , is planning to complete a 29.3 million euro concert hall in 2010 in honor of the region ’ s distinction that year as europe ’ s culture capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this statue on bonn 's central square reminds passersby of the city 's connection to beethoven the cologne philharmonic , considered to be one of the most beautiful concert halls in the world , is barely a half-hour drive from bonn .
" per year , 90,000 tickets to the cologne philharmonic are sold to bonn residents because they don ’ t have anything like that in bonn , " said hempel-soos .
she also estimated that there were around a million potential concert-goers in the area directly surrounding bonn . they won ’ t go to dortmund or duisburg , she said , because bonn will offer something completely different - world-class in everything from the building to the performers . questioning priorities for her , it ’ s matter-of-fact that the composer should be honored in his birthplace - and with much more than the less-than-modern beethoven hall , built in 1959 , the smaller chamber music house , museum and numerous monuments that already adorn the city . still , some are asking whether it ’ s wise to build an additional venue instead of using a fraction of the money to pay for renovations to other cultural institutions .
bonn ’ s theater , for example , where operas , ballets and some plays are performed , could use a 20 million euro overhaul , according to the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger . it ’ s not the city of bonn that will be cutting a check for the new venue , however .
though nothing has been put in ink quite yet , three major german companies headquartered in bonn - deutsche telekom , deutsche post and postbank - are on deck to finance 100 percent of the construction costs . after the project is completed , a partially public foundation will be set up to ensure that the level of artistic quality remains high .
after all , big-name musicians aren ’ t cheaper by the dozen .

" it is important to the company that bonn is an attractive city for its employees , " said postbank spokesperson joachim strunk , who added that it ’ s a way to encourage employee retention .
telekom ’ s commitment to the elite project , however , coincides with the current negotiations over cutting pay and increasing work time for 50,000 of its employees , who may not necessarily be enthusiastic about the multi-million euro deal .
with beethoven as the helm , organizers have set their sights way beyond bonn , however .
" it is critical that the artistic program is at a first-class level , in order to make an international name for bonn as the city of beethoven , " said strunk .
for hempel-soos , the formula for making bonn the city of beethoven is simple : " when the best musicians in the world come to bonn , the audiences will come too .

the original constitution has been ratified by 18 of the 27 eu member states but was kicked into the political long grass in 2005 when french and dutch voters rejected it in national referendums .
the german eu presidency , which has arranged bilateral consultations with member states over an intensive two-week period from april 23 to may 4 , is making every effort " to restrict changes to what is absolutely necessary to reach an overall agreement and ensure ratification in all member states , " according to the questionnaire 's introduction .
among the most euroskeptic nations are the netherlands and britain .
british prime minister tony blair said last friday that his country no longer needs to hold a referendum on any new european union treaty , a move welcomed by eu leaders battling to replace the bloc 's near-dead constitution .
blair said the eu treaty he favors to replace the failed one would not require a british referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in brussels were relieved by blair 's comments " if it 's not a constitutional treaty , so that it alters the basic relationship between europe and the member states , then there is n't the same case for a referendum , " he told papers including britain 's financial times .
lowest common denominator in the introduction to its questionnaire , the german presidency says that a european summit on june 21-22 should decide to open " an intergovernmental conference with a very precise and limited mandate " on the constitution , with the aim of getting it ratified by all members before the next european parliamentary elections in 2009 .
the 12 questions are based on suggestions arising from previous bilateral negotiations , as the germans attempt to discover what the minimum changes each country would insist upon are for a new treaty to be acceptable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even metioning an eu anthem is touchy hence many of the questions have been in effect drawn up by the less enthusiastic member states .

these name changes would be made " without changing the legal substance " of the measures , the german paper assures .

granted the composer 's name does have selling power , but is there room in the region for another classical venue ? " it will be a one-of-a-kind concert hall , " said karin hempel-soos , spokesperson for bonn ’ s culture council and driving force behind the plans for a new festival concert hall in germany ’ s former capital .
the estimated 60 to 80 million euro -lrb- $ 81-108 million -rrb- hall is meant to draw top-notch performers and put bonn - and beethoven - in the big leagues , along with salzburg and mozart , and bayreuth and wagner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house in bonn is now a museum it may be completed as early as 2011 , well in time for the composer ’ s 250th birthday in 2020 .
a design contest for the building is said to be in the works , and according to bonn ’ s daily general-anzeiger , the who ’ s-who of architecture are being taken into consideration : tadao ando , frank gehry , jacques herzog , pierre de meuron and thomas van den valentyn , for example . critics , however , are wondering whether the glamorous hall , top artists and a big-name mascot will be enough to attract the most important ingredient - enough music lovers to fill the planned 1,400 seats .
“ there ’ s a lot of competition for the concert hall in bonn , ” wrote the city ’ s daily paper . an oversaturated music market ? within the past few years , western germany ’ s rhine and ruhr valley regions have invested millions of both public and private funds in constructing new classical music venues and renovating older ones .

it opened on april 21 .

essen renovated its philharmonic in 2004 and düsseldorf modernized its world-renowned tonhalle in 2005 .
bochum , also in the ruhr valley , is planning to complete a 29.3 million euro concert hall in 2010 in honor of the region ’ s distinction that year as europe ’ s culture capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this statue on bonn 's central square reminds passersby of the city 's connection to beethoven the cologne philharmonic , considered to be one of the most beautiful concert halls in the world , is barely a half-hour drive from bonn .
" per year , 90,000 tickets to the cologne philharmonic are sold to bonn residents because they don ’ t have anything like that in bonn , " said hempel-soos .
she also estimated that there were around a million potential concert-goers in the area directly surrounding bonn . they won ’ t go to dortmund or duisburg , she said , because bonn will offer something completely different - world-class in everything from the building to the performers . questioning priorities for her , it ’ s matter-of-fact that the composer should be honored in his birthplace - and with much more than the less-than-modern beethoven hall , built in 1959 , the smaller chamber music house , museum and numerous monuments that already adorn the city . still , some are asking whether it ’ s wise to build an additional venue instead of using a fraction of the money to pay for renovations to other cultural institutions .

she also estimated that there were around a million potential concert-goers in the area directly surrounding bonn . they won ’ t go to dortmund or duisburg , she said , because bonn will offer something completely different - world-class in everything from the building to the performers . questioning priorities for her , it ’ s matter-of-fact that the composer should be honored in his birthplace - and with much more than the less-than-modern beethoven hall , built in 1959 , the smaller chamber music house , museum and numerous monuments that already adorn the city . still , some are asking whether it ’ s wise to build an additional venue instead of using a fraction of the money to pay for renovations to other cultural institutions .
bonn ’ s theater , for example , where operas , ballets and some plays are performed , could use a 20 million euro overhaul , according to the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger . it ’ s not the city of bonn that will be cutting a check for the new venue , however .
though nothing has been put in ink quite yet , three major german companies headquartered in bonn - deutsche telekom , deutsche post and postbank - are on deck to finance 100 percent of the construction costs . after the project is completed , a partially public foundation will be set up to ensure that the level of artistic quality remains high .
after all , big-name musicians aren ’ t cheaper by the dozen .

" it is important to the company that bonn is an attractive city for its employees , " said postbank spokesperson joachim strunk , who added that it ’ s a way to encourage employee retention .
telekom ’ s commitment to the elite project , however , coincides with the current negotiations over cutting pay and increasing work time for 50,000 of its employees , who may not necessarily be enthusiastic about the multi-million euro deal .
with beethoven as the helm , organizers have set their sights way beyond bonn , however .
" it is critical that the artistic program is at a first-class level , in order to make an international name for bonn as the city of beethoven , " said strunk .

the original constitution has been ratified by 18 of the 27 eu member states but was kicked into the political long grass in 2005 when french and dutch voters rejected it in national referendums .
the german eu presidency , which has arranged bilateral consultations with member states over an intensive two-week period from april 23 to may 4 , is making every effort " to restrict changes to what is absolutely necessary to reach an overall agreement and ensure ratification in all member states , " according to the questionnaire 's introduction .
among the most euroskeptic nations are the netherlands and britain .
british prime minister tony blair said last friday that his country no longer needs to hold a referendum on any new european union treaty , a move welcomed by eu leaders battling to replace the bloc 's near-dead constitution .

granted the composer 's name does have selling power , but is there room in the region for another classical venue ? " it will be a one-of-a-kind concert hall , " said karin hempel-soos , spokesperson for bonn ’ s culture council and driving force behind the plans for a new festival concert hall in germany ’ s former capital .
the estimated 60 to 80 million euro -lrb- $ 81-108 million -rrb- hall is meant to draw top-notch performers and put bonn - and beethoven - in the big leagues , along with salzburg and mozart , and bayreuth and wagner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house in bonn is now a museum it may be completed as early as 2011 , well in time for the composer ’ s 250th birthday in 2020 .
a design contest for the building is said to be in the works , and according to bonn ’ s daily general-anzeiger , the who ’ s-who of architecture are being taken into consideration : tadao ando , frank gehry , jacques herzog , pierre de meuron and thomas van den valentyn , for example . critics , however , are wondering whether the glamorous hall , top artists and a big-name mascot will be enough to attract the most important ingredient - enough music lovers to fill the planned 1,400 seats .
“ there ’ s a lot of competition for the concert hall in bonn , ” wrote the city ’ s daily paper . an oversaturated music market ? within the past few years , western germany ’ s rhine and ruhr valley regions have invested millions of both public and private funds in constructing new classical music venues and renovating older ones .

cup holders sevilla fell in the night 's other semi-final 1-0 to osasuna . barcelona espanyol headed in two goals from corner kicks in front of a home crowd thursday night and gave thomas schaaf 's side a clear outline of what the team will have to improve before the semi-final 's second leg kicks off place in bremen . espanyol moved out in front of bremen midway through the first half when moises hurtado headed into goal on an ivan de la pena corner , then doubled their lead shortly after the halftime break when walter pandiani put in another de la pena corner kick .
espanyol 's third goal came in the game 's final minutes from substitute ferran corominas . german international torsten frings said bremen would have a difficult time preventing an all-spanish uefa cup final in glasgow on may 16 . bremen need a " miracle " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese will miss the second semi-final leg for a professional foul in barcelona " you ca n't make mistakes like that if you want to be the uefa cup winners , 3-0 is a big loss , " he said .
" we 'll need a pretty big miracle .
with a performance like this one , we do n't have a chance . " the german side , which has n't lost a bundesliga match since mid-february , appeared to have forgotten to unpack its offensive arsenal made up of playmaker diego and world cup golden boot winner miroslav klose , neither of whom were able to leave an impression on the match . both teams will be without key players for this thursday 's second leg .
goal scorers moises and pandiani both received yellow cards and will be will be suspended for the match in bremen . the bundesliga side finished the match with 10 men and will play with a back-up goalie between the posts after tim wiese received a red card for hauling down espanyol striker raul tamudo outside the area . " after the red card it was difficult for us to get back into it , " schaaf said .

germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble remains in favor of the controversial practice , but will wait for a legal ruling . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble faced massive criticism this week after it was revealed that german intelligence agencies were secretly snooping on terrorism suspects via the internet . schäuble has ordered a temporary halt to the practice .
" there is a moratorium , " a spokeswoman for the interior ministry confirmed in the financial times deutschland newspaper on friday .
intelligence agencies have monitored suspects ' computers via the internet for two years , according to members of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee .
privacy concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics question the legality of internet snooping representatives from all political parties questioned the legality of the practice .
critics say the secret searches violate article 13 of the german basic law , which governs privacy .
schäuble , of the christian democratic union , has suggested the government consider expanding article 13 to allow it .
but the government does n't want to go ahead with the monitoring until a clear legal foundation is provided , schäuble told parliament .
until then , the monitoring will stop , he said .
schäuble faced criticism from within his party and from coalition partners in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the interior experts for the cdu / csu , hans-peter uhl and ralf göbel , called the intelligence agency searches were " legally questionable . "
the measures are necessary , but require a " sustainable legal basis , " they said in a statement .
important intelligence tool bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say spying is an important tool in fighting terrorism schäuble has called for a change in the law , saying the monitoring is an important intelligence tool and that the practice should continue .
a special law already exists in the german state of north rhine-westphalia which allows computers to be searched without their owners ' knowledge .
the chancellor 's office insists that terrorism makes examining pc hard drives necessary .
it also said computer monitoring played a role in deployment planning in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , according to parliament records .
germany 's interior intelligence agency , the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- has been accessing private data via the internet since june , 2005 .
the prior interior minister , otto schily , altered regulations to allow it .
according to the chancellor 's office , a decision by the german federal court in january , 2007 , which allowed for online data searches to be prosecuted , does not apply to the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
but politicians argue that schily 's regulations do not provide a sustainable legal foundation for internet spying .
skepticism remains politicians from other parties have maintained skepticism over the necessity of the program and have expressed concern that it violates privacy .
berlin 's state interior minister , ehrhart körting , said the practice was not very efficient , because it catches only the least sophisticated computer users who do n't know how to defend against so-called trojan programs . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german intelligence must stop computer spying , lawmakers say intelligence agencies said they have been monitoring suspects ' computers via the internet , but lawmakers called for an immediate stop to the controversial practice .

granted the composer 's name does have selling power , but is there room in the region for another classical venue ? " it will be a one-of-a-kind concert hall , " said karin hempel-soos , spokesperson for bonn ’ s culture council and driving force behind the plans for a new festival concert hall in germany ’ s former capital .
the estimated 60 to 80 million euro -lrb- $ 81-108 million -rrb- hall is meant to draw top-notch performers and put bonn - and beethoven - in the big leagues , along with salzburg and mozart , and bayreuth and wagner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house in bonn is now a museum it may be completed as early as 2011 , well in time for the composer ’ s 250th birthday in 2020 .
a design contest for the building is said to be in the works , and according to bonn ’ s daily general-anzeiger , the who ’ s-who of architecture are being taken into consideration : tadao ando , frank gehry , jacques herzog , pierre de meuron and thomas van den valentyn , for example . critics , however , are wondering whether the glamorous hall , top artists and a big-name mascot will be enough to attract the most important ingredient - enough music lovers to fill the planned 1,400 seats .
“ there ’ s a lot of competition for the concert hall in bonn , ” wrote the city ’ s daily paper . an oversaturated music market ? within the past few years , western germany ’ s rhine and ruhr valley regions have invested millions of both public and private funds in constructing new classical music venues and renovating older ones .
all of them are within an hour ’ s drive from bonn .
in duisburg the mercatorhalle has been transformed into a massive 150 million-euro -lrb- $ 204 million -rrb- complex that includes a 1,750-seat concert hall as well as a shopping mall , casino and conference center .
it opened on april 21 .
dortmund , minutes away from duisburg , opened a new 50 million euro , 1,550-seat concert hall in 2002 .
essen renovated its philharmonic in 2004 and düsseldorf modernized its world-renowned tonhalle in 2005 .
bochum , also in the ruhr valley , is planning to complete a 29.3 million euro concert hall in 2010 in honor of the region ’ s distinction that year as europe ’ s culture capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this statue on bonn 's central square reminds passersby of the city 's connection to beethoven the cologne philharmonic , considered to be one of the most beautiful concert halls in the world , is barely a half-hour drive from bonn .
" per year , 90,000 tickets to the cologne philharmonic are sold to bonn residents because they don ’ t have anything like that in bonn , " said hempel-soos .
she also estimated that there were around a million potential concert-goers in the area directly surrounding bonn . they won ’ t go to dortmund or duisburg , she said , because bonn will offer something completely different - world-class in everything from the building to the performers . questioning priorities for her , it ’ s matter-of-fact that the composer should be honored in his birthplace - and with much more than the less-than-modern beethoven hall , built in 1959 , the smaller chamber music house , museum and numerous monuments that already adorn the city . still , some are asking whether it ’ s wise to build an additional venue instead of using a fraction of the money to pay for renovations to other cultural institutions .
bonn ’ s theater , for example , where operas , ballets and some plays are performed , could use a 20 million euro overhaul , according to the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger . it ’ s not the city of bonn that will be cutting a check for the new venue , however .
though nothing has been put in ink quite yet , three major german companies headquartered in bonn - deutsche telekom , deutsche post and postbank - are on deck to finance 100 percent of the construction costs . after the project is completed , a partially public foundation will be set up to ensure that the level of artistic quality remains high .
after all , big-name musicians aren ’ t cheaper by the dozen .
employee benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's existing beethoven hall , built in 1959 , is wanting in acoustics and aesthetics as a sponsor , the postbank is counting on the magnetic power of the legendary hall to-be .
" it is important to the company that bonn is an attractive city for its employees , " said postbank spokesperson joachim strunk , who added that it ’ s a way to encourage employee retention .
telekom ’ s commitment to the elite project , however , coincides with the current negotiations over cutting pay and increasing work time for 50,000 of its employees , who may not necessarily be enthusiastic about the multi-million euro deal .
with beethoven as the helm , organizers have set their sights way beyond bonn , however .
" it is critical that the artistic program is at a first-class level , in order to make an international name for bonn as the city of beethoven , " said strunk .
for hempel-soos , the formula for making bonn the city of beethoven is simple : " when the best musicians in the world come to bonn , the audiences will come too .

" i would like to see bochum win the match and schalke lift the trophy , " said peter neururer , who has coached both teams in the past .
schalke have not lost in five trips to bochum , winning four and drawing once .
but bochum boast the bundesliga top scorer in theofanis gekas , who is ready to add to his 18 goals before a summer move to bayer leverkusen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cutouts will be replaced with the real thing if schalke win the next four matches schalke are aware of the danger , with sports director andreas müller expecting the match to be trickier than the game in a fortnight at their biggest regional rival borussia dortmund .
" a lot of people are talking about the dortmund match , but bochum could be much tougher for us , " müller said .
" we have to win the last four games . "
schalke lead the way with 62 points from werder bremen -lrb- 60 -rrb- and vfb stuttgart -lrb- 58 -rrb- , and ca n't afford to drop points if they really want to lift the trophy for the first time since 1958 .
" i do n't think we will relinquish the lead , " schalke playmaker lincoln said .
" but if we do we are strong enough to reclaim it . "
schalke coach mirko slomka said his side must concentrate on winning their last four games - against bochum , nuremberg , dortmund and arminia bielefeld - to make the title safe .
" it 's not a question of waiting for one of the others to slip up , we just have to put on a good performance ourselves , " he said .

former champions borussia mönchengladbach are the only club all but beyond hope eight points away from safety .
relegation could become a fact for them if they lose at home on saturday against stuttgart , who are coming off a morale-boosting 2-0 against champions bayern munich and are in the running for a league and cup double .
bremen left wondering about klose the real danger for schalke comes from bremen , who may be left contending only for the german title as their uefa cup chances nearly disintegrated after a 3-0 semi-final loss in barcelona to espanyol on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been tight lipped about whether he 'll keep hugging bremen players next season bremen 's bundesliga match at troubled arminia bielefeld comes on sunday and could be overshadowed by speculation that their top striker miroslav klose will leave for archrival munich .
bremen president jürgen born and sports director klaus allofs , however , ruled out a transfer within germany but reiterated that klose could get out of his contract , which runs until 2008 , if he has an offer from a foreign club .
german media reported that klose met with munich officials , while spanish media said the german goal scorer was set to join barcelona .
" there is a contract with miroslav klose until 2008 and we have received no offer , neither from munich nor barcelona , " born said .

mark van bommel , owen hargreaves and claudio pizarro are all also struggling against injuries but are likely to finish the season .
second-from-bottom mainz 05 will be praying for three points and some magic from their egyptian striker mohamed zidan , who has bagged 11 goals this season when they host mid-table hanover .

" there will clearly be a discussion within nato , there will clearly be a discussion between capitals and the russian federation on what they mean . "
making his last state of the nation speech in moscow , putin said thursday that russia could pull out of the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty until all of nato 's current members ratified it .
" it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence ... until it has been ratified by all nato countries without exception , " he said .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said the 26 member countries had received the news with " concern , grave concern , disappointment and deep regret because the allies are of the opinion that the cfe treaty is one of the cornerstones of european security . "
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for calm .
" the arithmetic of the cold war , with its numbers of armed vehicles , missiles and troops on each side , just does n't add up any more , " he said .
" we must avoid an escalation . "
europeans call for calm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's steinmeier calls for more dialogue " what we need is not less disarmament and fewer arms controls , we need more , " said steinmeier , whose once-divided country was the frontline for the cold war .
in berlin government spokesman thomas steg called for continued dialogue , while adding that " we are strongly convinced that threats do not help . "
in france foreign ministry spokesman jean-baptiste mattei called for russia to go back on its decision , calling the cfe treaty " a cornerstone of security in europe . "
he said that debate on the treaty and the us anti-missile plan that triggered putin 's move should continue in the nato-russia joint council to overcome moscow 's suspicions .
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 in paris by the countries of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- and the former warsaw pact to limit military hardware in the region .
it was adapted in istanbul in 1999 following the collapse of the warsaw pact , in order to limit deployments on a country-by-country basis .
nato states have refused to ratify the new pact on the grounds that moscow has failed to honour commitments made in istanbul to withdraw russian forces from the former soviet republics of georgia and moldova .
increased threat of mutually assured destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's tone has become more belligerent in recent days president putin reiterated his belliegernt stance when he warned of an increased threat of mutually assured destruction in a meeting about the planned us missile shield with czech president vaclav klaus .
" the increase of the threat of mutual harm to one another , and possibly of destruction , will grow many times over , " putin said , adding the system 's proposed bases in the czech republic and poland would violate europe 's security apparatus .
although the us plans have been known for years , russia has increased its rhetoric in recent months after the czech republic and poland , eastern european countries moscow considers its sphere of influence , entered talks to house elements on their territory .
us defence secretary robert gates visited putin and other officials in moscow earlier this week to invite russia to join the project , but apparently made little progress .
washington says the shield is designed to protect against threats from iran and north korea and that its 10 interceptor missiles could not defend against russia 's thousands of warheads .
russia claims to be real target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russians consider the missile system to be a threat russia has said it is the target of the shield , and putin told klaus he was ready to invite specialists from the czech republic and poland to show neither iran nor north korea had missile systems demanding the defence system .
washington , for its part , says both north korea and iran either have or are trying to acquire atomic bombs and could in 10 years ' time have missiles that threaten europe .
klaus told russian news agencies after his talks with putin that he had been unable to explain the czech arguments for the shield .
" i assured the president the czech side did n't have the slightest intention for the radar bases -lrb- proposed for czech territory -rrb- to become a threat to russia , " klaus said .
" that 's understandable - the czech republic wo n't control the stations , " putin was quoted as saying in response .
in a meeting where putin reminded klaus his country received 75 per cent of its natural gas from energy-rich moscow and had recently signed an agreement lasting till 2035 , putin told the czech leader the shield was similar to putting nuclear missiles on european territory .
putin said he hoped the czech republic would advance russian-eu relations as european union president in 2009 .
" i have a very wide circle of questions and problems and we are glad for the opportunity to exchange opinions , " he added .
but regarding the shield , he added that " as head of state i would have to say yes , relations will worsen . "
" we wo n't raise an hysteria over this , we 'll simply take the necessary measures , " the russian leader said . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia threatens pullout from landmark arms treaty president vladimir putin on thursday threatened russian withdrawal from a landmark cold war-era arms treaty limiting military forces in europe , raising the stakes in an already tense security dispute with the west .

granted the composer 's name does have selling power , but is there room in the region for another classical venue ? " it will be a one-of-a-kind concert hall , " said karin hempel-soos , spokesperson for bonn ’ s culture council and driving force behind the plans for a new festival concert hall in germany ’ s former capital .
the estimated 60 to 80 million euro -lrb- $ 81-108 million -rrb- hall is meant to draw top-notch performers and put bonn - and beethoven - in the big leagues , along with salzburg and mozart , and bayreuth and wagner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house in bonn is now a museum it may be completed as early as 2011 , well in time for the composer ’ s 250th birthday in 2020 .
a design contest for the building is said to be in the works , and according to bonn ’ s daily general-anzeiger , the who ’ s-who of architecture are being taken into consideration : tadao ando , frank gehry , jacques herzog , pierre de meuron and thomas van den valentyn , for example . critics , however , are wondering whether the glamorous hall , top artists and a big-name mascot will be enough to attract the most important ingredient - enough music lovers to fill the planned 1,400 seats .
“ there ’ s a lot of competition for the concert hall in bonn , ” wrote the city ’ s daily paper . an oversaturated music market ? within the past few years , western germany ’ s rhine and ruhr valley regions have invested millions of both public and private funds in constructing new classical music venues and renovating older ones .
all of them are within an hour ’ s drive from bonn .
in duisburg the mercatorhalle has been transformed into a massive 150 million-euro -lrb- $ 204 million -rrb- complex that includes a 1,750-seat concert hall as well as a shopping mall , casino and conference center .
it opened on april 21 .
dortmund , minutes away from duisburg , opened a new 50 million euro , 1,550-seat concert hall in 2002 .
essen renovated its philharmonic in 2004 and düsseldorf modernized its world-renowned tonhalle in 2005 .
bochum , also in the ruhr valley , is planning to complete a 29.3 million euro concert hall in 2010 in honor of the region ’ s distinction that year as europe ’ s culture capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this statue on bonn 's central square reminds passersby of the city 's connection to beethoven the cologne philharmonic , considered to be one of the most beautiful concert halls in the world , is barely a half-hour drive from bonn .
" per year , 90,000 tickets to the cologne philharmonic are sold to bonn residents because they don ’ t have anything like that in bonn , " said hempel-soos .
she also estimated that there were around a million potential concert-goers in the area directly surrounding bonn . they won ’ t go to dortmund or duisburg , she said , because bonn will offer something completely different - world-class in everything from the building to the performers . questioning priorities for her , it ’ s matter-of-fact that the composer should be honored in his birthplace - and with much more than the less-than-modern beethoven hall , built in 1959 , the smaller chamber music house , museum and numerous monuments that already adorn the city . still , some are asking whether it ’ s wise to build an additional venue instead of using a fraction of the money to pay for renovations to other cultural institutions .
bonn ’ s theater , for example , where operas , ballets and some plays are performed , could use a 20 million euro overhaul , according to the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger . it ’ s not the city of bonn that will be cutting a check for the new venue , however .
though nothing has been put in ink quite yet , three major german companies headquartered in bonn - deutsche telekom , deutsche post and postbank - are on deck to finance 100 percent of the construction costs . after the project is completed , a partially public foundation will be set up to ensure that the level of artistic quality remains high .
after all , big-name musicians aren ’ t cheaper by the dozen .
employee benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's existing beethoven hall , built in 1959 , is wanting in acoustics and aesthetics as a sponsor , the postbank is counting on the magnetic power of the legendary hall to-be .
" it is important to the company that bonn is an attractive city for its employees , " said postbank spokesperson joachim strunk , who added that it ’ s a way to encourage employee retention .
telekom ’ s commitment to the elite project , however , coincides with the current negotiations over cutting pay and increasing work time for 50,000 of its employees , who may not necessarily be enthusiastic about the multi-million euro deal .
with beethoven as the helm , organizers have set their sights way beyond bonn , however .
" it is critical that the artistic program is at a first-class level , in order to make an international name for bonn as the city of beethoven , " said strunk .
for hempel-soos , the formula for making bonn the city of beethoven is simple : " when the best musicians in the world come to bonn , the audiences will come too .

essen renovated its philharmonic in 2004 and düsseldorf modernized its world-renowned tonhalle in 2005 .

" per year , 90,000 tickets to the cologne philharmonic are sold to bonn residents because they don ’ t have anything like that in bonn , " said hempel-soos .
she also estimated that there were around a million potential concert-goers in the area directly surrounding bonn . they won ’ t go to dortmund or duisburg , she said , because bonn will offer something completely different - world-class in everything from the building to the performers . questioning priorities for her , it ’ s matter-of-fact that the composer should be honored in his birthplace - and with much more than the less-than-modern beethoven hall , built in 1959 , the smaller chamber music house , museum and numerous monuments that already adorn the city . still , some are asking whether it ’ s wise to build an additional venue instead of using a fraction of the money to pay for renovations to other cultural institutions .
bonn ’ s theater , for example , where operas , ballets and some plays are performed , could use a 20 million euro overhaul , according to the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger . it ’ s not the city of bonn that will be cutting a check for the new venue , however .
though nothing has been put in ink quite yet , three major german companies headquartered in bonn - deutsche telekom , deutsche post and postbank - are on deck to finance 100 percent of the construction costs . after the project is completed , a partially public foundation will be set up to ensure that the level of artistic quality remains high .

telekom ’ s commitment to the elite project , however , coincides with the current negotiations over cutting pay and increasing work time for 50,000 of its employees , who may not necessarily be enthusiastic about the multi-million euro deal .
with beethoven as the helm , organizers have set their sights way beyond bonn , however .
" it is critical that the artistic program is at a first-class level , in order to make an international name for bonn as the city of beethoven , " said strunk .

she also estimated that there were around a million potential concert-goers in the area directly surrounding bonn . they won ’ t go to dortmund or duisburg , she said , because bonn will offer something completely different - world-class in everything from the building to the performers . questioning priorities for her , it ’ s matter-of-fact that the composer should be honored in his birthplace - and with much more than the less-than-modern beethoven hall , built in 1959 , the smaller chamber music house , museum and numerous monuments that already adorn the city . still , some are asking whether it ’ s wise to build an additional venue instead of using a fraction of the money to pay for renovations to other cultural institutions .
bonn ’ s theater , for example , where operas , ballets and some plays are performed , could use a 20 million euro overhaul , according to the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger . it ’ s not the city of bonn that will be cutting a check for the new venue , however .
though nothing has been put in ink quite yet , three major german companies headquartered in bonn - deutsche telekom , deutsche post and postbank - are on deck to finance 100 percent of the construction costs . after the project is completed , a partially public foundation will be set up to ensure that the level of artistic quality remains high .
after all , big-name musicians aren ’ t cheaper by the dozen .
employee benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's existing beethoven hall , built in 1959 , is wanting in acoustics and aesthetics as a sponsor , the postbank is counting on the magnetic power of the legendary hall to-be .
" it is important to the company that bonn is an attractive city for its employees , " said postbank spokesperson joachim strunk , who added that it ’ s a way to encourage employee retention .
telekom ’ s commitment to the elite project , however , coincides with the current negotiations over cutting pay and increasing work time for 50,000 of its employees , who may not necessarily be enthusiastic about the multi-million euro deal .
with beethoven as the helm , organizers have set their sights way beyond bonn , however .
" it is critical that the artistic program is at a first-class level , in order to make an international name for bonn as the city of beethoven , " said strunk .
for hempel-soos , the formula for making bonn the city of beethoven is simple : " when the best musicians in the world come to bonn , the audiences will come too .

the original constitution has been ratified by 18 of the 27 eu member states but was kicked into the political long grass in 2005 when french and dutch voters rejected it in national referendums .
the german eu presidency , which has arranged bilateral consultations with member states over an intensive two-week period from april 23 to may 4 , is making every effort " to restrict changes to what is absolutely necessary to reach an overall agreement and ensure ratification in all member states , " according to the questionnaire 's introduction .
among the most euroskeptic nations are the netherlands and britain .
british prime minister tony blair said last friday that his country no longer needs to hold a referendum on any new european union treaty , a move welcomed by eu leaders battling to replace the bloc 's near-dead constitution .
blair said the eu treaty he favors to replace the failed one would not require a british referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in brussels were relieved by blair 's comments " if it 's not a constitutional treaty , so that it alters the basic relationship between europe and the member states , then there is n't the same case for a referendum , " he told papers including britain 's financial times .
lowest common denominator in the introduction to its questionnaire , the german presidency says that a european summit on june 21-22 should decide to open " an intergovernmental conference with a very precise and limited mandate " on the constitution , with the aim of getting it ratified by all members before the next european parliamentary elections in 2009 .
the 12 questions are based on suggestions arising from previous bilateral negotiations , as the germans attempt to discover what the minimum changes each country would insist upon are for a new treaty to be acceptable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even metioning an eu anthem is touchy hence many of the questions have been in effect drawn up by the less enthusiastic member states .
thus , there is a question about avoiding explicitly mentioning the primacy of eu law and another on avoiding the use of certain terms , including " constitution " and european " minister for foreign affairs , " a post that was included in the original treaty and led to fears concerning national sovereignty over foreign policy .
these name changes would be made " without changing the legal substance " of the measures , the german paper assures .
likewise there is a question about dropping references to eu symbols such as its flag and anthem .

" consumption has the green light , ” said gfk spokesperson klaus wübbenhorst .
experts said they were surprised how quickly confidence came back after an initially weak start to the year .
the economic forecast increased almost eight points to 61 points , a record since the monthly consumer climate study began in 1980 .

" i would like to see bochum win the match and schalke lift the trophy , " said peter neururer , who has coached both teams in the past .
schalke have not lost in five trips to bochum , winning four and drawing once .
but bochum boast the bundesliga top scorer in theofanis gekas , who is ready to add to his 18 goals before a summer move to bayer leverkusen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cutouts will be replaced with the real thing if schalke win the next four matches schalke are aware of the danger , with sports director andreas müller expecting the match to be trickier than the game in a fortnight at their biggest regional rival borussia dortmund .
" a lot of people are talking about the dortmund match , but bochum could be much tougher for us , " müller said .
" we have to win the last four games . "
schalke lead the way with 62 points from werder bremen -lrb- 60 -rrb- and vfb stuttgart -lrb- 58 -rrb- , and ca n't afford to drop points if they really want to lift the trophy for the first time since 1958 .
" i do n't think we will relinquish the lead , " schalke playmaker lincoln said .
" but if we do we are strong enough to reclaim it . "
schalke coach mirko slomka said his side must concentrate on winning their last four games - against bochum , nuremberg , dortmund and arminia bielefeld - to make the title safe .
" it 's not a question of waiting for one of the others to slip up , we just have to put on a good performance ourselves , " he said .
relegation free-for-all continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz 's zidan is in the middle of the battle to avoid relegation in 11th place , bochum , are just three points clear of the drop zone and in a fierce fight against relegation involving more than half of the league 's 18 teams .
former champions borussia mönchengladbach are the only club all but beyond hope eight points away from safety .
relegation could become a fact for them if they lose at home on saturday against stuttgart , who are coming off a morale-boosting 2-0 against champions bayern munich and are in the running for a league and cup double .
bremen left wondering about klose the real danger for schalke comes from bremen , who may be left contending only for the german title as their uefa cup chances nearly disintegrated after a 3-0 semi-final loss in barcelona to espanyol on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been tight lipped about whether he 'll keep hugging bremen players next season bremen 's bundesliga match at troubled arminia bielefeld comes on sunday and could be overshadowed by speculation that their top striker miroslav klose will leave for archrival munich .
bremen president jürgen born and sports director klaus allofs , however , ruled out a transfer within germany but reiterated that klose could get out of his contract , which runs until 2008 , if he has an offer from a foreign club .
german media reported that klose met with munich officials , while spanish media said the german goal scorer was set to join barcelona .
" there is a contract with miroslav klose until 2008 and we have received no offer , neither from munich nor barcelona , " born said .

" i would like to see bochum win the match and schalke lift the trophy , " said peter neururer , who has coached both teams in the past .
schalke have not lost in five trips to bochum , winning four and drawing once .
but bochum boast the bundesliga top scorer in theofanis gekas , who is ready to add to his 18 goals before a summer move to bayer leverkusen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cutouts will be replaced with the real thing if schalke win the next four matches schalke are aware of the danger , with sports director andreas müller expecting the match to be trickier than the game in a fortnight at their biggest regional rival borussia dortmund .
" a lot of people are talking about the dortmund match , but bochum could be much tougher for us , " müller said .
" we have to win the last four games . "
schalke lead the way with 62 points from werder bremen -lrb- 60 -rrb- and vfb stuttgart -lrb- 58 -rrb- , and ca n't afford to drop points if they really want to lift the trophy for the first time since 1958 .
" i do n't think we will relinquish the lead , " schalke playmaker lincoln said .
" but if we do we are strong enough to reclaim it . "
schalke coach mirko slomka said his side must concentrate on winning their last four games - against bochum , nuremberg , dortmund and arminia bielefeld - to make the title safe .
" it 's not a question of waiting for one of the others to slip up , we just have to put on a good performance ourselves , " he said .

former champions borussia mönchengladbach are the only club all but beyond hope eight points away from safety .
relegation could become a fact for them if they lose at home on saturday against stuttgart , who are coming off a morale-boosting 2-0 against champions bayern munich and are in the running for a league and cup double .
bremen left wondering about klose the real danger for schalke comes from bremen , who may be left contending only for the german title as their uefa cup chances nearly disintegrated after a 3-0 semi-final loss in barcelona to espanyol on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been tight lipped about whether he 'll keep hugging bremen players next season bremen 's bundesliga match at troubled arminia bielefeld comes on sunday and could be overshadowed by speculation that their top striker miroslav klose will leave for archrival munich .
bremen president jürgen born and sports director klaus allofs , however , ruled out a transfer within germany but reiterated that klose could get out of his contract , which runs until 2008 , if he has an offer from a foreign club .
german media reported that klose met with munich officials , while spanish media said the german goal scorer was set to join barcelona .
" there is a contract with miroslav klose until 2008 and we have received no offer , neither from munich nor barcelona , " born said .

" i would like to see bochum win the match and schalke lift the trophy , " said peter neururer , who has coached both teams in the past .
schalke have not lost in five trips to bochum , winning four and drawing once .
but bochum boast the bundesliga top scorer in theofanis gekas , who is ready to add to his 18 goals before a summer move to bayer leverkusen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cutouts will be replaced with the real thing if schalke win the next four matches schalke are aware of the danger , with sports director andreas müller expecting the match to be trickier than the game in a fortnight at their biggest regional rival borussia dortmund .
" a lot of people are talking about the dortmund match , but bochum could be much tougher for us , " müller said .
" we have to win the last four games . "
schalke lead the way with 62 points from werder bremen -lrb- 60 -rrb- and vfb stuttgart -lrb- 58 -rrb- , and ca n't afford to drop points if they really want to lift the trophy for the first time since 1958 .
" i do n't think we will relinquish the lead , " schalke playmaker lincoln said .
" but if we do we are strong enough to reclaim it . "
schalke coach mirko slomka said his side must concentrate on winning their last four games - against bochum , nuremberg , dortmund and arminia bielefeld - to make the title safe .
" it 's not a question of waiting for one of the others to slip up , we just have to put on a good performance ourselves , " he said .
relegation free-for-all continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz 's zidan is in the middle of the battle to avoid relegation in 11th place , bochum , are just three points clear of the drop zone and in a fierce fight against relegation involving more than half of the league 's 18 teams .
former champions borussia mönchengladbach are the only club all but beyond hope eight points away from safety .
relegation could become a fact for them if they lose at home on saturday against stuttgart , who are coming off a morale-boosting 2-0 against champions bayern munich and are in the running for a league and cup double .
bremen left wondering about klose the real danger for schalke comes from bremen , who may be left contending only for the german title as their uefa cup chances nearly disintegrated after a 3-0 semi-final loss in barcelona to espanyol on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been tight lipped about whether he 'll keep hugging bremen players next season bremen 's bundesliga match at troubled arminia bielefeld comes on sunday and could be overshadowed by speculation that their top striker miroslav klose will leave for archrival munich .
bremen president jürgen born and sports director klaus allofs , however , ruled out a transfer within germany but reiterated that klose could get out of his contract , which runs until 2008 , if he has an offer from a foreign club .
german media reported that klose met with munich officials , while spanish media said the german goal scorer was set to join barcelona .
" there is a contract with miroslav klose until 2008 and we have received no offer , neither from munich nor barcelona , " born said .
bad news piles up in munich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi wo n't be back this season after suffering a knee injury munich had to bury their remote title hopes last week in stuttgart and , trailing stuttgart by five points in fourth place , are also likely to miss the champions league for the first time in a decade .

the call came as an eu report highlighted ongoing human rights failings in various countries . germany needs to use its presidency of the eu to take a strong stance against the failings of russia and china in regards to human rights , activists said at a meeting in berlin .
the leaders of three russian non-governmental organizations pressed the eu to address what they said was a deteriorating rights situation in russia under president vladimir putin .
the activists gathered in berlin at the invitation of new york-based human rights watch and amnesty international on thursday .
the head of the centre for the development of democracy and human rights , yuri dzhibladze , accused germany of turning a blind eye to rights violations in russia so as not to jeopardize its economic ties , in particular in the energy sector .
" we believe that germany is under performing in its role of leader in europe in working with russia , " dzhibladze told reporters , ahead of eu-russia human rights consultations on may 3 in berlin , before the may 18 eu-russia summit .
germany needs to " speak up " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should put political pressure on putin , activists say the chairwoman of demos centre for information and research , tanya lokshina , cited a bloody police crackdown against opposition activists and a sharp rise in racist attacks as symptomatic of a harsher climate for dissent .
" all the european countries ought to stand up for russian civil society , but germany should be leading the way , " lokshina said .
" with the putin government trying to suppress all dissent , we need you now more than ever . "
oleg orlov , the head of memorial , one of russia 's oldest human rights groups , said europe had the power to help turn the tide in russia .
" speaking out on human rights in russia wo n't threaten europe 's energy supply but it would really help to curb the government 's crackdown , " orlov said .
" russian civil society is under attack and we need germany to speak up . "
the activists also criticised the planning of next week 's meeting in berlin , saying that no russian human rights groups had been invited .
eu criticizes putin 's government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian reporter anna politkovskaya 's murder points to human rights problems under putin the meeting in berlin coincided with the release of the eu parliament 's annual human rights report .
the parliament in strasbourg strongly criticised the russian government over human rights , regretting that the eu has had " only limited success in bringing about policy change as a result of raising difficult issues . "
the report attacked russian legislation limiting the activities of ngos and that journalists and human rights defenders have been threatened .
it also highlighted the murder of russian journalist anna politkovskaya and allegations of russian involvement in the poisoning of former russian agent alexander litvinenko in london .
serious concerns about china in addition to russia , the eu raised concern about turkey , iran and china .
china 's human rights record is a matter of " serious concern " and should thus " receive more focus in the build-up to the beijing olympic games , " parliament members said , emphasising the need to strengthen and improve dialogue on the issue between the eu and china .
members urged the european commission and member states " to raise the question of tibet " in talks with the beijing government , adding that trade relations with china should be contingent upon human rights reform .
china has ruled tibet since 1951 , since troops were sent to " liberate " the region .
subsequent uprisings have been violently supressed .
china on thursday warned visiting foreigners against engaging in activities that threaten the nation 's unity , as a rights group demanded the release of four americans detained for a pro-tibet protest .
" limited progress " in other countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's record was criticized by the eu the report also noted a deterioration of the human rights situation in iran , including " the intensification of the repression against human rights defenders . "
the report also voiced concern over the " limited progress " on human rights issues in turkey and encouraged the ankara government to change article 301 of its penal code , which outlaws the denigration of " turkishness . "
it raises concerns over religious freedoms and minority rights , including for the kurds in the southeast of the country .
the eu itself does not escape censure in the parliamentary report which says the union should have taken " more unilateral action " to persuade the sudanese government to accept an international peacekeeping force in darfur .
parliament members want " a plan of specific , targeted sanctions to be imposed on the khartoum regime ... in the event of non-compliance with the demands of the international community . "
the parliament also called on the eu to urge the us government to " charge or release " its guantanamo detainees " in accordance with international law .

the head of the centre for the development of democracy and human rights , yuri dzhibladze , accused germany of turning a blind eye to rights violations in russia so as not to jeopardize its economic ties , in particular in the energy sector .
" we believe that germany is under performing in its role of leader in europe in working with russia , " dzhibladze told reporters , ahead of eu-russia human rights consultations on may 3 in berlin , before the may 18 eu-russia summit .
germany needs to " speak up " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should put political pressure on putin , activists say the chairwoman of demos centre for information and research , tanya lokshina , cited a bloody police crackdown against opposition activists and a sharp rise in racist attacks as symptomatic of a harsher climate for dissent .
" all the european countries ought to stand up for russian civil society , but germany should be leading the way , " lokshina said .
" with the putin government trying to suppress all dissent , we need you now more than ever . "
oleg orlov , the head of memorial , one of russia 's oldest human rights groups , said europe had the power to help turn the tide in russia .
" speaking out on human rights in russia wo n't threaten europe 's energy supply but it would really help to curb the government 's crackdown , " orlov said .
" russian civil society is under attack and we need germany to speak up . "
the activists also criticised the planning of next week 's meeting in berlin , saying that no russian human rights groups had been invited .
eu criticizes putin 's government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian reporter anna politkovskaya 's murder points to human rights problems under putin the meeting in berlin coincided with the release of the eu parliament 's annual human rights report .
the parliament in strasbourg strongly criticised the russian government over human rights , regretting that the eu has had " only limited success in bringing about policy change as a result of raising difficult issues . "
the report attacked russian legislation limiting the activities of ngos and that journalists and human rights defenders have been threatened .
it also highlighted the murder of russian journalist anna politkovskaya and allegations of russian involvement in the poisoning of former russian agent alexander litvinenko in london .
serious concerns about china in addition to russia , the eu raised concern about turkey , iran and china .
china 's human rights record is a matter of " serious concern " and should thus " receive more focus in the build-up to the beijing olympic games , " parliament members said , emphasising the need to strengthen and improve dialogue on the issue between the eu and china .
members urged the european commission and member states " to raise the question of tibet " in talks with the beijing government , adding that trade relations with china should be contingent upon human rights reform .
china has ruled tibet since 1951 , since troops were sent to " liberate " the region .
subsequent uprisings have been violently supressed .
china on thursday warned visiting foreigners against engaging in activities that threaten the nation 's unity , as a rights group demanded the release of four americans detained for a pro-tibet protest .
" limited progress " in other countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's record was criticized by the eu the report also noted a deterioration of the human rights situation in iran , including " the intensification of the repression against human rights defenders . "
the report also voiced concern over the " limited progress " on human rights issues in turkey and encouraged the ankara government to change article 301 of its penal code , which outlaws the denigration of " turkishness . "
it raises concerns over religious freedoms and minority rights , including for the kurds in the southeast of the country .
the eu itself does not escape censure in the parliamentary report which says the union should have taken " more unilateral action " to persuade the sudanese government to accept an international peacekeeping force in darfur .
parliament members want " a plan of specific , targeted sanctions to be imposed on the khartoum regime ... in the event of non-compliance with the demands of the international community . "
the parliament also called on the eu to urge the us government to " charge or release " its guantanamo detainees " in accordance with international law .

it also highlighted the murder of russian journalist anna politkovskaya and allegations of russian involvement in the poisoning of former russian agent alexander litvinenko in london .
serious concerns about china in addition to russia , the eu raised concern about turkey , iran and china .
china 's human rights record is a matter of " serious concern " and should thus " receive more focus in the build-up to the beijing olympic games , " parliament members said , emphasising the need to strengthen and improve dialogue on the issue between the eu and china .
members urged the european commission and member states " to raise the question of tibet " in talks with the beijing government , adding that trade relations with china should be contingent upon human rights reform .
china has ruled tibet since 1951 , since troops were sent to " liberate " the region .
subsequent uprisings have been violently supressed .
china on thursday warned visiting foreigners against engaging in activities that threaten the nation 's unity , as a rights group demanded the release of four americans detained for a pro-tibet protest .
" limited progress " in other countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's record was criticized by the eu the report also noted a deterioration of the human rights situation in iran , including " the intensification of the repression against human rights defenders . "
the report also voiced concern over the " limited progress " on human rights issues in turkey and encouraged the ankara government to change article 301 of its penal code , which outlaws the denigration of " turkishness . "
it raises concerns over religious freedoms and minority rights , including for the kurds in the southeast of the country .
the eu itself does not escape censure in the parliamentary report which says the union should have taken " more unilateral action " to persuade the sudanese government to accept an international peacekeeping force in darfur .
parliament members want " a plan of specific , targeted sanctions to be imposed on the khartoum regime ... in the event of non-compliance with the demands of the international community . "
the parliament also called on the eu to urge the us government to " charge or release " its guantanamo detainees " in accordance with international law .

at the beginning of the year , economists were pessimistic .
a new sales tax increase that went into effect in january would kill consumer spending , they predicted .

at the same time , earnings forcasts escalated to a six year high .
" consumption has the green light , ” said gfk spokesperson klaus wübbenhorst .
experts said they were surprised how quickly confidence came back after an initially weak start to the year .
the economic forecast increased almost eight points to 61 points , a record since the monthly consumer climate study began in 1980 .
one of the important reasons for this optimism is caused by positive developments in the employment market , gfk said .

the government is counting on a decrease in unemployment of more than a million people by 2008 .
in the upcoming year the number of unemployed should be less than 3.5 million .
that would be the lowest rate in more than a decade .
the government also increased its growth estimate to 2.3 percent .
until now , the government had predicted a 1.7 percent growth rate .
the monthly gfk consumer indicator is based on a survey of approximately 2,000 consumers .
substantial factors in determining the consumer climate are income expectations , earnings forecasts and purchases .

" there will clearly be a discussion within nato , there will clearly be a discussion between capitals and the russian federation on what they mean . "
making his last state of the nation speech in moscow , putin said thursday that russia could pull out of the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty until all of nato 's current members ratified it .
" it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence ... until it has been ratified by all nato countries without exception , " he said .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said the 26 member countries had received the news with " concern , grave concern , disappointment and deep regret because the allies are of the opinion that the cfe treaty is one of the cornerstones of european security . "

" the increase of the threat of mutual harm to one another , and possibly of destruction , will grow many times over , " putin said , adding the system 's proposed bases in the czech republic and poland would violate europe 's security apparatus .

washington , for its part , says both north korea and iran either have or are trying to acquire atomic bombs and could in 10 years ' time have missiles that threaten europe .
klaus told russian news agencies after his talks with putin that he had been unable to explain the czech arguments for the shield .
" i assured the president the czech side did n't have the slightest intention for the radar bases -lrb- proposed for czech territory -rrb- to become a threat to russia , " klaus said .

" i have seen quotes from presidential advisors saying : ' well , we only mean in six months ' , i have heard some else tell me that he subsequently said they only mean in one year , " he said .
" there will clearly be a discussion within nato , there will clearly be a discussion between capitals and the russian federation on what they mean . "
making his last state of the nation speech in moscow , putin said thursday that russia could pull out of the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty until all of nato 's current members ratified it .
" it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence ... until it has been ratified by all nato countries without exception , " he said .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said the 26 member countries had received the news with " concern , grave concern , disappointment and deep regret because the allies are of the opinion that the cfe treaty is one of the cornerstones of european security . "
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for calm .
" the arithmetic of the cold war , with its numbers of armed vehicles , missiles and troops on each side , just does n't add up any more , " he said .

in france foreign ministry spokesman jean-baptiste mattei called for russia to go back on its decision , calling the cfe treaty " a cornerstone of security in europe . "
he said that debate on the treaty and the us anti-missile plan that triggered putin 's move should continue in the nato-russia joint council to overcome moscow 's suspicions .
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 in paris by the countries of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- and the former warsaw pact to limit military hardware in the region .

cup holders sevilla fell in the night 's other semi-final 1-0 to osasuna . barcelona espanyol headed in two goals from corner kicks in front of a home crowd thursday night and gave thomas schaaf 's side a clear outline of what the team will have to improve before the semi-final 's second leg kicks off place in bremen . espanyol moved out in front of bremen midway through the first half when moises hurtado headed into goal on an ivan de la pena corner , then doubled their lead shortly after the halftime break when walter pandiani put in another de la pena corner kick .
espanyol 's third goal came in the game 's final minutes from substitute ferran corominas . german international torsten frings said bremen would have a difficult time preventing an all-spanish uefa cup final in glasgow on may 16 . bremen need a " miracle " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese will miss the second semi-final leg for a professional foul in barcelona " you ca n't make mistakes like that if you want to be the uefa cup winners , 3-0 is a big loss , " he said .
" we 'll need a pretty big miracle .
with a performance like this one , we do n't have a chance . " the german side , which has n't lost a bundesliga match since mid-february , appeared to have forgotten to unpack its offensive arsenal made up of playmaker diego and world cup golden boot winner miroslav klose , neither of whom were able to leave an impression on the match . both teams will be without key players for this thursday 's second leg .
goal scorers moises and pandiani both received yellow cards and will be will be suspended for the match in bremen . the bundesliga side finished the match with 10 men and will play with a back-up goalie between the posts after tim wiese received a red card for hauling down espanyol striker raul tamudo outside the area . " after the red card it was difficult for us to get back into it , " schaaf said .
" we are going to have to put in an exceptional performance -lrb- in the return leg -rrb- if we are to progress . " sevilla face manageable task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roberto soldado , in red , stayed out in front of sevilla spanish league strugglers osasuna turned on the style to claim a precious 1-0 home win over reigning uefa cup champions sevilla in the first leg of the competition 's other semi-final . osasuna came out fired up but appeared to be lacking the required focus in the early stages when veteran striker savo milosevic threw sevilla 's christian poulsen to the ground with a forceful - an unpunished - shove in the face . david lopez , arguably osasuna 's man-of-the-match , delivered a cross 10 minutes after the restart , that left sevilla 's keeper clutching at air when roberto soldado 's header drove its way in at the far post . soldado narrowly missed claiming his second goal on 63 minutes when he ran unchallenged down the left flank , cut inside his defender and sent his long curling effort just over the top left hand corner . shortly thereafter the referee walked off the pitch , followed by the players , when it appeared he had been hit with an object thrown from the crowd . six minutes of injury time were later allocated for the interruption , but despite close efforts on sevilla 's part to snatch an undeserved draw , osasuna held on for a well-deserved win that could prove decisive ahead of the second leg next week . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen out to gatecrash spanish fiesta in uefa cup semis werder bremen aim to crash the spanish uefa cup fiesta thursday when they play espanyol in the first leg of their semi-final tie .

the call came as an eu report highlighted ongoing human rights failings in various countries . germany needs to use its presidency of the eu to take a strong stance against the failings of russia and china in regards to human rights , activists said at a meeting in berlin .
the leaders of three russian non-governmental organizations pressed the eu to address what they said was a deteriorating rights situation in russia under president vladimir putin .
the activists gathered in berlin at the invitation of new york-based human rights watch and amnesty international on thursday .
the head of the centre for the development of democracy and human rights , yuri dzhibladze , accused germany of turning a blind eye to rights violations in russia so as not to jeopardize its economic ties , in particular in the energy sector .
" we believe that germany is under performing in its role of leader in europe in working with russia , " dzhibladze told reporters , ahead of eu-russia human rights consultations on may 3 in berlin , before the may 18 eu-russia summit .
germany needs to " speak up " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should put political pressure on putin , activists say the chairwoman of demos centre for information and research , tanya lokshina , cited a bloody police crackdown against opposition activists and a sharp rise in racist attacks as symptomatic of a harsher climate for dissent .
" all the european countries ought to stand up for russian civil society , but germany should be leading the way , " lokshina said .
" with the putin government trying to suppress all dissent , we need you now more than ever . "
oleg orlov , the head of memorial , one of russia 's oldest human rights groups , said europe had the power to help turn the tide in russia .
" speaking out on human rights in russia wo n't threaten europe 's energy supply but it would really help to curb the government 's crackdown , " orlov said .
" russian civil society is under attack and we need germany to speak up . "
the activists also criticised the planning of next week 's meeting in berlin , saying that no russian human rights groups had been invited .
eu criticizes putin 's government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian reporter anna politkovskaya 's murder points to human rights problems under putin the meeting in berlin coincided with the release of the eu parliament 's annual human rights report .
the parliament in strasbourg strongly criticised the russian government over human rights , regretting that the eu has had " only limited success in bringing about policy change as a result of raising difficult issues . "
the report attacked russian legislation limiting the activities of ngos and that journalists and human rights defenders have been threatened .
it also highlighted the murder of russian journalist anna politkovskaya and allegations of russian involvement in the poisoning of former russian agent alexander litvinenko in london .
serious concerns about china in addition to russia , the eu raised concern about turkey , iran and china .
china 's human rights record is a matter of " serious concern " and should thus " receive more focus in the build-up to the beijing olympic games , " parliament members said , emphasising the need to strengthen and improve dialogue on the issue between the eu and china .
members urged the european commission and member states " to raise the question of tibet " in talks with the beijing government , adding that trade relations with china should be contingent upon human rights reform .
china has ruled tibet since 1951 , since troops were sent to " liberate " the region .
subsequent uprisings have been violently supressed .
china on thursday warned visiting foreigners against engaging in activities that threaten the nation 's unity , as a rights group demanded the release of four americans detained for a pro-tibet protest .
" limited progress " in other countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's record was criticized by the eu the report also noted a deterioration of the human rights situation in iran , including " the intensification of the repression against human rights defenders . "
the report also voiced concern over the " limited progress " on human rights issues in turkey and encouraged the ankara government to change article 301 of its penal code , which outlaws the denigration of " turkishness . "
it raises concerns over religious freedoms and minority rights , including for the kurds in the southeast of the country .
the eu itself does not escape censure in the parliamentary report which says the union should have taken " more unilateral action " to persuade the sudanese government to accept an international peacekeeping force in darfur .
parliament members want " a plan of specific , targeted sanctions to be imposed on the khartoum regime ... in the event of non-compliance with the demands of the international community . "
the parliament also called on the eu to urge the us government to " charge or release " its guantanamo detainees " in accordance with international law .

cup holders sevilla fell in the night 's other semi-final 1-0 to osasuna . barcelona espanyol headed in two goals from corner kicks in front of a home crowd thursday night and gave thomas schaaf 's side a clear outline of what the team will have to improve before the semi-final 's second leg kicks off place in bremen . espanyol moved out in front of bremen midway through the first half when moises hurtado headed into goal on an ivan de la pena corner , then doubled their lead shortly after the halftime break when walter pandiani put in another de la pena corner kick .
espanyol 's third goal came in the game 's final minutes from substitute ferran corominas . german international torsten frings said bremen would have a difficult time preventing an all-spanish uefa cup final in glasgow on may 16 . bremen need a " miracle " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese will miss the second semi-final leg for a professional foul in barcelona " you ca n't make mistakes like that if you want to be the uefa cup winners , 3-0 is a big loss , " he said .
" we 'll need a pretty big miracle .
with a performance like this one , we do n't have a chance . " the german side , which has n't lost a bundesliga match since mid-february , appeared to have forgotten to unpack its offensive arsenal made up of playmaker diego and world cup golden boot winner miroslav klose , neither of whom were able to leave an impression on the match . both teams will be without key players for this thursday 's second leg .
goal scorers moises and pandiani both received yellow cards and will be will be suspended for the match in bremen . the bundesliga side finished the match with 10 men and will play with a back-up goalie between the posts after tim wiese received a red card for hauling down espanyol striker raul tamudo outside the area . " after the red card it was difficult for us to get back into it , " schaaf said .
" we are going to have to put in an exceptional performance -lrb- in the return leg -rrb- if we are to progress .

she also estimated that there were around a million potential concert-goers in the area directly surrounding bonn . they won ’ t go to dortmund or duisburg , she said , because bonn will offer something completely different - world-class in everything from the building to the performers . questioning priorities for her , it ’ s matter-of-fact that the composer should be honored in his birthplace - and with much more than the less-than-modern beethoven hall , built in 1959 , the smaller chamber music house , museum and numerous monuments that already adorn the city . still , some are asking whether it ’ s wise to build an additional venue instead of using a fraction of the money to pay for renovations to other cultural institutions .
bonn ’ s theater , for example , where operas , ballets and some plays are performed , could use a 20 million euro overhaul , according to the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger . it ’ s not the city of bonn that will be cutting a check for the new venue , however .
though nothing has been put in ink quite yet , three major german companies headquartered in bonn - deutsche telekom , deutsche post and postbank - are on deck to finance 100 percent of the construction costs . after the project is completed , a partially public foundation will be set up to ensure that the level of artistic quality remains high .
after all , big-name musicians aren ’ t cheaper by the dozen .
employee benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's existing beethoven hall , built in 1959 , is wanting in acoustics and aesthetics as a sponsor , the postbank is counting on the magnetic power of the legendary hall to-be .
" it is important to the company that bonn is an attractive city for its employees , " said postbank spokesperson joachim strunk , who added that it ’ s a way to encourage employee retention .
telekom ’ s commitment to the elite project , however , coincides with the current negotiations over cutting pay and increasing work time for 50,000 of its employees , who may not necessarily be enthusiastic about the multi-million euro deal .
with beethoven as the helm , organizers have set their sights way beyond bonn , however .
" it is critical that the artistic program is at a first-class level , in order to make an international name for bonn as the city of beethoven , " said strunk .
for hempel-soos , the formula for making bonn the city of beethoven is simple : " when the best musicians in the world come to bonn , the audiences will come too .

although he is widely seen as the architect of turkey 's eu bid , they object to his islamist past and the fact that his wife wears the muslim headscarf . to them , the prospect of a president with an islamist background is proof of religion steadily creeping into politics and public life .
the government 's supporters , meanwhile , respond with charges of crisis-mongering and flouting democracy in a country where surveys show people increasingly identify with islam . amid these growing concerns , thousands of people rallied in ankara in recent weeks against erdogan and his party . boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations in ankara meanwhile , opposition parties boycotted the poll friday and declared the vote invalid . the main opposition party republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- had threatened a boycott and said it would challenge the result in the constitutional court if the session convened with less than two-thirds of the legislators taking part - hoping thereby to isolate the akp by convincing other opposition mps to boycott the session .
the plan was then to petition the constitutional court to scrap the first-round vote , thus blocking the election process and forcing early elections . " i urge all elected deputies to come and do their democratic political duty .
we are facing one of the most important days of our democratic life , " erdogan had said in a last-minute appeal to deputies to attend the parliament vote friday . " let us not fall into the trap of those who are trying to drag turkey back to the customs of the past , to those periods of political paralysis , " he added .
" despite our differences , the result of our democratic rivalry , we are ... the representatives of the same nation , " he said .
" attending the general assembly and voting - be it for or against - is a duty given to us by the people . " but as the vote began , the number fell short of a 367-member threshold and the chp confirmed it would challenge the vote in court .
according to the reuters news agency , there were 360 deputies in the chamber for the vote , clearing the way for the main opposition to ask the constitutional court to annul the vote . the akp now faces the biggest crisis of its near five-year rule .
if the court upholds the opposition appeal , erdogan will have to call a snap general election within 90 days . the candidates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul oversaw turkey 's eu bid the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , holds a solid majority in the 550-member assembly to secure gul 's election , but only in the later stages of the vote . the only other candidate , dissident akp deputy ersonmez yarbay , stands no chance of election . the akp currently controls nearly two-thirds of the legislative assembly , or 352 seats , despite winning only 34 percent of the popular vote - a quirk of turkey 's electoral system . the party has disowned its islamist roots , pledged commitment to the secular system and secured the opening of membership talks with the european union . but some of its actions , such as attempts to criminalize adultery , isolate alcohol-serving establishments in special zones and encourage koranic courses , have fuelled suspicions of its islamist ambitions . in what was seen as a last-minute maneuver to garner support , the akp said friday it was ready to consider several constitutional reforms advocated by the centre-right motherland party -lrb- anap -rrb- in the hope of luring its 20 deputies to vote . the moderate gul was picked as akp candidate following unprecedented mass protests against erdogan , a highly popular but controversial politician who had been widely expected to run . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish foreign minister abdullah gül to run for president turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has named foreign minister abdullah gül as the ruling party 's candidate for president , ending speculation that erdogan , a former islamist , would stand himself .

" the first step will still have to be to clarify exactly what president -lrb- vladimir -rrb- putin meant , " chief nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters , when asked how the alliance would respond to the apparent move .
" i have seen quotes from presidential advisors saying : ' well , we only mean in six months ' , i have heard some else tell me that he subsequently said they only mean in one year , " he said .
" there will clearly be a discussion within nato , there will clearly be a discussion between capitals and the russian federation on what they mean . "
making his last state of the nation speech in moscow , putin said thursday that russia could pull out of the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty until all of nato 's current members ratified it .
" it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence ... until it has been ratified by all nato countries without exception , " he said .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said the 26 member countries had received the news with " concern , grave concern , disappointment and deep regret because the allies are of the opinion that the cfe treaty is one of the cornerstones of european security . "
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for calm .
" the arithmetic of the cold war , with its numbers of armed vehicles , missiles and troops on each side , just does n't add up any more , " he said .
" we must avoid an escalation . "
europeans call for calm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's steinmeier calls for more dialogue " what we need is not less disarmament and fewer arms controls , we need more , " said steinmeier , whose once-divided country was the frontline for the cold war .
in berlin government spokesman thomas steg called for continued dialogue , while adding that " we are strongly convinced that threats do not help . "
in france foreign ministry spokesman jean-baptiste mattei called for russia to go back on its decision , calling the cfe treaty " a cornerstone of security in europe . "
he said that debate on the treaty and the us anti-missile plan that triggered putin 's move should continue in the nato-russia joint council to overcome moscow 's suspicions .
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 in paris by the countries of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- and the former warsaw pact to limit military hardware in the region .
it was adapted in istanbul in 1999 following the collapse of the warsaw pact , in order to limit deployments on a country-by-country basis .
nato states have refused to ratify the new pact on the grounds that moscow has failed to honour commitments made in istanbul to withdraw russian forces from the former soviet republics of georgia and moldova .

although the us plans have been known for years , russia has increased its rhetoric in recent months after the czech republic and poland , eastern european countries moscow considers its sphere of influence , entered talks to house elements on their territory .
us defence secretary robert gates visited putin and other officials in moscow earlier this week to invite russia to join the project , but apparently made little progress .
washington says the shield is designed to protect against threats from iran and north korea and that its 10 interceptor missiles could not defend against russia 's thousands of warheads .

washington , for its part , says both north korea and iran either have or are trying to acquire atomic bombs and could in 10 years ' time have missiles that threaten europe .
klaus told russian news agencies after his talks with putin that he had been unable to explain the czech arguments for the shield .
" i assured the president the czech side did n't have the slightest intention for the radar bases -lrb- proposed for czech territory -rrb- to become a threat to russia , " klaus said .

germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble remains in favor of the controversial practice , but will wait for a legal ruling . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble faced massive criticism this week after it was revealed that german intelligence agencies were secretly snooping on terrorism suspects via the internet . schäuble has ordered a temporary halt to the practice .
" there is a moratorium , " a spokeswoman for the interior ministry confirmed in the financial times deutschland newspaper on friday .
intelligence agencies have monitored suspects ' computers via the internet for two years , according to members of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee .
privacy concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics question the legality of internet snooping representatives from all political parties questioned the legality of the practice .
critics say the secret searches violate article 13 of the german basic law , which governs privacy .
schäuble , of the christian democratic union , has suggested the government consider expanding article 13 to allow it .

" the first step will still have to be to clarify exactly what president -lrb- vladimir -rrb- putin meant , " chief nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters , when asked how the alliance would respond to the apparent move .
" i have seen quotes from presidential advisors saying : ' well , we only mean in six months ' , i have heard some else tell me that he subsequently said they only mean in one year , " he said .
" there will clearly be a discussion within nato , there will clearly be a discussion between capitals and the russian federation on what they mean . "
making his last state of the nation speech in moscow , putin said thursday that russia could pull out of the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty until all of nato 's current members ratified it .
" it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence ... until it has been ratified by all nato countries without exception , " he said .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said the 26 member countries had received the news with " concern , grave concern , disappointment and deep regret because the allies are of the opinion that the cfe treaty is one of the cornerstones of european security . "
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for calm .
" the arithmetic of the cold war , with its numbers of armed vehicles , missiles and troops on each side , just does n't add up any more , " he said .
" we must avoid an escalation . "
europeans call for calm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's steinmeier calls for more dialogue " what we need is not less disarmament and fewer arms controls , we need more , " said steinmeier , whose once-divided country was the frontline for the cold war .
in berlin government spokesman thomas steg called for continued dialogue , while adding that " we are strongly convinced that threats do not help . "
in france foreign ministry spokesman jean-baptiste mattei called for russia to go back on its decision , calling the cfe treaty " a cornerstone of security in europe . "
he said that debate on the treaty and the us anti-missile plan that triggered putin 's move should continue in the nato-russia joint council to overcome moscow 's suspicions .
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 in paris by the countries of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- and the former warsaw pact to limit military hardware in the region .
it was adapted in istanbul in 1999 following the collapse of the warsaw pact , in order to limit deployments on a country-by-country basis .
nato states have refused to ratify the new pact on the grounds that moscow has failed to honour commitments made in istanbul to withdraw russian forces from the former soviet republics of georgia and moldova .
increased threat of mutually assured destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's tone has become more belligerent in recent days president putin reiterated his belliegernt stance when he warned of an increased threat of mutually assured destruction in a meeting about the planned us missile shield with czech president vaclav klaus .
" the increase of the threat of mutual harm to one another , and possibly of destruction , will grow many times over , " putin said , adding the system 's proposed bases in the czech republic and poland would violate europe 's security apparatus .
although the us plans have been known for years , russia has increased its rhetoric in recent months after the czech republic and poland , eastern european countries moscow considers its sphere of influence , entered talks to house elements on their territory .
us defence secretary robert gates visited putin and other officials in moscow earlier this week to invite russia to join the project , but apparently made little progress .
washington says the shield is designed to protect against threats from iran and north korea and that its 10 interceptor missiles could not defend against russia 's thousands of warheads .
russia claims to be real target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russians consider the missile system to be a threat russia has said it is the target of the shield , and putin told klaus he was ready to invite specialists from the czech republic and poland to show neither iran nor north korea had missile systems demanding the defence system .
washington , for its part , says both north korea and iran either have or are trying to acquire atomic bombs and could in 10 years ' time have missiles that threaten europe .
klaus told russian news agencies after his talks with putin that he had been unable to explain the czech arguments for the shield .
" i assured the president the czech side did n't have the slightest intention for the radar bases -lrb- proposed for czech territory -rrb- to become a threat to russia , " klaus said .
" that 's understandable - the czech republic wo n't control the stations , " putin was quoted as saying in response .
in a meeting where putin reminded klaus his country received 75 per cent of its natural gas from energy-rich moscow and had recently signed an agreement lasting till 2035 , putin told the czech leader the shield was similar to putting nuclear missiles on european territory .
putin said he hoped the czech republic would advance russian-eu relations as european union president in 2009 .
" i have a very wide circle of questions and problems and we are glad for the opportunity to exchange opinions , " he added .
but regarding the shield , he added that " as head of state i would have to say yes , relations will worsen . "

germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble remains in favor of the controversial practice , but will wait for a legal ruling . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble faced massive criticism this week after it was revealed that german intelligence agencies were secretly snooping on terrorism suspects via the internet . schäuble has ordered a temporary halt to the practice .
" there is a moratorium , " a spokeswoman for the interior ministry confirmed in the financial times deutschland newspaper on friday .
intelligence agencies have monitored suspects ' computers via the internet for two years , according to members of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee .
privacy concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics question the legality of internet snooping representatives from all political parties questioned the legality of the practice .
critics say the secret searches violate article 13 of the german basic law , which governs privacy .
schäuble , of the christian democratic union , has suggested the government consider expanding article 13 to allow it .
but the government does n't want to go ahead with the monitoring until a clear legal foundation is provided , schäuble told parliament .
until then , the monitoring will stop , he said .
schäuble faced criticism from within his party and from coalition partners in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the interior experts for the cdu / csu , hans-peter uhl and ralf göbel , called the intelligence agency searches were " legally questionable . "
the measures are necessary , but require a " sustainable legal basis , " they said in a statement .
important intelligence tool bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say spying is an important tool in fighting terrorism schäuble has called for a change in the law , saying the monitoring is an important intelligence tool and that the practice should continue .
a special law already exists in the german state of north rhine-westphalia which allows computers to be searched without their owners ' knowledge .
the chancellor 's office insists that terrorism makes examining pc hard drives necessary .
it also said computer monitoring played a role in deployment planning in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , according to parliament records .
germany 's interior intelligence agency , the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- has been accessing private data via the internet since june , 2005 .
the prior interior minister , otto schily , altered regulations to allow it .
according to the chancellor 's office , a decision by the german federal court in january , 2007 , which allowed for online data searches to be prosecuted , does not apply to the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
but politicians argue that schily 's regulations do not provide a sustainable legal foundation for internet spying .
skepticism remains politicians from other parties have maintained skepticism over the necessity of the program and have expressed concern that it violates privacy .
berlin 's state interior minister , ehrhart körting , said the practice was not very efficient , because it catches only the least sophisticated computer users who do n't know how to defend against so-called trojan programs . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german intelligence must stop computer spying , lawmakers say intelligence agencies said they have been monitoring suspects ' computers via the internet , but lawmakers called for an immediate stop to the controversial practice .
-lrb- 26.04.2007 -rrb- harsh words from german commissioner on data protection the federal commissioner for data protection has accused the german government of " culpable neglect " in protecting data privacy .
he said the government should halt plans for greater access to phone and internet records .

cup holders sevilla fell in the night 's other semi-final 1-0 to osasuna . barcelona espanyol headed in two goals from corner kicks in front of a home crowd thursday night and gave thomas schaaf 's side a clear outline of what the team will have to improve before the semi-final 's second leg kicks off place in bremen . espanyol moved out in front of bremen midway through the first half when moises hurtado headed into goal on an ivan de la pena corner , then doubled their lead shortly after the halftime break when walter pandiani put in another de la pena corner kick .
espanyol 's third goal came in the game 's final minutes from substitute ferran corominas . german international torsten frings said bremen would have a difficult time preventing an all-spanish uefa cup final in glasgow on may 16 . bremen need a " miracle " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese will miss the second semi-final leg for a professional foul in barcelona " you ca n't make mistakes like that if you want to be the uefa cup winners , 3-0 is a big loss , " he said .
" we 'll need a pretty big miracle .
with a performance like this one , we do n't have a chance . " the german side , which has n't lost a bundesliga match since mid-february , appeared to have forgotten to unpack its offensive arsenal made up of playmaker diego and world cup golden boot winner miroslav klose , neither of whom were able to leave an impression on the match . both teams will be without key players for this thursday 's second leg .

cup holders sevilla fell in the night 's other semi-final 1-0 to osasuna . barcelona espanyol headed in two goals from corner kicks in front of a home crowd thursday night and gave thomas schaaf 's side a clear outline of what the team will have to improve before the semi-final 's second leg kicks off place in bremen . espanyol moved out in front of bremen midway through the first half when moises hurtado headed into goal on an ivan de la pena corner , then doubled their lead shortly after the halftime break when walter pandiani put in another de la pena corner kick .
espanyol 's third goal came in the game 's final minutes from substitute ferran corominas . german international torsten frings said bremen would have a difficult time preventing an all-spanish uefa cup final in glasgow on may 16 . bremen need a " miracle " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese will miss the second semi-final leg for a professional foul in barcelona " you ca n't make mistakes like that if you want to be the uefa cup winners , 3-0 is a big loss , " he said .
" we 'll need a pretty big miracle .
with a performance like this one , we do n't have a chance . " the german side , which has n't lost a bundesliga match since mid-february , appeared to have forgotten to unpack its offensive arsenal made up of playmaker diego and world cup golden boot winner miroslav klose , neither of whom were able to leave an impression on the match . both teams will be without key players for this thursday 's second leg .

" i think it will be increased ... because the needs have increased , " michel said .
" the humanitarian situation in the palestinian territories is deteriorating a lot .
i remember when i came one year ago in the region , it was already awful and difficult , but now i think it is deteriorating . " the palestinian territories have been reeling from the effects of a ban on direct aid to the government that the european union and the united states imposed a year ago , when the islamist hamas movement formed a cabinet . the european union , the largest donor of aid to the palestinians , has since funneled aid money through a special mechanism that bypasses the government , meaning that tens of thousands of civil servants have gone without full pay . payments bypass government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is still sending about $ 34 million a month to the palestinian authority palestinian officials had hoped a unity government formed between members of hamas and president mahmoud abbas ' fatah faction would convince the eu to lift the aid embargo .
the israeli government , however , has pressed for the eu to keep the ban in place until the palestinian unity government recognizes israel , renounces violence and abides by international peace deals . " as long as these criteria are not fulfilled , there will not be a change in the system , the manner , the process of aid support from the european union , " michel said . eu officials estimated that - even accounting for funds not issued through the government - the bloc sends about $ 34 million a month in " allowances " directly to health officials and civil servants to meet their basic needs . citizens ' concerns come first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel said the barrier in the west bank could have a negative effect on people 's daily lives he said restrictions on movement that israel imposed in the territories , citing security precautions , were partly to blame . " i show a very high concern for the security of israel , " michel said .
" i know it is not an easy life to be under the danger of terror attacks ... but at the same time when i see walls , when i see the fences and when i see the barriers , of course i can easily imagine it has very bad consequences on the daily life of the people in the palestinian territories . " the belgian eu official also condemned both the near-daily rocket attacks by palestinian militants from gaza on israeli civilian towns and israeli military actions targeting palestinian population centers . " my first concern ... is to see how we can improve the access and the movement of the people , " michel added . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oxfam urges eu to lift aid boycott on palestinians international relief agency oxfam on friday urged the european union to lift a year-long suspension of aid to the hamas-led government as the palestinian people sink deeper into poverty .

although he is widely seen as the architect of turkey 's eu bid , they object to his islamist past and the fact that his wife wears the muslim headscarf . to them , the prospect of a president with an islamist background is proof of religion steadily creeping into politics and public life .
the government 's supporters , meanwhile , respond with charges of crisis-mongering and flouting democracy in a country where surveys show people increasingly identify with islam . amid these growing concerns , thousands of people rallied in ankara in recent weeks against erdogan and his party . boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations in ankara meanwhile , opposition parties boycotted the poll friday and declared the vote invalid . the main opposition party republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- had threatened a boycott and said it would challenge the result in the constitutional court if the session convened with less than two-thirds of the legislators taking part - hoping thereby to isolate the akp by convincing other opposition mps to boycott the session .
the plan was then to petition the constitutional court to scrap the first-round vote , thus blocking the election process and forcing early elections . " i urge all elected deputies to come and do their democratic political duty .
we are facing one of the most important days of our democratic life , " erdogan had said in a last-minute appeal to deputies to attend the parliament vote friday . " let us not fall into the trap of those who are trying to drag turkey back to the customs of the past , to those periods of political paralysis , " he added .
" despite our differences , the result of our democratic rivalry , we are ... the representatives of the same nation , " he said .
" attending the general assembly and voting - be it for or against - is a duty given to us by the people . " but as the vote began , the number fell short of a 367-member threshold and the chp confirmed it would challenge the vote in court .
according to the reuters news agency , there were 360 deputies in the chamber for the vote , clearing the way for the main opposition to ask the constitutional court to annul the vote . the akp now faces the biggest crisis of its near five-year rule .
if the court upholds the opposition appeal , erdogan will have to call a snap general election within 90 days . the candidates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul oversaw turkey 's eu bid the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , holds a solid majority in the 550-member assembly to secure gul 's election , but only in the later stages of the vote . the only other candidate , dissident akp deputy ersonmez yarbay , stands no chance of election . the akp currently controls nearly two-thirds of the legislative assembly , or 352 seats , despite winning only 34 percent of the popular vote - a quirk of turkey 's electoral system . the party has disowned its islamist roots , pledged commitment to the secular system and secured the opening of membership talks with the european union . but some of its actions , such as attempts to criminalize adultery , isolate alcohol-serving establishments in special zones and encourage koranic courses , have fuelled suspicions of its islamist ambitions . in what was seen as a last-minute maneuver to garner support , the akp said friday it was ready to consider several constitutional reforms advocated by the centre-right motherland party -lrb- anap -rrb- in the hope of luring its 20 deputies to vote . the moderate gul was picked as akp candidate following unprecedented mass protests against erdogan , a highly popular but controversial politician who had been widely expected to run . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish foreign minister abdullah gül to run for president turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has named foreign minister abdullah gül as the ruling party 's candidate for president , ending speculation that erdogan , a former islamist , would stand himself .

" i would like to see bochum win the match and schalke lift the trophy , " said peter neururer , who has coached both teams in the past .
schalke have not lost in five trips to bochum , winning four and drawing once .
but bochum boast the bundesliga top scorer in theofanis gekas , who is ready to add to his 18 goals before a summer move to bayer leverkusen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cutouts will be replaced with the real thing if schalke win the next four matches schalke are aware of the danger , with sports director andreas müller expecting the match to be trickier than the game in a fortnight at their biggest regional rival borussia dortmund .
" a lot of people are talking about the dortmund match , but bochum could be much tougher for us , " müller said .
" we have to win the last four games . "
schalke lead the way with 62 points from werder bremen -lrb- 60 -rrb- and vfb stuttgart -lrb- 58 -rrb- , and ca n't afford to drop points if they really want to lift the trophy for the first time since 1958 .
" i do n't think we will relinquish the lead , " schalke playmaker lincoln said .
" but if we do we are strong enough to reclaim it . "
schalke coach mirko slomka said his side must concentrate on winning their last four games - against bochum , nuremberg , dortmund and arminia bielefeld - to make the title safe .
" it 's not a question of waiting for one of the others to slip up , we just have to put on a good performance ourselves , " he said .

bremen president jürgen born and sports director klaus allofs , however , ruled out a transfer within germany but reiterated that klose could get out of his contract , which runs until 2008 , if he has an offer from a foreign club .
german media reported that klose met with munich officials , while spanish media said the german goal scorer was set to join barcelona .
" there is a contract with miroslav klose until 2008 and we have received no offer , neither from munich nor barcelona , " born said .

" the first step will still have to be to clarify exactly what president -lrb- vladimir -rrb- putin meant , " chief nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters , when asked how the alliance would respond to the apparent move .
" i have seen quotes from presidential advisors saying : ' well , we only mean in six months ' , i have heard some else tell me that he subsequently said they only mean in one year , " he said .
" there will clearly be a discussion within nato , there will clearly be a discussion between capitals and the russian federation on what they mean . "
making his last state of the nation speech in moscow , putin said thursday that russia could pull out of the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty until all of nato 's current members ratified it .
" it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence ... until it has been ratified by all nato countries without exception , " he said .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said the 26 member countries had received the news with " concern , grave concern , disappointment and deep regret because the allies are of the opinion that the cfe treaty is one of the cornerstones of european security . "
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for calm .
" the arithmetic of the cold war , with its numbers of armed vehicles , missiles and troops on each side , just does n't add up any more , " he said .
" we must avoid an escalation . "
europeans call for calm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's steinmeier calls for more dialogue " what we need is not less disarmament and fewer arms controls , we need more , " said steinmeier , whose once-divided country was the frontline for the cold war .
in berlin government spokesman thomas steg called for continued dialogue , while adding that " we are strongly convinced that threats do not help . "
in france foreign ministry spokesman jean-baptiste mattei called for russia to go back on its decision , calling the cfe treaty " a cornerstone of security in europe . "
he said that debate on the treaty and the us anti-missile plan that triggered putin 's move should continue in the nato-russia joint council to overcome moscow 's suspicions .
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 in paris by the countries of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- and the former warsaw pact to limit military hardware in the region .
it was adapted in istanbul in 1999 following the collapse of the warsaw pact , in order to limit deployments on a country-by-country basis .
nato states have refused to ratify the new pact on the grounds that moscow has failed to honour commitments made in istanbul to withdraw russian forces from the former soviet republics of georgia and moldova .
increased threat of mutually assured destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's tone has become more belligerent in recent days president putin reiterated his belliegernt stance when he warned of an increased threat of mutually assured destruction in a meeting about the planned us missile shield with czech president vaclav klaus .
" the increase of the threat of mutual harm to one another , and possibly of destruction , will grow many times over , " putin said , adding the system 's proposed bases in the czech republic and poland would violate europe 's security apparatus .
although the us plans have been known for years , russia has increased its rhetoric in recent months after the czech republic and poland , eastern european countries moscow considers its sphere of influence , entered talks to house elements on their territory .
us defence secretary robert gates visited putin and other officials in moscow earlier this week to invite russia to join the project , but apparently made little progress .
washington says the shield is designed to protect against threats from iran and north korea and that its 10 interceptor missiles could not defend against russia 's thousands of warheads .
russia claims to be real target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russians consider the missile system to be a threat russia has said it is the target of the shield , and putin told klaus he was ready to invite specialists from the czech republic and poland to show neither iran nor north korea had missile systems demanding the defence system .
washington , for its part , says both north korea and iran either have or are trying to acquire atomic bombs and could in 10 years ' time have missiles that threaten europe .
klaus told russian news agencies after his talks with putin that he had been unable to explain the czech arguments for the shield .
" i assured the president the czech side did n't have the slightest intention for the radar bases -lrb- proposed for czech territory -rrb- to become a threat to russia , " klaus said .
" that 's understandable - the czech republic wo n't control the stations , " putin was quoted as saying in response .
in a meeting where putin reminded klaus his country received 75 per cent of its natural gas from energy-rich moscow and had recently signed an agreement lasting till 2035 , putin told the czech leader the shield was similar to putting nuclear missiles on european territory .
putin said he hoped the czech republic would advance russian-eu relations as european union president in 2009 .
" i have a very wide circle of questions and problems and we are glad for the opportunity to exchange opinions , " he added .
but regarding the shield , he added that " as head of state i would have to say yes , relations will worsen . "

granted the composer 's name does have selling power , but is there room in the region for another classical venue ? " it will be a one-of-a-kind concert hall , " said karin hempel-soos , spokesperson for bonn ’ s culture council and driving force behind the plans for a new festival concert hall in germany ’ s former capital .
the estimated 60 to 80 million euro -lrb- $ 81-108 million -rrb- hall is meant to draw top-notch performers and put bonn - and beethoven - in the big leagues , along with salzburg and mozart , and bayreuth and wagner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house in bonn is now a museum it may be completed as early as 2011 , well in time for the composer ’ s 250th birthday in 2020 .
a design contest for the building is said to be in the works , and according to bonn ’ s daily general-anzeiger , the who ’ s-who of architecture are being taken into consideration : tadao ando , frank gehry , jacques herzog , pierre de meuron and thomas van den valentyn , for example . critics , however , are wondering whether the glamorous hall , top artists and a big-name mascot will be enough to attract the most important ingredient - enough music lovers to fill the planned 1,400 seats .
“ there ’ s a lot of competition for the concert hall in bonn , ” wrote the city ’ s daily paper . an oversaturated music market ? within the past few years , western germany ’ s rhine and ruhr valley regions have invested millions of both public and private funds in constructing new classical music venues and renovating older ones .
all of them are within an hour ’ s drive from bonn .
in duisburg the mercatorhalle has been transformed into a massive 150 million-euro -lrb- $ 204 million -rrb- complex that includes a 1,750-seat concert hall as well as a shopping mall , casino and conference center .
it opened on april 21 .
dortmund , minutes away from duisburg , opened a new 50 million euro , 1,550-seat concert hall in 2002 .
essen renovated its philharmonic in 2004 and düsseldorf modernized its world-renowned tonhalle in 2005 .
bochum , also in the ruhr valley , is planning to complete a 29.3 million euro concert hall in 2010 in honor of the region ’ s distinction that year as europe ’ s culture capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this statue on bonn 's central square reminds passersby of the city 's connection to beethoven the cologne philharmonic , considered to be one of the most beautiful concert halls in the world , is barely a half-hour drive from bonn .
" per year , 90,000 tickets to the cologne philharmonic are sold to bonn residents because they don ’ t have anything like that in bonn , " said hempel-soos .
she also estimated that there were around a million potential concert-goers in the area directly surrounding bonn . they won ’ t go to dortmund or duisburg , she said , because bonn will offer something completely different - world-class in everything from the building to the performers . questioning priorities for her , it ’ s matter-of-fact that the composer should be honored in his birthplace - and with much more than the less-than-modern beethoven hall , built in 1959 , the smaller chamber music house , museum and numerous monuments that already adorn the city . still , some are asking whether it ’ s wise to build an additional venue instead of using a fraction of the money to pay for renovations to other cultural institutions .
bonn ’ s theater , for example , where operas , ballets and some plays are performed , could use a 20 million euro overhaul , according to the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger . it ’ s not the city of bonn that will be cutting a check for the new venue , however .
though nothing has been put in ink quite yet , three major german companies headquartered in bonn - deutsche telekom , deutsche post and postbank - are on deck to finance 100 percent of the construction costs . after the project is completed , a partially public foundation will be set up to ensure that the level of artistic quality remains high .
after all , big-name musicians aren ’ t cheaper by the dozen .
employee benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's existing beethoven hall , built in 1959 , is wanting in acoustics and aesthetics as a sponsor , the postbank is counting on the magnetic power of the legendary hall to-be .
" it is important to the company that bonn is an attractive city for its employees , " said postbank spokesperson joachim strunk , who added that it ’ s a way to encourage employee retention .
telekom ’ s commitment to the elite project , however , coincides with the current negotiations over cutting pay and increasing work time for 50,000 of its employees , who may not necessarily be enthusiastic about the multi-million euro deal .
with beethoven as the helm , organizers have set their sights way beyond bonn , however .
" it is critical that the artistic program is at a first-class level , in order to make an international name for bonn as the city of beethoven , " said strunk .
for hempel-soos , the formula for making bonn the city of beethoven is simple : " when the best musicians in the world come to bonn , the audiences will come too .

" i think it will be increased ... because the needs have increased , " michel said .
" the humanitarian situation in the palestinian territories is deteriorating a lot .
i remember when i came one year ago in the region , it was already awful and difficult , but now i think it is deteriorating . " the palestinian territories have been reeling from the effects of a ban on direct aid to the government that the european union and the united states imposed a year ago , when the islamist hamas movement formed a cabinet . the european union , the largest donor of aid to the palestinians , has since funneled aid money through a special mechanism that bypasses the government , meaning that tens of thousands of civil servants have gone without full pay . payments bypass government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is still sending about $ 34 million a month to the palestinian authority palestinian officials had hoped a unity government formed between members of hamas and president mahmoud abbas ' fatah faction would convince the eu to lift the aid embargo .
the israeli government , however , has pressed for the eu to keep the ban in place until the palestinian unity government recognizes israel , renounces violence and abides by international peace deals . " as long as these criteria are not fulfilled , there will not be a change in the system , the manner , the process of aid support from the european union , " michel said . eu officials estimated that - even accounting for funds not issued through the government - the bloc sends about $ 34 million a month in " allowances " directly to health officials and civil servants to meet their basic needs . citizens ' concerns come first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel said the barrier in the west bank could have a negative effect on people 's daily lives he said restrictions on movement that israel imposed in the territories , citing security precautions , were partly to blame . " i show a very high concern for the security of israel , " michel said .
" i know it is not an easy life to be under the danger of terror attacks ... but at the same time when i see walls , when i see the fences and when i see the barriers , of course i can easily imagine it has very bad consequences on the daily life of the people in the palestinian territories . " the belgian eu official also condemned both the near-daily rocket attacks by palestinian militants from gaza on israeli civilian towns and israeli military actions targeting palestinian population centers . " my first concern ... is to see how we can improve the access and the movement of the people , " michel added . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oxfam urges eu to lift aid boycott on palestinians international relief agency oxfam on friday urged the european union to lift a year-long suspension of aid to the hamas-led government as the palestinian people sink deeper into poverty .

" i would like to see bochum win the match and schalke lift the trophy , " said peter neururer , who has coached both teams in the past .
schalke have not lost in five trips to bochum , winning four and drawing once .
but bochum boast the bundesliga top scorer in theofanis gekas , who is ready to add to his 18 goals before a summer move to bayer leverkusen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cutouts will be replaced with the real thing if schalke win the next four matches schalke are aware of the danger , with sports director andreas müller expecting the match to be trickier than the game in a fortnight at their biggest regional rival borussia dortmund .
" a lot of people are talking about the dortmund match , but bochum could be much tougher for us , " müller said .
" we have to win the last four games . "
schalke lead the way with 62 points from werder bremen -lrb- 60 -rrb- and vfb stuttgart -lrb- 58 -rrb- , and ca n't afford to drop points if they really want to lift the trophy for the first time since 1958 .
" i do n't think we will relinquish the lead , " schalke playmaker lincoln said .
" but if we do we are strong enough to reclaim it . "
schalke coach mirko slomka said his side must concentrate on winning their last four games - against bochum , nuremberg , dortmund and arminia bielefeld - to make the title safe .
" it 's not a question of waiting for one of the others to slip up , we just have to put on a good performance ourselves , " he said .

former champions borussia mönchengladbach are the only club all but beyond hope eight points away from safety .
relegation could become a fact for them if they lose at home on saturday against stuttgart , who are coming off a morale-boosting 2-0 against champions bayern munich and are in the running for a league and cup double .
bremen left wondering about klose the real danger for schalke comes from bremen , who may be left contending only for the german title as their uefa cup chances nearly disintegrated after a 3-0 semi-final loss in barcelona to espanyol on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been tight lipped about whether he 'll keep hugging bremen players next season bremen 's bundesliga match at troubled arminia bielefeld comes on sunday and could be overshadowed by speculation that their top striker miroslav klose will leave for archrival munich .
bremen president jürgen born and sports director klaus allofs , however , ruled out a transfer within germany but reiterated that klose could get out of his contract , which runs until 2008 , if he has an offer from a foreign club .
german media reported that klose met with munich officials , while spanish media said the german goal scorer was set to join barcelona .
" there is a contract with miroslav klose until 2008 and we have received no offer , neither from munich nor barcelona , " born said .
bad news piles up in munich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi wo n't be back this season after suffering a knee injury munich had to bury their remote title hopes last week in stuttgart and , trailing stuttgart by five points in fourth place , are also likely to miss the champions league for the first time in a decade .
there was more bad news ahead of saturday 's match against troubled sv hamburg as striker lukas podolski was ruled out for the rest of the season due to a knee injury that requires surgery .
mark van bommel , owen hargreaves and claudio pizarro are all also struggling against injuries but are likely to finish the season .
second-from-bottom mainz 05 will be praying for three points and some magic from their egyptian striker mohamed zidan , who has bagged 11 goals this season when they host mid-table hanover .
borussia dortmund and eintracht frankfurt , both hovering above the bottom three , will be scrapping for points , while vfl wolfsburg travel to nuremberg .

espanyol 's third goal came in the game 's final minutes from substitute ferran corominas . german international torsten frings said bremen would have a difficult time preventing an all-spanish uefa cup final in glasgow on may 16 . bremen need a " miracle " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese will miss the second semi-final leg for a professional foul in barcelona " you ca n't make mistakes like that if you want to be the uefa cup winners , 3-0 is a big loss , " he said .

the call came as an eu report highlighted ongoing human rights failings in various countries . germany needs to use its presidency of the eu to take a strong stance against the failings of russia and china in regards to human rights , activists said at a meeting in berlin .
the leaders of three russian non-governmental organizations pressed the eu to address what they said was a deteriorating rights situation in russia under president vladimir putin .
the activists gathered in berlin at the invitation of new york-based human rights watch and amnesty international on thursday .
the head of the centre for the development of democracy and human rights , yuri dzhibladze , accused germany of turning a blind eye to rights violations in russia so as not to jeopardize its economic ties , in particular in the energy sector .
" we believe that germany is under performing in its role of leader in europe in working with russia , " dzhibladze told reporters , ahead of eu-russia human rights consultations on may 3 in berlin , before the may 18 eu-russia summit .
germany needs to " speak up " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should put political pressure on putin , activists say the chairwoman of demos centre for information and research , tanya lokshina , cited a bloody police crackdown against opposition activists and a sharp rise in racist attacks as symptomatic of a harsher climate for dissent .
" all the european countries ought to stand up for russian civil society , but germany should be leading the way , " lokshina said .
" with the putin government trying to suppress all dissent , we need you now more than ever . "
oleg orlov , the head of memorial , one of russia 's oldest human rights groups , said europe had the power to help turn the tide in russia .
" speaking out on human rights in russia wo n't threaten europe 's energy supply but it would really help to curb the government 's crackdown , " orlov said .
" russian civil society is under attack and we need germany to speak up . "
the activists also criticised the planning of next week 's meeting in berlin , saying that no russian human rights groups had been invited .
eu criticizes putin 's government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian reporter anna politkovskaya 's murder points to human rights problems under putin the meeting in berlin coincided with the release of the eu parliament 's annual human rights report .
the parliament in strasbourg strongly criticised the russian government over human rights , regretting that the eu has had " only limited success in bringing about policy change as a result of raising difficult issues . "
the report attacked russian legislation limiting the activities of ngos and that journalists and human rights defenders have been threatened .
it also highlighted the murder of russian journalist anna politkovskaya and allegations of russian involvement in the poisoning of former russian agent alexander litvinenko in london .
serious concerns about china in addition to russia , the eu raised concern about turkey , iran and china .
china 's human rights record is a matter of " serious concern " and should thus " receive more focus in the build-up to the beijing olympic games , " parliament members said , emphasising the need to strengthen and improve dialogue on the issue between the eu and china .
members urged the european commission and member states " to raise the question of tibet " in talks with the beijing government , adding that trade relations with china should be contingent upon human rights reform .
china has ruled tibet since 1951 , since troops were sent to " liberate " the region .
subsequent uprisings have been violently supressed .
china on thursday warned visiting foreigners against engaging in activities that threaten the nation 's unity , as a rights group demanded the release of four americans detained for a pro-tibet protest .
" limited progress " in other countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's record was criticized by the eu the report also noted a deterioration of the human rights situation in iran , including " the intensification of the repression against human rights defenders . "
the report also voiced concern over the " limited progress " on human rights issues in turkey and encouraged the ankara government to change article 301 of its penal code , which outlaws the denigration of " turkishness . "
it raises concerns over religious freedoms and minority rights , including for the kurds in the southeast of the country .
the eu itself does not escape censure in the parliamentary report which says the union should have taken " more unilateral action " to persuade the sudanese government to accept an international peacekeeping force in darfur .
parliament members want " a plan of specific , targeted sanctions to be imposed on the khartoum regime ... in the event of non-compliance with the demands of the international community . "

the original constitution has been ratified by 18 of the 27 eu member states but was kicked into the political long grass in 2005 when french and dutch voters rejected it in national referendums .
the german eu presidency , which has arranged bilateral consultations with member states over an intensive two-week period from april 23 to may 4 , is making every effort " to restrict changes to what is absolutely necessary to reach an overall agreement and ensure ratification in all member states , " according to the questionnaire 's introduction .
among the most euroskeptic nations are the netherlands and britain .
british prime minister tony blair said last friday that his country no longer needs to hold a referendum on any new european union treaty , a move welcomed by eu leaders battling to replace the bloc 's near-dead constitution .
blair said the eu treaty he favors to replace the failed one would not require a british referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in brussels were relieved by blair 's comments " if it 's not a constitutional treaty , so that it alters the basic relationship between europe and the member states , then there is n't the same case for a referendum , " he told papers including britain 's financial times .
lowest common denominator in the introduction to its questionnaire , the german presidency says that a european summit on june 21-22 should decide to open " an intergovernmental conference with a very precise and limited mandate " on the constitution , with the aim of getting it ratified by all members before the next european parliamentary elections in 2009 .
the 12 questions are based on suggestions arising from previous bilateral negotiations , as the germans attempt to discover what the minimum changes each country would insist upon are for a new treaty to be acceptable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even metioning an eu anthem is touchy hence many of the questions have been in effect drawn up by the less enthusiastic member states .
thus , there is a question about avoiding explicitly mentioning the primacy of eu law and another on avoiding the use of certain terms , including " constitution " and european " minister for foreign affairs , " a post that was included in the original treaty and led to fears concerning national sovereignty over foreign policy .
these name changes would be made " without changing the legal substance " of the measures , the german paper assures .

" i think it will be increased ... because the needs have increased , " michel said .
" the humanitarian situation in the palestinian territories is deteriorating a lot .
i remember when i came one year ago in the region , it was already awful and difficult , but now i think it is deteriorating . " the palestinian territories have been reeling from the effects of a ban on direct aid to the government that the european union and the united states imposed a year ago , when the islamist hamas movement formed a cabinet . the european union , the largest donor of aid to the palestinians , has since funneled aid money through a special mechanism that bypasses the government , meaning that tens of thousands of civil servants have gone without full pay . payments bypass government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is still sending about $ 34 million a month to the palestinian authority palestinian officials had hoped a unity government formed between members of hamas and president mahmoud abbas ' fatah faction would convince the eu to lift the aid embargo .
the israeli government , however , has pressed for the eu to keep the ban in place until the palestinian unity government recognizes israel , renounces violence and abides by international peace deals . " as long as these criteria are not fulfilled , there will not be a change in the system , the manner , the process of aid support from the european union , " michel said . eu officials estimated that - even accounting for funds not issued through the government - the bloc sends about $ 34 million a month in " allowances " directly to health officials and civil servants to meet their basic needs . citizens ' concerns come first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel said the barrier in the west bank could have a negative effect on people 's daily lives he said restrictions on movement that israel imposed in the territories , citing security precautions , were partly to blame . " i show a very high concern for the security of israel , " michel said .
" i know it is not an easy life to be under the danger of terror attacks ... but at the same time when i see walls , when i see the fences and when i see the barriers , of course i can easily imagine it has very bad consequences on the daily life of the people in the palestinian territories . " the belgian eu official also condemned both the near-daily rocket attacks by palestinian militants from gaza on israeli civilian towns and israeli military actions targeting palestinian population centers .

the original constitution has been ratified by 18 of the 27 eu member states but was kicked into the political long grass in 2005 when french and dutch voters rejected it in national referendums .
the german eu presidency , which has arranged bilateral consultations with member states over an intensive two-week period from april 23 to may 4 , is making every effort " to restrict changes to what is absolutely necessary to reach an overall agreement and ensure ratification in all member states , " according to the questionnaire 's introduction .
among the most euroskeptic nations are the netherlands and britain .
british prime minister tony blair said last friday that his country no longer needs to hold a referendum on any new european union treaty , a move welcomed by eu leaders battling to replace the bloc 's near-dead constitution .
blair said the eu treaty he favors to replace the failed one would not require a british referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in brussels were relieved by blair 's comments " if it 's not a constitutional treaty , so that it alters the basic relationship between europe and the member states , then there is n't the same case for a referendum , " he told papers including britain 's financial times .
lowest common denominator in the introduction to its questionnaire , the german presidency says that a european summit on june 21-22 should decide to open " an intergovernmental conference with a very precise and limited mandate " on the constitution , with the aim of getting it ratified by all members before the next european parliamentary elections in 2009 .
the 12 questions are based on suggestions arising from previous bilateral negotiations , as the germans attempt to discover what the minimum changes each country would insist upon are for a new treaty to be acceptable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even metioning an eu anthem is touchy hence many of the questions have been in effect drawn up by the less enthusiastic member states .
thus , there is a question about avoiding explicitly mentioning the primacy of eu law and another on avoiding the use of certain terms , including " constitution " and european " minister for foreign affairs , " a post that was included in the original treaty and led to fears concerning national sovereignty over foreign policy .
these name changes would be made " without changing the legal substance " of the measures , the german paper assures .
likewise there is a question about dropping references to eu symbols such as its flag and anthem .
another question asks whether the member states believe that the original package of institutional provisions was " balanced " and " should not be reopened .

germany needs to " speak up " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should put political pressure on putin , activists say the chairwoman of demos centre for information and research , tanya lokshina , cited a bloody police crackdown against opposition activists and a sharp rise in racist attacks as symptomatic of a harsher climate for dissent .
" all the european countries ought to stand up for russian civil society , but germany should be leading the way , " lokshina said .
" with the putin government trying to suppress all dissent , we need you now more than ever . "
oleg orlov , the head of memorial , one of russia 's oldest human rights groups , said europe had the power to help turn the tide in russia .
" speaking out on human rights in russia wo n't threaten europe 's energy supply but it would really help to curb the government 's crackdown , " orlov said .
" russian civil society is under attack and we need germany to speak up . "
the activists also criticised the planning of next week 's meeting in berlin , saying that no russian human rights groups had been invited .
eu criticizes putin 's government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian reporter anna politkovskaya 's murder points to human rights problems under putin the meeting in berlin coincided with the release of the eu parliament 's annual human rights report .
the parliament in strasbourg strongly criticised the russian government over human rights , regretting that the eu has had " only limited success in bringing about policy change as a result of raising difficult issues . "
the report attacked russian legislation limiting the activities of ngos and that journalists and human rights defenders have been threatened .
it also highlighted the murder of russian journalist anna politkovskaya and allegations of russian involvement in the poisoning of former russian agent alexander litvinenko in london .
serious concerns about china in addition to russia , the eu raised concern about turkey , iran and china .
china 's human rights record is a matter of " serious concern " and should thus " receive more focus in the build-up to the beijing olympic games , " parliament members said , emphasising the need to strengthen and improve dialogue on the issue between the eu and china .
members urged the european commission and member states " to raise the question of tibet " in talks with the beijing government , adding that trade relations with china should be contingent upon human rights reform .
china has ruled tibet since 1951 , since troops were sent to " liberate " the region .
subsequent uprisings have been violently supressed .
china on thursday warned visiting foreigners against engaging in activities that threaten the nation 's unity , as a rights group demanded the release of four americans detained for a pro-tibet protest .
" limited progress " in other countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's record was criticized by the eu the report also noted a deterioration of the human rights situation in iran , including " the intensification of the repression against human rights defenders . "
the report also voiced concern over the " limited progress " on human rights issues in turkey and encouraged the ankara government to change article 301 of its penal code , which outlaws the denigration of " turkishness . "
it raises concerns over religious freedoms and minority rights , including for the kurds in the southeast of the country .
the eu itself does not escape censure in the parliamentary report which says the union should have taken " more unilateral action " to persuade the sudanese government to accept an international peacekeeping force in darfur .
parliament members want " a plan of specific , targeted sanctions to be imposed on the khartoum regime ... in the event of non-compliance with the demands of the international community . "
the parliament also called on the eu to urge the us government to " charge or release " its guantanamo detainees " in accordance with international law .

" i think it will be increased ... because the needs have increased , " michel said .
" the humanitarian situation in the palestinian territories is deteriorating a lot .
i remember when i came one year ago in the region , it was already awful and difficult , but now i think it is deteriorating . " the palestinian territories have been reeling from the effects of a ban on direct aid to the government that the european union and the united states imposed a year ago , when the islamist hamas movement formed a cabinet . the european union , the largest donor of aid to the palestinians , has since funneled aid money through a special mechanism that bypasses the government , meaning that tens of thousands of civil servants have gone without full pay . payments bypass government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is still sending about $ 34 million a month to the palestinian authority palestinian officials had hoped a unity government formed between members of hamas and president mahmoud abbas ' fatah faction would convince the eu to lift the aid embargo .
the israeli government , however , has pressed for the eu to keep the ban in place until the palestinian unity government recognizes israel , renounces violence and abides by international peace deals . " as long as these criteria are not fulfilled , there will not be a change in the system , the manner , the process of aid support from the european union , " michel said . eu officials estimated that - even accounting for funds not issued through the government - the bloc sends about $ 34 million a month in " allowances " directly to health officials and civil servants to meet their basic needs . citizens ' concerns come first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel said the barrier in the west bank could have a negative effect on people 's daily lives he said restrictions on movement that israel imposed in the territories , citing security precautions , were partly to blame . " i show a very high concern for the security of israel , " michel said .
" i know it is not an easy life to be under the danger of terror attacks ... but at the same time when i see walls , when i see the fences and when i see the barriers , of course i can easily imagine it has very bad consequences on the daily life of the people in the palestinian territories . " the belgian eu official also condemned both the near-daily rocket attacks by palestinian militants from gaza on israeli civilian towns and israeli military actions targeting palestinian population centers . " my first concern ... is to see how we can improve the access and the movement of the people , " michel added . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oxfam urges eu to lift aid boycott on palestinians international relief agency oxfam on friday urged the european union to lift a year-long suspension of aid to the hamas-led government as the palestinian people sink deeper into poverty .
-lrb- 13.04.2007 -rrb- eu says no to aiding palestinian unity government new palestinian finance minister salam fayyad has failed to convince the european union to agree to resume aid to the palestinian authority despite what he called a " very acute financial crisis " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 27.04.2007 germany quizzes eu members on constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the route to a constitutional treaty is long and precarious germany , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has sent the 27 eu member states a questionnaire on what to do about the bloc 's stalled constitutional treaty to kick-start an intensive series of talks . the 12 questions cover a range of possibilities , including an opt-out from some policy provisions and dropping the term " constitution , " deemed tainted in several quarters .
the original constitution has been ratified by 18 of the 27 eu member states but was kicked into the political long grass in 2005 when french and dutch voters rejected it in national referendums .
the german eu presidency , which has arranged bilateral consultations with member states over an intensive two-week period from april 23 to may 4 , is making every effort " to restrict changes to what is absolutely necessary to reach an overall agreement and ensure ratification in all member states , " according to the questionnaire 's introduction .
among the most euroskeptic nations are the netherlands and britain .
british prime minister tony blair said last friday that his country no longer needs to hold a referendum on any new european union treaty , a move welcomed by eu leaders battling to replace the bloc 's near-dead constitution .
blair said the eu treaty he favors to replace the failed one would not require a british referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in brussels were relieved by blair 's comments " if it 's not a constitutional treaty , so that it alters the basic relationship between europe and the member states , then there is n't the same case for a referendum , " he told papers including britain 's financial times .
lowest common denominator in the introduction to its questionnaire , the german presidency says that a european summit on june 21-22 should decide to open " an intergovernmental conference with a very precise and limited mandate " on the constitution , with the aim of getting it ratified by all members before the next european parliamentary elections in 2009 .
the 12 questions are based on suggestions arising from previous bilateral negotiations , as the germans attempt to discover what the minimum changes each country would insist upon are for a new treaty to be acceptable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even metioning an eu anthem is touchy hence many of the questions have been in effect drawn up by the less enthusiastic member states .
thus , there is a question about avoiding explicitly mentioning the primacy of eu law and another on avoiding the use of certain terms , including " constitution " and european " minister for foreign affairs , " a post that was included in the original treaty and led to fears concerning national sovereignty over foreign policy .
these name changes would be made " without changing the legal substance " of the measures , the german paper assures .
likewise there is a question about dropping references to eu symbols such as its flag and anthem .
another question asks whether the member states believe that the original package of institutional provisions was " balanced " and " should not be reopened .

but not everyone is happy about the strategy .

although he is widely seen as the architect of turkey 's eu bid , they object to his islamist past and the fact that his wife wears the muslim headscarf . to them , the prospect of a president with an islamist background is proof of religion steadily creeping into politics and public life .
the government 's supporters , meanwhile , respond with charges of crisis-mongering and flouting democracy in a country where surveys show people increasingly identify with islam . amid these growing concerns , thousands of people rallied in ankara in recent weeks against erdogan and his party . boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations in ankara meanwhile , opposition parties boycotted the poll friday and declared the vote invalid . the main opposition party republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- had threatened a boycott and said it would challenge the result in the constitutional court if the session convened with less than two-thirds of the legislators taking part - hoping thereby to isolate the akp by convincing other opposition mps to boycott the session .
the plan was then to petition the constitutional court to scrap the first-round vote , thus blocking the election process and forcing early elections . " i urge all elected deputies to come and do their democratic political duty .
we are facing one of the most important days of our democratic life , " erdogan had said in a last-minute appeal to deputies to attend the parliament vote friday . " let us not fall into the trap of those who are trying to drag turkey back to the customs of the past , to those periods of political paralysis , " he added .
" despite our differences , the result of our democratic rivalry , we are ... the representatives of the same nation , " he said .
" attending the general assembly and voting - be it for or against - is a duty given to us by the people . " but as the vote began , the number fell short of a 367-member threshold and the chp confirmed it would challenge the vote in court .
according to the reuters news agency , there were 360 deputies in the chamber for the vote , clearing the way for the main opposition to ask the constitutional court to annul the vote . the akp now faces the biggest crisis of its near five-year rule .
if the court upholds the opposition appeal , erdogan will have to call a snap general election within 90 days . the candidates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul oversaw turkey 's eu bid the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , holds a solid majority in the 550-member assembly to secure gul 's election , but only in the later stages of the vote . the only other candidate , dissident akp deputy ersonmez yarbay , stands no chance of election . the akp currently controls nearly two-thirds of the legislative assembly , or 352 seats , despite winning only 34 percent of the popular vote - a quirk of turkey 's electoral system . the party has disowned its islamist roots , pledged commitment to the secular system and secured the opening of membership talks with the european union . but some of its actions , such as attempts to criminalize adultery , isolate alcohol-serving establishments in special zones and encourage koranic courses , have fuelled suspicions of its islamist ambitions . in what was seen as a last-minute maneuver to garner support , the akp said friday it was ready to consider several constitutional reforms advocated by the centre-right motherland party -lrb- anap -rrb- in the hope of luring its 20 deputies to vote . the moderate gul was picked as akp candidate following unprecedented mass protests against erdogan , a highly popular but controversial politician who had been widely expected to run . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish foreign minister abdullah gül to run for president turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has named foreign minister abdullah gül as the ruling party 's candidate for president , ending speculation that erdogan , a former islamist , would stand himself .

" the first step will still have to be to clarify exactly what president -lrb- vladimir -rrb- putin meant , " chief nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters , when asked how the alliance would respond to the apparent move .
" i have seen quotes from presidential advisors saying : ' well , we only mean in six months ' , i have heard some else tell me that he subsequently said they only mean in one year , " he said .
" there will clearly be a discussion within nato , there will clearly be a discussion between capitals and the russian federation on what they mean . "
making his last state of the nation speech in moscow , putin said thursday that russia could pull out of the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty until all of nato 's current members ratified it .
" it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence ... until it has been ratified by all nato countries without exception , " he said .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said the 26 member countries had received the news with " concern , grave concern , disappointment and deep regret because the allies are of the opinion that the cfe treaty is one of the cornerstones of european security . "
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for calm .
" the arithmetic of the cold war , with its numbers of armed vehicles , missiles and troops on each side , just does n't add up any more , " he said .
" we must avoid an escalation . "
europeans call for calm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's steinmeier calls for more dialogue " what we need is not less disarmament and fewer arms controls , we need more , " said steinmeier , whose once-divided country was the frontline for the cold war .
in berlin government spokesman thomas steg called for continued dialogue , while adding that " we are strongly convinced that threats do not help . "
in france foreign ministry spokesman jean-baptiste mattei called for russia to go back on its decision , calling the cfe treaty " a cornerstone of security in europe . "
he said that debate on the treaty and the us anti-missile plan that triggered putin 's move should continue in the nato-russia joint council to overcome moscow 's suspicions .
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 in paris by the countries of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- and the former warsaw pact to limit military hardware in the region .
it was adapted in istanbul in 1999 following the collapse of the warsaw pact , in order to limit deployments on a country-by-country basis .
nato states have refused to ratify the new pact on the grounds that moscow has failed to honour commitments made in istanbul to withdraw russian forces from the former soviet republics of georgia and moldova .
increased threat of mutually assured destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's tone has become more belligerent in recent days president putin reiterated his belliegernt stance when he warned of an increased threat of mutually assured destruction in a meeting about the planned us missile shield with czech president vaclav klaus .
" the increase of the threat of mutual harm to one another , and possibly of destruction , will grow many times over , " putin said , adding the system 's proposed bases in the czech republic and poland would violate europe 's security apparatus .
although the us plans have been known for years , russia has increased its rhetoric in recent months after the czech republic and poland , eastern european countries moscow considers its sphere of influence , entered talks to house elements on their territory .
us defence secretary robert gates visited putin and other officials in moscow earlier this week to invite russia to join the project , but apparently made little progress .
washington says the shield is designed to protect against threats from iran and north korea and that its 10 interceptor missiles could not defend against russia 's thousands of warheads .
russia claims to be real target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russians consider the missile system to be a threat russia has said it is the target of the shield , and putin told klaus he was ready to invite specialists from the czech republic and poland to show neither iran nor north korea had missile systems demanding the defence system .
washington , for its part , says both north korea and iran either have or are trying to acquire atomic bombs and could in 10 years ' time have missiles that threaten europe .
klaus told russian news agencies after his talks with putin that he had been unable to explain the czech arguments for the shield .
" i assured the president the czech side did n't have the slightest intention for the radar bases -lrb- proposed for czech territory -rrb- to become a threat to russia , " klaus said .
" that 's understandable - the czech republic wo n't control the stations , " putin was quoted as saying in response .
in a meeting where putin reminded klaus his country received 75 per cent of its natural gas from energy-rich moscow and had recently signed an agreement lasting till 2035 , putin told the czech leader the shield was similar to putting nuclear missiles on european territory .
putin said he hoped the czech republic would advance russian-eu relations as european union president in 2009 .
" i have a very wide circle of questions and problems and we are glad for the opportunity to exchange opinions , " he added .
but regarding the shield , he added that " as head of state i would have to say yes , relations will worsen . "

" the first step will still have to be to clarify exactly what president -lrb- vladimir -rrb- putin meant , " chief nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters , when asked how the alliance would respond to the apparent move .
" i have seen quotes from presidential advisors saying : ' well , we only mean in six months ' , i have heard some else tell me that he subsequently said they only mean in one year , " he said .
" there will clearly be a discussion within nato , there will clearly be a discussion between capitals and the russian federation on what they mean . "
making his last state of the nation speech in moscow , putin said thursday that russia could pull out of the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty until all of nato 's current members ratified it .
" it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence ... until it has been ratified by all nato countries without exception , " he said .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said the 26 member countries had received the news with " concern , grave concern , disappointment and deep regret because the allies are of the opinion that the cfe treaty is one of the cornerstones of european security . "
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for calm .
" the arithmetic of the cold war , with its numbers of armed vehicles , missiles and troops on each side , just does n't add up any more , " he said .
" we must avoid an escalation . "
europeans call for calm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's steinmeier calls for more dialogue " what we need is not less disarmament and fewer arms controls , we need more , " said steinmeier , whose once-divided country was the frontline for the cold war .
in berlin government spokesman thomas steg called for continued dialogue , while adding that " we are strongly convinced that threats do not help . "
in france foreign ministry spokesman jean-baptiste mattei called for russia to go back on its decision , calling the cfe treaty " a cornerstone of security in europe . "
he said that debate on the treaty and the us anti-missile plan that triggered putin 's move should continue in the nato-russia joint council to overcome moscow 's suspicions .
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 in paris by the countries of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- and the former warsaw pact to limit military hardware in the region .
it was adapted in istanbul in 1999 following the collapse of the warsaw pact , in order to limit deployments on a country-by-country basis .
nato states have refused to ratify the new pact on the grounds that moscow has failed to honour commitments made in istanbul to withdraw russian forces from the former soviet republics of georgia and moldova .

germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble remains in favor of the controversial practice , but will wait for a legal ruling . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble faced massive criticism this week after it was revealed that german intelligence agencies were secretly snooping on terrorism suspects via the internet . schäuble has ordered a temporary halt to the practice .
" there is a moratorium , " a spokeswoman for the interior ministry confirmed in the financial times deutschland newspaper on friday .
intelligence agencies have monitored suspects ' computers via the internet for two years , according to members of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee .
privacy concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics question the legality of internet snooping representatives from all political parties questioned the legality of the practice .
critics say the secret searches violate article 13 of the german basic law , which governs privacy .
schäuble , of the christian democratic union , has suggested the government consider expanding article 13 to allow it .
but the government does n't want to go ahead with the monitoring until a clear legal foundation is provided , schäuble told parliament .
until then , the monitoring will stop , he said .
schäuble faced criticism from within his party and from coalition partners in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the interior experts for the cdu / csu , hans-peter uhl and ralf göbel , called the intelligence agency searches were " legally questionable . "
the measures are necessary , but require a " sustainable legal basis , " they said in a statement .
important intelligence tool bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say spying is an important tool in fighting terrorism schäuble has called for a change in the law , saying the monitoring is an important intelligence tool and that the practice should continue .
a special law already exists in the german state of north rhine-westphalia which allows computers to be searched without their owners ' knowledge .
the chancellor 's office insists that terrorism makes examining pc hard drives necessary .
it also said computer monitoring played a role in deployment planning in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , according to parliament records .
germany 's interior intelligence agency , the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- has been accessing private data via the internet since june , 2005 .
the prior interior minister , otto schily , altered regulations to allow it .
according to the chancellor 's office , a decision by the german federal court in january , 2007 , which allowed for online data searches to be prosecuted , does not apply to the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
but politicians argue that schily 's regulations do not provide a sustainable legal foundation for internet spying .
skepticism remains politicians from other parties have maintained skepticism over the necessity of the program and have expressed concern that it violates privacy .
berlin 's state interior minister , ehrhart körting , said the practice was not very efficient , because it catches only the least sophisticated computer users who do n't know how to defend against so-called trojan programs . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german intelligence must stop computer spying , lawmakers say intelligence agencies said they have been monitoring suspects ' computers via the internet , but lawmakers called for an immediate stop to the controversial practice .

he said the government should halt plans for greater access to phone and internet records .

the original constitution has been ratified by 18 of the 27 eu member states but was kicked into the political long grass in 2005 when french and dutch voters rejected it in national referendums .
the german eu presidency , which has arranged bilateral consultations with member states over an intensive two-week period from april 23 to may 4 , is making every effort " to restrict changes to what is absolutely necessary to reach an overall agreement and ensure ratification in all member states , " according to the questionnaire 's introduction .
among the most euroskeptic nations are the netherlands and britain .
british prime minister tony blair said last friday that his country no longer needs to hold a referendum on any new european union treaty , a move welcomed by eu leaders battling to replace the bloc 's near-dead constitution .
blair said the eu treaty he favors to replace the failed one would not require a british referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in brussels were relieved by blair 's comments " if it 's not a constitutional treaty , so that it alters the basic relationship between europe and the member states , then there is n't the same case for a referendum , " he told papers including britain 's financial times .
lowest common denominator in the introduction to its questionnaire , the german presidency says that a european summit on june 21-22 should decide to open " an intergovernmental conference with a very precise and limited mandate " on the constitution , with the aim of getting it ratified by all members before the next european parliamentary elections in 2009 .
the 12 questions are based on suggestions arising from previous bilateral negotiations , as the germans attempt to discover what the minimum changes each country would insist upon are for a new treaty to be acceptable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even metioning an eu anthem is touchy hence many of the questions have been in effect drawn up by the less enthusiastic member states .
thus , there is a question about avoiding explicitly mentioning the primacy of eu law and another on avoiding the use of certain terms , including " constitution " and european " minister for foreign affairs , " a post that was included in the original treaty and led to fears concerning national sovereignty over foreign policy .
these name changes would be made " without changing the legal substance " of the measures , the german paper assures .
likewise there is a question about dropping references to eu symbols such as its flag and anthem .
another question asks whether the member states believe that the original package of institutional provisions was " balanced " and " should not be reopened .

the leaders of three russian non-governmental organizations pressed the eu to address what they said was a deteriorating rights situation in russia under president vladimir putin .
the activists gathered in berlin at the invitation of new york-based human rights watch and amnesty international on thursday .
the head of the centre for the development of democracy and human rights , yuri dzhibladze , accused germany of turning a blind eye to rights violations in russia so as not to jeopardize its economic ties , in particular in the energy sector .
" we believe that germany is under performing in its role of leader in europe in working with russia , " dzhibladze told reporters , ahead of eu-russia human rights consultations on may 3 in berlin , before the may 18 eu-russia summit .
germany needs to " speak up " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should put political pressure on putin , activists say the chairwoman of demos centre for information and research , tanya lokshina , cited a bloody police crackdown against opposition activists and a sharp rise in racist attacks as symptomatic of a harsher climate for dissent .
" all the european countries ought to stand up for russian civil society , but germany should be leading the way , " lokshina said .
" with the putin government trying to suppress all dissent , we need you now more than ever . "
oleg orlov , the head of memorial , one of russia 's oldest human rights groups , said europe had the power to help turn the tide in russia .

germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble remains in favor of the controversial practice , but will wait for a legal ruling . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble faced massive criticism this week after it was revealed that german intelligence agencies were secretly snooping on terrorism suspects via the internet . schäuble has ordered a temporary halt to the practice .
" there is a moratorium , " a spokeswoman for the interior ministry confirmed in the financial times deutschland newspaper on friday .
intelligence agencies have monitored suspects ' computers via the internet for two years , according to members of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee .
privacy concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics question the legality of internet snooping representatives from all political parties questioned the legality of the practice .
critics say the secret searches violate article 13 of the german basic law , which governs privacy .
schäuble , of the christian democratic union , has suggested the government consider expanding article 13 to allow it .
but the government does n't want to go ahead with the monitoring until a clear legal foundation is provided , schäuble told parliament .
until then , the monitoring will stop , he said .
schäuble faced criticism from within his party and from coalition partners in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the interior experts for the cdu / csu , hans-peter uhl and ralf göbel , called the intelligence agency searches were " legally questionable . "
the measures are necessary , but require a " sustainable legal basis , " they said in a statement .
important intelligence tool bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say spying is an important tool in fighting terrorism schäuble has called for a change in the law , saying the monitoring is an important intelligence tool and that the practice should continue .
a special law already exists in the german state of north rhine-westphalia which allows computers to be searched without their owners ' knowledge .
the chancellor 's office insists that terrorism makes examining pc hard drives necessary .
it also said computer monitoring played a role in deployment planning in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , according to parliament records .
germany 's interior intelligence agency , the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- has been accessing private data via the internet since june , 2005 .
the prior interior minister , otto schily , altered regulations to allow it .
according to the chancellor 's office , a decision by the german federal court in january , 2007 , which allowed for online data searches to be prosecuted , does not apply to the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
but politicians argue that schily 's regulations do not provide a sustainable legal foundation for internet spying .
skepticism remains politicians from other parties have maintained skepticism over the necessity of the program and have expressed concern that it violates privacy .
berlin 's state interior minister , ehrhart körting , said the practice was not very efficient , because it catches only the least sophisticated computer users who do n't know how to defend against so-called trojan programs . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german intelligence must stop computer spying , lawmakers say intelligence agencies said they have been monitoring suspects ' computers via the internet , but lawmakers called for an immediate stop to the controversial practice .

he said the government should halt plans for greater access to phone and internet records .
-lrb- 24.04.2007 -rrb- in germany , new anti-terrorism database stirs controversy germany 's first single database from which both police and intelligence officials can tap information about terrorism suspects went into operation friday .
but critics say the measure could erode civil liberties .

" there is a moratorium , " a spokeswoman for the interior ministry confirmed in the financial times deutschland newspaper on friday .
intelligence agencies have monitored suspects ' computers via the internet for two years , according to members of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee .
privacy concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics question the legality of internet snooping representatives from all political parties questioned the legality of the practice .
critics say the secret searches violate article 13 of the german basic law , which governs privacy .
schäuble , of the christian democratic union , has suggested the government consider expanding article 13 to allow it .
but the government does n't want to go ahead with the monitoring until a clear legal foundation is provided , schäuble told parliament .
until then , the monitoring will stop , he said .
schäuble faced criticism from within his party and from coalition partners in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the interior experts for the cdu / csu , hans-peter uhl and ralf göbel , called the intelligence agency searches were " legally questionable . "
the measures are necessary , but require a " sustainable legal basis , " they said in a statement .
important intelligence tool bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say spying is an important tool in fighting terrorism schäuble has called for a change in the law , saying the monitoring is an important intelligence tool and that the practice should continue .
a special law already exists in the german state of north rhine-westphalia which allows computers to be searched without their owners ' knowledge .
the chancellor 's office insists that terrorism makes examining pc hard drives necessary .
it also said computer monitoring played a role in deployment planning in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , according to parliament records .
germany 's interior intelligence agency , the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- has been accessing private data via the internet since june , 2005 .
the prior interior minister , otto schily , altered regulations to allow it .
according to the chancellor 's office , a decision by the german federal court in january , 2007 , which allowed for online data searches to be prosecuted , does not apply to the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
but politicians argue that schily 's regulations do not provide a sustainable legal foundation for internet spying .
skepticism remains politicians from other parties have maintained skepticism over the necessity of the program and have expressed concern that it violates privacy .
berlin 's state interior minister , ehrhart körting , said the practice was not very efficient , because it catches only the least sophisticated computer users who do n't know how to defend against so-called trojan programs . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german intelligence must stop computer spying , lawmakers say intelligence agencies said they have been monitoring suspects ' computers via the internet , but lawmakers called for an immediate stop to the controversial practice .

he said the government should halt plans for greater access to phone and internet records .

but critics say the measure could erode civil liberties .

cup holders sevilla fell in the night 's other semi-final 1-0 to osasuna . barcelona espanyol headed in two goals from corner kicks in front of a home crowd thursday night and gave thomas schaaf 's side a clear outline of what the team will have to improve before the semi-final 's second leg kicks off place in bremen . espanyol moved out in front of bremen midway through the first half when moises hurtado headed into goal on an ivan de la pena corner , then doubled their lead shortly after the halftime break when walter pandiani put in another de la pena corner kick .
espanyol 's third goal came in the game 's final minutes from substitute ferran corominas . german international torsten frings said bremen would have a difficult time preventing an all-spanish uefa cup final in glasgow on may 16 . bremen need a " miracle " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese will miss the second semi-final leg for a professional foul in barcelona " you ca n't make mistakes like that if you want to be the uefa cup winners , 3-0 is a big loss , " he said .
" we 'll need a pretty big miracle .
with a performance like this one , we do n't have a chance . " the german side , which has n't lost a bundesliga match since mid-february , appeared to have forgotten to unpack its offensive arsenal made up of playmaker diego and world cup golden boot winner miroslav klose , neither of whom were able to leave an impression on the match . both teams will be without key players for this thursday 's second leg .
goal scorers moises and pandiani both received yellow cards and will be will be suspended for the match in bremen . the bundesliga side finished the match with 10 men and will play with a back-up goalie between the posts after tim wiese received a red card for hauling down espanyol striker raul tamudo outside the area . " after the red card it was difficult for us to get back into it , " schaaf said .
" we are going to have to put in an exceptional performance -lrb- in the return leg -rrb- if we are to progress . " sevilla face manageable task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roberto soldado , in red , stayed out in front of sevilla spanish league strugglers osasuna turned on the style to claim a precious 1-0 home win over reigning uefa cup champions sevilla in the first leg of the competition 's other semi-final . osasuna came out fired up but appeared to be lacking the required focus in the early stages when veteran striker savo milosevic threw sevilla 's christian poulsen to the ground with a forceful - an unpunished - shove in the face . david lopez , arguably osasuna 's man-of-the-match , delivered a cross 10 minutes after the restart , that left sevilla 's keeper clutching at air when roberto soldado 's header drove its way in at the far post . soldado narrowly missed claiming his second goal on 63 minutes when he ran unchallenged down the left flank , cut inside his defender and sent his long curling effort just over the top left hand corner . shortly thereafter the referee walked off the pitch , followed by the players , when it appeared he had been hit with an object thrown from the crowd . six minutes of injury time were later allocated for the interruption , but despite close efforts on sevilla 's part to snatch an undeserved draw , osasuna held on for a well-deserved win that could prove decisive ahead of the second leg next week . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen out to gatecrash spanish fiesta in uefa cup semis werder bremen aim to crash the spanish uefa cup fiesta thursday when they play espanyol in the first leg of their semi-final tie .

cup holders sevilla fell in the night 's other semi-final 1-0 to osasuna . barcelona espanyol headed in two goals from corner kicks in front of a home crowd thursday night and gave thomas schaaf 's side a clear outline of what the team will have to improve before the semi-final 's second leg kicks off place in bremen . espanyol moved out in front of bremen midway through the first half when moises hurtado headed into goal on an ivan de la pena corner , then doubled their lead shortly after the halftime break when walter pandiani put in another de la pena corner kick .
espanyol 's third goal came in the game 's final minutes from substitute ferran corominas . german international torsten frings said bremen would have a difficult time preventing an all-spanish uefa cup final in glasgow on may 16 . bremen need a " miracle " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese will miss the second semi-final leg for a professional foul in barcelona " you ca n't make mistakes like that if you want to be the uefa cup winners , 3-0 is a big loss , " he said .
" we 'll need a pretty big miracle .
with a performance like this one , we do n't have a chance . " the german side , which has n't lost a bundesliga match since mid-february , appeared to have forgotten to unpack its offensive arsenal made up of playmaker diego and world cup golden boot winner miroslav klose , neither of whom were able to leave an impression on the match . both teams will be without key players for this thursday 's second leg .
goal scorers moises and pandiani both received yellow cards and will be will be suspended for the match in bremen . the bundesliga side finished the match with 10 men and will play with a back-up goalie between the posts after tim wiese received a red card for hauling down espanyol striker raul tamudo outside the area .

cup holders sevilla fell in the night 's other semi-final 1-0 to osasuna . barcelona espanyol headed in two goals from corner kicks in front of a home crowd thursday night and gave thomas schaaf 's side a clear outline of what the team will have to improve before the semi-final 's second leg kicks off place in bremen . espanyol moved out in front of bremen midway through the first half when moises hurtado headed into goal on an ivan de la pena corner , then doubled their lead shortly after the halftime break when walter pandiani put in another de la pena corner kick .
espanyol 's third goal came in the game 's final minutes from substitute ferran corominas . german international torsten frings said bremen would have a difficult time preventing an all-spanish uefa cup final in glasgow on may 16 . bremen need a " miracle " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese will miss the second semi-final leg for a professional foul in barcelona " you ca n't make mistakes like that if you want to be the uefa cup winners , 3-0 is a big loss , " he said .
" we 'll need a pretty big miracle .
with a performance like this one , we do n't have a chance . " the german side , which has n't lost a bundesliga match since mid-february , appeared to have forgotten to unpack its offensive arsenal made up of playmaker diego and world cup golden boot winner miroslav klose , neither of whom were able to leave an impression on the match . both teams will be without key players for this thursday 's second leg .
goal scorers moises and pandiani both received yellow cards and will be will be suspended for the match in bremen . the bundesliga side finished the match with 10 men and will play with a back-up goalie between the posts after tim wiese received a red card for hauling down espanyol striker raul tamudo outside the area . " after the red card it was difficult for us to get back into it , " schaaf said .
" we are going to have to put in an exceptional performance -lrb- in the return leg -rrb- if we are to progress . " sevilla face manageable task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roberto soldado , in red , stayed out in front of sevilla spanish league strugglers osasuna turned on the style to claim a precious 1-0 home win over reigning uefa cup champions sevilla in the first leg of the competition 's other semi-final . osasuna came out fired up but appeared to be lacking the required focus in the early stages when veteran striker savo milosevic threw sevilla 's christian poulsen to the ground with a forceful - an unpunished - shove in the face . david lopez , arguably osasuna 's man-of-the-match , delivered a cross 10 minutes after the restart , that left sevilla 's keeper clutching at air when roberto soldado 's header drove its way in at the far post . soldado narrowly missed claiming his second goal on 63 minutes when he ran unchallenged down the left flank , cut inside his defender and sent his long curling effort just over the top left hand corner . shortly thereafter the referee walked off the pitch , followed by the players , when it appeared he had been hit with an object thrown from the crowd . six minutes of injury time were later allocated for the interruption , but despite close efforts on sevilla 's part to snatch an undeserved draw , osasuna held on for a well-deserved win that could prove decisive ahead of the second leg next week . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen out to gatecrash spanish fiesta in uefa cup semis werder bremen aim to crash the spanish uefa cup fiesta thursday when they play espanyol in the first leg of their semi-final tie .

" i think it will be increased ... because the needs have increased , " michel said .
" the humanitarian situation in the palestinian territories is deteriorating a lot .
i remember when i came one year ago in the region , it was already awful and difficult , but now i think it is deteriorating . " the palestinian territories have been reeling from the effects of a ban on direct aid to the government that the european union and the united states imposed a year ago , when the islamist hamas movement formed a cabinet . the european union , the largest donor of aid to the palestinians , has since funneled aid money through a special mechanism that bypasses the government , meaning that tens of thousands of civil servants have gone without full pay . payments bypass government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is still sending about $ 34 million a month to the palestinian authority palestinian officials had hoped a unity government formed between members of hamas and president mahmoud abbas ' fatah faction would convince the eu to lift the aid embargo .
the israeli government , however , has pressed for the eu to keep the ban in place until the palestinian unity government recognizes israel , renounces violence and abides by international peace deals . " as long as these criteria are not fulfilled , there will not be a change in the system , the manner , the process of aid support from the european union , " michel said . eu officials estimated that - even accounting for funds not issued through the government - the bloc sends about $ 34 million a month in " allowances " directly to health officials and civil servants to meet their basic needs . citizens ' concerns come first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel said the barrier in the west bank could have a negative effect on people 's daily lives he said restrictions on movement that israel imposed in the territories , citing security precautions , were partly to blame . " i show a very high concern for the security of israel , " michel said .
" i know it is not an easy life to be under the danger of terror attacks ... but at the same time when i see walls , when i see the fences and when i see the barriers , of course i can easily imagine it has very bad consequences on the daily life of the people in the palestinian territories . " the belgian eu official also condemned both the near-daily rocket attacks by palestinian militants from gaza on israeli civilian towns and israeli military actions targeting palestinian population centers .

a new sales tax increase that went into effect in january would kill consumer spending , they predicted .
that has n't happened .
instead , gfk , germany ’ s largest market research institute , announced this week consumer confidence in the economy is at an all time high .
at the same time , earnings forcasts escalated to a six year high .
" consumption has the green light , ” said gfk spokesperson klaus wübbenhorst .
experts said they were surprised how quickly confidence came back after an initially weak start to the year .
the economic forecast increased almost eight points to 61 points , a record since the monthly consumer climate study began in 1980 .
one of the important reasons for this optimism is caused by positive developments in the employment market , gfk said .
sunny outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence has boosted business and predictions are that consumer confidence will remain strong , with the typical german scepticism nowhere to be found .
earnings forecasts were better in april than expected , due to a strong job market .
signs that the slump in consumer spending had ended could be seen in the retail industry .
“ we see signs that the retail industry on a growth path , but not at the level of the national economy , ” said hubertus pellengahr of the german retail association .
a run of warm spring weather has led to strong showings for home improvement stores and garden centers , he said .
unemployment down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's nowhere but up for the german economy the upswing in consumer confidence helps the job market , said federal finance minister peer steinbrück “ the clear expansion of employment with its positive consequences for private income and consumption makes it likely that the domestic demand will increase in the upcoming months , ” steinbrück said .
the government is counting on a decrease in unemployment of more than a million people by 2008 .
in the upcoming year the number of unemployed should be less than 3.5 million .
that would be the lowest rate in more than a decade .
the government also increased its growth estimate to 2.3 percent .
until now , the government had predicted a 1.7 percent growth rate .
the monthly gfk consumer indicator is based on a survey of approximately 2,000 consumers .
substantial factors in determining the consumer climate are income expectations , earnings forecasts and purchases .
strong euro wo n't stop boom the euro is hovering at $ 1.36 a near-record high .
the situation seems likely to continue without having a negative effect on the economy , as long as foreign demand remains strong .
the euro could go as high as $ 1.40 without causing major economic problems , economists said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de business confidence surges as germany boosts growth outlook business confidence in germany continued to climb in april as the booming german economy , the biggest in the 13-country eurozone , was bolstered by international investment , a survey showed .

cup holders sevilla fell in the night 's other semi-final 1-0 to osasuna . barcelona espanyol headed in two goals from corner kicks in front of a home crowd thursday night and gave thomas schaaf 's side a clear outline of what the team will have to improve before the semi-final 's second leg kicks off place in bremen . espanyol moved out in front of bremen midway through the first half when moises hurtado headed into goal on an ivan de la pena corner , then doubled their lead shortly after the halftime break when walter pandiani put in another de la pena corner kick .
espanyol 's third goal came in the game 's final minutes from substitute ferran corominas . german international torsten frings said bremen would have a difficult time preventing an all-spanish uefa cup final in glasgow on may 16 . bremen need a " miracle " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese will miss the second semi-final leg for a professional foul in barcelona " you ca n't make mistakes like that if you want to be the uefa cup winners , 3-0 is a big loss , " he said .
" we 'll need a pretty big miracle .
with a performance like this one , we do n't have a chance . " the german side , which has n't lost a bundesliga match since mid-february , appeared to have forgotten to unpack its offensive arsenal made up of playmaker diego and world cup golden boot winner miroslav klose , neither of whom were able to leave an impression on the match . both teams will be without key players for this thursday 's second leg .
goal scorers moises and pandiani both received yellow cards and will be will be suspended for the match in bremen . the bundesliga side finished the match with 10 men and will play with a back-up goalie between the posts after tim wiese received a red card for hauling down espanyol striker raul tamudo outside the area . " after the red card it was difficult for us to get back into it , " schaaf said .
" we are going to have to put in an exceptional performance -lrb- in the return leg -rrb- if we are to progress . " sevilla face manageable task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roberto soldado , in red , stayed out in front of sevilla spanish league strugglers osasuna turned on the style to claim a precious 1-0 home win over reigning uefa cup champions sevilla in the first leg of the competition 's other semi-final . osasuna came out fired up but appeared to be lacking the required focus in the early stages when veteran striker savo milosevic threw sevilla 's christian poulsen to the ground with a forceful - an unpunished - shove in the face . david lopez , arguably osasuna 's man-of-the-match , delivered a cross 10 minutes after the restart , that left sevilla 's keeper clutching at air when roberto soldado 's header drove its way in at the far post . soldado narrowly missed claiming his second goal on 63 minutes when he ran unchallenged down the left flank , cut inside his defender and sent his long curling effort just over the top left hand corner . shortly thereafter the referee walked off the pitch , followed by the players , when it appeared he had been hit with an object thrown from the crowd . six minutes of injury time were later allocated for the interruption , but despite close efforts on sevilla 's part to snatch an undeserved draw , osasuna held on for a well-deserved win that could prove decisive ahead of the second leg next week . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen out to gatecrash spanish fiesta in uefa cup semis werder bremen aim to crash the spanish uefa cup fiesta thursday when they play espanyol in the first leg of their semi-final tie .

germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble remains in favor of the controversial practice , but will wait for a legal ruling . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble faced massive criticism this week after it was revealed that german intelligence agencies were secretly snooping on terrorism suspects via the internet . schäuble has ordered a temporary halt to the practice .
" there is a moratorium , " a spokeswoman for the interior ministry confirmed in the financial times deutschland newspaper on friday .
intelligence agencies have monitored suspects ' computers via the internet for two years , according to members of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee .
privacy concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics question the legality of internet snooping representatives from all political parties questioned the legality of the practice .
critics say the secret searches violate article 13 of the german basic law , which governs privacy .
schäuble , of the christian democratic union , has suggested the government consider expanding article 13 to allow it .
but the government does n't want to go ahead with the monitoring until a clear legal foundation is provided , schäuble told parliament .
until then , the monitoring will stop , he said .
schäuble faced criticism from within his party and from coalition partners in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the interior experts for the cdu / csu , hans-peter uhl and ralf göbel , called the intelligence agency searches were " legally questionable . "
the measures are necessary , but require a " sustainable legal basis , " they said in a statement .
important intelligence tool bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say spying is an important tool in fighting terrorism schäuble has called for a change in the law , saying the monitoring is an important intelligence tool and that the practice should continue .
a special law already exists in the german state of north rhine-westphalia which allows computers to be searched without their owners ' knowledge .
the chancellor 's office insists that terrorism makes examining pc hard drives necessary .
it also said computer monitoring played a role in deployment planning in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , according to parliament records .
germany 's interior intelligence agency , the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- has been accessing private data via the internet since june , 2005 .
the prior interior minister , otto schily , altered regulations to allow it .
according to the chancellor 's office , a decision by the german federal court in january , 2007 , which allowed for online data searches to be prosecuted , does not apply to the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
but politicians argue that schily 's regulations do not provide a sustainable legal foundation for internet spying .
skepticism remains politicians from other parties have maintained skepticism over the necessity of the program and have expressed concern that it violates privacy .
berlin 's state interior minister , ehrhart körting , said the practice was not very efficient , because it catches only the least sophisticated computer users who do n't know how to defend against so-called trojan programs . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german intelligence must stop computer spying , lawmakers say intelligence agencies said they have been monitoring suspects ' computers via the internet , but lawmakers called for an immediate stop to the controversial practice .

" i would like to see bochum win the match and schalke lift the trophy , " said peter neururer , who has coached both teams in the past .
schalke have not lost in five trips to bochum , winning four and drawing once .
but bochum boast the bundesliga top scorer in theofanis gekas , who is ready to add to his 18 goals before a summer move to bayer leverkusen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cutouts will be replaced with the real thing if schalke win the next four matches schalke are aware of the danger , with sports director andreas müller expecting the match to be trickier than the game in a fortnight at their biggest regional rival borussia dortmund .
" a lot of people are talking about the dortmund match , but bochum could be much tougher for us , " müller said .
" we have to win the last four games . "
schalke lead the way with 62 points from werder bremen -lrb- 60 -rrb- and vfb stuttgart -lrb- 58 -rrb- , and ca n't afford to drop points if they really want to lift the trophy for the first time since 1958 .
" i do n't think we will relinquish the lead , " schalke playmaker lincoln said .
" but if we do we are strong enough to reclaim it . "
schalke coach mirko slomka said his side must concentrate on winning their last four games - against bochum , nuremberg , dortmund and arminia bielefeld - to make the title safe .
" it 's not a question of waiting for one of the others to slip up , we just have to put on a good performance ourselves , " he said .

former champions borussia mönchengladbach are the only club all but beyond hope eight points away from safety .
relegation could become a fact for them if they lose at home on saturday against stuttgart , who are coming off a morale-boosting 2-0 against champions bayern munich and are in the running for a league and cup double .
bremen left wondering about klose the real danger for schalke comes from bremen , who may be left contending only for the german title as their uefa cup chances nearly disintegrated after a 3-0 semi-final loss in barcelona to espanyol on thursday .

bremen president jürgen born and sports director klaus allofs , however , ruled out a transfer within germany but reiterated that klose could get out of his contract , which runs until 2008 , if he has an offer from a foreign club .
german media reported that klose met with munich officials , while spanish media said the german goal scorer was set to join barcelona .
" there is a contract with miroslav klose until 2008 and we have received no offer , neither from munich nor barcelona , " born said .

the call came as an eu report highlighted ongoing human rights failings in various countries . germany needs to use its presidency of the eu to take a strong stance against the failings of russia and china in regards to human rights , activists said at a meeting in berlin .
the leaders of three russian non-governmental organizations pressed the eu to address what they said was a deteriorating rights situation in russia under president vladimir putin .
the activists gathered in berlin at the invitation of new york-based human rights watch and amnesty international on thursday .
the head of the centre for the development of democracy and human rights , yuri dzhibladze , accused germany of turning a blind eye to rights violations in russia so as not to jeopardize its economic ties , in particular in the energy sector .
" we believe that germany is under performing in its role of leader in europe in working with russia , " dzhibladze told reporters , ahead of eu-russia human rights consultations on may 3 in berlin , before the may 18 eu-russia summit .
germany needs to " speak up " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should put political pressure on putin , activists say the chairwoman of demos centre for information and research , tanya lokshina , cited a bloody police crackdown against opposition activists and a sharp rise in racist attacks as symptomatic of a harsher climate for dissent .
" all the european countries ought to stand up for russian civil society , but germany should be leading the way , " lokshina said .
" with the putin government trying to suppress all dissent , we need you now more than ever . "
oleg orlov , the head of memorial , one of russia 's oldest human rights groups , said europe had the power to help turn the tide in russia .
" speaking out on human rights in russia wo n't threaten europe 's energy supply but it would really help to curb the government 's crackdown , " orlov said .
" russian civil society is under attack and we need germany to speak up . "
the activists also criticised the planning of next week 's meeting in berlin , saying that no russian human rights groups had been invited .
eu criticizes putin 's government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian reporter anna politkovskaya 's murder points to human rights problems under putin the meeting in berlin coincided with the release of the eu parliament 's annual human rights report .
the parliament in strasbourg strongly criticised the russian government over human rights , regretting that the eu has had " only limited success in bringing about policy change as a result of raising difficult issues . "
the report attacked russian legislation limiting the activities of ngos and that journalists and human rights defenders have been threatened .
it also highlighted the murder of russian journalist anna politkovskaya and allegations of russian involvement in the poisoning of former russian agent alexander litvinenko in london .
serious concerns about china in addition to russia , the eu raised concern about turkey , iran and china .
china 's human rights record is a matter of " serious concern " and should thus " receive more focus in the build-up to the beijing olympic games , " parliament members said , emphasising the need to strengthen and improve dialogue on the issue between the eu and china .
members urged the european commission and member states " to raise the question of tibet " in talks with the beijing government , adding that trade relations with china should be contingent upon human rights reform .
china has ruled tibet since 1951 , since troops were sent to " liberate " the region .
subsequent uprisings have been violently supressed .
china on thursday warned visiting foreigners against engaging in activities that threaten the nation 's unity , as a rights group demanded the release of four americans detained for a pro-tibet protest .
" limited progress " in other countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's record was criticized by the eu the report also noted a deterioration of the human rights situation in iran , including " the intensification of the repression against human rights defenders . "
the report also voiced concern over the " limited progress " on human rights issues in turkey and encouraged the ankara government to change article 301 of its penal code , which outlaws the denigration of " turkishness . "
it raises concerns over religious freedoms and minority rights , including for the kurds in the southeast of the country .
the eu itself does not escape censure in the parliamentary report which says the union should have taken " more unilateral action " to persuade the sudanese government to accept an international peacekeeping force in darfur .
parliament members want " a plan of specific , targeted sanctions to be imposed on the khartoum regime ... in the event of non-compliance with the demands of the international community . "
the parliament also called on the eu to urge the us government to " charge or release " its guantanamo detainees " in accordance with international law .

the call came as an eu report highlighted ongoing human rights failings in various countries . germany needs to use its presidency of the eu to take a strong stance against the failings of russia and china in regards to human rights , activists said at a meeting in berlin .
the leaders of three russian non-governmental organizations pressed the eu to address what they said was a deteriorating rights situation in russia under president vladimir putin .
the activists gathered in berlin at the invitation of new york-based human rights watch and amnesty international on thursday .
the head of the centre for the development of democracy and human rights , yuri dzhibladze , accused germany of turning a blind eye to rights violations in russia so as not to jeopardize its economic ties , in particular in the energy sector .
" we believe that germany is under performing in its role of leader in europe in working with russia , " dzhibladze told reporters , ahead of eu-russia human rights consultations on may 3 in berlin , before the may 18 eu-russia summit .
germany needs to " speak up " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should put political pressure on putin , activists say the chairwoman of demos centre for information and research , tanya lokshina , cited a bloody police crackdown against opposition activists and a sharp rise in racist attacks as symptomatic of a harsher climate for dissent .
" all the european countries ought to stand up for russian civil society , but germany should be leading the way , " lokshina said .
" with the putin government trying to suppress all dissent , we need you now more than ever . "
oleg orlov , the head of memorial , one of russia 's oldest human rights groups , said europe had the power to help turn the tide in russia .
" speaking out on human rights in russia wo n't threaten europe 's energy supply but it would really help to curb the government 's crackdown , " orlov said .
" russian civil society is under attack and we need germany to speak up . "
the activists also criticised the planning of next week 's meeting in berlin , saying that no russian human rights groups had been invited .
eu criticizes putin 's government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian reporter anna politkovskaya 's murder points to human rights problems under putin the meeting in berlin coincided with the release of the eu parliament 's annual human rights report .
the parliament in strasbourg strongly criticised the russian government over human rights , regretting that the eu has had " only limited success in bringing about policy change as a result of raising difficult issues . "
the report attacked russian legislation limiting the activities of ngos and that journalists and human rights defenders have been threatened .
it also highlighted the murder of russian journalist anna politkovskaya and allegations of russian involvement in the poisoning of former russian agent alexander litvinenko in london .
serious concerns about china in addition to russia , the eu raised concern about turkey , iran and china .
china 's human rights record is a matter of " serious concern " and should thus " receive more focus in the build-up to the beijing olympic games , " parliament members said , emphasising the need to strengthen and improve dialogue on the issue between the eu and china .
members urged the european commission and member states " to raise the question of tibet " in talks with the beijing government , adding that trade relations with china should be contingent upon human rights reform .
china has ruled tibet since 1951 , since troops were sent to " liberate " the region .
subsequent uprisings have been violently supressed .
china on thursday warned visiting foreigners against engaging in activities that threaten the nation 's unity , as a rights group demanded the release of four americans detained for a pro-tibet protest .
" limited progress " in other countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's record was criticized by the eu the report also noted a deterioration of the human rights situation in iran , including " the intensification of the repression against human rights defenders . "
the report also voiced concern over the " limited progress " on human rights issues in turkey and encouraged the ankara government to change article 301 of its penal code , which outlaws the denigration of " turkishness . "
it raises concerns over religious freedoms and minority rights , including for the kurds in the southeast of the country .
the eu itself does not escape censure in the parliamentary report which says the union should have taken " more unilateral action " to persuade the sudanese government to accept an international peacekeeping force in darfur .
parliament members want " a plan of specific , targeted sanctions to be imposed on the khartoum regime ... in the event of non-compliance with the demands of the international community . "
the parliament also called on the eu to urge the us government to " charge or release " its guantanamo detainees " in accordance with international law .

" i have seen quotes from presidential advisors saying : ' well , we only mean in six months ' , i have heard some else tell me that he subsequently said they only mean in one year , " he said .
" there will clearly be a discussion within nato , there will clearly be a discussion between capitals and the russian federation on what they mean . "
making his last state of the nation speech in moscow , putin said thursday that russia could pull out of the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty until all of nato 's current members ratified it .
" it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence ... until it has been ratified by all nato countries without exception , " he said .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said the 26 member countries had received the news with " concern , grave concern , disappointment and deep regret because the allies are of the opinion that the cfe treaty is one of the cornerstones of european security . "
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for calm .

europeans call for calm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's steinmeier calls for more dialogue " what we need is not less disarmament and fewer arms controls , we need more , " said steinmeier , whose once-divided country was the frontline for the cold war .
in berlin government spokesman thomas steg called for continued dialogue , while adding that " we are strongly convinced that threats do not help . "
in france foreign ministry spokesman jean-baptiste mattei called for russia to go back on its decision , calling the cfe treaty " a cornerstone of security in europe . "
he said that debate on the treaty and the us anti-missile plan that triggered putin 's move should continue in the nato-russia joint council to overcome moscow 's suspicions .
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 in paris by the countries of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- and the former warsaw pact to limit military hardware in the region .
it was adapted in istanbul in 1999 following the collapse of the warsaw pact , in order to limit deployments on a country-by-country basis .
nato states have refused to ratify the new pact on the grounds that moscow has failed to honour commitments made in istanbul to withdraw russian forces from the former soviet republics of georgia and moldova .

" the increase of the threat of mutual harm to one another , and possibly of destruction , will grow many times over , " putin said , adding the system 's proposed bases in the czech republic and poland would violate europe 's security apparatus .
although the us plans have been known for years , russia has increased its rhetoric in recent months after the czech republic and poland , eastern european countries moscow considers its sphere of influence , entered talks to house elements on their territory .
us defence secretary robert gates visited putin and other officials in moscow earlier this week to invite russia to join the project , but apparently made little progress .

washington , for its part , says both north korea and iran either have or are trying to acquire atomic bombs and could in 10 years ' time have missiles that threaten europe .
klaus told russian news agencies after his talks with putin that he had been unable to explain the czech arguments for the shield .
" i assured the president the czech side did n't have the slightest intention for the radar bases -lrb- proposed for czech territory -rrb- to become a threat to russia , " klaus said .

of 552 votes , 497 members of parliament were in favor of the extension until november 15 , while 32 were against it and 23 abstained . 39 unarmed german soldiers and five police officers are currently taking part in the un mission in sudan -lrb- unmis -rrb- at a cost of some 800,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.09m -rrb- .
the mandate allows for up to 75 german troops , while the total unmis consists of 10,000 soldiers , of which 750 are observers , and 700 police personnel . " it 's important we support the peace process in sudan , " said gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesperson for the social democratic party .
" despite its modest means , this mission is far more than just symbolic . " strong criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr meets the sudanese armes forces in juba during the debate , politicians from all parties spoke out about human rights abuses in darfur and strongly criticized the sudanese government in khartoum , recently accused by the un of flying arms into darfur in planes disguised with un symbols , in violation of un security council resolutions . according to the united nations , the situation in sudan is currently the world 's worst humanitarian crisis .
about 200,000 people have been killed and two million displaced in the four-year conflict in darfur that began as a rebellion and turned into a savage conflict involving government forces , tribes and villagers . eu called on to act but despite escalating violence in the region , the eu has shied away from imposing tougher sanctions on the sudanese government . berlin has also adopted a motion for a resolution to push the eu to increase fundung to the african union 's mission in darfur , as well as to humanitarian aid programs in the region , including in neighboring chad and the central african republic .

germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble remains in favor of the controversial practice , but will wait for a legal ruling . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble faced massive criticism this week after it was revealed that german intelligence agencies were secretly snooping on terrorism suspects via the internet . schäuble has ordered a temporary halt to the practice .
" there is a moratorium , " a spokeswoman for the interior ministry confirmed in the financial times deutschland newspaper on friday .
intelligence agencies have monitored suspects ' computers via the internet for two years , according to members of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee .
privacy concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics question the legality of internet snooping representatives from all political parties questioned the legality of the practice .
critics say the secret searches violate article 13 of the german basic law , which governs privacy .
schäuble , of the christian democratic union , has suggested the government consider expanding article 13 to allow it .
but the government does n't want to go ahead with the monitoring until a clear legal foundation is provided , schäuble told parliament .
until then , the monitoring will stop , he said .
schäuble faced criticism from within his party and from coalition partners in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the interior experts for the cdu / csu , hans-peter uhl and ralf göbel , called the intelligence agency searches were " legally questionable . "
the measures are necessary , but require a " sustainable legal basis , " they said in a statement .
important intelligence tool bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say spying is an important tool in fighting terrorism schäuble has called for a change in the law , saying the monitoring is an important intelligence tool and that the practice should continue .
a special law already exists in the german state of north rhine-westphalia which allows computers to be searched without their owners ' knowledge .
the chancellor 's office insists that terrorism makes examining pc hard drives necessary .
it also said computer monitoring played a role in deployment planning in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , according to parliament records .
germany 's interior intelligence agency , the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- has been accessing private data via the internet since june , 2005 .
the prior interior minister , otto schily , altered regulations to allow it .
according to the chancellor 's office , a decision by the german federal court in january , 2007 , which allowed for online data searches to be prosecuted , does not apply to the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
but politicians argue that schily 's regulations do not provide a sustainable legal foundation for internet spying .
skepticism remains politicians from other parties have maintained skepticism over the necessity of the program and have expressed concern that it violates privacy .
berlin 's state interior minister , ehrhart körting , said the practice was not very efficient , because it catches only the least sophisticated computer users who do n't know how to defend against so-called trojan programs . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german intelligence must stop computer spying , lawmakers say intelligence agencies said they have been monitoring suspects ' computers via the internet , but lawmakers called for an immediate stop to the controversial practice .
-lrb- 26.04.2007 -rrb- harsh words from german commissioner on data protection the federal commissioner for data protection has accused the german government of " culpable neglect " in protecting data privacy .
he said the government should halt plans for greater access to phone and internet records .
-lrb- 24.04.2007 -rrb- in germany , new anti-terrorism database stirs controversy germany 's first single database from which both police and intelligence officials can tap information about terrorism suspects went into operation friday .

of 552 votes , 497 members of parliament were in favor of the extension until november 15 , while 32 were against it and 23 abstained . 39 unarmed german soldiers and five police officers are currently taking part in the un mission in sudan -lrb- unmis -rrb- at a cost of some 800,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.09m -rrb- .
the mandate allows for up to 75 german troops , while the total unmis consists of 10,000 soldiers , of which 750 are observers , and 700 police personnel .

about 200,000 people have been killed and two million displaced in the four-year conflict in darfur that began as a rebellion and turned into a savage conflict involving government forces , tribes and villagers . eu called on to act but despite escalating violence in the region , the eu has shied away from imposing tougher sanctions on the sudanese government . berlin has also adopted a motion for a resolution to push the eu to increase fundung to the african union 's mission in darfur , as well as to humanitarian aid programs in the region , including in neighboring chad and the central african republic .
the german government also wants the eu to encourage russia and china to step up pressure on omar hassan ahmad al-bashir 's government . at a meeting of in luxembourg earlier this week , the bloc 's 27 foreign ministers complained that humanitarian aid to the trouble-spot is moreover being hampered by red tape , with germany 's frank-walter steinmeier of the social democrats describing the situation as " extremely disturbing .

although he is widely seen as the architect of turkey 's eu bid , they object to his islamist past and the fact that his wife wears the muslim headscarf . to them , the prospect of a president with an islamist background is proof of religion steadily creeping into politics and public life .
the government 's supporters , meanwhile , respond with charges of crisis-mongering and flouting democracy in a country where surveys show people increasingly identify with islam . amid these growing concerns , thousands of people rallied in ankara in recent weeks against erdogan and his party . boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations in ankara meanwhile , opposition parties boycotted the poll friday and declared the vote invalid . the main opposition party republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- had threatened a boycott and said it would challenge the result in the constitutional court if the session convened with less than two-thirds of the legislators taking part - hoping thereby to isolate the akp by convincing other opposition mps to boycott the session .
the plan was then to petition the constitutional court to scrap the first-round vote , thus blocking the election process and forcing early elections . " i urge all elected deputies to come and do their democratic political duty .
we are facing one of the most important days of our democratic life , " erdogan had said in a last-minute appeal to deputies to attend the parliament vote friday . " let us not fall into the trap of those who are trying to drag turkey back to the customs of the past , to those periods of political paralysis , " he added .
" despite our differences , the result of our democratic rivalry , we are ... the representatives of the same nation , " he said .
" attending the general assembly and voting - be it for or against - is a duty given to us by the people . " but as the vote began , the number fell short of a 367-member threshold and the chp confirmed it would challenge the vote in court .
according to the reuters news agency , there were 360 deputies in the chamber for the vote , clearing the way for the main opposition to ask the constitutional court to annul the vote . the akp now faces the biggest crisis of its near five-year rule .
if the court upholds the opposition appeal , erdogan will have to call a snap general election within 90 days . the candidates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul oversaw turkey 's eu bid the akp , the moderate offshoot of a now-banned islamist movement , holds a solid majority in the 550-member assembly to secure gul 's election , but only in the later stages of the vote . the only other candidate , dissident akp deputy ersonmez yarbay , stands no chance of election . the akp currently controls nearly two-thirds of the legislative assembly , or 352 seats , despite winning only 34 percent of the popular vote - a quirk of turkey 's electoral system . the party has disowned its islamist roots , pledged commitment to the secular system and secured the opening of membership talks with the european union . but some of its actions , such as attempts to criminalize adultery , isolate alcohol-serving establishments in special zones and encourage koranic courses , have fuelled suspicions of its islamist ambitions . in what was seen as a last-minute maneuver to garner support , the akp said friday it was ready to consider several constitutional reforms advocated by the centre-right motherland party -lrb- anap -rrb- in the hope of luring its 20 deputies to vote . the moderate gul was picked as akp candidate following unprecedented mass protests against erdogan , a highly popular but controversial politician who had been widely expected to run . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish foreign minister abdullah gül to run for president turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has named foreign minister abdullah gül as the ruling party 's candidate for president , ending speculation that erdogan , a former islamist , would stand himself .

" i would like to see bochum win the match and schalke lift the trophy , " said peter neururer , who has coached both teams in the past .
schalke have not lost in five trips to bochum , winning four and drawing once .
but bochum boast the bundesliga top scorer in theofanis gekas , who is ready to add to his 18 goals before a summer move to bayer leverkusen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cutouts will be replaced with the real thing if schalke win the next four matches schalke are aware of the danger , with sports director andreas müller expecting the match to be trickier than the game in a fortnight at their biggest regional rival borussia dortmund .
" a lot of people are talking about the dortmund match , but bochum could be much tougher for us , " müller said .
" we have to win the last four games . "
schalke lead the way with 62 points from werder bremen -lrb- 60 -rrb- and vfb stuttgart -lrb- 58 -rrb- , and ca n't afford to drop points if they really want to lift the trophy for the first time since 1958 .
" i do n't think we will relinquish the lead , " schalke playmaker lincoln said .
" but if we do we are strong enough to reclaim it . "
schalke coach mirko slomka said his side must concentrate on winning their last four games - against bochum , nuremberg , dortmund and arminia bielefeld - to make the title safe .
" it 's not a question of waiting for one of the others to slip up , we just have to put on a good performance ourselves , " he said .
relegation free-for-all continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz 's zidan is in the middle of the battle to avoid relegation in 11th place , bochum , are just three points clear of the drop zone and in a fierce fight against relegation involving more than half of the league 's 18 teams .
former champions borussia mönchengladbach are the only club all but beyond hope eight points away from safety .
relegation could become a fact for them if they lose at home on saturday against stuttgart , who are coming off a morale-boosting 2-0 against champions bayern munich and are in the running for a league and cup double .
bremen left wondering about klose the real danger for schalke comes from bremen , who may be left contending only for the german title as their uefa cup chances nearly disintegrated after a 3-0 semi-final loss in barcelona to espanyol on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been tight lipped about whether he 'll keep hugging bremen players next season bremen 's bundesliga match at troubled arminia bielefeld comes on sunday and could be overshadowed by speculation that their top striker miroslav klose will leave for archrival munich .
bremen president jürgen born and sports director klaus allofs , however , ruled out a transfer within germany but reiterated that klose could get out of his contract , which runs until 2008 , if he has an offer from a foreign club .
german media reported that klose met with munich officials , while spanish media said the german goal scorer was set to join barcelona .
" there is a contract with miroslav klose until 2008 and we have received no offer , neither from munich nor barcelona , " born said .
bad news piles up in munich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi wo n't be back this season after suffering a knee injury munich had to bury their remote title hopes last week in stuttgart and , trailing stuttgart by five points in fourth place , are also likely to miss the champions league for the first time in a decade .
there was more bad news ahead of saturday 's match against troubled sv hamburg as striker lukas podolski was ruled out for the rest of the season due to a knee injury that requires surgery .
mark van bommel , owen hargreaves and claudio pizarro are all also struggling against injuries but are likely to finish the season .
second-from-bottom mainz 05 will be praying for three points and some magic from their egyptian striker mohamed zidan , who has bagged 11 goals this season when they host mid-table hanover .
borussia dortmund and eintracht frankfurt , both hovering above the bottom three , will be scrapping for points , while vfl wolfsburg travel to nuremberg .

cup holders sevilla fell in the night 's other semi-final 1-0 to osasuna . barcelona espanyol headed in two goals from corner kicks in front of a home crowd thursday night and gave thomas schaaf 's side a clear outline of what the team will have to improve before the semi-final 's second leg kicks off place in bremen . espanyol moved out in front of bremen midway through the first half when moises hurtado headed into goal on an ivan de la pena corner , then doubled their lead shortly after the halftime break when walter pandiani put in another de la pena corner kick .
espanyol 's third goal came in the game 's final minutes from substitute ferran corominas . german international torsten frings said bremen would have a difficult time preventing an all-spanish uefa cup final in glasgow on may 16 . bremen need a " miracle " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese will miss the second semi-final leg for a professional foul in barcelona " you ca n't make mistakes like that if you want to be the uefa cup winners , 3-0 is a big loss , " he said .
" we 'll need a pretty big miracle .
with a performance like this one , we do n't have a chance . " the german side , which has n't lost a bundesliga match since mid-february , appeared to have forgotten to unpack its offensive arsenal made up of playmaker diego and world cup golden boot winner miroslav klose , neither of whom were able to leave an impression on the match . both teams will be without key players for this thursday 's second leg .
goal scorers moises and pandiani both received yellow cards and will be will be suspended for the match in bremen . the bundesliga side finished the match with 10 men and will play with a back-up goalie between the posts after tim wiese received a red card for hauling down espanyol striker raul tamudo outside the area . " after the red card it was difficult for us to get back into it , " schaaf said .

but bochum boast the bundesliga top scorer in theofanis gekas , who is ready to add to his 18 goals before a summer move to bayer leverkusen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cutouts will be replaced with the real thing if schalke win the next four matches schalke are aware of the danger , with sports director andreas müller expecting the match to be trickier than the game in a fortnight at their biggest regional rival borussia dortmund .
" a lot of people are talking about the dortmund match , but bochum could be much tougher for us , " müller said .
" we have to win the last four games . "
schalke lead the way with 62 points from werder bremen -lrb- 60 -rrb- and vfb stuttgart -lrb- 58 -rrb- , and ca n't afford to drop points if they really want to lift the trophy for the first time since 1958 .
" i do n't think we will relinquish the lead , " schalke playmaker lincoln said .
" but if we do we are strong enough to reclaim it . "
schalke coach mirko slomka said his side must concentrate on winning their last four games - against bochum , nuremberg , dortmund and arminia bielefeld - to make the title safe .
" it 's not a question of waiting for one of the others to slip up , we just have to put on a good performance ourselves , " he said .
relegation free-for-all continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz 's zidan is in the middle of the battle to avoid relegation in 11th place , bochum , are just three points clear of the drop zone and in a fierce fight against relegation involving more than half of the league 's 18 teams .
former champions borussia mönchengladbach are the only club all but beyond hope eight points away from safety .
relegation could become a fact for them if they lose at home on saturday against stuttgart , who are coming off a morale-boosting 2-0 against champions bayern munich and are in the running for a league and cup double .
bremen left wondering about klose the real danger for schalke comes from bremen , who may be left contending only for the german title as their uefa cup chances nearly disintegrated after a 3-0 semi-final loss in barcelona to espanyol on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been tight lipped about whether he 'll keep hugging bremen players next season bremen 's bundesliga match at troubled arminia bielefeld comes on sunday and could be overshadowed by speculation that their top striker miroslav klose will leave for archrival munich .
bremen president jürgen born and sports director klaus allofs , however , ruled out a transfer within germany but reiterated that klose could get out of his contract , which runs until 2008 , if he has an offer from a foreign club .
german media reported that klose met with munich officials , while spanish media said the german goal scorer was set to join barcelona .
" there is a contract with miroslav klose until 2008 and we have received no offer , neither from munich nor barcelona , " born said .
bad news piles up in munich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi wo n't be back this season after suffering a knee injury munich had to bury their remote title hopes last week in stuttgart and , trailing stuttgart by five points in fourth place , are also likely to miss the champions league for the first time in a decade .
there was more bad news ahead of saturday 's match against troubled sv hamburg as striker lukas podolski was ruled out for the rest of the season due to a knee injury that requires surgery .
mark van bommel , owen hargreaves and claudio pizarro are all also struggling against injuries but are likely to finish the season .
second-from-bottom mainz 05 will be praying for three points and some magic from their egyptian striker mohamed zidan , who has bagged 11 goals this season when they host mid-table hanover .
borussia dortmund and eintracht frankfurt , both hovering above the bottom three , will be scrapping for points , while vfl wolfsburg travel to nuremberg .

germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble remains in favor of the controversial practice , but will wait for a legal ruling . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble faced massive criticism this week after it was revealed that german intelligence agencies were secretly snooping on terrorism suspects via the internet . schäuble has ordered a temporary halt to the practice .
" there is a moratorium , " a spokeswoman for the interior ministry confirmed in the financial times deutschland newspaper on friday .
intelligence agencies have monitored suspects ' computers via the internet for two years , according to members of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee .
privacy concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics question the legality of internet snooping representatives from all political parties questioned the legality of the practice .
critics say the secret searches violate article 13 of the german basic law , which governs privacy .
schäuble , of the christian democratic union , has suggested the government consider expanding article 13 to allow it .
but the government does n't want to go ahead with the monitoring until a clear legal foundation is provided , schäuble told parliament .
until then , the monitoring will stop , he said .
schäuble faced criticism from within his party and from coalition partners in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the interior experts for the cdu / csu , hans-peter uhl and ralf göbel , called the intelligence agency searches were " legally questionable . "
the measures are necessary , but require a " sustainable legal basis , " they said in a statement .
important intelligence tool bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say spying is an important tool in fighting terrorism schäuble has called for a change in the law , saying the monitoring is an important intelligence tool and that the practice should continue .
a special law already exists in the german state of north rhine-westphalia which allows computers to be searched without their owners ' knowledge .
the chancellor 's office insists that terrorism makes examining pc hard drives necessary .
it also said computer monitoring played a role in deployment planning in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , according to parliament records .
germany 's interior intelligence agency , the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- has been accessing private data via the internet since june , 2005 .
the prior interior minister , otto schily , altered regulations to allow it .
according to the chancellor 's office , a decision by the german federal court in january , 2007 , which allowed for online data searches to be prosecuted , does not apply to the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
but politicians argue that schily 's regulations do not provide a sustainable legal foundation for internet spying .
skepticism remains politicians from other parties have maintained skepticism over the necessity of the program and have expressed concern that it violates privacy .
berlin 's state interior minister , ehrhart körting , said the practice was not very efficient , because it catches only the least sophisticated computer users who do n't know how to defend against so-called trojan programs . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german intelligence must stop computer spying , lawmakers say intelligence agencies said they have been monitoring suspects ' computers via the internet , but lawmakers called for an immediate stop to the controversial practice .

located in western germany near both the dutch and belgian borders , the city is considered a model for cross-border cooperation . the shops are closed , the red carpet rolled out , tv cameras and men donning radio earplugs can be seen everywhere : an important state visit is taking place .
crowds cheer , the politicians wave and former german chancellor gerhard schröder grins widely . every spring , on the day when the old imperial city awards the charlemagne prize , or so-called " karlspreis " to promoters of european unity , aachen goes haywire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana will receive the charlemagne prize in 2007 bill clinton was one of the recent winners .
the list of recipients is a who 's who of european policy , including winston churchill , jacques delors , vaclav havel , and former german chancellors helmut kohl and konrad adenauer . the prize is worth more than just a certificate , medal or the symbolic 5,000 euro award .
the charlemagne prize is to aachen what the oktoberfest is to munich or what the wagner festival is to bayreuth .
every year on this one day , aachen becomes the heart of europe , much like it was more than a millennium ago . cradle of europe some 1,200 years ago , charlemagne chose aachen as his main residence and center of power .
some even believed it to be " the cradle of europe . " though hardly comparable to today 's european unity , the idea is nevertheless enshrined in the walls of the aachen cathedral .
germany 's oldest cultural heritage site , the giant cathedral remains an obligatory sight to see for tourists from all around the world .
the area immediately surrounding the cathedral still boasts some of its former splendor , but that does n't mean time has stood still here . as proud as aachen is of its imperial past , the people of aachen are also quick to point out their futuristic high-tech sector .

politicians like to praise the place as germany 's most international city , labeling it a " european region , " or " euregio " for short . the people in this region often live in germany , work in the netherlands and shop and dine in belgium .
the colorful mix of languages is one of the attractions of living in this belgian , dutch , german triangle .
regular bus lines make it easy to go shopping in cologne , düsseldorf , brussels and amsterdam . fountain of youth situated in the far western reaches of germany , aachen 's location used to relegate it to a provincial status .
however , its international surroundings have breathed new life into the city of 250,000 citizens . within just a few years , long abandoned coal mines , factories and warehouses have become new homes for a multitude of high-tech start ups - all of them the products of an entrepreneurial boom in this so-called " euregio . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technology is booming in aachen but the strong engine driving this boom is not to be found at eu headquarters in brussels .
it is situated in aachen itself at the city 's university of technology , which is an architectural masterpiece of concrete and steel .
no other german technical university is so large , so old and has such an outstanding international reputation . in some ways , this renowned school is like a fountain of youth - it guarantees that not only cathedral pilgrims or european politicians are the sole visitors to this ancient city . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a place to rest for german kings when an engraved stone was dug up nearly a century ago on a building site , it did n't excite many .

cup holders sevilla fell in the night 's other semi-final 1-0 to osasuna . barcelona espanyol headed in two goals from corner kicks in front of a home crowd thursday night and gave thomas schaaf 's side a clear outline of what the team will have to improve before the semi-final 's second leg kicks off place in bremen . espanyol moved out in front of bremen midway through the first half when moises hurtado headed into goal on an ivan de la pena corner , then doubled their lead shortly after the halftime break when walter pandiani put in another de la pena corner kick .
espanyol 's third goal came in the game 's final minutes from substitute ferran corominas . german international torsten frings said bremen would have a difficult time preventing an all-spanish uefa cup final in glasgow on may 16 . bremen need a " miracle " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese will miss the second semi-final leg for a professional foul in barcelona " you ca n't make mistakes like that if you want to be the uefa cup winners , 3-0 is a big loss , " he said .
" we 'll need a pretty big miracle .
with a performance like this one , we do n't have a chance . " the german side , which has n't lost a bundesliga match since mid-february , appeared to have forgotten to unpack its offensive arsenal made up of playmaker diego and world cup golden boot winner miroslav klose , neither of whom were able to leave an impression on the match . both teams will be without key players for this thursday 's second leg .
goal scorers moises and pandiani both received yellow cards and will be will be suspended for the match in bremen . the bundesliga side finished the match with 10 men and will play with a back-up goalie between the posts after tim wiese received a red card for hauling down espanyol striker raul tamudo outside the area . " after the red card it was difficult for us to get back into it , " schaaf said .
" we are going to have to put in an exceptional performance -lrb- in the return leg -rrb- if we are to progress . " sevilla face manageable task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roberto soldado , in red , stayed out in front of sevilla spanish league strugglers osasuna turned on the style to claim a precious 1-0 home win over reigning uefa cup champions sevilla in the first leg of the competition 's other semi-final . osasuna came out fired up but appeared to be lacking the required focus in the early stages when veteran striker savo milosevic threw sevilla 's christian poulsen to the ground with a forceful - an unpunished - shove in the face . david lopez , arguably osasuna 's man-of-the-match , delivered a cross 10 minutes after the restart , that left sevilla 's keeper clutching at air when roberto soldado 's header drove its way in at the far post . soldado narrowly missed claiming his second goal on 63 minutes when he ran unchallenged down the left flank , cut inside his defender and sent his long curling effort just over the top left hand corner . shortly thereafter the referee walked off the pitch , followed by the players , when it appeared he had been hit with an object thrown from the crowd . six minutes of injury time were later allocated for the interruption , but despite close efforts on sevilla 's part to snatch an undeserved draw , osasuna held on for a well-deserved win that could prove decisive ahead of the second leg next week . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen out to gatecrash spanish fiesta in uefa cup semis werder bremen aim to crash the spanish uefa cup fiesta thursday when they play espanyol in the first leg of their semi-final tie .

the original constitution has been ratified by 18 of the 27 eu member states but was kicked into the political long grass in 2005 when french and dutch voters rejected it in national referendums .
the german eu presidency , which has arranged bilateral consultations with member states over an intensive two-week period from april 23 to may 4 , is making every effort " to restrict changes to what is absolutely necessary to reach an overall agreement and ensure ratification in all member states , " according to the questionnaire 's introduction .
among the most euroskeptic nations are the netherlands and britain .
british prime minister tony blair said last friday that his country no longer needs to hold a referendum on any new european union treaty , a move welcomed by eu leaders battling to replace the bloc 's near-dead constitution .
blair said the eu treaty he favors to replace the failed one would not require a british referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in brussels were relieved by blair 's comments " if it 's not a constitutional treaty , so that it alters the basic relationship between europe and the member states , then there is n't the same case for a referendum , " he told papers including britain 's financial times .
lowest common denominator in the introduction to its questionnaire , the german presidency says that a european summit on june 21-22 should decide to open " an intergovernmental conference with a very precise and limited mandate " on the constitution , with the aim of getting it ratified by all members before the next european parliamentary elections in 2009 .
the 12 questions are based on suggestions arising from previous bilateral negotiations , as the germans attempt to discover what the minimum changes each country would insist upon are for a new treaty to be acceptable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even metioning an eu anthem is touchy hence many of the questions have been in effect drawn up by the less enthusiastic member states .
thus , there is a question about avoiding explicitly mentioning the primacy of eu law and another on avoiding the use of certain terms , including " constitution " and european " minister for foreign affairs , " a post that was included in the original treaty and led to fears concerning national sovereignty over foreign policy .
these name changes would be made " without changing the legal substance " of the measures , the german paper assures .
likewise there is a question about dropping references to eu symbols such as its flag and anthem .
another question asks whether the member states believe that the original package of institutional provisions was " balanced " and " should not be reopened .

" the first step will still have to be to clarify exactly what president -lrb- vladimir -rrb- putin meant , " chief nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters , when asked how the alliance would respond to the apparent move .
" i have seen quotes from presidential advisors saying : ' well , we only mean in six months ' , i have heard some else tell me that he subsequently said they only mean in one year , " he said .
" there will clearly be a discussion within nato , there will clearly be a discussion between capitals and the russian federation on what they mean . "
making his last state of the nation speech in moscow , putin said thursday that russia could pull out of the 1990 conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty until all of nato 's current members ratified it .
" it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence ... until it has been ratified by all nato countries without exception , " he said .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said the 26 member countries had received the news with " concern , grave concern , disappointment and deep regret because the allies are of the opinion that the cfe treaty is one of the cornerstones of european security . "
but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for calm .
" the arithmetic of the cold war , with its numbers of armed vehicles , missiles and troops on each side , just does n't add up any more , " he said .
" we must avoid an escalation . "
europeans call for calm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's steinmeier calls for more dialogue " what we need is not less disarmament and fewer arms controls , we need more , " said steinmeier , whose once-divided country was the frontline for the cold war .
in berlin government spokesman thomas steg called for continued dialogue , while adding that " we are strongly convinced that threats do not help . "
in france foreign ministry spokesman jean-baptiste mattei called for russia to go back on its decision , calling the cfe treaty " a cornerstone of security in europe . "
he said that debate on the treaty and the us anti-missile plan that triggered putin 's move should continue in the nato-russia joint council to overcome moscow 's suspicions .
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 in paris by the countries of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- and the former warsaw pact to limit military hardware in the region .
it was adapted in istanbul in 1999 following the collapse of the warsaw pact , in order to limit deployments on a country-by-country basis .
nato states have refused to ratify the new pact on the grounds that moscow has failed to honour commitments made in istanbul to withdraw russian forces from the former soviet republics of georgia and moldova .
increased threat of mutually assured destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's tone has become more belligerent in recent days president putin reiterated his belliegernt stance when he warned of an increased threat of mutually assured destruction in a meeting about the planned us missile shield with czech president vaclav klaus .
" the increase of the threat of mutual harm to one another , and possibly of destruction , will grow many times over , " putin said , adding the system 's proposed bases in the czech republic and poland would violate europe 's security apparatus .
although the us plans have been known for years , russia has increased its rhetoric in recent months after the czech republic and poland , eastern european countries moscow considers its sphere of influence , entered talks to house elements on their territory .
us defence secretary robert gates visited putin and other officials in moscow earlier this week to invite russia to join the project , but apparently made little progress .
washington says the shield is designed to protect against threats from iran and north korea and that its 10 interceptor missiles could not defend against russia 's thousands of warheads .
russia claims to be real target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russians consider the missile system to be a threat russia has said it is the target of the shield , and putin told klaus he was ready to invite specialists from the czech republic and poland to show neither iran nor north korea had missile systems demanding the defence system .
washington , for its part , says both north korea and iran either have or are trying to acquire atomic bombs and could in 10 years ' time have missiles that threaten europe .
klaus told russian news agencies after his talks with putin that he had been unable to explain the czech arguments for the shield .
" i assured the president the czech side did n't have the slightest intention for the radar bases -lrb- proposed for czech territory -rrb- to become a threat to russia , " klaus said .
" that 's understandable - the czech republic wo n't control the stations , " putin was quoted as saying in response .
in a meeting where putin reminded klaus his country received 75 per cent of its natural gas from energy-rich moscow and had recently signed an agreement lasting till 2035 , putin told the czech leader the shield was similar to putting nuclear missiles on european territory .
putin said he hoped the czech republic would advance russian-eu relations as european union president in 2009 .
" i have a very wide circle of questions and problems and we are glad for the opportunity to exchange opinions , " he added .
but regarding the shield , he added that " as head of state i would have to say yes , relations will worsen . "
" we wo n't raise an hysteria over this , we 'll simply take the necessary measures , " the russian leader said . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia threatens pullout from landmark arms treaty president vladimir putin on thursday threatened russian withdrawal from a landmark cold war-era arms treaty limiting military forces in europe , raising the stakes in an already tense security dispute with the west .

" it would be appropriate to announce a moratorium on russian adherence ... until it has been ratified by all nato countries without exception , " he said .

cup holders sevilla fell in the night 's other semi-final 1-0 to osasuna . barcelona espanyol headed in two goals from corner kicks in front of a home crowd thursday night and gave thomas schaaf 's side a clear outline of what the team will have to improve before the semi-final 's second leg kicks off place in bremen . espanyol moved out in front of bremen midway through the first half when moises hurtado headed into goal on an ivan de la pena corner , then doubled their lead shortly after the halftime break when walter pandiani put in another de la pena corner kick .
espanyol 's third goal came in the game 's final minutes from substitute ferran corominas . german international torsten frings said bremen would have a difficult time preventing an all-spanish uefa cup final in glasgow on may 16 . bremen need a " miracle " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese will miss the second semi-final leg for a professional foul in barcelona " you ca n't make mistakes like that if you want to be the uefa cup winners , 3-0 is a big loss , " he said .
" we 'll need a pretty big miracle .
with a performance like this one , we do n't have a chance . " the german side , which has n't lost a bundesliga match since mid-february , appeared to have forgotten to unpack its offensive arsenal made up of playmaker diego and world cup golden boot winner miroslav klose , neither of whom were able to leave an impression on the match . both teams will be without key players for this thursday 's second leg .
goal scorers moises and pandiani both received yellow cards and will be will be suspended for the match in bremen . the bundesliga side finished the match with 10 men and will play with a back-up goalie between the posts after tim wiese received a red card for hauling down espanyol striker raul tamudo outside the area . " after the red card it was difficult for us to get back into it , " schaaf said .
" we are going to have to put in an exceptional performance -lrb- in the return leg -rrb- if we are to progress . " sevilla face manageable task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roberto soldado , in red , stayed out in front of sevilla spanish league strugglers osasuna turned on the style to claim a precious 1-0 home win over reigning uefa cup champions sevilla in the first leg of the competition 's other semi-final . osasuna came out fired up but appeared to be lacking the required focus in the early stages when veteran striker savo milosevic threw sevilla 's christian poulsen to the ground with a forceful - an unpunished - shove in the face . david lopez , arguably osasuna 's man-of-the-match , delivered a cross 10 minutes after the restart , that left sevilla 's keeper clutching at air when roberto soldado 's header drove its way in at the far post . soldado narrowly missed claiming his second goal on 63 minutes when he ran unchallenged down the left flank , cut inside his defender and sent his long curling effort just over the top left hand corner . shortly thereafter the referee walked off the pitch , followed by the players , when it appeared he had been hit with an object thrown from the crowd . six minutes of injury time were later allocated for the interruption , but despite close efforts on sevilla 's part to snatch an undeserved draw , osasuna held on for a well-deserved win that could prove decisive ahead of the second leg next week . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen out to gatecrash spanish fiesta in uefa cup semis werder bremen aim to crash the spanish uefa cup fiesta thursday when they play espanyol in the first leg of their semi-final tie .

the original constitution has been ratified by 18 of the 27 eu member states but was kicked into the political long grass in 2005 when french and dutch voters rejected it in national referendums .
the german eu presidency , which has arranged bilateral consultations with member states over an intensive two-week period from april 23 to may 4 , is making every effort " to restrict changes to what is absolutely necessary to reach an overall agreement and ensure ratification in all member states , " according to the questionnaire 's introduction .
among the most euroskeptic nations are the netherlands and britain .
british prime minister tony blair said last friday that his country no longer needs to hold a referendum on any new european union treaty , a move welcomed by eu leaders battling to replace the bloc 's near-dead constitution .
blair said the eu treaty he favors to replace the failed one would not require a british referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in brussels were relieved by blair 's comments " if it 's not a constitutional treaty , so that it alters the basic relationship between europe and the member states , then there is n't the same case for a referendum , " he told papers including britain 's financial times .
lowest common denominator in the introduction to its questionnaire , the german presidency says that a european summit on june 21-22 should decide to open " an intergovernmental conference with a very precise and limited mandate " on the constitution , with the aim of getting it ratified by all members before the next european parliamentary elections in 2009 .
the 12 questions are based on suggestions arising from previous bilateral negotiations , as the germans attempt to discover what the minimum changes each country would insist upon are for a new treaty to be acceptable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even metioning an eu anthem is touchy hence many of the questions have been in effect drawn up by the less enthusiastic member states .
thus , there is a question about avoiding explicitly mentioning the primacy of eu law and another on avoiding the use of certain terms , including " constitution " and european " minister for foreign affairs , " a post that was included in the original treaty and led to fears concerning national sovereignty over foreign policy .
these name changes would be made " without changing the legal substance " of the measures , the german paper assures .
likewise there is a question about dropping references to eu symbols such as its flag and anthem .
another question asks whether the member states believe that the original package of institutional provisions was " balanced " and " should not be reopened .

although he is widely seen as the architect of turkey 's eu bid , they object to his islamist past and the fact that his wife wears the muslim headscarf . to them , the prospect of a president with an islamist background is proof of religion steadily creeping into politics and public life .
the government 's supporters , meanwhile , respond with charges of crisis-mongering and flouting democracy in a country where surveys show people increasingly identify with islam . amid these growing concerns , thousands of people rallied in ankara in recent weeks against erdogan and his party . boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations in ankara meanwhile , opposition parties boycotted the poll friday and declared the vote invalid . the main opposition party republican people 's party -lrb- chp -rrb- had threatened a boycott and said it would challenge the result in the constitutional court if the session convened with less than two-thirds of the legislators taking part - hoping thereby to isolate the akp by convincing other opposition mps to boycott the session .
the plan was then to petition the constitutional court to scrap the first-round vote , thus blocking the election process and forcing early elections . " i urge all elected deputies to come and do their democratic political duty .
we are facing one of the most important days of our democratic life , " erdogan had said in a last-minute appeal to deputies to attend the parliament vote friday . " let us not fall into the trap of those who are trying to drag turkey back to the customs of the past , to those periods of political paralysis , " he added .
" despite our differences , the result of our democratic rivalry , we are ... the representatives of the same nation , " he said .
" attending the general assembly and voting - be it for or against - is a duty given to us by the people . " but as the vote began , the number fell short of a 367-member threshold and the chp confirmed it would challenge the vote in court .

" i would like to see bochum win the match and schalke lift the trophy , " said peter neururer , who has coached both teams in the past .
schalke have not lost in five trips to bochum , winning four and drawing once .
but bochum boast the bundesliga top scorer in theofanis gekas , who is ready to add to his 18 goals before a summer move to bayer leverkusen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cutouts will be replaced with the real thing if schalke win the next four matches schalke are aware of the danger , with sports director andreas müller expecting the match to be trickier than the game in a fortnight at their biggest regional rival borussia dortmund .
" a lot of people are talking about the dortmund match , but bochum could be much tougher for us , " müller said .
" we have to win the last four games . "
schalke lead the way with 62 points from werder bremen -lrb- 60 -rrb- and vfb stuttgart -lrb- 58 -rrb- , and ca n't afford to drop points if they really want to lift the trophy for the first time since 1958 .

germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble remains in favor of the controversial practice , but will wait for a legal ruling . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble faced massive criticism this week after it was revealed that german intelligence agencies were secretly snooping on terrorism suspects via the internet . schäuble has ordered a temporary halt to the practice .
" there is a moratorium , " a spokeswoman for the interior ministry confirmed in the financial times deutschland newspaper on friday .
intelligence agencies have monitored suspects ' computers via the internet for two years , according to members of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee .
privacy concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics question the legality of internet snooping representatives from all political parties questioned the legality of the practice .
critics say the secret searches violate article 13 of the german basic law , which governs privacy .
schäuble , of the christian democratic union , has suggested the government consider expanding article 13 to allow it .
but the government does n't want to go ahead with the monitoring until a clear legal foundation is provided , schäuble told parliament .
until then , the monitoring will stop , he said .
schäuble faced criticism from within his party and from coalition partners in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the interior experts for the cdu / csu , hans-peter uhl and ralf göbel , called the intelligence agency searches were " legally questionable . "
the measures are necessary , but require a " sustainable legal basis , " they said in a statement .

according to the chancellor 's office , a decision by the german federal court in january , 2007 , which allowed for online data searches to be prosecuted , does not apply to the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
but politicians argue that schily 's regulations do not provide a sustainable legal foundation for internet spying .
skepticism remains politicians from other parties have maintained skepticism over the necessity of the program and have expressed concern that it violates privacy .

germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble remains in favor of the controversial practice , but will wait for a legal ruling . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble faced massive criticism this week after it was revealed that german intelligence agencies were secretly snooping on terrorism suspects via the internet . schäuble has ordered a temporary halt to the practice .
" there is a moratorium , " a spokeswoman for the interior ministry confirmed in the financial times deutschland newspaper on friday .
intelligence agencies have monitored suspects ' computers via the internet for two years , according to members of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee .
privacy concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics question the legality of internet snooping representatives from all political parties questioned the legality of the practice .
critics say the secret searches violate article 13 of the german basic law , which governs privacy .
schäuble , of the christian democratic union , has suggested the government consider expanding article 13 to allow it .
but the government does n't want to go ahead with the monitoring until a clear legal foundation is provided , schäuble told parliament .
until then , the monitoring will stop , he said .
schäuble faced criticism from within his party and from coalition partners in the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the interior experts for the cdu / csu , hans-peter uhl and ralf göbel , called the intelligence agency searches were " legally questionable . "
the measures are necessary , but require a " sustainable legal basis , " they said in a statement .
important intelligence tool bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say spying is an important tool in fighting terrorism schäuble has called for a change in the law , saying the monitoring is an important intelligence tool and that the practice should continue .
a special law already exists in the german state of north rhine-westphalia which allows computers to be searched without their owners ' knowledge .
the chancellor 's office insists that terrorism makes examining pc hard drives necessary .
it also said computer monitoring played a role in deployment planning in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , according to parliament records .
germany 's interior intelligence agency , the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- has been accessing private data via the internet since june , 2005 .
the prior interior minister , otto schily , altered regulations to allow it .
according to the chancellor 's office , a decision by the german federal court in january , 2007 , which allowed for online data searches to be prosecuted , does not apply to the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- .
but politicians argue that schily 's regulations do not provide a sustainable legal foundation for internet spying .
skepticism remains politicians from other parties have maintained skepticism over the necessity of the program and have expressed concern that it violates privacy .
berlin 's state interior minister , ehrhart körting , said the practice was not very efficient , because it catches only the least sophisticated computer users who do n't know how to defend against so-called trojan programs . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german intelligence must stop computer spying , lawmakers say intelligence agencies said they have been monitoring suspects ' computers via the internet , but lawmakers called for an immediate stop to the controversial practice .

cup holders sevilla fell in the night 's other semi-final 1-0 to osasuna . barcelona espanyol headed in two goals from corner kicks in front of a home crowd thursday night and gave thomas schaaf 's side a clear outline of what the team will have to improve before the semi-final 's second leg kicks off place in bremen . espanyol moved out in front of bremen midway through the first half when moises hurtado headed into goal on an ivan de la pena corner , then doubled their lead shortly after the halftime break when walter pandiani put in another de la pena corner kick .
espanyol 's third goal came in the game 's final minutes from substitute ferran corominas . german international torsten frings said bremen would have a difficult time preventing an all-spanish uefa cup final in glasgow on may 16 . bremen need a " miracle " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese will miss the second semi-final leg for a professional foul in barcelona " you ca n't make mistakes like that if you want to be the uefa cup winners , 3-0 is a big loss , " he said .
" we 'll need a pretty big miracle .
with a performance like this one , we do n't have a chance . " the german side , which has n't lost a bundesliga match since mid-february , appeared to have forgotten to unpack its offensive arsenal made up of playmaker diego and world cup golden boot winner miroslav klose , neither of whom were able to leave an impression on the match . both teams will be without key players for this thursday 's second leg .
goal scorers moises and pandiani both received yellow cards and will be will be suspended for the match in bremen . the bundesliga side finished the match with 10 men and will play with a back-up goalie between the posts after tim wiese received a red card for hauling down espanyol striker raul tamudo outside the area . " after the red card it was difficult for us to get back into it , " schaaf said .
" we are going to have to put in an exceptional performance -lrb- in the return leg -rrb- if we are to progress . " sevilla face manageable task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roberto soldado , in red , stayed out in front of sevilla spanish league strugglers osasuna turned on the style to claim a precious 1-0 home win over reigning uefa cup champions sevilla in the first leg of the competition 's other semi-final . osasuna came out fired up but appeared to be lacking the required focus in the early stages when veteran striker savo milosevic threw sevilla 's christian poulsen to the ground with a forceful - an unpunished - shove in the face . david lopez , arguably osasuna 's man-of-the-match , delivered a cross 10 minutes after the restart , that left sevilla 's keeper clutching at air when roberto soldado 's header drove its way in at the far post . soldado narrowly missed claiming his second goal on 63 minutes when he ran unchallenged down the left flank , cut inside his defender and sent his long curling effort just over the top left hand corner . shortly thereafter the referee walked off the pitch , followed by the players , when it appeared he had been hit with an object thrown from the crowd . six minutes of injury time were later allocated for the interruption , but despite close efforts on sevilla 's part to snatch an undeserved draw , osasuna held on for a well-deserved win that could prove decisive ahead of the second leg next week . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen out to gatecrash spanish fiesta in uefa cup semis werder bremen aim to crash the spanish uefa cup fiesta thursday when they play espanyol in the first leg of their semi-final tie .

" we believe that germany is under performing in its role of leader in europe in working with russia , " dzhibladze told reporters , ahead of eu-russia human rights consultations on may 3 in berlin , before the may 18 eu-russia summit .
germany needs to " speak up " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should put political pressure on putin , activists say the chairwoman of demos centre for information and research , tanya lokshina , cited a bloody police crackdown against opposition activists and a sharp rise in racist attacks as symptomatic of a harsher climate for dissent .
" all the european countries ought to stand up for russian civil society , but germany should be leading the way , " lokshina said .
" with the putin government trying to suppress all dissent , we need you now more than ever . "
oleg orlov , the head of memorial , one of russia 's oldest human rights groups , said europe had the power to help turn the tide in russia .
" speaking out on human rights in russia wo n't threaten europe 's energy supply but it would really help to curb the government 's crackdown , " orlov said .
" russian civil society is under attack and we need germany to speak up . "
the activists also criticised the planning of next week 's meeting in berlin , saying that no russian human rights groups had been invited .
eu criticizes putin 's government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian reporter anna politkovskaya 's murder points to human rights problems under putin the meeting in berlin coincided with the release of the eu parliament 's annual human rights report .
the parliament in strasbourg strongly criticised the russian government over human rights , regretting that the eu has had " only limited success in bringing about policy change as a result of raising difficult issues . "
the report attacked russian legislation limiting the activities of ngos and that journalists and human rights defenders have been threatened .
it also highlighted the murder of russian journalist anna politkovskaya and allegations of russian involvement in the poisoning of former russian agent alexander litvinenko in london .
serious concerns about china in addition to russia , the eu raised concern about turkey , iran and china .
china 's human rights record is a matter of " serious concern " and should thus " receive more focus in the build-up to the beijing olympic games , " parliament members said , emphasising the need to strengthen and improve dialogue on the issue between the eu and china .
members urged the european commission and member states " to raise the question of tibet " in talks with the beijing government , adding that trade relations with china should be contingent upon human rights reform .
china has ruled tibet since 1951 , since troops were sent to " liberate " the region .
subsequent uprisings have been violently supressed .
china on thursday warned visiting foreigners against engaging in activities that threaten the nation 's unity , as a rights group demanded the release of four americans detained for a pro-tibet protest .
" limited progress " in other countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's record was criticized by the eu the report also noted a deterioration of the human rights situation in iran , including " the intensification of the repression against human rights defenders . "
the report also voiced concern over the " limited progress " on human rights issues in turkey and encouraged the ankara government to change article 301 of its penal code , which outlaws the denigration of " turkishness . "
it raises concerns over religious freedoms and minority rights , including for the kurds in the southeast of the country .
the eu itself does not escape censure in the parliamentary report which says the union should have taken " more unilateral action " to persuade the sudanese government to accept an international peacekeeping force in darfur .
parliament members want " a plan of specific , targeted sanctions to be imposed on the khartoum regime ... in the event of non-compliance with the demands of the international community . "

at the beginning of the year , economists were pessimistic .
a new sales tax increase that went into effect in january would kill consumer spending , they predicted .
that has n't happened .
instead , gfk , germany ’ s largest market research institute , announced this week consumer confidence in the economy is at an all time high .
at the same time , earnings forcasts escalated to a six year high .
" consumption has the green light , ” said gfk spokesperson klaus wübbenhorst .
experts said they were surprised how quickly confidence came back after an initially weak start to the year .
the economic forecast increased almost eight points to 61 points , a record since the monthly consumer climate study began in 1980 .
one of the important reasons for this optimism is caused by positive developments in the employment market , gfk said .
sunny outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence has boosted business and predictions are that consumer confidence will remain strong , with the typical german scepticism nowhere to be found .
earnings forecasts were better in april than expected , due to a strong job market .
signs that the slump in consumer spending had ended could be seen in the retail industry .
“ we see signs that the retail industry on a growth path , but not at the level of the national economy , ” said hubertus pellengahr of the german retail association .
a run of warm spring weather has led to strong showings for home improvement stores and garden centers , he said .
unemployment down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's nowhere but up for the german economy the upswing in consumer confidence helps the job market , said federal finance minister peer steinbrück “ the clear expansion of employment with its positive consequences for private income and consumption makes it likely that the domestic demand will increase in the upcoming months , ” steinbrück said .
the government is counting on a decrease in unemployment of more than a million people by 2008 .
in the upcoming year the number of unemployed should be less than 3.5 million .
that would be the lowest rate in more than a decade .
the government also increased its growth estimate to 2.3 percent .
until now , the government had predicted a 1.7 percent growth rate .
the monthly gfk consumer indicator is based on a survey of approximately 2,000 consumers .
substantial factors in determining the consumer climate are income expectations , earnings forecasts and purchases .
strong euro wo n't stop boom the euro is hovering at $ 1.36 a near-record high .
the situation seems likely to continue without having a negative effect on the economy , as long as foreign demand remains strong .
the euro could go as high as $ 1.40 without causing major economic problems , economists said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : business confidence surges as germany boosts growth outlook business confidence in germany continued to climb in april as the booming german economy , the biggest in the 13-country eurozone , was bolstered by international investment , a survey showed .

the call came as an eu report highlighted ongoing human rights failings in various countries . germany needs to use its presidency of the eu to take a strong stance against the failings of russia and china in regards to human rights , activists said at a meeting in berlin .
the leaders of three russian non-governmental organizations pressed the eu to address what they said was a deteriorating rights situation in russia under president vladimir putin .
the activists gathered in berlin at the invitation of new york-based human rights watch and amnesty international on thursday .
the head of the centre for the development of democracy and human rights , yuri dzhibladze , accused germany of turning a blind eye to rights violations in russia so as not to jeopardize its economic ties , in particular in the energy sector .
" we believe that germany is under performing in its role of leader in europe in working with russia , " dzhibladze told reporters , ahead of eu-russia human rights consultations on may 3 in berlin , before the may 18 eu-russia summit .
germany needs to " speak up " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should put political pressure on putin , activists say the chairwoman of demos centre for information and research , tanya lokshina , cited a bloody police crackdown against opposition activists and a sharp rise in racist attacks as symptomatic of a harsher climate for dissent .
" all the european countries ought to stand up for russian civil society , but germany should be leading the way , " lokshina said .
" with the putin government trying to suppress all dissent , we need you now more than ever . "
oleg orlov , the head of memorial , one of russia 's oldest human rights groups , said europe had the power to help turn the tide in russia .
" speaking out on human rights in russia wo n't threaten europe 's energy supply but it would really help to curb the government 's crackdown , " orlov said .
" russian civil society is under attack and we need germany to speak up . "
the activists also criticised the planning of next week 's meeting in berlin , saying that no russian human rights groups had been invited .
eu criticizes putin 's government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian reporter anna politkovskaya 's murder points to human rights problems under putin the meeting in berlin coincided with the release of the eu parliament 's annual human rights report .
the parliament in strasbourg strongly criticised the russian government over human rights , regretting that the eu has had " only limited success in bringing about policy change as a result of raising difficult issues . "
the report attacked russian legislation limiting the activities of ngos and that journalists and human rights defenders have been threatened .
it also highlighted the murder of russian journalist anna politkovskaya and allegations of russian involvement in the poisoning of former russian agent alexander litvinenko in london .
serious concerns about china in addition to russia , the eu raised concern about turkey , iran and china .
china 's human rights record is a matter of " serious concern " and should thus " receive more focus in the build-up to the beijing olympic games , " parliament members said , emphasising the need to strengthen and improve dialogue on the issue between the eu and china .
members urged the european commission and member states " to raise the question of tibet " in talks with the beijing government , adding that trade relations with china should be contingent upon human rights reform .
china has ruled tibet since 1951 , since troops were sent to " liberate " the region .
subsequent uprisings have been violently supressed .
china on thursday warned visiting foreigners against engaging in activities that threaten the nation 's unity , as a rights group demanded the release of four americans detained for a pro-tibet protest .
" limited progress " in other countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's record was criticized by the eu the report also noted a deterioration of the human rights situation in iran , including " the intensification of the repression against human rights defenders . "
the report also voiced concern over the " limited progress " on human rights issues in turkey and encouraged the ankara government to change article 301 of its penal code , which outlaws the denigration of " turkishness . "
it raises concerns over religious freedoms and minority rights , including for the kurds in the southeast of the country .
the eu itself does not escape censure in the parliamentary report which says the union should have taken " more unilateral action " to persuade the sudanese government to accept an international peacekeeping force in darfur .
parliament members want " a plan of specific , targeted sanctions to be imposed on the khartoum regime ... in the event of non-compliance with the demands of the international community . "

granted the composer 's name does have selling power , but is there room in the region for another classical venue ? " it will be a one-of-a-kind concert hall , " said karin hempel-soos , spokesperson for bonn ’ s culture council and driving force behind the plans for a new festival concert hall in germany ’ s former capital .
the estimated 60 to 80 million euro -lrb- $ 81-108 million -rrb- hall is meant to draw top-notch performers and put bonn - and beethoven - in the big leagues , along with salzburg and mozart , and bayreuth and wagner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house in bonn is now a museum it may be completed as early as 2011 , well in time for the composer ’ s 250th birthday in 2020 .
a design contest for the building is said to be in the works , and according to bonn ’ s daily general-anzeiger , the who ’ s-who of architecture are being taken into consideration : tadao ando , frank gehry , jacques herzog , pierre de meuron and thomas van den valentyn , for example . critics , however , are wondering whether the glamorous hall , top artists and a big-name mascot will be enough to attract the most important ingredient - enough music lovers to fill the planned 1,400 seats .
“ there ’ s a lot of competition for the concert hall in bonn , ” wrote the city ’ s daily paper . an oversaturated music market ? within the past few years , western germany ’ s rhine and ruhr valley regions have invested millions of both public and private funds in constructing new classical music venues and renovating older ones .
all of them are within an hour ’ s drive from bonn .
in duisburg the mercatorhalle has been transformed into a massive 150 million-euro -lrb- $ 204 million -rrb- complex that includes a 1,750-seat concert hall as well as a shopping mall , casino and conference center .
it opened on april 21 .
dortmund , minutes away from duisburg , opened a new 50 million euro , 1,550-seat concert hall in 2002 .
essen renovated its philharmonic in 2004 and düsseldorf modernized its world-renowned tonhalle in 2005 .
bochum , also in the ruhr valley , is planning to complete a 29.3 million euro concert hall in 2010 in honor of the region ’ s distinction that year as europe ’ s culture capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this statue on bonn 's central square reminds passersby of the city 's connection to beethoven the cologne philharmonic , considered to be one of the most beautiful concert halls in the world , is barely a half-hour drive from bonn .
" per year , 90,000 tickets to the cologne philharmonic are sold to bonn residents because they don ’ t have anything like that in bonn , " said hempel-soos .
she also estimated that there were around a million potential concert-goers in the area directly surrounding bonn . they won ’ t go to dortmund or duisburg , she said , because bonn will offer something completely different - world-class in everything from the building to the performers . questioning priorities for her , it ’ s matter-of-fact that the composer should be honored in his birthplace - and with much more than the less-than-modern beethoven hall , built in 1959 , the smaller chamber music house , museum and numerous monuments that already adorn the city . still , some are asking whether it ’ s wise to build an additional venue instead of using a fraction of the money to pay for renovations to other cultural institutions .
bonn ’ s theater , for example , where operas , ballets and some plays are performed , could use a 20 million euro overhaul , according to the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger . it ’ s not the city of bonn that will be cutting a check for the new venue , however .
though nothing has been put in ink quite yet , three major german companies headquartered in bonn - deutsche telekom , deutsche post and postbank - are on deck to finance 100 percent of the construction costs . after the project is completed , a partially public foundation will be set up to ensure that the level of artistic quality remains high .
after all , big-name musicians aren ’ t cheaper by the dozen .
employee benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's existing beethoven hall , built in 1959 , is wanting in acoustics and aesthetics as a sponsor , the postbank is counting on the magnetic power of the legendary hall to-be .
" it is important to the company that bonn is an attractive city for its employees , " said postbank spokesperson joachim strunk , who added that it ’ s a way to encourage employee retention .

as part of his washington visit , mr abe also met us president george bush for an informal dinner at the white house .
the two men talked about baseball and golf , but the discussions will turn to more serious matters on friday .
the leaders are expected to meet at camp david to discuss bilateral ties and co-operation over north korea .
' deeply sorry ' mr abe provoked an angry reaction in march , when he questioned whether there was any proof that the japanese military coerced women to work as sex slaves during world war ii .
but he has since stated several times that he stands by an official 1993 statement in which japan acknowledged the imperial army set up and ran brothels for its wartime troops .
the japan-us alliance is the cornerstone of japan 's diplomacy shinzo abe mr abe tried to minimise the damage further on thursday , when he told us lawmakers : " i feel sympathy from the bottom of my heart to former comfort women . "
" i feel deeply sorry that they were forced to be placed in such extremely painful situations , " he was quoted as saying by japanese government officials .

" i will express my stance with an iron will of seeking a solution to the abduction issue , " he went on .
high on the agenda will also be the two countries ' military relationship , as well as climate change , iraq and japan 's decision to ease restrictions on us beef imports .

on mr koizumi 's last visit before leaving office , he wowed americans with an elvis presley impersonation on a sideline visit to graceland .
mr abe chose to broaden japanese diplomacy when he took office , by breaking with a tradition that the new japanese prime minister 's first overseas visit be to washington .

recorded in los angeles , the album features eminem producer mike elizondo , maroon 5 singer adam levine and former madonna songwriter patrick leonard .
with her latest single , i want to have your babies , in the top 10 , bedingfield talks about success , being an introvert and the rules of dating .
on your last album you were singing about being a single , independent woman .
this time you have songs called i want to have your babies and soulmate .
what 's happened ?
i was in america for about a year-and-a-half touring .
it was like a gap year , but i 'd never been away from friends and family before .
i realised how important relationships are .
so the album 's about relationships .
you can be independent , but you need people around you who really understand you .
and have you found a soulmate ?
i 've got a lovely man that i 'm dating at the moment , so we 'll see .
natasha left a psychology degree to concentrate on singing do you find it hard to date people now you 're in the public eye ?
i think dating is a very awkward thing anyway .
what are the rules ?
can a woman ask a guy out ?
can a girl give a guy flowers ?
is that weird ?
and what if you 're saying too much ?
that 's what i want to have your babies is about .
what if he actually knew what you were saying in your head - would he freak out ?
and there 's always that hurdle of the first time you tell someone that you love them .
i know !
and if they do n't say it back it 's awful .
or if someone says it to you and you do n't want to say it back .
what would you say in that situation ?
erm ... " you 're a very nice person ? ! "
you were talking about i want to have your babies .
if you do have children , is there a character trait you would n't want them to inherit ?
when i was younger i did n't feel very free to express my opinion to other people .
i wanted to keep everyone happy , and that can be quite damaging as you get older and get into a job .
is that something you 've experienced in the music industry ?
it 's definitely something the industry has taught me .
i 've had to be clear on what i think is right , even if it is just a gut feeling .
if i do n't want a subject or a song on my album , that 's perfectly acceptable .
your album is called nb - is that just your initials , or is there a double meaning ?
yes , it 's latin for nota bene - which means note well .
it 's not like i 'm saying the album is really important , it 's just a pun .
did i study latin at school ?
no .
natasha is the sister of gotta get thru this singer daniel bedingfield are you as self-analytical as your lyrics suggest ?

its report says this would reduce the number of mistakes made by the public , and make tax assessments more accurate .
the nao report on the way hm revenue & customs -lrb- hmrc -rrb- communicates with the public points out that improvements have already been made .
but it says some forms are still too hard to read for the average person .
" tax can be a complicated matter , so it is important to make it as easy as possible for taxpayers to understand and comply with their tax obligations , " said sir john bourn , head of the nao .
high reading age some of the hmrc advice published in its guidance forms requires a reading age of 16 to 17-years-old , which , the nao points out , is a level of literacy achieved by less than half the population .
if hmrc ca n't get its advice right in all cases , how are taxpayers expected to fill in their forms correctly ?
tory mp edward leigh and a small proportion of callers to the hmrc telephone advice service - 6 % - are still not provided with complete and correct advice , said the nao .
the report adds that the hmrc website should be improved to make it easier for people to find the right forms with the right guidance .
this , it suggests , would help tax payers claim another £ 300 a year , which they are forgoing as a result of making mistakes on their tax forms .
" in order to understand some of the tax guidance , people need an a-level standard reading age .
that 's simply too hard for many , " said edward leigh mp , chairman of the parliamentary public accounts committee .
" and if hmrc ca n't get its advice right in all cases , how are taxpayers expected to fill in their forms correctly ?
" guidance can also be hard to find , but i note that the department is making efforts to improve its website and call handling , " he added .

gere , 57 , kissed shetty , 31 , several times on the cheek at an aids awareness event in delhi earlier this month .
the court in jaipur in rajasthan state called it " an obscene act " , after a local lawyer filed a complaint .
gere , who is a frequent visitor to india , told a us tv show that he expected the case to be thrown out .
speaking on the daily show with jon stewart , the actor dismissed the situation as " nothing " .
" there is a very small right-wing , very conservative political party in india and they are the moral police in india ... they do this kind of thing quite often , " he said .
shetty , who found fame outside india as the winner of celebrity big brother in the uk , has also been asked to appear before the court .
bigger issue but her spokesman , dale bhagwager , said the actress had not received any court order or summons and was currently away visiting temples .
he said shetty had not done anything wrong .
" what is there to comment ?
they were three innocent , natural cute pecks on the cheek , " said mr bhagwager .
" what can one say , when three pecks can be made into an issue in the land of the kama sutra ?
people should concentrate on the bigger issue of aids , rather than this . "
dance scene photographs of the clinch were splashed across front pages of newspapers in india .
public displays of affection are still largely taboo in india , and protestors in mumbai -lrb- bombay -rrb- set fire to effigies of gere following the incident .
shetty has defended gere saying that it was all done " in good humour " .
" he especially told me to tell the media that he did n't want to hurt any indian sensibilities , " she said .
she said gere had only been re-enacting a scene from his film shall we dance .
under indian law , a person convicted of public obscenity faces up to three months in prison , a fine or both .
gere , star of films such as chicago and pretty woman , is a buddhist and travels to india frequently to visit the dalai lama , who lives in exile in the north of the country .

it is the talk of the town .
the latest police crackdown on islamic dress has angered many iranians - male , female , young and old .
but iranian tv has reported that an opinion poll conducted in tehran found 86 % of people were in favour of the crackdown - a statistic that is surprising given the strength of feeling against this move .
police cars are stationed outside major shopping centres in tehran .
they are stopping pedestrians and even cars - warning female drivers not to show any hair - and impounding the vehicles and arresting the women if they argue back .
middle-aged women , foreign tourists and journalists have all been harassed , not just the young and fashionably dressed .
individual choice overnight the standard of what is acceptable dress has slipped back . "
i want the whole world to know that they oppress us and all we can do is put up with it " tofiq , 15 hard-won freedoms - like the right to wear a colourful headscarf - have been snatched away .
it may sound trivial but iranian women have found ways of expressing their individuality and returning to drab colours like black , grey and dark blue is not something they will accept easily .
" if we want to do something we will do it anyway , all this is total nonsense , " says a young girl , heavily made up and dressed up .
she believes islamic dress should be something personal - whether you 're swathed in a black chador or dressed in what she calls " more normal clothes " .
interestingly many women who choose to wear the all enveloping chador agree - saying it 's a personal choice and should n't be forced on people .
" this year is much worse than before because the newspapers and the tv have given the issue a lot of coverage compared to last year ; it was n't this bad before , " says shabnam who 's out shopping with her friend .
permission denied at the start of every summer the police say they will enforce the islamic dress code , but this year has been unusually harsh .
thousands of women have been cautioned by police over their dress , some have been obliged to sign statements that they will do better in the future , and some face court cases against them .
though the authorities want coverage internally to scare women - they do n't want the story broadcast abroad .
the bbc 's cameraman was detained when he tried to film the police at work and the government denied us permission to go on patrol with the police .
" really we do n't have any security , " complains shabam 's friend leyla .
" since we came out this morning many people we met have continuously warned us to be careful about our headscarves and to wear them further forward because they are arresting women who are dressed like this , " she says .
boutique owners are furious .
some shops have been sealed - others warned not to sell tight revealing clothing .
one shopkeeper selling evening dresses told us the moral police had ordered him to saw off the breasts of his mannequins because they were too revealing .
he said he was n't the only shop to receive this strange instruction .
respect there 's even been less traffic on the streets because some women are not venturing out - fearful they will be harassed .
and it 's not even safe in a car .
taxi agencies have received a circular warning them not to carry a " bad hijabi " .
" they have said we should n't carry passengers who wear bad islamic dress and if we do we have to warn them to respect the islamic dress code even inside the car , " said one taxi driver .
and it 's not just women who are being targeted this year .
young men are being cautioned for wearing short sleeved shirts or for their hairstyles .
morad - a hairdresser whose gelled hair is made to stand straight up - says it 's necessary for him to look like this to attract customers .
" these last few days i do n't dare walk down the main roads looking like this case i get arrested , " he says .
" i use the side streets and alleys . "
morad is scared because his friends have told him they 've seen the police seize young men and forcibly cut their hair if it 's too long .
fifteen-year-old tofiq who 'd also gelled his hair to stand on end said he too was afraid but he was n't going to change .
" i want the whole world to know that they oppress us and all we can do is put up with it , " he said .
some parents have complained that harassing the young over their clothing will only push them to leave the country .
but one mp has said those iranians who can not cope with islamic laws should leave .
some commentators have suggested that the government is conducting this crackdown to distract attention from the rising cost of living in iran and increasing tension with the international community over the nuclear issue .
if so , it 's a strategy that risks alienating people who 've got used to years of relative social freedom and do not want to return to the early days of the revolution when dress rules were much more tightly enforced .

it is the talk of the town .
the latest police crackdown on islamic dress has angered many iranians - male , female , young and old .
but iranian tv has reported that an opinion poll conducted in tehran found 86 % of people were in favour of the crackdown - a statistic that is surprising given the strength of feeling against this move .
police cars are stationed outside major shopping centres in tehran .
they are stopping pedestrians and even cars - warning female drivers not to show any hair - and impounding the vehicles and arresting the women if they argue back .
middle-aged women , foreign tourists and journalists have all been harassed , not just the young and fashionably dressed .
individual choice overnight the standard of what is acceptable dress has slipped back .
i want the whole world to know that they oppress us and all we can do is put up with it tofiq , 15 hard-won freedoms - like the right to wear a colourful headscarf - have been snatched away .
it may sound trivial but iranian women have found ways of expressing their individuality and returning to drab colours like black , grey and dark blue is not something they will accept easily .
" if we want to do something we will do it anyway , all this is total nonsense , " says a young girl , heavily made up and dressed up .
she believes islamic dress should be something personal - whether you 're swathed in a black chador or dressed in what she calls " more normal clothes " .
interestingly many women who choose to wear the all enveloping chador agree - saying it 's a personal choice and should n't be forced on people .
" this year is much worse than before because the newspapers and the tv have given the issue a lot of coverage compared to last year ; it was n't this bad before , " says shabnam who 's out shopping with her friend .
permission denied at the start of every summer the police say they will enforce the islamic dress code , but this year has been unusually harsh .
thousands of women have been cautioned by police over their dress , some have been obliged to sign statements that they will do better in the future , and some face court cases against them .
even shop mannequins considered " too revealing " are dealt with though the authorities want coverage internally to scare women - they do n't want the story broadcast abroad .

it is the talk of the town .
the latest police crackdown on islamic dress has angered many iranians - male , female , young and old .
but iranian tv has reported that an opinion poll conducted in tehran found 86 % of people were in favour of the crackdown - a statistic that is surprising given the strength of feeling against this move .
police cars are stationed outside major shopping centres in tehran .
they are stopping pedestrians and even cars - warning female drivers not to show any hair - and impounding the vehicles and arresting the women if they argue back .
middle-aged women , foreign tourists and journalists have all been harassed , not just the young and fashionably dressed .
individual choice overnight the standard of what is acceptable dress has slipped back .
i want the whole world to know that they oppress us and all we can do is put up with it tofiq , 15 hard-won freedoms - like the right to wear a colourful headscarf - have been snatched away .
it may sound trivial but iranian women have found ways of expressing their individuality and returning to drab colours like black , grey and dark blue is not something they will accept easily .
" if we want to do something we will do it anyway , all this is total nonsense , " says a young girl , heavily made up and dressed up .
she believes islamic dress should be something personal - whether you 're swathed in a black chador or dressed in what she calls " more normal clothes " .
interestingly many women who choose to wear the all enveloping chador agree - saying it 's a personal choice and should n't be forced on people .
" this year is much worse than before because the newspapers and the tv have given the issue a lot of coverage compared to last year ; it was n't this bad before , " says shabnam who 's out shopping with her friend .
permission denied at the start of every summer the police say they will enforce the islamic dress code , but this year has been unusually harsh .
thousands of women have been cautioned by police over their dress , some have been obliged to sign statements that they will do better in the future , and some face court cases against them .
even shop mannequins considered " too revealing " are dealt with though the authorities want coverage internally to scare women - they do n't want the story broadcast abroad .
the bbc 's cameraman was detained when he tried to film the police at work and the government denied us permission to go on patrol with the police .
" really we do n't have any security , " complains shabam 's friend leyla .
" since we came out this morning many people we met have continuously warned us to be careful about our headscarves and to wear them further forward because they are arresting women who are dressed like this , " she says .
boutique owners are furious .
some shops have been sealed - others warned not to sell tight revealing clothing .
one shopkeeper selling evening dresses told us the moral police had ordered him to saw off the breasts of his mannequins because they were too revealing .
he said he was n't the only shop to receive this strange instruction .
respect there 's even been less traffic on the streets because some women are not venturing out - fearful they will be harassed .
and it 's not even safe in a car .
taxi agencies have received a circular warning them not to carry a " bad hijabi " .
" they have said we should n't carry passengers who wear bad islamic dress and if we do we have to warn them to respect the islamic dress code even inside the car , " said one taxi driver .
and it 's not just women who are being targeted this year .
young men are being cautioned for wearing short sleeved shirts or for their hairstyles .
morad - a hairdresser whose gelled hair is made to stand straight up - says it 's necessary for him to look like this to attract customers .
" these last few days i do n't dare walk down the main roads looking like this case i get arrested , " he says .
" i use the side streets and alleys . "
morad is scared because his friends have told him they 've seen the police seize young men and forcibly cut their hair if it 's too long .
fifteen-year-old tofiq who 'd also gelled his hair to stand on end said he too was afraid but he was n't going to change .
" i want the whole world to know that they oppress us and all we can do is put up with it , " he said .
some parents have complained that harassing the young over their clothing will only push them to leave the country .
but one mp has said those iranians who can not cope with islamic laws should leave .
some commentators have suggested that the government is conducting this crackdown to distract attention from the rising cost of living in iran and increasing tension with the international community over the nuclear issue .
if so , it 's a strategy that risks alienating people who 've got used to years of relative social freedom and do not want to return to the early days of the revolution when dress rules were much more tightly enforced .

it is the talk of the town .
the latest police crackdown on islamic dress has angered many iranians - male , female , young and old .
but iranian tv has reported that an opinion poll conducted in tehran found 86 % of people were in favour of the crackdown - a statistic that is surprising given the strength of feeling against this move .
police cars are stationed outside major shopping centres in tehran .
they are stopping pedestrians and even cars - warning female drivers not to show any hair - and impounding the vehicles and arresting the women if they argue back .
middle-aged women , foreign tourists and journalists have all been harassed , not just the young and fashionably dressed .
individual choice overnight the standard of what is acceptable dress has slipped back .
i want the whole world to know that they oppress us and all we can do is put up with it tofiq , 15 hard-won freedoms - like the right to wear a colourful headscarf - have been snatched away .
it may sound trivial but iranian women have found ways of expressing their individuality and returning to drab colours like black , grey and dark blue is not something they will accept easily .
" if we want to do something we will do it anyway , all this is total nonsense , " says a young girl , heavily made up and dressed up .
she believes islamic dress should be something personal - whether you 're swathed in a black chador or dressed in what she calls " more normal clothes " .
interestingly many women who choose to wear the all enveloping chador agree - saying it 's a personal choice and should n't be forced on people .
" this year is much worse than before because the newspapers and the tv have given the issue a lot of coverage compared to last year ; it was n't this bad before , " says shabnam who 's out shopping with her friend .
permission denied at the start of every summer the police say they will enforce the islamic dress code , but this year has been unusually harsh .
thousands of women have been cautioned by police over their dress , some have been obliged to sign statements that they will do better in the future , and some face court cases against them .
even shop mannequins considered " too revealing " are dealt with though the authorities want coverage internally to scare women - they do n't want the story broadcast abroad .
the bbc 's cameraman was detained when he tried to film the police at work and the government denied us permission to go on patrol with the police .
" really we do n't have any security , " complains shabam 's friend leyla .
" since we came out this morning many people we met have continuously warned us to be careful about our headscarves and to wear them further forward because they are arresting women who are dressed like this , " she says .
boutique owners are furious .
some shops have been sealed - others warned not to sell tight revealing clothing .
one shopkeeper selling evening dresses told us the moral police had ordered him to saw off the breasts of his mannequins because they were too revealing .
he said he was n't the only shop to receive this strange instruction .
respect there 's even been less traffic on the streets because some women are not venturing out - fearful they will be harassed .
and it 's not even safe in a car .

the house at 21 mivart street in easton , bristol , was being sold for offers in excess of £ 160,000 .
three sealed bids are currently being considered by the owner in devon .
however , the offers are not legally binding as the art by the cult graffiti artist was the item up for sale - with the house thrown in for free .
the free-painted artwork on the side of the terraced property , and accessible from the street , is believed to be one of the artist 's early pieces , dating to around 2002 .
the house and the mural are being sold as a package it was daubed with red paint sometime between wednesday evening and thursday morning .
estate agents ocean were due to go to the property on friday morning to see the damage before informing the seller .
those people who submitted bids will then have to be informed so that they can make a decision whether or not to withdraw from the sale .
vendor sarah anslow , of the red propeller art gallery in devon , put the mural and house up for sale in february .
" we 've been absolutely overwhelmed by the interest in this piece , " she said , adding that having decided to sell the property it was important the work of art was kept " as it is " .
banksy 's art has become very desirable among fashionable collectors with angelina jolie and christina aguilera among those who are reported to have bought his work .
but it 's not the first time one of his murals has been defaced .
mural stolen workers on the london underground painted over a pulp fiction inspired piece earlier this month after mistaking it for ordinary graffiti .
and in march , a mural in east london was almost entirely removed by thieves .
one of banksy 's early murals was mistakenly painted over in the same month by bristol council 's graffiti-removal contractors .
and in february two smaller works in london were also painted over .

the house at 21 mivart street in easton , bristol , was being sold for offers in excess of £ 160,000 .
three sealed bids are currently being considered by the owner in devon .
however , the offers are not legally binding as the art by the cult graffiti artist was the item up for sale - with the house thrown in for free .
the free-painted artwork on the side of the terraced property , and accessible from the street , is believed to be one of the artist 's early pieces , dating to around 2002 .
the house and the mural are being sold as a package it was daubed with red paint sometime between wednesday evening and thursday morning .
estate agents ocean were due to go to the property on friday morning to see the damage before informing the seller .
those people who submitted bids will then have to be informed so that they can make a decision whether or not to withdraw from the sale .
vendor sarah anslow , of the red propeller art gallery in devon , put the mural and house up for sale in february .
" we 've been absolutely overwhelmed by the interest in this piece , " she said , adding that having decided to sell the property it was important the work of art was kept " as it is " .
banksy 's art has become very desirable among fashionable collectors with angelina jolie and christina aguilera among those who are reported to have bought his work .
but it 's not the first time one of his murals has been defaced .
mural stolen workers on the london underground painted over a pulp fiction inspired piece earlier this month after mistaking it for ordinary graffiti .
and in march , a mural in east london was almost entirely removed by thieves .
one of banksy 's early murals was mistakenly painted over in the same month by bristol council 's graffiti-removal contractors .
and in february two smaller works in london were also painted over .
