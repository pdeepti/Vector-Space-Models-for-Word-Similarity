portuguese foreign minister luis amado attended as the representative of the next eu presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benita ferrero-waldner ferrero-waldner said the aim of the program was to ensure that judges " can do in the future what we take for granted " in the west . the eu funding would also go towards developing alternative crops to combat the narcotics industry in afghanistan , which is the world 's biggest opium producer . stabilizing the situation the pledge follows the announcement last week that the united states plans to spend an extra $ 10.6 billion in afghanistan over two years and to extend the tour of duty of more than 3,000 us troops there by four months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british nato soldier in kabul at washington 's urging , nato has agreed to step up military efforts in spring when taliban insurgents are expected to intensify their offensive .

" an eu police mission in afghanistan is very likely , " solana said in a speech to a conference on european security and defence policy which followed the aid announcement .
eu member states last week gave the green light for such a mission to support the nato-led military and reconstruction campaign in afghanistan . german experts are already helping to train afghanistan 's police force . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : german pilots train for combat in afghanistan germany is expected to decide soon on a nato request to send reconnaissance aircraft to southern afghanistan .

" public incitement of violence and hatred or the denial or trivialization of genocide with racist or xenophobic motives " should be criminalized eu-wide , german officials said in brussels on monday .
" but the plan does not include a ban on certain symbols such as swastikas . " the german eu presidency hopes that eu members will come to an agreement on the plan during the meeting in luxembourg on april 19 and 20 . a similar attempt to make holocaust denial illegal by luxembourg in 2005 was blocked by britain , denmark and notably italy , where silvio berlusconi 's center-right coalition was still in power .
the new italian government under romano prodi introduced a national bill over the weekend that would impose jail time for inciting racial hatred . in europe , only austria , belgium , france , germany , poland , romania and spain have laws that specifically target revisionism . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de readers debate criminalizing holocaust denial in the eu jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 29.01.2007 amid debate , germany 's heroin injection clinics fight to survive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for severe addicts , the injection clinics could prove life-saving germany 's conservatives are opposed to liberalizing heroin and giving free doses to the country 's worst addicts .
some say the rigid stance may jeopardize the health of hundreds of patients . last week , the cities of hamburg and frankfurt warned that injection clinics where severe heroin addicts are administered free doses of the drug under medical supervision are in danger of closure by the middle of the year if the german government doesn ’ t extend their lifetime . a failure to do so wouldn ’ t just threaten the future of the clinics in hamburg and frankfurt , but also hit heroin injection centers in five other german cities where hard-core addicts can inject themselves with diamorphine , a chemically pure form of heroin .
in addition to providing clean needles , the clinics also offer crucial psychiatric support . heroin versus methadone they were all set up in 2002 under the previous german government of social democrats and greens as part of a project modeled on similar experiments in switzerland and the netherlands to find the most effective way to treat hard-core heroin addicts , help them build a relatively normal life and eventually get them to kick the habit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the heroin injection clinic in frankfurt the project compared results between a group of patients who were put on heroin maintenance therapy and another on methadone , a heroin substitute . the findings , which were published in a study last year , found that the heroin group fared much better . " those on heroin stayed in treatment longer and the drop out is much less than the methadone group .
they had much less illicit drug use , using street heroin and cocaine , and so have better health records , ” said christian haase , a hamburg-based researcher who carried out the study . lower drug crime and better health the study ’ s conclusions in favor of heroin maintenance therapy to treat the country ’ s worst addicts has been boosted by the fact that germany ’ s heroin-overdose death rate has continually plunged in the past years and is currently at its lowest level since 1989 .
in addition , cities such as hamburg , long notorious for its open drug scene near the main railway station , have managed to stem illicit drug use and lower drug crime . “ our clinic ’ s priority has been to improve the health of patients and we have made good progress with that , ” said peter heine , a spokesman for the frankfurt mayor ’ s office .
the city ’ s heroin injection clinic has seen its patients dwindle to 59 from 93 .
“ and importantly , the clinic has helped to keep addicts off the street and prevent them from resorting to illegal means to obtain the drug , ” heine added . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is estimated to have around 1,500 severe smack addicts karin bonorden-kleij , head of the heroin injection clinic in hamburg said patient numbers had dropped to 70 from an original 200 who started therapy .
most turned clean with fewer health problems , a few dropped out while some went back to the streets . bonorden-kleij said that thanks to twice daily injections of diamorphine , more than 40 of her patients now had regular jobs - which was unthinkable when they first approached the center . conservatives resist heroin maintenance despite the therapy ’ s success , heroin maintenance treatment remains highly controversial .
the injection clinics initially sparked angry protests among residents living near them , particularly in hamburg and frankfurt .
but most have since dropped their resistance . however , politicians in germany remain split on whether the project - which has already been extended once - should be renewed beyond june 2007 . in particular , the conservatives in germany ’ s current grand coalition government are against the project . though members of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the christian social union , -lrb- csu -rrb- declined requests for interviews ; their resistance to the project on ideological and financial grounds is well known . last year , they reacted furiously to a proposal to make heroin available by prescription . " these plans are n't acceptable .
the csu wo n't approve any legislation that will make the state a drug dealer , " markus söder , general secretary of the csu told daily die welt , adding there was no way " the state will pay for the junkies ' fix " when citizens were paying ever more for their health .
the heroin maintenance project has so far cost over 12 million euros . " a big chance for germany " experts however rebuff the too-expensive argument , saying that though heroin maintenance is admittedly more expensive than methadone therapy ; the benefits far outweigh the costs . " you have to look at the bigger picture .
heroin therapy is n't expensive if you take into account the indirect costs that you save in terms of improved quality of life , productivity and improved health , " hamburg researcher haase said .
he says the therapy will cost just around 10,000 euros per patient every year for the estimated small group of germany 's 1,500 severe heroin addicts . " this is a big chance for germany to take a step forward and create a modern therapy to tackle drug dependency , " haase said . legalizing heroin a sticking point the conservatives - who control the upper house of parliament and can thus block legislation - are also against changing germany ’ s drug laws to legalize heroin and approve it for medical use , a point that experts say is absolutely essential . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the opium that makes its way to the west comes from central asia " it 's really annoying that a medical discussion has been hijacked by politics , " said ralf hüllinghorst , head of the german head office for dependency matters -lrb- dhs -rrb- who stressed that heroin administration had to made part of regular health care in germany . " if heroin maintenance has proved to be effective , we have to be able to make use of it .
heroin has to be legalized and doctors should be allowed to prescribe it like in the netherlands and in switzerland . " the matter however is far from decided .
conservative members of germany 's parliament face a challenge from their own party members on the issue at the state level . hamburg which is ruled by a cdu government said last week it was kicking off a campaign to lobby support in the upper house of parliament to amend german drug laws to legalize heroin .
frankfurt too saw a rare show of support across party lines for extending its heroin injection clinic . patients stand to lose everything as the debate rumbles on , advocates of the project warn that if the german government doesn ’ t extend the project and legalize heroin it would spell disaster for hundreds of patients . " if the clinic closes and we stop the diamorphine doses , it will make everything worse for the patients who have managed to stabilize their lives , " said karin bonorden-kleij who pointed out that most of her patients had managed to break away from a life of criminality and abuse and painstakingly build a normal life . " if you take this away from them , i fear that some will not see the point of living anymore and commit suicide .

some say the rigid stance may jeopardize the health of hundreds of patients . last week , the cities of hamburg and frankfurt warned that injection clinics where severe heroin addicts are administered free doses of the drug under medical supervision are in danger of closure by the middle of the year if the german government doesn ’ t extend their lifetime . a failure to do so wouldn ’ t just threaten the future of the clinics in hamburg and frankfurt , but also hit heroin injection centers in five other german cities where hard-core addicts can inject themselves with diamorphine , a chemically pure form of heroin .
in addition to providing clean needles , the clinics also offer crucial psychiatric support . heroin versus methadone they were all set up in 2002 under the previous german government of social democrats and greens as part of a project modeled on similar experiments in switzerland and the netherlands to find the most effective way to treat hard-core heroin addicts , help them build a relatively normal life and eventually get them to kick the habit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the heroin injection clinic in frankfurt the project compared results between a group of patients who were put on heroin maintenance therapy and another on methadone , a heroin substitute . the findings , which were published in a study last year , found that the heroin group fared much better . " those on heroin stayed in treatment longer and the drop out is much less than the methadone group .
they had much less illicit drug use , using street heroin and cocaine , and so have better health records , ” said christian haase , a hamburg-based researcher who carried out the study . lower drug crime and better health the study ’ s conclusions in favor of heroin maintenance therapy to treat the country ’ s worst addicts has been boosted by the fact that germany ’ s heroin-overdose death rate has continually plunged in the past years and is currently at its lowest level since 1989 .
in addition , cities such as hamburg , long notorious for its open drug scene near the main railway station , have managed to stem illicit drug use and lower drug crime . “ our clinic ’ s priority has been to improve the health of patients and we have made good progress with that , ” said peter heine , a spokesman for the frankfurt mayor ’ s office .
the city ’ s heroin injection clinic has seen its patients dwindle to 59 from 93 .
“ and importantly , the clinic has helped to keep addicts off the street and prevent them from resorting to illegal means to obtain the drug , ” heine added . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is estimated to have around 1,500 severe smack addicts karin bonorden-kleij , head of the heroin injection clinic in hamburg said patient numbers had dropped to 70 from an original 200 who started therapy .
most turned clean with fewer health problems , a few dropped out while some went back to the streets . bonorden-kleij said that thanks to twice daily injections of diamorphine , more than 40 of her patients now had regular jobs - which was unthinkable when they first approached the center . conservatives resist heroin maintenance despite the therapy ’ s success , heroin maintenance treatment remains highly controversial .
the injection clinics initially sparked angry protests among residents living near them , particularly in hamburg and frankfurt .
but most have since dropped their resistance . however , politicians in germany remain split on whether the project - which has already been extended once - should be renewed beyond june 2007 . in particular , the conservatives in germany ’ s current grand coalition government are against the project . though members of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the christian social union , -lrb- csu -rrb- declined requests for interviews ; their resistance to the project on ideological and financial grounds is well known . last year , they reacted furiously to a proposal to make heroin available by prescription . " these plans are n't acceptable .
the csu wo n't approve any legislation that will make the state a drug dealer , " markus söder , general secretary of the csu told daily die welt , adding there was no way " the state will pay for the junkies ' fix " when citizens were paying ever more for their health .
the heroin maintenance project has so far cost over 12 million euros . " a big chance for germany " experts however rebuff the too-expensive argument , saying that though heroin maintenance is admittedly more expensive than methadone therapy ; the benefits far outweigh the costs . " you have to look at the bigger picture .
heroin therapy is n't expensive if you take into account the indirect costs that you save in terms of improved quality of life , productivity and improved health , " hamburg researcher haase said .
he says the therapy will cost just around 10,000 euros per patient every year for the estimated small group of germany 's 1,500 severe heroin addicts . " this is a big chance for germany to take a step forward and create a modern therapy to tackle drug dependency , " haase said . legalizing heroin a sticking point the conservatives - who control the upper house of parliament and can thus block legislation - are also against changing germany ’ s drug laws to legalize heroin and approve it for medical use , a point that experts say is absolutely essential . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the opium that makes its way to the west comes from central asia " it 's really annoying that a medical discussion has been hijacked by politics , " said ralf hüllinghorst , head of the german head office for dependency matters -lrb- dhs -rrb- who stressed that heroin administration had to made part of regular health care in germany . " if heroin maintenance has proved to be effective , we have to be able to make use of it .
heroin has to be legalized and doctors should be allowed to prescribe it like in the netherlands and in switzerland . " the matter however is far from decided .
conservative members of germany 's parliament face a challenge from their own party members on the issue at the state level . hamburg which is ruled by a cdu government said last week it was kicking off a campaign to lobby support in the upper house of parliament to amend german drug laws to legalize heroin .
frankfurt too saw a rare show of support across party lines for extending its heroin injection clinic . patients stand to lose everything as the debate rumbles on , advocates of the project warn that if the german government doesn ’ t extend the project and legalize heroin it would spell disaster for hundreds of patients . " if the clinic closes and we stop the diamorphine doses , it will make everything worse for the patients who have managed to stabilize their lives , " said karin bonorden-kleij who pointed out that most of her patients had managed to break away from a life of criminality and abuse and painstakingly build a normal life .

most turned clean with fewer health problems , a few dropped out while some went back to the streets . bonorden-kleij said that thanks to twice daily injections of diamorphine , more than 40 of her patients now had regular jobs - which was unthinkable when they first approached the center . conservatives resist heroin maintenance despite the therapy ’ s success , heroin maintenance treatment remains highly controversial .
the injection clinics initially sparked angry protests among residents living near them , particularly in hamburg and frankfurt .
but most have since dropped their resistance . however , politicians in germany remain split on whether the project - which has already been extended once - should be renewed beyond june 2007 . in particular , the conservatives in germany ’ s current grand coalition government are against the project . though members of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the christian social union , -lrb- csu -rrb- declined requests for interviews ; their resistance to the project on ideological and financial grounds is well known . last year , they reacted furiously to a proposal to make heroin available by prescription . " these plans are n't acceptable .
the csu wo n't approve any legislation that will make the state a drug dealer , " markus söder , general secretary of the csu told daily die welt , adding there was no way " the state will pay for the junkies ' fix " when citizens were paying ever more for their health .
the heroin maintenance project has so far cost over 12 million euros . " a big chance for germany " experts however rebuff the too-expensive argument , saying that though heroin maintenance is admittedly more expensive than methadone therapy ; the benefits far outweigh the costs . " you have to look at the bigger picture .
heroin therapy is n't expensive if you take into account the indirect costs that you save in terms of improved quality of life , productivity and improved health , " hamburg researcher haase said .
he says the therapy will cost just around 10,000 euros per patient every year for the estimated small group of germany 's 1,500 severe heroin addicts . " this is a big chance for germany to take a step forward and create a modern therapy to tackle drug dependency , " haase said . legalizing heroin a sticking point the conservatives - who control the upper house of parliament and can thus block legislation - are also against changing germany ’ s drug laws to legalize heroin and approve it for medical use , a point that experts say is absolutely essential . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the opium that makes its way to the west comes from central asia " it 's really annoying that a medical discussion has been hijacked by politics , " said ralf hüllinghorst , head of the german head office for dependency matters -lrb- dhs -rrb- who stressed that heroin administration had to made part of regular health care in germany . " if heroin maintenance has proved to be effective , we have to be able to make use of it .
heroin has to be legalized and doctors should be allowed to prescribe it like in the netherlands and in switzerland . " the matter however is far from decided .
conservative members of germany 's parliament face a challenge from their own party members on the issue at the state level . hamburg which is ruled by a cdu government said last week it was kicking off a campaign to lobby support in the upper house of parliament to amend german drug laws to legalize heroin .
frankfurt too saw a rare show of support across party lines for extending its heroin injection clinic . patients stand to lose everything as the debate rumbles on , advocates of the project warn that if the german government doesn ’ t extend the project and legalize heroin it would spell disaster for hundreds of patients . " if the clinic closes and we stop the diamorphine doses , it will make everything worse for the patients who have managed to stabilize their lives , " said karin bonorden-kleij who pointed out that most of her patients had managed to break away from a life of criminality and abuse and painstakingly build a normal life . " if you take this away from them , i fear that some will not see the point of living anymore and commit suicide .

some say the rigid stance may jeopardize the health of hundreds of patients . last week , the cities of hamburg and frankfurt warned that injection clinics where severe heroin addicts are administered free doses of the drug under medical supervision are in danger of closure by the middle of the year if the german government doesn ’ t extend their lifetime . a failure to do so wouldn ’ t just threaten the future of the clinics in hamburg and frankfurt , but also hit heroin injection centers in five other german cities where hard-core addicts can inject themselves with diamorphine , a chemically pure form of heroin .
in addition to providing clean needles , the clinics also offer crucial psychiatric support . heroin versus methadone they were all set up in 2002 under the previous german government of social democrats and greens as part of a project modeled on similar experiments in switzerland and the netherlands to find the most effective way to treat hard-core heroin addicts , help them build a relatively normal life and eventually get them to kick the habit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the heroin injection clinic in frankfurt the project compared results between a group of patients who were put on heroin maintenance therapy and another on methadone , a heroin substitute . the findings , which were published in a study last year , found that the heroin group fared much better . " those on heroin stayed in treatment longer and the drop out is much less than the methadone group .
they had much less illicit drug use , using street heroin and cocaine , and so have better health records , ” said christian haase , a hamburg-based researcher who carried out the study . lower drug crime and better health the study ’ s conclusions in favor of heroin maintenance therapy to treat the country ’ s worst addicts has been boosted by the fact that germany ’ s heroin-overdose death rate has continually plunged in the past years and is currently at its lowest level since 1989 .
in addition , cities such as hamburg , long notorious for its open drug scene near the main railway station , have managed to stem illicit drug use and lower drug crime . “ our clinic ’ s priority has been to improve the health of patients and we have made good progress with that , ” said peter heine , a spokesman for the frankfurt mayor ’ s office .
the city ’ s heroin injection clinic has seen its patients dwindle to 59 from 93 .

27 was holocaust memorial day in germany .
meanwhile , germany 's efforts to criminalize holocaust denial in the eu are increasing coming up against resistance .
see what other readers had to say on the matter . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the basic idea of the principle of free speech is that you have a right , issuing from your dignity as a human being , to say what you honestly think is true .
those who believe in the arguments of holocaust revisionism meet this criterion .
there is very good evidence behind these arguments and those who support them are intellectually honest .
they are not hateful propagandists .
if the eu makes holocaust denial a crime , it makes itself a criminal against classical liberalism and the dignity of man . - kendra blewitt , san francisco how can one deny the holocaust ?
it happened .
how can one not admit the existence of israel ?
there it is .
but how long do we have to cow-tow to the wishes of the israelis ?
just get over it . - james wilder , us these laws prohibiting holocaust skepticism are evil .
it is the right of a free people to question their government publicly .
the founding fathers of the united states drew upon great european thinkers and philosophers such as voltaire and john stuart mill .
european tradition is what today 's europe should espouse , not stalinist laws to placate interest groups .
i can not express the evil with which i view any law which proscribes my right to believe or not to believe in any aspect of any historical event and to publicly state my opinion . - joseph kochanek bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did nazis carry out systematic murder ?
in germany it 's a crime to say no as long as the european union does not have a common constitution approved by all its members , it will be difficult to find consensus on the criminalization of holocaust denial . - jose nigrin the german government has a moral obligation to uphold its constitution , which guarantees any of its citizens the right to free speech .
also , a murder is a crime no matter who commits it .
to exempt one group from the rest is a violation of article 14 of the un 's international covenant on civil and political rights . - rudolf pueschel passing laws that illegalize holocaust denial is a victory against freedom of speech . - brad harris to put a man at mr. zundel 's advanced age in jail is criminal to say the least .
i thought people were allowed to think .
mr. zundel chooses to think differently .
it is n't a crime .
how many people will germany put in jail for thinking or writing books ?
shame ! - sheila fox merely expressing one 's opinion or belief , or even ignorance , will not change what has already happened and will also not make a non-occurrence an occurrence .
in this light , such a ban is laughable and infantile .
it also shows that the eu is held hostage by jewish groups and lobbies .
moreover , it is now 2007 and everyone has got over the world war two itch , other than germany , that is .
there are far more pressing issues to be taken care of than this pet obsession .
if the government wants to be a stooge to the jewish lobby , then it is up to its members to decide , but it can at no point of time force others to subscribe to its point of view . - suvrajit saha bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria , belgium , france , germany , poland , romania and spain already have laws against holocaust denial sixty years after the war 's end , nazism is again rearing its ugly head : jailing people for their speech , laws against free thought and burning books .
how can you people be so stupid ?
do you really think you are any different then hitler ? - lynda , uk what the hell is wrong with germany ?
they have been sitting around like a whipped puppy since world war two .
germany needs to openly look at the issue of the holocaust .
there is sufficient evidence that all the claims are not true .
germany has zero national pride .
you need to act like the father land and stand strong and see to what is best for your nation .
you have so much to offer god 's world .
you first need to break this " holocaust poison " that has ruined your spirit as a people . - andrew compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's pursuit of holocaust denial resolution hits skids germany 's hope of using its eu presidency to persuade all 27 member states to make holocaust denial a crime has received a setback in italy and is expected to run into more resistance .
-lrb- 28.01.2007 -rrb- germany joins the world in remembering holocaust victims ceremonies marking holocaust memorial day got underway across germany on saturday , the 62nd anniversary of the liberation of the infamous nazi auschwitz death camp .

27 was holocaust memorial day in germany .
meanwhile , germany 's efforts to criminalize holocaust denial in the eu are increasing coming up against resistance .
see what other readers had to say on the matter . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the basic idea of the principle of free speech is that you have a right , issuing from your dignity as a human being , to say what you honestly think is true .
those who believe in the arguments of holocaust revisionism meet this criterion .
there is very good evidence behind these arguments and those who support them are intellectually honest .
they are not hateful propagandists .
if the eu makes holocaust denial a crime , it makes itself a criminal against classical liberalism and the dignity of man . - kendra blewitt , san francisco how can one deny the holocaust ?
it happened .
how can one not admit the existence of israel ?
there it is .
but how long do we have to cow-tow to the wishes of the israelis ?
just get over it . - james wilder , us these laws prohibiting holocaust skepticism are evil .
it is the right of a free people to question their government publicly .
the founding fathers of the united states drew upon great european thinkers and philosophers such as voltaire and john stuart mill .
european tradition is what today 's europe should espouse , not stalinist laws to placate interest groups .
i can not express the evil with which i view any law which proscribes my right to believe or not to believe in any aspect of any historical event and to publicly state my opinion . - joseph kochanek bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did nazis carry out systematic murder ?
in germany it 's a crime to say no as long as the european union does not have a common constitution approved by all its members , it will be difficult to find consensus on the criminalization of holocaust denial . - jose nigrin the german government has a moral obligation to uphold its constitution , which guarantees any of its citizens the right to free speech .
also , a murder is a crime no matter who commits it .
to exempt one group from the rest is a violation of article 14 of the un 's international covenant on civil and political rights . - rudolf pueschel passing laws that illegalize holocaust denial is a victory against freedom of speech . - brad harris to put a man at mr. zundel 's advanced age in jail is criminal to say the least .
i thought people were allowed to think .
mr. zundel chooses to think differently .
it is n't a crime .
how many people will germany put in jail for thinking or writing books ?
shame ! - sheila fox merely expressing one 's opinion or belief , or even ignorance , will not change what has already happened and will also not make a non-occurrence an occurrence .
in this light , such a ban is laughable and infantile .
it also shows that the eu is held hostage by jewish groups and lobbies .
moreover , it is now 2007 and everyone has got over the world war two itch , other than germany , that is .
there are far more pressing issues to be taken care of than this pet obsession .
if the government wants to be a stooge to the jewish lobby , then it is up to its members to decide , but it can at no point of time force others to subscribe to its point of view . - suvrajit saha bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria , belgium , france , germany , poland , romania and spain already have laws against holocaust denial sixty years after the war 's end , nazism is again rearing its ugly head : jailing people for their speech , laws against free thought and burning books .
how can you people be so stupid ?
do you really think you are any different then hitler ? - lynda , uk what the hell is wrong with germany ?
they have been sitting around like a whipped puppy since world war two .
germany needs to openly look at the issue of the holocaust .
there is sufficient evidence that all the claims are not true .
germany has zero national pride .
you need to act like the father land and stand strong and see to what is best for your nation .
you have so much to offer god 's world .
you first need to break this " holocaust poison " that has ruined your spirit as a people . - andrew compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's pursuit of holocaust denial resolution hits skids germany 's hope of using its eu presidency to persuade all 27 member states to make holocaust denial a crime has received a setback in italy and is expected to run into more resistance .

germany is expected to decide soon on a nato request to send reconnaissance aircraft to southern afghanistan .
according to a news report , german pilots may be preparing for more than that , however . germany is expected to decide soon on a nato request to send reconnaissance aircraft to southern afghanistan .
but , according to a news report , german pilots may be preparing for more than that . on wednesday , germany 's cabinet will most likely give the green light to deploying six tornado surveillance planes to help alliance forces in the dangerous southern regions of afghanistan . germany 's bundestag , which has to give final approval , is mulling the plan next week .
so far , the bundeswehr 's current mandate limits the deployment of some 3,000 german soldiers to the afghan capital kabul and the relatively safer northern part of the country . but according to a news report by german public broadcaster ard , the mission might go beyond mere reconnaissance : bundeswehr pilots are currently testing technology that would allow them to participate directly in combat missions . combat support or combat ? the " reccelite " technology allows pilots to transfer images to a ground station or fighter planes in real time .
this allows so-called " close-air-support " operations , which make it possible to identify and bombard moving targets in a quick and precise way . bildunterschrift : the ard report quoted pilots , who said that they had received orders from " the highest position " to acquire the skills for such missions " very quickly . " they added that it would really only make sense for german pilots to bombard targets themselves as they do not have the ability to transfer information wirelessly to fighter planes or ground stations in a secure way . defense ministry officials said that the " reccelite " tests had been planned for some time and that no plans so far existed to buy the technology for a potential tornado mission in afghanistan . opposition , spd concerns opposition politicians on the other hand saw the training as further evidence that the planes were meant to be used in combat missions . members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the government 's junior coalition partner , meanwhile also voiced concerns about deploying planes . " we have to do everything to prevent being pulled into an escalating combat situation , " said gert weisskirchen , the spd 's foreign affairs spokesman in parliament . but spd defense policy expert hans-peter bartels countered that germany was already involved in combat operations in afghanistan .

germany is expected to decide soon on a nato request to send reconnaissance aircraft to southern afghanistan .
according to a news report , german pilots may be preparing for more than that , however . germany is expected to decide soon on a nato request to send reconnaissance aircraft to southern afghanistan .
but , according to a news report , german pilots may be preparing for more than that . on wednesday , germany 's cabinet will most likely give the green light to deploying six tornado surveillance planes to help alliance forces in the dangerous southern regions of afghanistan . germany 's bundestag , which has to give final approval , is mulling the plan next week .
so far , the bundeswehr 's current mandate limits the deployment of some 3,000 german soldiers to the afghan capital kabul and the relatively safer northern part of the country . but according to a news report by german public broadcaster ard , the mission might go beyond mere reconnaissance : bundeswehr pilots are currently testing technology that would allow them to participate directly in combat missions . combat support or combat ? the " reccelite " technology allows pilots to transfer images to a ground station or fighter planes in real time .
this allows so-called " close-air-support " operations , which make it possible to identify and bombard moving targets in a quick and precise way . bildunterschrift : the ard report quoted pilots , who said that they had received orders from " the highest position " to acquire the skills for such missions " very quickly . " they added that it would really only make sense for german pilots to bombard targets themselves as they do not have the ability to transfer information wirelessly to fighter planes or ground stations in a secure way . defense ministry officials said that the " reccelite " tests had been planned for some time and that no plans so far existed to buy the technology for a potential tornado mission in afghanistan . opposition , spd concerns opposition politicians on the other hand saw the training as further evidence that the planes were meant to be used in combat missions . members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the government 's junior coalition partner , meanwhile also voiced concerns about deploying planes . " we have to do everything to prevent being pulled into an escalating combat situation , " said gert weisskirchen , the spd 's foreign affairs spokesman in parliament . but spd defense policy expert hans-peter bartels countered that germany was already involved in combat operations in afghanistan . " it would be hypocritical to say that we germans have nothing to do with conducting war in afghanistan , " he said . spd leader kurt beck said he expected germany to approve the request to send tornado planes .

" the government will do everything it can to reach a sector-wide reduction , " merkel told a meeting of industry leaders in berlin . it was " regrettable " that european car makers would not meet the targets they had set themselves , merkel said . " but we must not let the result of that be to impose a general obligation for all cars to be subject to the same measure , " she said . " the diversity of the automobile industry must be respected , " merkel maintained . merkel said the german government would do all it could to make sure any goals in the 27-member bloc depended on the type of car . eu rejects german car industry opposition european commission president jose manuel barroso and environment commissioner stavros dimas want binding legislation that would require car makers to reduce co2 emissions of new cars to an industry average of 120 grams per km in 2012 .
that is because the auto industry is likely to miss a voluntary target to cut average co2 emissions for new cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suvs , which are increasingly found on european roads , are big polluters some german politicians have said they support such a move but others have voiced reservations . on monday , the eu commission rejected a letter from written by the heads of germany 's top five car companies over the weekend to the eu commission that warned of the risk to eu competitiveness and employment if brussels imposed binding limits on car exhaust emissions . daimlerchrysler , volkswagen , ford , bmw and opel say that if the eu plans are implemented , it will be forced to cut jobs or move them to cheaper nations as it copes with rising costs and a tougher consumer market . but a spokesman for the european commission , johannes laitenberger , said that the best way to preserve jobs was to embrace and anticipate change rather than resist it . " normally jobs are not lost when you proactively embrace change , " laitenberger said .
" we need to equip europe for globalization and our industry for the future .
neither globalization nor climate change will go away . " eu divided about emissions legislation the issue is complicated by the fact that the eu executive too is divided about the planned legislation to limit car emissions . the commission delayed a decision last week to allow more time to forge a consensus . eu environment commissioner dimas has said that he wants the burden of responsiblity to lie with carmakers .
however industry commissioner guenter verheugen , considered close to the car lobby , has suggested that car owners too should be required to stick to energy-efficient driving habits among other things . verheugen has also proposed that carmakers could be made part of the europe-wide trade in carbon emissions . that would mean that german carmakers would then not be forced to lower carbon dioxide emissions for new cars to 120 grams per kilometer by 2012 as required by the eu .
instead they could then buy emission rights from other sectors or support environmental projects in developing countries to balance out their emission record . eu spokesman laitenberger insisted monday that the eu needed a law to limit emissions for new cars , but indicated there could be room for maneuvering . " what is now under discussion is to debate and to decide on what exactly should be covered by the legislation , " he said .
" we are not driven by a day or two , or by a week or two , but by the urge to get this right . " experts say carmakers need to invest in green technology the dispute over the car industry 's responsiblity to lower emissions comes just weeks after the european union embraced a " low-carbon economy " to combat climate change by reducing its reliance on imported oil and natural gas and promote renewable sources of energy . but the eu is worried that rising carbon dioxide emissions from transportation will undermine its battle to cut greenhouse emissions on the continent . bildunterschrift : the number of cars on european roads has increased greatly in the past years according to the european environment agency , the overall level of greenhouse emissions from road transport has increased 22 percent since 1990 as the number of cars on the road rises . the european commission wants to force automakers to manufacture cars that are more environmentally friendly .
but carmakers , who say they have cut emissions by 13 percent , argue that it 's not viable for them to sell smaller cars or hybrid-fuel models . critics however say that carmakers simply are n't doing enough to develop environmentally-friendly technology . andreas troge , head of the german environment agency , warned that the german car industry was in danger of missing the boat on new green technologies which in turn could end up jeopardizing jobs . " if you 're too late in adapting , you can threaten jobs , " troge told hanover-based paper neuen presse . reinhard bütikofer , chairman of the opposition green party , urged the german car industry to view new environmental challenges as an opportunity instead of a threat .

" the government will do everything it can to reach a sector-wide reduction , " merkel told a meeting of industry leaders in berlin . it was " regrettable " that european car makers would not meet the targets they had set themselves , merkel said . " but we must not let the result of that be to impose a general obligation for all cars to be subject to the same measure , " she said . " the diversity of the automobile industry must be respected , " merkel maintained . merkel said the german government would do all it could to make sure any goals in the 27-member bloc depended on the type of car . eu rejects german car industry opposition european commission president jose manuel barroso and environment commissioner stavros dimas want binding legislation that would require car makers to reduce co2 emissions of new cars to an industry average of 120 grams per km in 2012 .
that is because the auto industry is likely to miss a voluntary target to cut average co2 emissions for new cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suvs , which are increasingly found on european roads , are big polluters some german politicians have said they support such a move but others have voiced reservations . on monday , the eu commission rejected a letter from written by the heads of germany 's top five car companies over the weekend to the eu commission that warned of the risk to eu competitiveness and employment if brussels imposed binding limits on car exhaust emissions . daimlerchrysler , volkswagen , ford , bmw and opel say that if the eu plans are implemented , it will be forced to cut jobs or move them to cheaper nations as it copes with rising costs and a tougher consumer market . but a spokesman for the european commission , johannes laitenberger , said that the best way to preserve jobs was to embrace and anticipate change rather than resist it . " normally jobs are not lost when you proactively embrace change , " laitenberger said .
" we need to equip europe for globalization and our industry for the future .
neither globalization nor climate change will go away . " eu divided about emissions legislation the issue is complicated by the fact that the eu executive too is divided about the planned legislation to limit car emissions . the commission delayed a decision last week to allow more time to forge a consensus . eu environment commissioner dimas has said that he wants the burden of responsiblity to lie with carmakers .
however industry commissioner guenter verheugen , considered close to the car lobby , has suggested that car owners too should be required to stick to energy-efficient driving habits among other things . verheugen has also proposed that carmakers could be made part of the europe-wide trade in carbon emissions . that would mean that german carmakers would then not be forced to lower carbon dioxide emissions for new cars to 120 grams per kilometer by 2012 as required by the eu .
instead they could then buy emission rights from other sectors or support environmental projects in developing countries to balance out their emission record . eu spokesman laitenberger insisted monday that the eu needed a law to limit emissions for new cars , but indicated there could be room for maneuvering . " what is now under discussion is to debate and to decide on what exactly should be covered by the legislation , " he said .
" we are not driven by a day or two , or by a week or two , but by the urge to get this right . " experts say carmakers need to invest in green technology the dispute over the car industry 's responsiblity to lower emissions comes just weeks after the european union embraced a " low-carbon economy " to combat climate change by reducing its reliance on imported oil and natural gas and promote renewable sources of energy . but the eu is worried that rising carbon dioxide emissions from transportation will undermine its battle to cut greenhouse emissions on the continent . bildunterschrift : the number of cars on european roads has increased greatly in the past years according to the european environment agency , the overall level of greenhouse emissions from road transport has increased 22 percent since 1990 as the number of cars on the road rises . the european commission wants to force automakers to manufacture cars that are more environmentally friendly .
but carmakers , who say they have cut emissions by 13 percent , argue that it 's not viable for them to sell smaller cars or hybrid-fuel models . critics however say that carmakers simply are n't doing enough to develop environmentally-friendly technology . andreas troge , head of the german environment agency , warned that the german car industry was in danger of missing the boat on new green technologies which in turn could end up jeopardizing jobs . " if you 're too late in adapting , you can threaten jobs , " troge told hanover-based paper neuen presse . reinhard bütikofer , chairman of the opposition green party , urged the german car industry to view new environmental challenges as an opportunity instead of a threat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 29.01.2007 amid debate , germany 's heroin injection clinics fight to survive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for severe addicts , the injection clinics could prove life-saving germany 's conservatives are opposed to liberalizing heroin and giving free doses to the country 's worst addicts .
some say the rigid stance may jeopardize the health of hundreds of patients . last week , the cities of hamburg and frankfurt warned that injection clinics where severe heroin addicts are administered free doses of the drug under medical supervision are in danger of closure by the middle of the year if the german government doesn ’ t extend their lifetime . a failure to do so wouldn ’ t just threaten the future of the clinics in hamburg and frankfurt , but also hit heroin injection centers in five other german cities where hard-core addicts can inject themselves with diamorphine , a chemically pure form of heroin .
in addition to providing clean needles , the clinics also offer crucial psychiatric support . heroin versus methadone they were all set up in 2002 under the previous german government of social democrats and greens as part of a project modeled on similar experiments in switzerland and the netherlands to find the most effective way to treat hard-core heroin addicts , help them build a relatively normal life and eventually get them to kick the habit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the heroin injection clinic in frankfurt the project compared results between a group of patients who were put on heroin maintenance therapy and another on methadone , a heroin substitute . the findings , which were published in a study last year , found that the heroin group fared much better . " those on heroin stayed in treatment longer and the drop out is much less than the methadone group .
they had much less illicit drug use , using street heroin and cocaine , and so have better health records , ” said christian haase , a hamburg-based researcher who carried out the study . lower drug crime and better health the study ’ s conclusions in favor of heroin maintenance therapy to treat the country ’ s worst addicts has been boosted by the fact that germany ’ s heroin-overdose death rate has continually plunged in the past years and is currently at its lowest level since 1989 .
in addition , cities such as hamburg , long notorious for its open drug scene near the main railway station , have managed to stem illicit drug use and lower drug crime . “ our clinic ’ s priority has been to improve the health of patients and we have made good progress with that , ” said peter heine , a spokesman for the frankfurt mayor ’ s office .
the city ’ s heroin injection clinic has seen its patients dwindle to 59 from 93 .
“ and importantly , the clinic has helped to keep addicts off the street and prevent them from resorting to illegal means to obtain the drug , ” heine added . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is estimated to have around 1,500 severe smack addicts karin bonorden-kleij , head of the heroin injection clinic in hamburg said patient numbers had dropped to 70 from an original 200 who started therapy .
most turned clean with fewer health problems , a few dropped out while some went back to the streets . bonorden-kleij said that thanks to twice daily injections of diamorphine , more than 40 of her patients now had regular jobs - which was unthinkable when they first approached the center . conservatives resist heroin maintenance despite the therapy ’ s success , heroin maintenance treatment remains highly controversial .
the injection clinics initially sparked angry protests among residents living near them , particularly in hamburg and frankfurt .
but most have since dropped their resistance . however , politicians in germany remain split on whether the project - which has already been extended once - should be renewed beyond june 2007 . in particular , the conservatives in germany ’ s current grand coalition government are against the project . though members of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the christian social union , -lrb- csu -rrb- declined requests for interviews ; their resistance to the project on ideological and financial grounds is well known . last year , they reacted furiously to a proposal to make heroin available by prescription . " these plans are n't acceptable .
the csu wo n't approve any legislation that will make the state a drug dealer , " markus söder , general secretary of the csu told daily die welt , adding there was no way " the state will pay for the junkies ' fix " when citizens were paying ever more for their health .
the heroin maintenance project has so far cost over 12 million euros . " a big chance for germany " experts however rebuff the too-expensive argument , saying that though heroin maintenance is admittedly more expensive than methadone therapy ; the benefits far outweigh the costs . " you have to look at the bigger picture .
heroin therapy is n't expensive if you take into account the indirect costs that you save in terms of improved quality of life , productivity and improved health , " hamburg researcher haase said .
he says the therapy will cost just around 10,000 euros per patient every year for the estimated small group of germany 's 1,500 severe heroin addicts . " this is a big chance for germany to take a step forward and create a modern therapy to tackle drug dependency , " haase said . legalizing heroin a sticking point the conservatives - who control the upper house of parliament and can thus block legislation - are also against changing germany ’ s drug laws to legalize heroin and approve it for medical use , a point that experts say is absolutely essential . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the opium that makes its way to the west comes from central asia " it 's really annoying that a medical discussion has been hijacked by politics , " said ralf hüllinghorst , head of the german head office for dependency matters -lrb- dhs -rrb- who stressed that heroin administration had to made part of regular health care in germany . " if heroin maintenance has proved to be effective , we have to be able to make use of it .
heroin has to be legalized and doctors should be allowed to prescribe it like in the netherlands and in switzerland . " the matter however is far from decided .
conservative members of germany 's parliament face a challenge from their own party members on the issue at the state level . hamburg which is ruled by a cdu government said last week it was kicking off a campaign to lobby support in the upper house of parliament to amend german drug laws to legalize heroin .
frankfurt too saw a rare show of support across party lines for extending its heroin injection clinic . patients stand to lose everything as the debate rumbles on , advocates of the project warn that if the german government doesn ’ t extend the project and legalize heroin it would spell disaster for hundreds of patients . " if the clinic closes and we stop the diamorphine doses , it will make everything worse for the patients who have managed to stabilize their lives , " said karin bonorden-kleij who pointed out that most of her patients had managed to break away from a life of criminality and abuse and painstakingly build a normal life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 29.01.2007 amid debate , germany 's heroin injection clinics fight to survive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for severe addicts , the injection clinics could prove life-saving germany 's conservatives are opposed to liberalizing heroin and giving free doses to the country 's worst addicts .
some say the rigid stance may jeopardize the health of hundreds of patients . last week , the cities of hamburg and frankfurt warned that injection clinics where severe heroin addicts are administered free doses of the drug under medical supervision are in danger of closure by the middle of the year if the german government doesn ’ t extend their lifetime . a failure to do so wouldn ’ t just threaten the future of the clinics in hamburg and frankfurt , but also hit heroin injection centers in five other german cities where hard-core addicts can inject themselves with diamorphine , a chemically pure form of heroin .
in addition to providing clean needles , the clinics also offer crucial psychiatric support . heroin versus methadone they were all set up in 2002 under the previous german government of social democrats and greens as part of a project modeled on similar experiments in switzerland and the netherlands to find the most effective way to treat hard-core heroin addicts , help them build a relatively normal life and eventually get them to kick the habit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the heroin injection clinic in frankfurt the project compared results between a group of patients who were put on heroin maintenance therapy and another on methadone , a heroin substitute . the findings , which were published in a study last year , found that the heroin group fared much better . " those on heroin stayed in treatment longer and the drop out is much less than the methadone group .
they had much less illicit drug use , using street heroin and cocaine , and so have better health records , ” said christian haase , a hamburg-based researcher who carried out the study . lower drug crime and better health the study ’ s conclusions in favor of heroin maintenance therapy to treat the country ’ s worst addicts has been boosted by the fact that germany ’ s heroin-overdose death rate has continually plunged in the past years and is currently at its lowest level since 1989 .
in addition , cities such as hamburg , long notorious for its open drug scene near the main railway station , have managed to stem illicit drug use and lower drug crime . “ our clinic ’ s priority has been to improve the health of patients and we have made good progress with that , ” said peter heine , a spokesman for the frankfurt mayor ’ s office .
the city ’ s heroin injection clinic has seen its patients dwindle to 59 from 93 .
“ and importantly , the clinic has helped to keep addicts off the street and prevent them from resorting to illegal means to obtain the drug , ” heine added . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is estimated to have around 1,500 severe smack addicts karin bonorden-kleij , head of the heroin injection clinic in hamburg said patient numbers had dropped to 70 from an original 200 who started therapy .
most turned clean with fewer health problems , a few dropped out while some went back to the streets . bonorden-kleij said that thanks to twice daily injections of diamorphine , more than 40 of her patients now had regular jobs - which was unthinkable when they first approached the center . conservatives resist heroin maintenance despite the therapy ’ s success , heroin maintenance treatment remains highly controversial .
the injection clinics initially sparked angry protests among residents living near them , particularly in hamburg and frankfurt .
but most have since dropped their resistance . however , politicians in germany remain split on whether the project - which has already been extended once - should be renewed beyond june 2007 . in particular , the conservatives in germany ’ s current grand coalition government are against the project . though members of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the christian social union , -lrb- csu -rrb- declined requests for interviews ; their resistance to the project on ideological and financial grounds is well known . last year , they reacted furiously to a proposal to make heroin available by prescription . " these plans are n't acceptable .
the csu wo n't approve any legislation that will make the state a drug dealer , " markus söder , general secretary of the csu told daily die welt , adding there was no way " the state will pay for the junkies ' fix " when citizens were paying ever more for their health .
the heroin maintenance project has so far cost over 12 million euros . " a big chance for germany " experts however rebuff the too-expensive argument , saying that though heroin maintenance is admittedly more expensive than methadone therapy ; the benefits far outweigh the costs . " you have to look at the bigger picture .
heroin therapy is n't expensive if you take into account the indirect costs that you save in terms of improved quality of life , productivity and improved health , " hamburg researcher haase said .
he says the therapy will cost just around 10,000 euros per patient every year for the estimated small group of germany 's 1,500 severe heroin addicts . " this is a big chance for germany to take a step forward and create a modern therapy to tackle drug dependency , " haase said . legalizing heroin a sticking point the conservatives - who control the upper house of parliament and can thus block legislation - are also against changing germany ’ s drug laws to legalize heroin and approve it for medical use , a point that experts say is absolutely essential . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the opium that makes its way to the west comes from central asia " it 's really annoying that a medical discussion has been hijacked by politics , " said ralf hüllinghorst , head of the german head office for dependency matters -lrb- dhs -rrb- who stressed that heroin administration had to made part of regular health care in germany . " if heroin maintenance has proved to be effective , we have to be able to make use of it .
heroin has to be legalized and doctors should be allowed to prescribe it like in the netherlands and in switzerland . " the matter however is far from decided .
conservative members of germany 's parliament face a challenge from their own party members on the issue at the state level . hamburg which is ruled by a cdu government said last week it was kicking off a campaign to lobby support in the upper house of parliament to amend german drug laws to legalize heroin .
frankfurt too saw a rare show of support across party lines for extending its heroin injection clinic . patients stand to lose everything as the debate rumbles on , advocates of the project warn that if the german government doesn ’ t extend the project and legalize heroin it would spell disaster for hundreds of patients . " if the clinic closes and we stop the diamorphine doses , it will make everything worse for the patients who have managed to stabilize their lives , " said karin bonorden-kleij who pointed out that most of her patients had managed to break away from a life of criminality and abuse and painstakingly build a normal life . " if you take this away from them , i fear that some will not see the point of living anymore and commit suicide .

they had much less illicit drug use , using street heroin and cocaine , and so have better health records , ” said christian haase , a hamburg-based researcher who carried out the study . lower drug crime and better health the study ’ s conclusions in favor of heroin maintenance therapy to treat the country ’ s worst addicts has been boosted by the fact that germany ’ s heroin-overdose death rate has continually plunged in the past years and is currently at its lowest level since 1989 .
in addition , cities such as hamburg , long notorious for its open drug scene near the main railway station , have managed to stem illicit drug use and lower drug crime . “ our clinic ’ s priority has been to improve the health of patients and we have made good progress with that , ” said peter heine , a spokesman for the frankfurt mayor ’ s office .
the city ’ s heroin injection clinic has seen its patients dwindle to 59 from 93 .
“ and importantly , the clinic has helped to keep addicts off the street and prevent them from resorting to illegal means to obtain the drug , ” heine added . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is estimated to have around 1,500 severe smack addicts karin bonorden-kleij , head of the heroin injection clinic in hamburg said patient numbers had dropped to 70 from an original 200 who started therapy .
most turned clean with fewer health problems , a few dropped out while some went back to the streets . bonorden-kleij said that thanks to twice daily injections of diamorphine , more than 40 of her patients now had regular jobs - which was unthinkable when they first approached the center . conservatives resist heroin maintenance despite the therapy ’ s success , heroin maintenance treatment remains highly controversial .
the injection clinics initially sparked angry protests among residents living near them , particularly in hamburg and frankfurt .
but most have since dropped their resistance . however , politicians in germany remain split on whether the project - which has already been extended once - should be renewed beyond june 2007 . in particular , the conservatives in germany ’ s current grand coalition government are against the project . though members of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the christian social union , -lrb- csu -rrb- declined requests for interviews ; their resistance to the project on ideological and financial grounds is well known . last year , they reacted furiously to a proposal to make heroin available by prescription . " these plans are n't acceptable .
the csu wo n't approve any legislation that will make the state a drug dealer , " markus söder , general secretary of the csu told daily die welt , adding there was no way " the state will pay for the junkies ' fix " when citizens were paying ever more for their health .
the heroin maintenance project has so far cost over 12 million euros . " a big chance for germany " experts however rebuff the too-expensive argument , saying that though heroin maintenance is admittedly more expensive than methadone therapy ; the benefits far outweigh the costs . " you have to look at the bigger picture .
heroin therapy is n't expensive if you take into account the indirect costs that you save in terms of improved quality of life , productivity and improved health , " hamburg researcher haase said .
he says the therapy will cost just around 10,000 euros per patient every year for the estimated small group of germany 's 1,500 severe heroin addicts . " this is a big chance for germany to take a step forward and create a modern therapy to tackle drug dependency , " haase said . legalizing heroin a sticking point the conservatives - who control the upper house of parliament and can thus block legislation - are also against changing germany ’ s drug laws to legalize heroin and approve it for medical use , a point that experts say is absolutely essential . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the opium that makes its way to the west comes from central asia " it 's really annoying that a medical discussion has been hijacked by politics , " said ralf hüllinghorst , head of the german head office for dependency matters -lrb- dhs -rrb- who stressed that heroin administration had to made part of regular health care in germany . " if heroin maintenance has proved to be effective , we have to be able to make use of it .
heroin has to be legalized and doctors should be allowed to prescribe it like in the netherlands and in switzerland . " the matter however is far from decided .
conservative members of germany 's parliament face a challenge from their own party members on the issue at the state level . hamburg which is ruled by a cdu government said last week it was kicking off a campaign to lobby support in the upper house of parliament to amend german drug laws to legalize heroin .
frankfurt too saw a rare show of support across party lines for extending its heroin injection clinic . patients stand to lose everything as the debate rumbles on , advocates of the project warn that if the german government doesn ’ t extend the project and legalize heroin it would spell disaster for hundreds of patients . " if the clinic closes and we stop the diamorphine doses , it will make everything worse for the patients who have managed to stabilize their lives , " said karin bonorden-kleij who pointed out that most of her patients had managed to break away from a life of criminality and abuse and painstakingly build a normal life .

some say the rigid stance may jeopardize the health of hundreds of patients . last week , the cities of hamburg and frankfurt warned that injection clinics where severe heroin addicts are administered free doses of the drug under medical supervision are in danger of closure by the middle of the year if the german government doesn ’ t extend their lifetime . a failure to do so wouldn ’ t just threaten the future of the clinics in hamburg and frankfurt , but also hit heroin injection centers in five other german cities where hard-core addicts can inject themselves with diamorphine , a chemically pure form of heroin .
in addition to providing clean needles , the clinics also offer crucial psychiatric support . heroin versus methadone they were all set up in 2002 under the previous german government of social democrats and greens as part of a project modeled on similar experiments in switzerland and the netherlands to find the most effective way to treat hard-core heroin addicts , help them build a relatively normal life and eventually get them to kick the habit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the heroin injection clinic in frankfurt the project compared results between a group of patients who were put on heroin maintenance therapy and another on methadone , a heroin substitute . the findings , which were published in a study last year , found that the heroin group fared much better .

government subsidies - not jobs - are to be cut back drastically and may be history as early as 2018 . germany can not afford long-term subsidies for the coal industry , economics minister michael glos told public broadcaster zdf on monday . " it 's much better to take those economic resources and invest them in more modern , renewable energies , " he added . after extensive negotiations , the premiers of north rhine-westphalia and saarland , two of germany 's particularly coal-rich regions , and representatives of the coal union and the mining conglomerate agreed sunday on a plan to phase out german coal subsidies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rüttgers said subsidy cuts were necessary in part due to inexpensive coal imports though no official deadline was set , 2018 was mentioned as the year the last check would arrive .
the situation , however , will be subject to reevaluation in 2012 , according to the wishes of the social democratic party , the junior party in the ruling grand coalition of christian and social democrats .
traditionally , the party has staunchly opposed cutting coal subsidies . politicians promise no layoffs both glos and jürgen rüttgers , premier of north rhine-westphalia , said in the zdf interview on monday that no layoffs would be made and that coal workers should n't be worried about their livelihood . " we want to make the associated restructuring of labor as tolerable as possible , " glos said . rüttgers added that investments needed to be made in new jobs that would be more secure in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 25 million tons are mined annually in germany " in reality , it 's about starting a new chapter in the history of the ruhr valley , " he said . currently , some 34,000 miners extract 25 million tons of coal annually from eight mines in germany .
state and federal governments pay up to 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- per year in coal subsidies . merkel to continue talks monday according to the agreement made sunday , subsidy cutbacks are to be financed by putting up parts of the mining conglomerate raf for an initial public offering .
the stock revenues will then be transferred to a foundation . chancellor angela merkel will continue negotiations on the future of the coal industry with the government coalition monday evening .

so far , the bundeswehr 's current mandate limits the deployment of some 3,000 german soldiers to the afghan capital kabul and the relatively safer northern part of the country . but according to a news report by german public broadcaster ard , the mission might go beyond mere reconnaissance : bundeswehr pilots are currently testing technology that would allow them to participate directly in combat missions . combat support or combat ? the " reccelite " technology allows pilots to transfer images to a ground station or fighter planes in real time .

" they added that it would really only make sense for german pilots to bombard targets themselves as they do not have the ability to transfer information wirelessly to fighter planes or ground stations in a secure way . defense ministry officials said that the " reccelite " tests had been planned for some time and that no plans so far existed to buy the technology for a potential tornado mission in afghanistan . opposition , spd concerns opposition politicians on the other hand saw the training as further evidence that the planes were meant to be used in combat missions . members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the government 's junior coalition partner , meanwhile also voiced concerns about deploying planes .

" the government will do everything it can to reach a sector-wide reduction , " merkel told a meeting of industry leaders in berlin . it was " regrettable " that european car makers would not meet the targets they had set themselves , merkel said . " but we must not let the result of that be to impose a general obligation for all cars to be subject to the same measure , " she said . " the diversity of the automobile industry must be respected , " merkel maintained . merkel said the german government would do all it could to make sure any goals in the 27-member bloc depended on the type of car . eu rejects german car industry opposition european commission president jose manuel barroso and environment commissioner stavros dimas want binding legislation that would require car makers to reduce co2 emissions of new cars to an industry average of 120 grams per km in 2012 .
that is because the auto industry is likely to miss a voluntary target to cut average co2 emissions for new cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suvs , which are increasingly found on european roads , are big polluters some german politicians have said they support such a move but others have voiced reservations . on monday , the eu commission rejected a letter from written by the heads of germany 's top five car companies over the weekend to the eu commission that warned of the risk to eu competitiveness and employment if brussels imposed binding limits on car exhaust emissions . daimlerchrysler , volkswagen , ford , bmw and opel say that if the eu plans are implemented , it will be forced to cut jobs or move them to cheaper nations as it copes with rising costs and a tougher consumer market . but a spokesman for the european commission , johannes laitenberger , said that the best way to preserve jobs was to embrace and anticipate change rather than resist it . " normally jobs are not lost when you proactively embrace change , " laitenberger said .
" we need to equip europe for globalization and our industry for the future .
neither globalization nor climate change will go away . " eu divided about emissions legislation the issue is complicated by the fact that the eu executive too is divided about the planned legislation to limit car emissions . the commission delayed a decision last week to allow more time to forge a consensus . eu environment commissioner dimas has said that he wants the burden of responsiblity to lie with carmakers .
however industry commissioner guenter verheugen , considered close to the car lobby , has suggested that car owners too should be required to stick to energy-efficient driving habits among other things . verheugen has also proposed that carmakers could be made part of the europe-wide trade in carbon emissions . that would mean that german carmakers would then not be forced to lower carbon dioxide emissions for new cars to 120 grams per kilometer by 2012 as required by the eu .
instead they could then buy emission rights from other sectors or support environmental projects in developing countries to balance out their emission record . eu spokesman laitenberger insisted monday that the eu needed a law to limit emissions for new cars , but indicated there could be room for maneuvering . " what is now under discussion is to debate and to decide on what exactly should be covered by the legislation , " he said .
" we are not driven by a day or two , or by a week or two , but by the urge to get this right . " experts say carmakers need to invest in green technology the dispute over the car industry 's responsiblity to lower emissions comes just weeks after the european union embraced a " low-carbon economy " to combat climate change by reducing its reliance on imported oil and natural gas and promote renewable sources of energy . but the eu is worried that rising carbon dioxide emissions from transportation will undermine its battle to cut greenhouse emissions on the continent . bildunterschrift : the number of cars on european roads has increased greatly in the past years according to the european environment agency , the overall level of greenhouse emissions from road transport has increased 22 percent since 1990 as the number of cars on the road rises . the european commission wants to force automakers to manufacture cars that are more environmentally friendly .
but carmakers , who say they have cut emissions by 13 percent , argue that it 's not viable for them to sell smaller cars or hybrid-fuel models . critics however say that carmakers simply are n't doing enough to develop environmentally-friendly technology . andreas troge , head of the german environment agency , warned that the german car industry was in danger of missing the boat on new green technologies which in turn could end up jeopardizing jobs . " if you 're too late in adapting , you can threaten jobs , " troge told hanover-based paper neuen presse . reinhard bütikofer , chairman of the opposition green party , urged the german car industry to view new environmental challenges as an opportunity instead of a threat .

" the government will do everything it can to reach a sector-wide reduction , " merkel told a meeting of industry leaders in berlin . it was " regrettable " that european car makers would not meet the targets they had set themselves , merkel said . " but we must not let the result of that be to impose a general obligation for all cars to be subject to the same measure , " she said .

however industry commissioner guenter verheugen , considered close to the car lobby , has suggested that car owners too should be required to stick to energy-efficient driving habits among other things . verheugen has also proposed that carmakers could be made part of the europe-wide trade in carbon emissions . that would mean that german carmakers would then not be forced to lower carbon dioxide emissions for new cars to 120 grams per kilometer by 2012 as required by the eu .

but carmakers , who say they have cut emissions by 13 percent , argue that it 's not viable for them to sell smaller cars or hybrid-fuel models . critics however say that carmakers simply are n't doing enough to develop environmentally-friendly technology . andreas troge , head of the german environment agency , warned that the german car industry was in danger of missing the boat on new green technologies which in turn could end up jeopardizing jobs . " if you 're too late in adapting , you can threaten jobs , " troge told hanover-based paper neuen presse . reinhard bütikofer , chairman of the opposition green party , urged the german car industry to view new environmental challenges as an opportunity instead of a threat .

before you pack your bag , read about some of the travel adventures other dw-world.de readers have had in germany . my husband horst and i visited bavaria this year with a band from texas .
we felt welcome and enjoyed every minute of our tour , which took us to all those famous , beautiful places .
the german people were courteous and most of them spoke english , so nobody felt stranded .
since we came from texas , we felt very comfy in bavaria . - horst and rita klauser my friend and i have made numerous trips and love it .
we were in leipzig and were going to munich .
we jumped on the train , fell asleep and awoke to the conductor .
he asked where we were going and then waved his fingers and said , " no , no , you 're going to hamburg ! "
we all got a good laugh , as we were already in berlin .
the whole train car caught the joke and came to our assistance , offering suggestions of things to see and to do while there .
we had a blast .
we travel light , with few definite plans and always end up in many fantastic places and meet tons of friendly people . - brian parks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : got beer ?

i was a tourist in berlin in 2005 and , overall , i think berliners are generally polite .
however , somewhat surprisingly , an assistant at a transport information desk was rude and dismissive towards me .
i assume it was because my german language skills are weak .
also , the receptionist at our hotel was impatient with us when we questioned him about our assigned room .
that said , i found all shopkeepers and food vendors polite , and all the locals we encountered were very friendly .
the bad experiences have not put me off , and i look forward to returning to the wonderful city of berlin in the future . - lauren , australia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one traveler meant to go to munich but ended up in berlin my favorite hotel in germany ?

it has excellent connections to cologne via light rail and bus , so no car is needed .
the bensberg pedestrian zone , an easy walk away , has bakeries and a wide variety of restaurants and shops .
we found this place by accident seven years ago and have returned every year at the end of our vacation to relax for a few days before we return home to california .

portuguese foreign minister luis amado attended as the representative of the next eu presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benita ferrero-waldner ferrero-waldner said the aim of the program was to ensure that judges " can do in the future what we take for granted " in the west . the eu funding would also go towards developing alternative crops to combat the narcotics industry in afghanistan , which is the world 's biggest opium producer . stabilizing the situation the pledge follows the announcement last week that the united states plans to spend an extra $ 10.6 billion in afghanistan over two years and to extend the tour of duty of more than 3,000 us troops there by four months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british nato soldier in kabul at washington 's urging , nato has agreed to step up military efforts in spring when taliban insurgents are expected to intensify their offensive .
fighting last year left 4,000 people dead , most of them rebels . " we believe that we need to stabilize the situation before terrorist groups can reform , " said afghan foreign minister rangeen dadfar spanta , who also attended the meeting .
" yet on the other hand we have to continue our efforts for the rural populations especially in the south . " winning over afghans german foreign minister steinmeier pointed out that dire reports of the security situation in afghanistan obscured the fact that " there has been much civilian progress in the country . "
he added that the international community had an obligation to improve the lives of ordinary afghans . " despite all our efforts to secure afghanistan , we have to win over the hearts of the afghan people , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will they benefit from the new aid package ?
the combined contribution from the joint eu budget and by eu member states to afghanistan for the period 2002-2006 was 3.7 billion euros .
the new package for the period 2007-2010 , will also focus on health , apart from rural development and the reform of the justice sector . over the next few months , the eu 's executive arm plans to place experts in key justice institutions - the justice ministry , supreme court and the attorney general 's office - to help draw up reform plans for afghanistan 's judiciary and legal services . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in berlin on monday that it was increasingly likely that eu badge-wearing police advisors would be sent to afghanistan soon .
" an eu police mission in afghanistan is very likely , " solana said in a speech to a conference on european security and defence policy which followed the aid announcement .
eu member states last week gave the green light for such a mission to support the nato-led military and reconstruction campaign in afghanistan . german experts are already helping to train afghanistan 's police force . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : german pilots train for combat in afghanistan germany is expected to decide soon on a nato request to send reconnaissance aircraft to southern afghanistan .

portuguese foreign minister luis amado attended as the representative of the next eu presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benita ferrero-waldner ferrero-waldner said the aim of the program was to ensure that judges " can do in the future what we take for granted " in the west . the eu funding would also go towards developing alternative crops to combat the narcotics industry in afghanistan , which is the world 's biggest opium producer . stabilizing the situation the pledge follows the announcement last week that the united states plans to spend an extra $ 10.6 billion in afghanistan over two years and to extend the tour of duty of more than 3,000 us troops there by four months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british nato soldier in kabul at washington 's urging , nato has agreed to step up military efforts in spring when taliban insurgents are expected to intensify their offensive .
fighting last year left 4,000 people dead , most of them rebels . " we believe that we need to stabilize the situation before terrorist groups can reform , " said afghan foreign minister rangeen dadfar spanta , who also attended the meeting .
" yet on the other hand we have to continue our efforts for the rural populations especially in the south . " winning over afghans german foreign minister steinmeier pointed out that dire reports of the security situation in afghanistan obscured the fact that " there has been much civilian progress in the country . "
he added that the international community had an obligation to improve the lives of ordinary afghans . " despite all our efforts to secure afghanistan , we have to win over the hearts of the afghan people , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will they benefit from the new aid package ?
the combined contribution from the joint eu budget and by eu member states to afghanistan for the period 2002-2006 was 3.7 billion euros .
the new package for the period 2007-2010 , will also focus on health , apart from rural development and the reform of the justice sector . over the next few months , the eu 's executive arm plans to place experts in key justice institutions - the justice ministry , supreme court and the attorney general 's office - to help draw up reform plans for afghanistan 's judiciary and legal services . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in berlin on monday that it was increasingly likely that eu badge-wearing police advisors would be sent to afghanistan soon .
" an eu police mission in afghanistan is very likely , " solana said in a speech to a conference on european security and defence policy which followed the aid announcement .
eu member states last week gave the green light for such a mission to support the nato-led military and reconstruction campaign in afghanistan . german experts are already helping to train afghanistan 's police force . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : german pilots train for combat in afghanistan germany is expected to decide soon on a nato request to send reconnaissance aircraft to southern afghanistan .

27 was holocaust memorial day in germany .
meanwhile , germany 's efforts to criminalize holocaust denial in the eu are increasing coming up against resistance .
see what other readers had to say on the matter . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the basic idea of the principle of free speech is that you have a right , issuing from your dignity as a human being , to say what you honestly think is true .
those who believe in the arguments of holocaust revisionism meet this criterion .
there is very good evidence behind these arguments and those who support them are intellectually honest .
they are not hateful propagandists .
if the eu makes holocaust denial a crime , it makes itself a criminal against classical liberalism and the dignity of man . - kendra blewitt , san francisco how can one deny the holocaust ?
it happened .
how can one not admit the existence of israel ?
there it is .
but how long do we have to cow-tow to the wishes of the israelis ?
just get over it . - james wilder , us these laws prohibiting holocaust skepticism are evil .
it is the right of a free people to question their government publicly .
the founding fathers of the united states drew upon great european thinkers and philosophers such as voltaire and john stuart mill .
european tradition is what today 's europe should espouse , not stalinist laws to placate interest groups .
i can not express the evil with which i view any law which proscribes my right to believe or not to believe in any aspect of any historical event and to publicly state my opinion . - joseph kochanek bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did nazis carry out systematic murder ?
in germany it 's a crime to say no as long as the european union does not have a common constitution approved by all its members , it will be difficult to find consensus on the criminalization of holocaust denial . - jose nigrin the german government has a moral obligation to uphold its constitution , which guarantees any of its citizens the right to free speech .
also , a murder is a crime no matter who commits it .
to exempt one group from the rest is a violation of article 14 of the un 's international covenant on civil and political rights . - rudolf pueschel passing laws that illegalize holocaust denial is a victory against freedom of speech . - brad harris to put a man at mr. zundel 's advanced age in jail is criminal to say the least .
i thought people were allowed to think .
mr. zundel chooses to think differently .
it is n't a crime .
how many people will germany put in jail for thinking or writing books ?
shame ! - sheila fox merely expressing one 's opinion or belief , or even ignorance , will not change what has already happened and will also not make a non-occurrence an occurrence .
in this light , such a ban is laughable and infantile .
it also shows that the eu is held hostage by jewish groups and lobbies .
moreover , it is now 2007 and everyone has got over the world war two itch , other than germany , that is .
there are far more pressing issues to be taken care of than this pet obsession .
if the government wants to be a stooge to the jewish lobby , then it is up to its members to decide , but it can at no point of time force others to subscribe to its point of view . - suvrajit saha bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria , belgium , france , germany , poland , romania and spain already have laws against holocaust denial sixty years after the war 's end , nazism is again rearing its ugly head : jailing people for their speech , laws against free thought and burning books .
how can you people be so stupid ?
do you really think you are any different then hitler ? - lynda , uk what the hell is wrong with germany ?
they have been sitting around like a whipped puppy since world war two .
germany needs to openly look at the issue of the holocaust .
there is sufficient evidence that all the claims are not true .
germany has zero national pride .
you need to act like the father land and stand strong and see to what is best for your nation .
you have so much to offer god 's world .
you first need to break this " holocaust poison " that has ruined your spirit as a people . - andrew compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's pursuit of holocaust denial resolution hits skids germany 's hope of using its eu presidency to persuade all 27 member states to make holocaust denial a crime has received a setback in italy and is expected to run into more resistance .

some say the rigid stance may jeopardize the health of hundreds of patients . last week , the cities of hamburg and frankfurt warned that injection clinics where severe heroin addicts are administered free doses of the drug under medical supervision are in danger of closure by the middle of the year if the german government doesn ’ t extend their lifetime . a failure to do so wouldn ’ t just threaten the future of the clinics in hamburg and frankfurt , but also hit heroin injection centers in five other german cities where hard-core addicts can inject themselves with diamorphine , a chemically pure form of heroin .
in addition to providing clean needles , the clinics also offer crucial psychiatric support . heroin versus methadone they were all set up in 2002 under the previous german government of social democrats and greens as part of a project modeled on similar experiments in switzerland and the netherlands to find the most effective way to treat hard-core heroin addicts , help them build a relatively normal life and eventually get them to kick the habit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the heroin injection clinic in frankfurt the project compared results between a group of patients who were put on heroin maintenance therapy and another on methadone , a heroin substitute . the findings , which were published in a study last year , found that the heroin group fared much better . " those on heroin stayed in treatment longer and the drop out is much less than the methadone group .
they had much less illicit drug use , using street heroin and cocaine , and so have better health records , ” said christian haase , a hamburg-based researcher who carried out the study . lower drug crime and better health the study ’ s conclusions in favor of heroin maintenance therapy to treat the country ’ s worst addicts has been boosted by the fact that germany ’ s heroin-overdose death rate has continually plunged in the past years and is currently at its lowest level since 1989 .
in addition , cities such as hamburg , long notorious for its open drug scene near the main railway station , have managed to stem illicit drug use and lower drug crime . “ our clinic ’ s priority has been to improve the health of patients and we have made good progress with that , ” said peter heine , a spokesman for the frankfurt mayor ’ s office .
the city ’ s heroin injection clinic has seen its patients dwindle to 59 from 93 .
“ and importantly , the clinic has helped to keep addicts off the street and prevent them from resorting to illegal means to obtain the drug , ” heine added . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is estimated to have around 1,500 severe smack addicts karin bonorden-kleij , head of the heroin injection clinic in hamburg said patient numbers had dropped to 70 from an original 200 who started therapy .
most turned clean with fewer health problems , a few dropped out while some went back to the streets . bonorden-kleij said that thanks to twice daily injections of diamorphine , more than 40 of her patients now had regular jobs - which was unthinkable when they first approached the center . conservatives resist heroin maintenance despite the therapy ’ s success , heroin maintenance treatment remains highly controversial .
the injection clinics initially sparked angry protests among residents living near them , particularly in hamburg and frankfurt .
but most have since dropped their resistance . however , politicians in germany remain split on whether the project - which has already been extended once - should be renewed beyond june 2007 . in particular , the conservatives in germany ’ s current grand coalition government are against the project . though members of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the christian social union , -lrb- csu -rrb- declined requests for interviews ; their resistance to the project on ideological and financial grounds is well known . last year , they reacted furiously to a proposal to make heroin available by prescription . " these plans are n't acceptable .
the csu wo n't approve any legislation that will make the state a drug dealer , " markus söder , general secretary of the csu told daily die welt , adding there was no way " the state will pay for the junkies ' fix " when citizens were paying ever more for their health .
the heroin maintenance project has so far cost over 12 million euros . " a big chance for germany " experts however rebuff the too-expensive argument , saying that though heroin maintenance is admittedly more expensive than methadone therapy ; the benefits far outweigh the costs . " you have to look at the bigger picture .
heroin therapy is n't expensive if you take into account the indirect costs that you save in terms of improved quality of life , productivity and improved health , " hamburg researcher haase said .
he says the therapy will cost just around 10,000 euros per patient every year for the estimated small group of germany 's 1,500 severe heroin addicts . " this is a big chance for germany to take a step forward and create a modern therapy to tackle drug dependency , " haase said . legalizing heroin a sticking point the conservatives - who control the upper house of parliament and can thus block legislation - are also against changing germany ’ s drug laws to legalize heroin and approve it for medical use , a point that experts say is absolutely essential . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the opium that makes its way to the west comes from central asia " it 's really annoying that a medical discussion has been hijacked by politics , " said ralf hüllinghorst , head of the german head office for dependency matters -lrb- dhs -rrb- who stressed that heroin administration had to made part of regular health care in germany . " if heroin maintenance has proved to be effective , we have to be able to make use of it .
heroin has to be legalized and doctors should be allowed to prescribe it like in the netherlands and in switzerland . " the matter however is far from decided .
conservative members of germany 's parliament face a challenge from their own party members on the issue at the state level . hamburg which is ruled by a cdu government said last week it was kicking off a campaign to lobby support in the upper house of parliament to amend german drug laws to legalize heroin .
frankfurt too saw a rare show of support across party lines for extending its heroin injection clinic . patients stand to lose everything as the debate rumbles on , advocates of the project warn that if the german government doesn ’ t extend the project and legalize heroin it would spell disaster for hundreds of patients . " if the clinic closes and we stop the diamorphine doses , it will make everything worse for the patients who have managed to stabilize their lives , " said karin bonorden-kleij who pointed out that most of her patients had managed to break away from a life of criminality and abuse and painstakingly build a normal life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 29.01.2007 amid debate , germany 's heroin injection clinics fight to survive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for severe addicts , the injection clinics could prove life-saving germany 's conservatives are opposed to liberalizing heroin and giving free doses to the country 's worst addicts .
some say the rigid stance may jeopardize the health of hundreds of patients . last week , the cities of hamburg and frankfurt warned that injection clinics where severe heroin addicts are administered free doses of the drug under medical supervision are in danger of closure by the middle of the year if the german government doesn ’ t extend their lifetime . a failure to do so wouldn ’ t just threaten the future of the clinics in hamburg and frankfurt , but also hit heroin injection centers in five other german cities where hard-core addicts can inject themselves with diamorphine , a chemically pure form of heroin .
in addition to providing clean needles , the clinics also offer crucial psychiatric support . heroin versus methadone they were all set up in 2002 under the previous german government of social democrats and greens as part of a project modeled on similar experiments in switzerland and the netherlands to find the most effective way to treat hard-core heroin addicts , help them build a relatively normal life and eventually get them to kick the habit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the heroin injection clinic in frankfurt the project compared results between a group of patients who were put on heroin maintenance therapy and another on methadone , a heroin substitute . the findings , which were published in a study last year , found that the heroin group fared much better . " those on heroin stayed in treatment longer and the drop out is much less than the methadone group .
they had much less illicit drug use , using street heroin and cocaine , and so have better health records , ” said christian haase , a hamburg-based researcher who carried out the study . lower drug crime and better health the study ’ s conclusions in favor of heroin maintenance therapy to treat the country ’ s worst addicts has been boosted by the fact that germany ’ s heroin-overdose death rate has continually plunged in the past years and is currently at its lowest level since 1989 .
in addition , cities such as hamburg , long notorious for its open drug scene near the main railway station , have managed to stem illicit drug use and lower drug crime . “ our clinic ’ s priority has been to improve the health of patients and we have made good progress with that , ” said peter heine , a spokesman for the frankfurt mayor ’ s office .
the city ’ s heroin injection clinic has seen its patients dwindle to 59 from 93 .
“ and importantly , the clinic has helped to keep addicts off the street and prevent them from resorting to illegal means to obtain the drug , ” heine added . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is estimated to have around 1,500 severe smack addicts karin bonorden-kleij , head of the heroin injection clinic in hamburg said patient numbers had dropped to 70 from an original 200 who started therapy .
most turned clean with fewer health problems , a few dropped out while some went back to the streets . bonorden-kleij said that thanks to twice daily injections of diamorphine , more than 40 of her patients now had regular jobs - which was unthinkable when they first approached the center . conservatives resist heroin maintenance despite the therapy ’ s success , heroin maintenance treatment remains highly controversial .
the injection clinics initially sparked angry protests among residents living near them , particularly in hamburg and frankfurt .
but most have since dropped their resistance . however , politicians in germany remain split on whether the project - which has already been extended once - should be renewed beyond june 2007 . in particular , the conservatives in germany ’ s current grand coalition government are against the project . though members of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the christian social union , -lrb- csu -rrb- declined requests for interviews ; their resistance to the project on ideological and financial grounds is well known . last year , they reacted furiously to a proposal to make heroin available by prescription . " these plans are n't acceptable .
the csu wo n't approve any legislation that will make the state a drug dealer , " markus söder , general secretary of the csu told daily die welt , adding there was no way " the state will pay for the junkies ' fix " when citizens were paying ever more for their health .
the heroin maintenance project has so far cost over 12 million euros . " a big chance for germany " experts however rebuff the too-expensive argument , saying that though heroin maintenance is admittedly more expensive than methadone therapy ; the benefits far outweigh the costs . " you have to look at the bigger picture .
heroin therapy is n't expensive if you take into account the indirect costs that you save in terms of improved quality of life , productivity and improved health , " hamburg researcher haase said .
he says the therapy will cost just around 10,000 euros per patient every year for the estimated small group of germany 's 1,500 severe heroin addicts . " this is a big chance for germany to take a step forward and create a modern therapy to tackle drug dependency , " haase said . legalizing heroin a sticking point the conservatives - who control the upper house of parliament and can thus block legislation - are also against changing germany ’ s drug laws to legalize heroin and approve it for medical use , a point that experts say is absolutely essential . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the opium that makes its way to the west comes from central asia " it 's really annoying that a medical discussion has been hijacked by politics , " said ralf hüllinghorst , head of the german head office for dependency matters -lrb- dhs -rrb- who stressed that heroin administration had to made part of regular health care in germany . " if heroin maintenance has proved to be effective , we have to be able to make use of it .
heroin has to be legalized and doctors should be allowed to prescribe it like in the netherlands and in switzerland . " the matter however is far from decided .
conservative members of germany 's parliament face a challenge from their own party members on the issue at the state level . hamburg which is ruled by a cdu government said last week it was kicking off a campaign to lobby support in the upper house of parliament to amend german drug laws to legalize heroin .
frankfurt too saw a rare show of support across party lines for extending its heroin injection clinic . patients stand to lose everything as the debate rumbles on , advocates of the project warn that if the german government doesn ’ t extend the project and legalize heroin it would spell disaster for hundreds of patients . " if the clinic closes and we stop the diamorphine doses , it will make everything worse for the patients who have managed to stabilize their lives , " said karin bonorden-kleij who pointed out that most of her patients had managed to break away from a life of criminality and abuse and painstakingly build a normal life . " if you take this away from them , i fear that some will not see the point of living anymore and commit suicide .

before you pack your bag , read about some of the travel adventures other dw-world.de readers have had in germany . my husband horst and i visited bavaria this year with a band from texas .
we felt welcome and enjoyed every minute of our tour , which took us to all those famous , beautiful places .
the german people were courteous and most of them spoke english , so nobody felt stranded .
since we came from texas , we felt very comfy in bavaria . - horst and rita klauser my friend and i have made numerous trips and love it .
we were in leipzig and were going to munich .
we jumped on the train , fell asleep and awoke to the conductor .
he asked where we were going and then waved his fingers and said , " no , no , you 're going to hamburg ! "
we all got a good laugh , as we were already in berlin .
the whole train car caught the joke and came to our assistance , offering suggestions of things to see and to do while there .
we had a blast .
we travel light , with few definite plans and always end up in many fantastic places and meet tons of friendly people . - brian parks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : got beer ?
oberau by berchtesgaden is a choice spot for any vacation . - phil raasch i read the article regarding the politeness of berliners -lrb- 22.06.2006 -rrb- and can share my mixed experiences .
i was a tourist in berlin in 2005 and , overall , i think berliners are generally polite .
however , somewhat surprisingly , an assistant at a transport information desk was rude and dismissive towards me .
i assume it was because my german language skills are weak .
also , the receptionist at our hotel was impatient with us when we questioned him about our assigned room .
that said , i found all shopkeepers and food vendors polite , and all the locals we encountered were very friendly .
the bad experiences have not put me off , and i look forward to returning to the wonderful city of berlin in the future . - lauren , australia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one traveler meant to go to munich but ended up in berlin my favorite hotel in germany ?
this would be the wald hotel manngold in bergisch gladbach outside of cologne .
it is a small , third generation family-run hotel with tasteful , comfortable rooms and wonderful service .
if the restaurant does n't have five stars , then it 's under-rated !
it has a beautiful view of the castle at night and sits on the edge of a expansive woods covered with hiking trails .
it has excellent connections to cologne via light rail and bus , so no car is needed .
the bensberg pedestrian zone , an easy walk away , has bakeries and a wide variety of restaurants and shops .
we found this place by accident seven years ago and have returned every year at the end of our vacation to relax for a few days before we return home to california .
we have never been disappointed . - dr. john j. wicks marzipan , goulash soup , beer and the bratwurst on the market square bring back fond memories of many visits to germany . - ben , dallas , texas compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german travel adventures from dw-world.de readers planning a trip to germany in 2007 ?

we were in leipzig and were going to munich .
we jumped on the train , fell asleep and awoke to the conductor .
he asked where we were going and then waved his fingers and said , " no , no , you 're going to hamburg ! "
we all got a good laugh , as we were already in berlin .

" the government will do everything it can to reach a sector-wide reduction , " merkel told a meeting of industry leaders in berlin . it was " regrettable " that european car makers would not meet the targets they had set themselves , merkel said . " but we must not let the result of that be to impose a general obligation for all cars to be subject to the same measure , " she said . " the diversity of the automobile industry must be respected , " merkel maintained . merkel said the german government would do all it could to make sure any goals in the 27-member bloc depended on the type of car . eu rejects german car industry opposition european commission president jose manuel barroso and environment commissioner stavros dimas want binding legislation that would require car makers to reduce co2 emissions of new cars to an industry average of 120 grams per km in 2012 .
that is because the auto industry is likely to miss a voluntary target to cut average co2 emissions for new cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suvs , which are increasingly found on european roads , are big polluters some german politicians have said they support such a move but others have voiced reservations . on monday , the eu commission rejected a letter from written by the heads of germany 's top five car companies over the weekend to the eu commission that warned of the risk to eu competitiveness and employment if brussels imposed binding limits on car exhaust emissions . daimlerchrysler , volkswagen , ford , bmw and opel say that if the eu plans are implemented , it will be forced to cut jobs or move them to cheaper nations as it copes with rising costs and a tougher consumer market . but a spokesman for the european commission , johannes laitenberger , said that the best way to preserve jobs was to embrace and anticipate change rather than resist it . " normally jobs are not lost when you proactively embrace change , " laitenberger said .
" we need to equip europe for globalization and our industry for the future .
neither globalization nor climate change will go away . " eu divided about emissions legislation the issue is complicated by the fact that the eu executive too is divided about the planned legislation to limit car emissions . the commission delayed a decision last week to allow more time to forge a consensus . eu environment commissioner dimas has said that he wants the burden of responsiblity to lie with carmakers .
however industry commissioner guenter verheugen , considered close to the car lobby , has suggested that car owners too should be required to stick to energy-efficient driving habits among other things . verheugen has also proposed that carmakers could be made part of the europe-wide trade in carbon emissions . that would mean that german carmakers would then not be forced to lower carbon dioxide emissions for new cars to 120 grams per kilometer by 2012 as required by the eu .
instead they could then buy emission rights from other sectors or support environmental projects in developing countries to balance out their emission record . eu spokesman laitenberger insisted monday that the eu needed a law to limit emissions for new cars , but indicated there could be room for maneuvering . " what is now under discussion is to debate and to decide on what exactly should be covered by the legislation , " he said .
" we are not driven by a day or two , or by a week or two , but by the urge to get this right . " experts say carmakers need to invest in green technology the dispute over the car industry 's responsiblity to lower emissions comes just weeks after the european union embraced a " low-carbon economy " to combat climate change by reducing its reliance on imported oil and natural gas and promote renewable sources of energy . but the eu is worried that rising carbon dioxide emissions from transportation will undermine its battle to cut greenhouse emissions on the continent . bildunterschrift : the number of cars on european roads has increased greatly in the past years according to the european environment agency , the overall level of greenhouse emissions from road transport has increased 22 percent since 1990 as the number of cars on the road rises . the european commission wants to force automakers to manufacture cars that are more environmentally friendly .
but carmakers , who say they have cut emissions by 13 percent , argue that it 's not viable for them to sell smaller cars or hybrid-fuel models . critics however say that carmakers simply are n't doing enough to develop environmentally-friendly technology . andreas troge , head of the german environment agency , warned that the german car industry was in danger of missing the boat on new green technologies which in turn could end up jeopardizing jobs . " if you 're too late in adapting , you can threaten jobs , " troge told hanover-based paper neuen presse . reinhard bütikofer , chairman of the opposition green party , urged the german car industry to view new environmental challenges as an opportunity instead of a threat . " the car industry has to watch out that it does n't throw away its future , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de expert : most alpine glaciers gone in 30 years rising temperatures will cause a rapid melting of europe 's glaciers and have most of them disappear within three decades , according to an expert .

" the government will do everything it can to reach a sector-wide reduction , " merkel told a meeting of industry leaders in berlin . it was " regrettable " that european car makers would not meet the targets they had set themselves , merkel said .

however industry commissioner guenter verheugen , considered close to the car lobby , has suggested that car owners too should be required to stick to energy-efficient driving habits among other things . verheugen has also proposed that carmakers could be made part of the europe-wide trade in carbon emissions . that would mean that german carmakers would then not be forced to lower carbon dioxide emissions for new cars to 120 grams per kilometer by 2012 as required by the eu .
instead they could then buy emission rights from other sectors or support environmental projects in developing countries to balance out their emission record . eu spokesman laitenberger insisted monday that the eu needed a law to limit emissions for new cars , but indicated there could be room for maneuvering .

but carmakers , who say they have cut emissions by 13 percent , argue that it 's not viable for them to sell smaller cars or hybrid-fuel models . critics however say that carmakers simply are n't doing enough to develop environmentally-friendly technology . andreas troge , head of the german environment agency , warned that the german car industry was in danger of missing the boat on new green technologies which in turn could end up jeopardizing jobs . " if you 're too late in adapting , you can threaten jobs , " troge told hanover-based paper neuen presse . reinhard bütikofer , chairman of the opposition green party , urged the german car industry to view new environmental challenges as an opportunity instead of a threat .

germany is expected to decide soon on a nato request to send reconnaissance aircraft to southern afghanistan .
according to a news report , german pilots may be preparing for more than that , however . germany is expected to decide soon on a nato request to send reconnaissance aircraft to southern afghanistan .
but , according to a news report , german pilots may be preparing for more than that . on wednesday , germany 's cabinet will most likely give the green light to deploying six tornado surveillance planes to help alliance forces in the dangerous southern regions of afghanistan . germany 's bundestag , which has to give final approval , is mulling the plan next week .
so far , the bundeswehr 's current mandate limits the deployment of some 3,000 german soldiers to the afghan capital kabul and the relatively safer northern part of the country . but according to a news report by german public broadcaster ard , the mission might go beyond mere reconnaissance : bundeswehr pilots are currently testing technology that would allow them to participate directly in combat missions . combat support or combat ? the " reccelite " technology allows pilots to transfer images to a ground station or fighter planes in real time .

germany is expected to decide soon on a nato request to send reconnaissance aircraft to southern afghanistan .
according to a news report , german pilots may be preparing for more than that , however . germany is expected to decide soon on a nato request to send reconnaissance aircraft to southern afghanistan .
but , according to a news report , german pilots may be preparing for more than that . on wednesday , germany 's cabinet will most likely give the green light to deploying six tornado surveillance planes to help alliance forces in the dangerous southern regions of afghanistan . germany 's bundestag , which has to give final approval , is mulling the plan next week .
so far , the bundeswehr 's current mandate limits the deployment of some 3,000 german soldiers to the afghan capital kabul and the relatively safer northern part of the country . but according to a news report by german public broadcaster ard , the mission might go beyond mere reconnaissance : bundeswehr pilots are currently testing technology that would allow them to participate directly in combat missions . combat support or combat ? the " reccelite " technology allows pilots to transfer images to a ground station or fighter planes in real time .
this allows so-called " close-air-support " operations , which make it possible to identify and bombard moving targets in a quick and precise way . bildunterschrift : the ard report quoted pilots , who said that they had received orders from " the highest position " to acquire the skills for such missions " very quickly . " they added that it would really only make sense for german pilots to bombard targets themselves as they do not have the ability to transfer information wirelessly to fighter planes or ground stations in a secure way . defense ministry officials said that the " reccelite " tests had been planned for some time and that no plans so far existed to buy the technology for a potential tornado mission in afghanistan . opposition , spd concerns opposition politicians on the other hand saw the training as further evidence that the planes were meant to be used in combat missions . members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the government 's junior coalition partner , meanwhile also voiced concerns about deploying planes . " we have to do everything to prevent being pulled into an escalating combat situation , " said gert weisskirchen , the spd 's foreign affairs spokesman in parliament . but spd defense policy expert hans-peter bartels countered that germany was already involved in combat operations in afghanistan . " it would be hypocritical to say that we germans have nothing to do with conducting war in afghanistan , " he said . spd leader kurt beck said he expected germany to approve the request to send tornado planes . " germany has to live up to the task , " he said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de peace still elusive after five years in afghanistan german soldiers began patrolling the streets of kabul as part of the un 's peacekeeping mission on jan .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the basic idea of the principle of free speech is that you have a right , issuing from your dignity as a human being , to say what you honestly think is true .
those who believe in the arguments of holocaust revisionism meet this criterion .
there is very good evidence behind these arguments and those who support them are intellectually honest .
they are not hateful propagandists .
if the eu makes holocaust denial a crime , it makes itself a criminal against classical liberalism and the dignity of man . - kendra blewitt , san francisco how can one deny the holocaust ?
it happened .
how can one not admit the existence of israel ?
there it is .
but how long do we have to cow-tow to the wishes of the israelis ?
just get over it . - james wilder , us these laws prohibiting holocaust skepticism are evil .
it is the right of a free people to question their government publicly .
the founding fathers of the united states drew upon great european thinkers and philosophers such as voltaire and john stuart mill .
european tradition is what today 's europe should espouse , not stalinist laws to placate interest groups .
i can not express the evil with which i view any law which proscribes my right to believe or not to believe in any aspect of any historical event and to publicly state my opinion . - joseph kochanek bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did nazis carry out systematic murder ?
in germany it 's a crime to say no as long as the european union does not have a common constitution approved by all its members , it will be difficult to find consensus on the criminalization of holocaust denial . - jose nigrin the german government has a moral obligation to uphold its constitution , which guarantees any of its citizens the right to free speech .
also , a murder is a crime no matter who commits it .
to exempt one group from the rest is a violation of article 14 of the un 's international covenant on civil and political rights . - rudolf pueschel passing laws that illegalize holocaust denial is a victory against freedom of speech . - brad harris to put a man at mr. zundel 's advanced age in jail is criminal to say the least .
i thought people were allowed to think .
mr. zundel chooses to think differently .
it is n't a crime .
how many people will germany put in jail for thinking or writing books ?
shame ! - sheila fox merely expressing one 's opinion or belief , or even ignorance , will not change what has already happened and will also not make a non-occurrence an occurrence .
in this light , such a ban is laughable and infantile .
it also shows that the eu is held hostage by jewish groups and lobbies .
moreover , it is now 2007 and everyone has got over the world war two itch , other than germany , that is .
there are far more pressing issues to be taken care of than this pet obsession .
if the government wants to be a stooge to the jewish lobby , then it is up to its members to decide , but it can at no point of time force others to subscribe to its point of view . - suvrajit saha bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria , belgium , france , germany , poland , romania and spain already have laws against holocaust denial sixty years after the war 's end , nazism is again rearing its ugly head : jailing people for their speech , laws against free thought and burning books .

germany needs to openly look at the issue of the holocaust .
there is sufficient evidence that all the claims are not true .

government subsidies - not jobs - are to be cut back drastically and may be history as early as 2018 . germany can not afford long-term subsidies for the coal industry , economics minister michael glos told public broadcaster zdf on monday . " it 's much better to take those economic resources and invest them in more modern , renewable energies , " he added . after extensive negotiations , the premiers of north rhine-westphalia and saarland , two of germany 's particularly coal-rich regions , and representatives of the coal union and the mining conglomerate agreed sunday on a plan to phase out german coal subsidies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rüttgers said subsidy cuts were necessary in part due to inexpensive coal imports though no official deadline was set , 2018 was mentioned as the year the last check would arrive .

state and federal governments pay up to 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- per year in coal subsidies . merkel to continue talks monday according to the agreement made sunday , subsidy cutbacks are to be financed by putting up parts of the mining conglomerate raf for an initial public offering .
the stock revenues will then be transferred to a foundation . chancellor angela merkel will continue negotiations on the future of the coal industry with the government coalition monday evening .

-lrb- 22.01.2007 -rrb- germany debates the future of coal mining some say the german mining industry is squandering too much money and that production should cease as soon as possible , whereas others argue that coal is the energy source of the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 29.01.2007 readers debate criminalizing holocaust denial in the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors came to the holocaust memorial in berlin saturday for the national memorial day jan .
27 was holocaust memorial day in germany .
meanwhile , germany 's efforts to criminalize holocaust denial in the eu are increasing coming up against resistance .
see what other readers had to say on the matter . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the basic idea of the principle of free speech is that you have a right , issuing from your dignity as a human being , to say what you honestly think is true .
those who believe in the arguments of holocaust revisionism meet this criterion .
there is very good evidence behind these arguments and those who support them are intellectually honest .
they are not hateful propagandists .
if the eu makes holocaust denial a crime , it makes itself a criminal against classical liberalism and the dignity of man . - kendra blewitt , san francisco how can one deny the holocaust ?
it happened .
how can one not admit the existence of israel ?
there it is .
but how long do we have to cow-tow to the wishes of the israelis ?
just get over it . - james wilder , us these laws prohibiting holocaust skepticism are evil .
it is the right of a free people to question their government publicly .
the founding fathers of the united states drew upon great european thinkers and philosophers such as voltaire and john stuart mill .
european tradition is what today 's europe should espouse , not stalinist laws to placate interest groups .
i can not express the evil with which i view any law which proscribes my right to believe or not to believe in any aspect of any historical event and to publicly state my opinion . - joseph kochanek bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did nazis carry out systematic murder ?
in germany it 's a crime to say no as long as the european union does not have a common constitution approved by all its members , it will be difficult to find consensus on the criminalization of holocaust denial . - jose nigrin the german government has a moral obligation to uphold its constitution , which guarantees any of its citizens the right to free speech .
also , a murder is a crime no matter who commits it .
to exempt one group from the rest is a violation of article 14 of the un 's international covenant on civil and political rights . - rudolf pueschel passing laws that illegalize holocaust denial is a victory against freedom of speech . - brad harris to put a man at mr. zundel 's advanced age in jail is criminal to say the least .
i thought people were allowed to think .
mr. zundel chooses to think differently .
it is n't a crime .
how many people will germany put in jail for thinking or writing books ?
shame ! - sheila fox merely expressing one 's opinion or belief , or even ignorance , will not change what has already happened and will also not make a non-occurrence an occurrence .
in this light , such a ban is laughable and infantile .
it also shows that the eu is held hostage by jewish groups and lobbies .
moreover , it is now 2007 and everyone has got over the world war two itch , other than germany , that is .
there are far more pressing issues to be taken care of than this pet obsession .
if the government wants to be a stooge to the jewish lobby , then it is up to its members to decide , but it can at no point of time force others to subscribe to its point of view . - suvrajit saha bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria , belgium , france , germany , poland , romania and spain already have laws against holocaust denial sixty years after the war 's end , nazism is again rearing its ugly head : jailing people for their speech , laws against free thought and burning books .
how can you people be so stupid ?
do you really think you are any different then hitler ? - lynda , uk what the hell is wrong with germany ?
they have been sitting around like a whipped puppy since world war two .
germany needs to openly look at the issue of the holocaust .
there is sufficient evidence that all the claims are not true .
germany has zero national pride .
you need to act like the father land and stand strong and see to what is best for your nation .
you have so much to offer god 's world .
you first need to break this " holocaust poison " that has ruined your spirit as a people . - andrew compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's pursuit of holocaust denial resolution hits skids germany 's hope of using its eu presidency to persuade all 27 member states to make holocaust denial a crime has received a setback in italy and is expected to run into more resistance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 29.01.2007 amid debate , germany 's heroin injection clinics fight to survive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for severe addicts , the injection clinics could prove life-saving germany 's conservatives are opposed to liberalizing heroin and giving free doses to the country 's worst addicts .
some say the rigid stance may jeopardize the health of hundreds of patients . last week , the cities of hamburg and frankfurt warned that injection clinics where severe heroin addicts are administered free doses of the drug under medical supervision are in danger of closure by the middle of the year if the german government doesn ’ t extend their lifetime . a failure to do so wouldn ’ t just threaten the future of the clinics in hamburg and frankfurt , but also hit heroin injection centers in five other german cities where hard-core addicts can inject themselves with diamorphine , a chemically pure form of heroin .
in addition to providing clean needles , the clinics also offer crucial psychiatric support . heroin versus methadone they were all set up in 2002 under the previous german government of social democrats and greens as part of a project modeled on similar experiments in switzerland and the netherlands to find the most effective way to treat hard-core heroin addicts , help them build a relatively normal life and eventually get them to kick the habit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the heroin injection clinic in frankfurt the project compared results between a group of patients who were put on heroin maintenance therapy and another on methadone , a heroin substitute . the findings , which were published in a study last year , found that the heroin group fared much better . " those on heroin stayed in treatment longer and the drop out is much less than the methadone group .
they had much less illicit drug use , using street heroin and cocaine , and so have better health records , ” said christian haase , a hamburg-based researcher who carried out the study . lower drug crime and better health the study ’ s conclusions in favor of heroin maintenance therapy to treat the country ’ s worst addicts has been boosted by the fact that germany ’ s heroin-overdose death rate has continually plunged in the past years and is currently at its lowest level since 1989 .
in addition , cities such as hamburg , long notorious for its open drug scene near the main railway station , have managed to stem illicit drug use and lower drug crime . “ our clinic ’ s priority has been to improve the health of patients and we have made good progress with that , ” said peter heine , a spokesman for the frankfurt mayor ’ s office .
the city ’ s heroin injection clinic has seen its patients dwindle to 59 from 93 .
“ and importantly , the clinic has helped to keep addicts off the street and prevent them from resorting to illegal means to obtain the drug , ” heine added . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is estimated to have around 1,500 severe smack addicts karin bonorden-kleij , head of the heroin injection clinic in hamburg said patient numbers had dropped to 70 from an original 200 who started therapy .
most turned clean with fewer health problems , a few dropped out while some went back to the streets . bonorden-kleij said that thanks to twice daily injections of diamorphine , more than 40 of her patients now had regular jobs - which was unthinkable when they first approached the center . conservatives resist heroin maintenance despite the therapy ’ s success , heroin maintenance treatment remains highly controversial .
the injection clinics initially sparked angry protests among residents living near them , particularly in hamburg and frankfurt .
but most have since dropped their resistance . however , politicians in germany remain split on whether the project - which has already been extended once - should be renewed beyond june 2007 . in particular , the conservatives in germany ’ s current grand coalition government are against the project . though members of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the christian social union , -lrb- csu -rrb- declined requests for interviews ; their resistance to the project on ideological and financial grounds is well known . last year , they reacted furiously to a proposal to make heroin available by prescription . " these plans are n't acceptable .
the csu wo n't approve any legislation that will make the state a drug dealer , " markus söder , general secretary of the csu told daily die welt , adding there was no way " the state will pay for the junkies ' fix " when citizens were paying ever more for their health .
the heroin maintenance project has so far cost over 12 million euros . " a big chance for germany " experts however rebuff the too-expensive argument , saying that though heroin maintenance is admittedly more expensive than methadone therapy ; the benefits far outweigh the costs . " you have to look at the bigger picture .
heroin therapy is n't expensive if you take into account the indirect costs that you save in terms of improved quality of life , productivity and improved health , " hamburg researcher haase said .
he says the therapy will cost just around 10,000 euros per patient every year for the estimated small group of germany 's 1,500 severe heroin addicts . " this is a big chance for germany to take a step forward and create a modern therapy to tackle drug dependency , " haase said . legalizing heroin a sticking point the conservatives - who control the upper house of parliament and can thus block legislation - are also against changing germany ’ s drug laws to legalize heroin and approve it for medical use , a point that experts say is absolutely essential . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the opium that makes its way to the west comes from central asia " it 's really annoying that a medical discussion has been hijacked by politics , " said ralf hüllinghorst , head of the german head office for dependency matters -lrb- dhs -rrb- who stressed that heroin administration had to made part of regular health care in germany . " if heroin maintenance has proved to be effective , we have to be able to make use of it .
heroin has to be legalized and doctors should be allowed to prescribe it like in the netherlands and in switzerland . " the matter however is far from decided .
conservative members of germany 's parliament face a challenge from their own party members on the issue at the state level . hamburg which is ruled by a cdu government said last week it was kicking off a campaign to lobby support in the upper house of parliament to amend german drug laws to legalize heroin .
frankfurt too saw a rare show of support across party lines for extending its heroin injection clinic . patients stand to lose everything as the debate rumbles on , advocates of the project warn that if the german government doesn ’ t extend the project and legalize heroin it would spell disaster for hundreds of patients . " if the clinic closes and we stop the diamorphine doses , it will make everything worse for the patients who have managed to stabilize their lives , " said karin bonorden-kleij who pointed out that most of her patients had managed to break away from a life of criminality and abuse and painstakingly build a normal life .

some say the rigid stance may jeopardize the health of hundreds of patients . last week , the cities of hamburg and frankfurt warned that injection clinics where severe heroin addicts are administered free doses of the drug under medical supervision are in danger of closure by the middle of the year if the german government doesn ’ t extend their lifetime . a failure to do so wouldn ’ t just threaten the future of the clinics in hamburg and frankfurt , but also hit heroin injection centers in five other german cities where hard-core addicts can inject themselves with diamorphine , a chemically pure form of heroin .
in addition to providing clean needles , the clinics also offer crucial psychiatric support . heroin versus methadone they were all set up in 2002 under the previous german government of social democrats and greens as part of a project modeled on similar experiments in switzerland and the netherlands to find the most effective way to treat hard-core heroin addicts , help them build a relatively normal life and eventually get them to kick the habit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the heroin injection clinic in frankfurt the project compared results between a group of patients who were put on heroin maintenance therapy and another on methadone , a heroin substitute . the findings , which were published in a study last year , found that the heroin group fared much better . " those on heroin stayed in treatment longer and the drop out is much less than the methadone group .
they had much less illicit drug use , using street heroin and cocaine , and so have better health records , ” said christian haase , a hamburg-based researcher who carried out the study . lower drug crime and better health the study ’ s conclusions in favor of heroin maintenance therapy to treat the country ’ s worst addicts has been boosted by the fact that germany ’ s heroin-overdose death rate has continually plunged in the past years and is currently at its lowest level since 1989 .
in addition , cities such as hamburg , long notorious for its open drug scene near the main railway station , have managed to stem illicit drug use and lower drug crime . “ our clinic ’ s priority has been to improve the health of patients and we have made good progress with that , ” said peter heine , a spokesman for the frankfurt mayor ’ s office .
the city ’ s heroin injection clinic has seen its patients dwindle to 59 from 93 .
“ and importantly , the clinic has helped to keep addicts off the street and prevent them from resorting to illegal means to obtain the drug , ” heine added . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is estimated to have around 1,500 severe smack addicts karin bonorden-kleij , head of the heroin injection clinic in hamburg said patient numbers had dropped to 70 from an original 200 who started therapy .
most turned clean with fewer health problems , a few dropped out while some went back to the streets . bonorden-kleij said that thanks to twice daily injections of diamorphine , more than 40 of her patients now had regular jobs - which was unthinkable when they first approached the center . conservatives resist heroin maintenance despite the therapy ’ s success , heroin maintenance treatment remains highly controversial .
the injection clinics initially sparked angry protests among residents living near them , particularly in hamburg and frankfurt .
but most have since dropped their resistance . however , politicians in germany remain split on whether the project - which has already been extended once - should be renewed beyond june 2007 . in particular , the conservatives in germany ’ s current grand coalition government are against the project . though members of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the christian social union , -lrb- csu -rrb- declined requests for interviews ; their resistance to the project on ideological and financial grounds is well known . last year , they reacted furiously to a proposal to make heroin available by prescription . " these plans are n't acceptable .
the csu wo n't approve any legislation that will make the state a drug dealer , " markus söder , general secretary of the csu told daily die welt , adding there was no way " the state will pay for the junkies ' fix " when citizens were paying ever more for their health .
the heroin maintenance project has so far cost over 12 million euros . " a big chance for germany " experts however rebuff the too-expensive argument , saying that though heroin maintenance is admittedly more expensive than methadone therapy ; the benefits far outweigh the costs . " you have to look at the bigger picture .
heroin therapy is n't expensive if you take into account the indirect costs that you save in terms of improved quality of life , productivity and improved health , " hamburg researcher haase said .
he says the therapy will cost just around 10,000 euros per patient every year for the estimated small group of germany 's 1,500 severe heroin addicts . " this is a big chance for germany to take a step forward and create a modern therapy to tackle drug dependency , " haase said . legalizing heroin a sticking point the conservatives - who control the upper house of parliament and can thus block legislation - are also against changing germany ’ s drug laws to legalize heroin and approve it for medical use , a point that experts say is absolutely essential . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the opium that makes its way to the west comes from central asia " it 's really annoying that a medical discussion has been hijacked by politics , " said ralf hüllinghorst , head of the german head office for dependency matters -lrb- dhs -rrb- who stressed that heroin administration had to made part of regular health care in germany .

however industry commissioner guenter verheugen , considered close to the car lobby , has suggested that car owners too should be required to stick to energy-efficient driving habits among other things . verheugen has also proposed that carmakers could be made part of the europe-wide trade in carbon emissions . that would mean that german carmakers would then not be forced to lower carbon dioxide emissions for new cars to 120 grams per kilometer by 2012 as required by the eu .

before you pack your bag , read about some of the travel adventures other dw-world.de readers have had in germany . my husband horst and i visited bavaria this year with a band from texas .
we felt welcome and enjoyed every minute of our tour , which took us to all those famous , beautiful places .
the german people were courteous and most of them spoke english , so nobody felt stranded .
since we came from texas , we felt very comfy in bavaria . - horst and rita klauser my friend and i have made numerous trips and love it .
we were in leipzig and were going to munich .
we jumped on the train , fell asleep and awoke to the conductor .
he asked where we were going and then waved his fingers and said , " no , no , you 're going to hamburg ! "
we all got a good laugh , as we were already in berlin .
the whole train car caught the joke and came to our assistance , offering suggestions of things to see and to do while there .
we had a blast .
we travel light , with few definite plans and always end up in many fantastic places and meet tons of friendly people . - brian parks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : got beer ?
oberau by berchtesgaden is a choice spot for any vacation . - phil raasch i read the article regarding the politeness of berliners -lrb- 22.06.2006 -rrb- and can share my mixed experiences .
i was a tourist in berlin in 2005 and , overall , i think berliners are generally polite .
however , somewhat surprisingly , an assistant at a transport information desk was rude and dismissive towards me .
i assume it was because my german language skills are weak .
also , the receptionist at our hotel was impatient with us when we questioned him about our assigned room .
that said , i found all shopkeepers and food vendors polite , and all the locals we encountered were very friendly .
the bad experiences have not put me off , and i look forward to returning to the wonderful city of berlin in the future . - lauren , australia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one traveler meant to go to munich but ended up in berlin my favorite hotel in germany ?
this would be the wald hotel manngold in bergisch gladbach outside of cologne .
it is a small , third generation family-run hotel with tasteful , comfortable rooms and wonderful service .
if the restaurant does n't have five stars , then it 's under-rated !
it has a beautiful view of the castle at night and sits on the edge of a expansive woods covered with hiking trails .
it has excellent connections to cologne via light rail and bus , so no car is needed .
the bensberg pedestrian zone , an easy walk away , has bakeries and a wide variety of restaurants and shops .
we found this place by accident seven years ago and have returned every year at the end of our vacation to relax for a few days before we return home to california .
we have never been disappointed . - dr. john j. wicks marzipan , goulash soup , beer and the bratwurst on the market square bring back fond memories of many visits to germany . - ben , dallas , texas compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german travel adventures from dw-world.de readers planning a trip to germany in 2007 ?

germany is expected to decide soon on a nato request to send reconnaissance aircraft to southern afghanistan .
according to a news report , german pilots may be preparing for more than that , however . germany is expected to decide soon on a nato request to send reconnaissance aircraft to southern afghanistan .
but , according to a news report , german pilots may be preparing for more than that . on wednesday , germany 's cabinet will most likely give the green light to deploying six tornado surveillance planes to help alliance forces in the dangerous southern regions of afghanistan . germany 's bundestag , which has to give final approval , is mulling the plan next week .
so far , the bundeswehr 's current mandate limits the deployment of some 3,000 german soldiers to the afghan capital kabul and the relatively safer northern part of the country . but according to a news report by german public broadcaster ard , the mission might go beyond mere reconnaissance : bundeswehr pilots are currently testing technology that would allow them to participate directly in combat missions . combat support or combat ? the " reccelite " technology allows pilots to transfer images to a ground station or fighter planes in real time .
this allows so-called " close-air-support " operations , which make it possible to identify and bombard moving targets in a quick and precise way . bildunterschrift : the ard report quoted pilots , who said that they had received orders from " the highest position " to acquire the skills for such missions " very quickly . " they added that it would really only make sense for german pilots to bombard targets themselves as they do not have the ability to transfer information wirelessly to fighter planes or ground stations in a secure way . defense ministry officials said that the " reccelite " tests had been planned for some time and that no plans so far existed to buy the technology for a potential tornado mission in afghanistan . opposition , spd concerns opposition politicians on the other hand saw the training as further evidence that the planes were meant to be used in combat missions . members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the government 's junior coalition partner , meanwhile also voiced concerns about deploying planes . " we have to do everything to prevent being pulled into an escalating combat situation , " said gert weisskirchen , the spd 's foreign affairs spokesman in parliament . but spd defense policy expert hans-peter bartels countered that germany was already involved in combat operations in afghanistan . " it would be hypocritical to say that we germans have nothing to do with conducting war in afghanistan , " he said . spd leader kurt beck said he expected germany to approve the request to send tornado planes .

" they added that it would really only make sense for german pilots to bombard targets themselves as they do not have the ability to transfer information wirelessly to fighter planes or ground stations in a secure way . defense ministry officials said that the " reccelite " tests had been planned for some time and that no plans so far existed to buy the technology for a potential tornado mission in afghanistan . opposition , spd concerns opposition politicians on the other hand saw the training as further evidence that the planes were meant to be used in combat missions . members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the government 's junior coalition partner , meanwhile also voiced concerns about deploying planes . " we have to do everything to prevent being pulled into an escalating combat situation , " said gert weisskirchen , the spd 's foreign affairs spokesman in parliament . but spd defense policy expert hans-peter bartels countered that germany was already involved in combat operations in afghanistan . " it would be hypocritical to say that we germans have nothing to do with conducting war in afghanistan , " he said . spd leader kurt beck said he expected germany to approve the request to send tornado planes .

" an eu police mission in afghanistan is very likely , " solana said in a speech to a conference on european security and defence policy which followed the aid announcement .

according to a news report , german pilots may be preparing for more than that , however . germany is expected to decide soon on a nato request to send reconnaissance aircraft to southern afghanistan .
but , according to a news report , german pilots may be preparing for more than that . on wednesday , germany 's cabinet will most likely give the green light to deploying six tornado surveillance planes to help alliance forces in the dangerous southern regions of afghanistan . germany 's bundestag , which has to give final approval , is mulling the plan next week .
so far , the bundeswehr 's current mandate limits the deployment of some 3,000 german soldiers to the afghan capital kabul and the relatively safer northern part of the country . but according to a news report by german public broadcaster ard , the mission might go beyond mere reconnaissance : bundeswehr pilots are currently testing technology that would allow them to participate directly in combat missions . combat support or combat ? the " reccelite " technology allows pilots to transfer images to a ground station or fighter planes in real time .
this allows so-called " close-air-support " operations , which make it possible to identify and bombard moving targets in a quick and precise way . bildunterschrift : the ard report quoted pilots , who said that they had received orders from " the highest position " to acquire the skills for such missions " very quickly . " they added that it would really only make sense for german pilots to bombard targets themselves as they do not have the ability to transfer information wirelessly to fighter planes or ground stations in a secure way . defense ministry officials said that the " reccelite " tests had been planned for some time and that no plans so far existed to buy the technology for a potential tornado mission in afghanistan . opposition , spd concerns opposition politicians on the other hand saw the training as further evidence that the planes were meant to be used in combat missions . members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the government 's junior coalition partner , meanwhile also voiced concerns about deploying planes . " we have to do everything to prevent being pulled into an escalating combat situation , " said gert weisskirchen , the spd 's foreign affairs spokesman in parliament . but spd defense policy expert hans-peter bartels countered that germany was already involved in combat operations in afghanistan . " it would be hypocritical to say that we germans have nothing to do with conducting war in afghanistan , " he said . spd leader kurt beck said he expected germany to approve the request to send tornado planes .

government subsidies - not jobs - are to be cut back drastically and may be history as early as 2018 . germany can not afford long-term subsidies for the coal industry , economics minister michael glos told public broadcaster zdf on monday . " it 's much better to take those economic resources and invest them in more modern , renewable energies , " he added . after extensive negotiations , the premiers of north rhine-westphalia and saarland , two of germany 's particularly coal-rich regions , and representatives of the coal union and the mining conglomerate agreed sunday on a plan to phase out german coal subsidies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rüttgers said subsidy cuts were necessary in part due to inexpensive coal imports though no official deadline was set , 2018 was mentioned as the year the last check would arrive .
the situation , however , will be subject to reevaluation in 2012 , according to the wishes of the social democratic party , the junior party in the ruling grand coalition of christian and social democrats .
traditionally , the party has staunchly opposed cutting coal subsidies . politicians promise no layoffs both glos and jürgen rüttgers , premier of north rhine-westphalia , said in the zdf interview on monday that no layoffs would be made and that coal workers should n't be worried about their livelihood . " we want to make the associated restructuring of labor as tolerable as possible , " glos said . rüttgers added that investments needed to be made in new jobs that would be more secure in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 25 million tons are mined annually in germany " in reality , it 's about starting a new chapter in the history of the ruhr valley , " he said . currently , some 34,000 miners extract 25 million tons of coal annually from eight mines in germany .
state and federal governments pay up to 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- per year in coal subsidies . merkel to continue talks monday according to the agreement made sunday , subsidy cutbacks are to be financed by putting up parts of the mining conglomerate raf for an initial public offering .
the stock revenues will then be transferred to a foundation . chancellor angela merkel will continue negotiations on the future of the coal industry with the government coalition monday evening .
a final decision may be reached as early as this week . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's coal industry faces closures and job losses germany 's coal mining industry - already facing the end of government subsidies - was hit by a further blow this weekend when it was revealed that financial discrepencies could lead to mine closures and job losses .
-lrb- 22.01.2007 -rrb- germany debates the future of coal mining some say the german mining industry is squandering too much money and that production should cease as soon as possible , whereas others argue that coal is the energy source of the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 29.01.2007 amid debate , germany 's heroin injection clinics fight to survive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for severe addicts , the injection clinics could prove life-saving germany 's conservatives are opposed to liberalizing heroin and giving free doses to the country 's worst addicts .
some say the rigid stance may jeopardize the health of hundreds of patients . last week , the cities of hamburg and frankfurt warned that injection clinics where severe heroin addicts are administered free doses of the drug under medical supervision are in danger of closure by the middle of the year if the german government doesn ’ t extend their lifetime . a failure to do so wouldn ’ t just threaten the future of the clinics in hamburg and frankfurt , but also hit heroin injection centers in five other german cities where hard-core addicts can inject themselves with diamorphine , a chemically pure form of heroin .
in addition to providing clean needles , the clinics also offer crucial psychiatric support . heroin versus methadone they were all set up in 2002 under the previous german government of social democrats and greens as part of a project modeled on similar experiments in switzerland and the netherlands to find the most effective way to treat hard-core heroin addicts , help them build a relatively normal life and eventually get them to kick the habit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the heroin injection clinic in frankfurt the project compared results between a group of patients who were put on heroin maintenance therapy and another on methadone , a heroin substitute . the findings , which were published in a study last year , found that the heroin group fared much better . " those on heroin stayed in treatment longer and the drop out is much less than the methadone group .
they had much less illicit drug use , using street heroin and cocaine , and so have better health records , ” said christian haase , a hamburg-based researcher who carried out the study . lower drug crime and better health the study ’ s conclusions in favor of heroin maintenance therapy to treat the country ’ s worst addicts has been boosted by the fact that germany ’ s heroin-overdose death rate has continually plunged in the past years and is currently at its lowest level since 1989 .
in addition , cities such as hamburg , long notorious for its open drug scene near the main railway station , have managed to stem illicit drug use and lower drug crime . “ our clinic ’ s priority has been to improve the health of patients and we have made good progress with that , ” said peter heine , a spokesman for the frankfurt mayor ’ s office .
the city ’ s heroin injection clinic has seen its patients dwindle to 59 from 93 .
“ and importantly , the clinic has helped to keep addicts off the street and prevent them from resorting to illegal means to obtain the drug , ” heine added . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is estimated to have around 1,500 severe smack addicts karin bonorden-kleij , head of the heroin injection clinic in hamburg said patient numbers had dropped to 70 from an original 200 who started therapy .
most turned clean with fewer health problems , a few dropped out while some went back to the streets . bonorden-kleij said that thanks to twice daily injections of diamorphine , more than 40 of her patients now had regular jobs - which was unthinkable when they first approached the center . conservatives resist heroin maintenance despite the therapy ’ s success , heroin maintenance treatment remains highly controversial .
the injection clinics initially sparked angry protests among residents living near them , particularly in hamburg and frankfurt .
but most have since dropped their resistance . however , politicians in germany remain split on whether the project - which has already been extended once - should be renewed beyond june 2007 . in particular , the conservatives in germany ’ s current grand coalition government are against the project . though members of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the christian social union , -lrb- csu -rrb- declined requests for interviews ; their resistance to the project on ideological and financial grounds is well known . last year , they reacted furiously to a proposal to make heroin available by prescription . " these plans are n't acceptable .
the csu wo n't approve any legislation that will make the state a drug dealer , " markus söder , general secretary of the csu told daily die welt , adding there was no way " the state will pay for the junkies ' fix " when citizens were paying ever more for their health .
the heroin maintenance project has so far cost over 12 million euros . " a big chance for germany " experts however rebuff the too-expensive argument , saying that though heroin maintenance is admittedly more expensive than methadone therapy ; the benefits far outweigh the costs . " you have to look at the bigger picture .
heroin therapy is n't expensive if you take into account the indirect costs that you save in terms of improved quality of life , productivity and improved health , " hamburg researcher haase said .
he says the therapy will cost just around 10,000 euros per patient every year for the estimated small group of germany 's 1,500 severe heroin addicts . " this is a big chance for germany to take a step forward and create a modern therapy to tackle drug dependency , " haase said . legalizing heroin a sticking point the conservatives - who control the upper house of parliament and can thus block legislation - are also against changing germany ’ s drug laws to legalize heroin and approve it for medical use , a point that experts say is absolutely essential . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the opium that makes its way to the west comes from central asia " it 's really annoying that a medical discussion has been hijacked by politics , " said ralf hüllinghorst , head of the german head office for dependency matters -lrb- dhs -rrb- who stressed that heroin administration had to made part of regular health care in germany . " if heroin maintenance has proved to be effective , we have to be able to make use of it .
heroin has to be legalized and doctors should be allowed to prescribe it like in the netherlands and in switzerland . " the matter however is far from decided .
conservative members of germany 's parliament face a challenge from their own party members on the issue at the state level . hamburg which is ruled by a cdu government said last week it was kicking off a campaign to lobby support in the upper house of parliament to amend german drug laws to legalize heroin .
frankfurt too saw a rare show of support across party lines for extending its heroin injection clinic . patients stand to lose everything as the debate rumbles on , advocates of the project warn that if the german government doesn ’ t extend the project and legalize heroin it would spell disaster for hundreds of patients . " if the clinic closes and we stop the diamorphine doses , it will make everything worse for the patients who have managed to stabilize their lives , " said karin bonorden-kleij who pointed out that most of her patients had managed to break away from a life of criminality and abuse and painstakingly build a normal life . " if you take this away from them , i fear that some will not see the point of living anymore and commit suicide .

some say the rigid stance may jeopardize the health of hundreds of patients . last week , the cities of hamburg and frankfurt warned that injection clinics where severe heroin addicts are administered free doses of the drug under medical supervision are in danger of closure by the middle of the year if the german government doesn ’ t extend their lifetime . a failure to do so wouldn ’ t just threaten the future of the clinics in hamburg and frankfurt , but also hit heroin injection centers in five other german cities where hard-core addicts can inject themselves with diamorphine , a chemically pure form of heroin .
in addition to providing clean needles , the clinics also offer crucial psychiatric support . heroin versus methadone they were all set up in 2002 under the previous german government of social democrats and greens as part of a project modeled on similar experiments in switzerland and the netherlands to find the most effective way to treat hard-core heroin addicts , help them build a relatively normal life and eventually get them to kick the habit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the heroin injection clinic in frankfurt the project compared results between a group of patients who were put on heroin maintenance therapy and another on methadone , a heroin substitute . the findings , which were published in a study last year , found that the heroin group fared much better . " those on heroin stayed in treatment longer and the drop out is much less than the methadone group .
they had much less illicit drug use , using street heroin and cocaine , and so have better health records , ” said christian haase , a hamburg-based researcher who carried out the study . lower drug crime and better health the study ’ s conclusions in favor of heroin maintenance therapy to treat the country ’ s worst addicts has been boosted by the fact that germany ’ s heroin-overdose death rate has continually plunged in the past years and is currently at its lowest level since 1989 .
in addition , cities such as hamburg , long notorious for its open drug scene near the main railway station , have managed to stem illicit drug use and lower drug crime . “ our clinic ’ s priority has been to improve the health of patients and we have made good progress with that , ” said peter heine , a spokesman for the frankfurt mayor ’ s office .
the city ’ s heroin injection clinic has seen its patients dwindle to 59 from 93 .
“ and importantly , the clinic has helped to keep addicts off the street and prevent them from resorting to illegal means to obtain the drug , ” heine added . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is estimated to have around 1,500 severe smack addicts karin bonorden-kleij , head of the heroin injection clinic in hamburg said patient numbers had dropped to 70 from an original 200 who started therapy .
most turned clean with fewer health problems , a few dropped out while some went back to the streets . bonorden-kleij said that thanks to twice daily injections of diamorphine , more than 40 of her patients now had regular jobs - which was unthinkable when they first approached the center . conservatives resist heroin maintenance despite the therapy ’ s success , heroin maintenance treatment remains highly controversial .
the injection clinics initially sparked angry protests among residents living near them , particularly in hamburg and frankfurt .
but most have since dropped their resistance . however , politicians in germany remain split on whether the project - which has already been extended once - should be renewed beyond june 2007 . in particular , the conservatives in germany ’ s current grand coalition government are against the project . though members of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the christian social union , -lrb- csu -rrb- declined requests for interviews ; their resistance to the project on ideological and financial grounds is well known . last year , they reacted furiously to a proposal to make heroin available by prescription . " these plans are n't acceptable .
the csu wo n't approve any legislation that will make the state a drug dealer , " markus söder , general secretary of the csu told daily die welt , adding there was no way " the state will pay for the junkies ' fix " when citizens were paying ever more for their health .
the heroin maintenance project has so far cost over 12 million euros . " a big chance for germany " experts however rebuff the too-expensive argument , saying that though heroin maintenance is admittedly more expensive than methadone therapy ; the benefits far outweigh the costs . " you have to look at the bigger picture .
heroin therapy is n't expensive if you take into account the indirect costs that you save in terms of improved quality of life , productivity and improved health , " hamburg researcher haase said .
he says the therapy will cost just around 10,000 euros per patient every year for the estimated small group of germany 's 1,500 severe heroin addicts . " this is a big chance for germany to take a step forward and create a modern therapy to tackle drug dependency , " haase said . legalizing heroin a sticking point the conservatives - who control the upper house of parliament and can thus block legislation - are also against changing germany ’ s drug laws to legalize heroin and approve it for medical use , a point that experts say is absolutely essential . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the opium that makes its way to the west comes from central asia " it 's really annoying that a medical discussion has been hijacked by politics , " said ralf hüllinghorst , head of the german head office for dependency matters -lrb- dhs -rrb- who stressed that heroin administration had to made part of regular health care in germany . " if heroin maintenance has proved to be effective , we have to be able to make use of it .
heroin has to be legalized and doctors should be allowed to prescribe it like in the netherlands and in switzerland . " the matter however is far from decided .
conservative members of germany 's parliament face a challenge from their own party members on the issue at the state level . hamburg which is ruled by a cdu government said last week it was kicking off a campaign to lobby support in the upper house of parliament to amend german drug laws to legalize heroin .
frankfurt too saw a rare show of support across party lines for extending its heroin injection clinic . patients stand to lose everything as the debate rumbles on , advocates of the project warn that if the german government doesn ’ t extend the project and legalize heroin it would spell disaster for hundreds of patients . " if the clinic closes and we stop the diamorphine doses , it will make everything worse for the patients who have managed to stabilize their lives , " said karin bonorden-kleij who pointed out that most of her patients had managed to break away from a life of criminality and abuse and painstakingly build a normal life .

in addition to providing clean needles , the clinics also offer crucial psychiatric support . heroin versus methadone they were all set up in 2002 under the previous german government of social democrats and greens as part of a project modeled on similar experiments in switzerland and the netherlands to find the most effective way to treat hard-core heroin addicts , help them build a relatively normal life and eventually get them to kick the habit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the heroin injection clinic in frankfurt the project compared results between a group of patients who were put on heroin maintenance therapy and another on methadone , a heroin substitute . the findings , which were published in a study last year , found that the heroin group fared much better . " those on heroin stayed in treatment longer and the drop out is much less than the methadone group .
they had much less illicit drug use , using street heroin and cocaine , and so have better health records , ” said christian haase , a hamburg-based researcher who carried out the study . lower drug crime and better health the study ’ s conclusions in favor of heroin maintenance therapy to treat the country ’ s worst addicts has been boosted by the fact that germany ’ s heroin-overdose death rate has continually plunged in the past years and is currently at its lowest level since 1989 .
in addition , cities such as hamburg , long notorious for its open drug scene near the main railway station , have managed to stem illicit drug use and lower drug crime . “ our clinic ’ s priority has been to improve the health of patients and we have made good progress with that , ” said peter heine , a spokesman for the frankfurt mayor ’ s office .
the city ’ s heroin injection clinic has seen its patients dwindle to 59 from 93 .
“ and importantly , the clinic has helped to keep addicts off the street and prevent them from resorting to illegal means to obtain the drug , ” heine added . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is estimated to have around 1,500 severe smack addicts karin bonorden-kleij , head of the heroin injection clinic in hamburg said patient numbers had dropped to 70 from an original 200 who started therapy .
most turned clean with fewer health problems , a few dropped out while some went back to the streets . bonorden-kleij said that thanks to twice daily injections of diamorphine , more than 40 of her patients now had regular jobs - which was unthinkable when they first approached the center . conservatives resist heroin maintenance despite the therapy ’ s success , heroin maintenance treatment remains highly controversial .
the injection clinics initially sparked angry protests among residents living near them , particularly in hamburg and frankfurt .
but most have since dropped their resistance . however , politicians in germany remain split on whether the project - which has already been extended once - should be renewed beyond june 2007 . in particular , the conservatives in germany ’ s current grand coalition government are against the project . though members of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the christian social union , -lrb- csu -rrb- declined requests for interviews ; their resistance to the project on ideological and financial grounds is well known . last year , they reacted furiously to a proposal to make heroin available by prescription . " these plans are n't acceptable .
the csu wo n't approve any legislation that will make the state a drug dealer , " markus söder , general secretary of the csu told daily die welt , adding there was no way " the state will pay for the junkies ' fix " when citizens were paying ever more for their health .
the heroin maintenance project has so far cost over 12 million euros . " a big chance for germany " experts however rebuff the too-expensive argument , saying that though heroin maintenance is admittedly more expensive than methadone therapy ; the benefits far outweigh the costs . " you have to look at the bigger picture .
heroin therapy is n't expensive if you take into account the indirect costs that you save in terms of improved quality of life , productivity and improved health , " hamburg researcher haase said .
he says the therapy will cost just around 10,000 euros per patient every year for the estimated small group of germany 's 1,500 severe heroin addicts . " this is a big chance for germany to take a step forward and create a modern therapy to tackle drug dependency , " haase said . legalizing heroin a sticking point the conservatives - who control the upper house of parliament and can thus block legislation - are also against changing germany ’ s drug laws to legalize heroin and approve it for medical use , a point that experts say is absolutely essential . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the opium that makes its way to the west comes from central asia " it 's really annoying that a medical discussion has been hijacked by politics , " said ralf hüllinghorst , head of the german head office for dependency matters -lrb- dhs -rrb- who stressed that heroin administration had to made part of regular health care in germany . " if heroin maintenance has proved to be effective , we have to be able to make use of it .
heroin has to be legalized and doctors should be allowed to prescribe it like in the netherlands and in switzerland . " the matter however is far from decided .
conservative members of germany 's parliament face a challenge from their own party members on the issue at the state level . hamburg which is ruled by a cdu government said last week it was kicking off a campaign to lobby support in the upper house of parliament to amend german drug laws to legalize heroin .
frankfurt too saw a rare show of support across party lines for extending its heroin injection clinic . patients stand to lose everything as the debate rumbles on , advocates of the project warn that if the german government doesn ’ t extend the project and legalize heroin it would spell disaster for hundreds of patients . " if the clinic closes and we stop the diamorphine doses , it will make everything worse for the patients who have managed to stabilize their lives , " said karin bonorden-kleij who pointed out that most of her patients had managed to break away from a life of criminality and abuse and painstakingly build a normal life . " if you take this away from them , i fear that some will not see the point of living anymore and commit suicide .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the basic idea of the principle of free speech is that you have a right , issuing from your dignity as a human being , to say what you honestly think is true .
those who believe in the arguments of holocaust revisionism meet this criterion .
there is very good evidence behind these arguments and those who support them are intellectually honest .
they are not hateful propagandists .
if the eu makes holocaust denial a crime , it makes itself a criminal against classical liberalism and the dignity of man . - kendra blewitt , san francisco how can one deny the holocaust ?
it happened .
how can one not admit the existence of israel ?
there it is .
but how long do we have to cow-tow to the wishes of the israelis ?
just get over it . - james wilder , us these laws prohibiting holocaust skepticism are evil .
it is the right of a free people to question their government publicly .
the founding fathers of the united states drew upon great european thinkers and philosophers such as voltaire and john stuart mill .

in germany it 's a crime to say no as long as the european union does not have a common constitution approved by all its members , it will be difficult to find consensus on the criminalization of holocaust denial . - jose nigrin the german government has a moral obligation to uphold its constitution , which guarantees any of its citizens the right to free speech .
also , a murder is a crime no matter who commits it .
to exempt one group from the rest is a violation of article 14 of the un 's international covenant on civil and political rights . - rudolf pueschel passing laws that illegalize holocaust denial is a victory against freedom of speech . - brad harris to put a man at mr. zundel 's advanced age in jail is criminal to say the least .
i thought people were allowed to think .
mr. zundel chooses to think differently .
it is n't a crime .
how many people will germany put in jail for thinking or writing books ?
shame ! - sheila fox merely expressing one 's opinion or belief , or even ignorance , will not change what has already happened and will also not make a non-occurrence an occurrence .
in this light , such a ban is laughable and infantile .
it also shows that the eu is held hostage by jewish groups and lobbies .
moreover , it is now 2007 and everyone has got over the world war two itch , other than germany , that is .
there are far more pressing issues to be taken care of than this pet obsession .
if the government wants to be a stooge to the jewish lobby , then it is up to its members to decide , but it can at no point of time force others to subscribe to its point of view . - suvrajit saha bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria , belgium , france , germany , poland , romania and spain already have laws against holocaust denial sixty years after the war 's end , nazism is again rearing its ugly head : jailing people for their speech , laws against free thought and burning books .

so far , the bundeswehr 's current mandate limits the deployment of some 3,000 german soldiers to the afghan capital kabul and the relatively safer northern part of the country . but according to a news report by german public broadcaster ard , the mission might go beyond mere reconnaissance : bundeswehr pilots are currently testing technology that would allow them to participate directly in combat missions . combat support or combat ? the " reccelite " technology allows pilots to transfer images to a ground station or fighter planes in real time .

" the government will do everything it can to reach a sector-wide reduction , " merkel told a meeting of industry leaders in berlin . it was " regrettable " that european car makers would not meet the targets they had set themselves , merkel said . " but we must not let the result of that be to impose a general obligation for all cars to be subject to the same measure , " she said . " the diversity of the automobile industry must be respected , " merkel maintained . merkel said the german government would do all it could to make sure any goals in the 27-member bloc depended on the type of car . eu rejects german car industry opposition european commission president jose manuel barroso and environment commissioner stavros dimas want binding legislation that would require car makers to reduce co2 emissions of new cars to an industry average of 120 grams per km in 2012 .
that is because the auto industry is likely to miss a voluntary target to cut average co2 emissions for new cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suvs , which are increasingly found on european roads , are big polluters some german politicians have said they support such a move but others have voiced reservations . on monday , the eu commission rejected a letter from written by the heads of germany 's top five car companies over the weekend to the eu commission that warned of the risk to eu competitiveness and employment if brussels imposed binding limits on car exhaust emissions . daimlerchrysler , volkswagen , ford , bmw and opel say that if the eu plans are implemented , it will be forced to cut jobs or move them to cheaper nations as it copes with rising costs and a tougher consumer market . but a spokesman for the european commission , johannes laitenberger , said that the best way to preserve jobs was to embrace and anticipate change rather than resist it . " normally jobs are not lost when you proactively embrace change , " laitenberger said .
" we need to equip europe for globalization and our industry for the future .
neither globalization nor climate change will go away . " eu divided about emissions legislation the issue is complicated by the fact that the eu executive too is divided about the planned legislation to limit car emissions . the commission delayed a decision last week to allow more time to forge a consensus . eu environment commissioner dimas has said that he wants the burden of responsiblity to lie with carmakers .
however industry commissioner guenter verheugen , considered close to the car lobby , has suggested that car owners too should be required to stick to energy-efficient driving habits among other things . verheugen has also proposed that carmakers could be made part of the europe-wide trade in carbon emissions . that would mean that german carmakers would then not be forced to lower carbon dioxide emissions for new cars to 120 grams per kilometer by 2012 as required by the eu .
instead they could then buy emission rights from other sectors or support environmental projects in developing countries to balance out their emission record . eu spokesman laitenberger insisted monday that the eu needed a law to limit emissions for new cars , but indicated there could be room for maneuvering . " what is now under discussion is to debate and to decide on what exactly should be covered by the legislation , " he said .
" we are not driven by a day or two , or by a week or two , but by the urge to get this right . " experts say carmakers need to invest in green technology the dispute over the car industry 's responsiblity to lower emissions comes just weeks after the european union embraced a " low-carbon economy " to combat climate change by reducing its reliance on imported oil and natural gas and promote renewable sources of energy . but the eu is worried that rising carbon dioxide emissions from transportation will undermine its battle to cut greenhouse emissions on the continent . bildunterschrift : the number of cars on european roads has increased greatly in the past years according to the european environment agency , the overall level of greenhouse emissions from road transport has increased 22 percent since 1990 as the number of cars on the road rises . the european commission wants to force automakers to manufacture cars that are more environmentally friendly .
but carmakers , who say they have cut emissions by 13 percent , argue that it 's not viable for them to sell smaller cars or hybrid-fuel models . critics however say that carmakers simply are n't doing enough to develop environmentally-friendly technology . andreas troge , head of the german environment agency , warned that the german car industry was in danger of missing the boat on new green technologies which in turn could end up jeopardizing jobs . " if you 're too late in adapting , you can threaten jobs , " troge told hanover-based paper neuen presse . reinhard bütikofer , chairman of the opposition green party , urged the german car industry to view new environmental challenges as an opportunity instead of a threat .

before you pack your bag , read about some of the travel adventures other dw-world.de readers have had in germany . my husband horst and i visited bavaria this year with a band from texas .
we felt welcome and enjoyed every minute of our tour , which took us to all those famous , beautiful places .
the german people were courteous and most of them spoke english , so nobody felt stranded .
since we came from texas , we felt very comfy in bavaria . - horst and rita klauser my friend and i have made numerous trips and love it .
we were in leipzig and were going to munich .
we jumped on the train , fell asleep and awoke to the conductor .
he asked where we were going and then waved his fingers and said , " no , no , you 're going to hamburg ! "
we all got a good laugh , as we were already in berlin .
the whole train car caught the joke and came to our assistance , offering suggestions of things to see and to do while there .
we had a blast .
we travel light , with few definite plans and always end up in many fantastic places and meet tons of friendly people . - brian parks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : got beer ?
oberau by berchtesgaden is a choice spot for any vacation . - phil raasch i read the article regarding the politeness of berliners -lrb- 22.06.2006 -rrb- and can share my mixed experiences .
i was a tourist in berlin in 2005 and , overall , i think berliners are generally polite .
however , somewhat surprisingly , an assistant at a transport information desk was rude and dismissive towards me .
i assume it was because my german language skills are weak .
also , the receptionist at our hotel was impatient with us when we questioned him about our assigned room .
that said , i found all shopkeepers and food vendors polite , and all the locals we encountered were very friendly .
the bad experiences have not put me off , and i look forward to returning to the wonderful city of berlin in the future . - lauren , australia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one traveler meant to go to munich but ended up in berlin my favorite hotel in germany ?
this would be the wald hotel manngold in bergisch gladbach outside of cologne .
it is a small , third generation family-run hotel with tasteful , comfortable rooms and wonderful service .
if the restaurant does n't have five stars , then it 's under-rated !
it has a beautiful view of the castle at night and sits on the edge of a expansive woods covered with hiking trails .
it has excellent connections to cologne via light rail and bus , so no car is needed .
the bensberg pedestrian zone , an easy walk away , has bakeries and a wide variety of restaurants and shops .
we found this place by accident seven years ago and have returned every year at the end of our vacation to relax for a few days before we return home to california .
we have never been disappointed . - dr. john j. wicks marzipan , goulash soup , beer and the bratwurst on the market square bring back fond memories of many visits to germany . - ben , dallas , texas compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german travel adventures from dw-world.de readers planning a trip to germany in 2007 ?

we felt welcome and enjoyed every minute of our tour , which took us to all those famous , beautiful places .
the german people were courteous and most of them spoke english , so nobody felt stranded .
since we came from texas , we felt very comfy in bavaria . - horst and rita klauser my friend and i have made numerous trips and love it .
we were in leipzig and were going to munich .
we jumped on the train , fell asleep and awoke to the conductor .
he asked where we were going and then waved his fingers and said , " no , no , you 're going to hamburg ! "
we all got a good laugh , as we were already in berlin .
the whole train car caught the joke and came to our assistance , offering suggestions of things to see and to do while there .
we had a blast .
we travel light , with few definite plans and always end up in many fantastic places and meet tons of friendly people . - brian parks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : got beer ?
oberau by berchtesgaden is a choice spot for any vacation . - phil raasch i read the article regarding the politeness of berliners -lrb- 22.06.2006 -rrb- and can share my mixed experiences .
i was a tourist in berlin in 2005 and , overall , i think berliners are generally polite .
however , somewhat surprisingly , an assistant at a transport information desk was rude and dismissive towards me .
i assume it was because my german language skills are weak .
also , the receptionist at our hotel was impatient with us when we questioned him about our assigned room .
that said , i found all shopkeepers and food vendors polite , and all the locals we encountered were very friendly .
the bad experiences have not put me off , and i look forward to returning to the wonderful city of berlin in the future . - lauren , australia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one traveler meant to go to munich but ended up in berlin my favorite hotel in germany ?
this would be the wald hotel manngold in bergisch gladbach outside of cologne .
it is a small , third generation family-run hotel with tasteful , comfortable rooms and wonderful service .
if the restaurant does n't have five stars , then it 's under-rated !
it has a beautiful view of the castle at night and sits on the edge of a expansive woods covered with hiking trails .
it has excellent connections to cologne via light rail and bus , so no car is needed .
the bensberg pedestrian zone , an easy walk away , has bakeries and a wide variety of restaurants and shops .
we found this place by accident seven years ago and have returned every year at the end of our vacation to relax for a few days before we return home to california .
we have never been disappointed . - dr. john j. wicks marzipan , goulash soup , beer and the bratwurst on the market square bring back fond memories of many visits to germany . - ben , dallas , texas compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german travel adventures from dw-world.de readers planning a trip to germany in 2007 ?

germany is expected to decide soon on a nato request to send reconnaissance aircraft to southern afghanistan .
according to a news report , german pilots may be preparing for more than that , however . germany is expected to decide soon on a nato request to send reconnaissance aircraft to southern afghanistan .
but , according to a news report , german pilots may be preparing for more than that . on wednesday , germany 's cabinet will most likely give the green light to deploying six tornado surveillance planes to help alliance forces in the dangerous southern regions of afghanistan . germany 's bundestag , which has to give final approval , is mulling the plan next week .
so far , the bundeswehr 's current mandate limits the deployment of some 3,000 german soldiers to the afghan capital kabul and the relatively safer northern part of the country . but according to a news report by german public broadcaster ard , the mission might go beyond mere reconnaissance : bundeswehr pilots are currently testing technology that would allow them to participate directly in combat missions . combat support or combat ? the " reccelite " technology allows pilots to transfer images to a ground station or fighter planes in real time .
this allows so-called " close-air-support " operations , which make it possible to identify and bombard moving targets in a quick and precise way . bildunterschrift : the ard report quoted pilots , who said that they had received orders from " the highest position " to acquire the skills for such missions " very quickly . " they added that it would really only make sense for german pilots to bombard targets themselves as they do not have the ability to transfer information wirelessly to fighter planes or ground stations in a secure way . defense ministry officials said that the " reccelite " tests had been planned for some time and that no plans so far existed to buy the technology for a potential tornado mission in afghanistan . opposition , spd concerns opposition politicians on the other hand saw the training as further evidence that the planes were meant to be used in combat missions . members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the government 's junior coalition partner , meanwhile also voiced concerns about deploying planes . " we have to do everything to prevent being pulled into an escalating combat situation , " said gert weisskirchen , the spd 's foreign affairs spokesman in parliament . but spd defense policy expert hans-peter bartels countered that germany was already involved in combat operations in afghanistan . " it would be hypocritical to say that we germans have nothing to do with conducting war in afghanistan , " he said . spd leader kurt beck said he expected germany to approve the request to send tornado planes . " germany has to live up to the task , " he said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de peace still elusive after five years in afghanistan german soldiers began patrolling the streets of kabul as part of the un 's peacekeeping mission on jan .
14 , 2002 .
five years later , the bundeswehr is still active in afghanistan and peace seems far off .

before you pack your bag , read about some of the travel adventures other dw-world.de readers have had in germany . my husband horst and i visited bavaria this year with a band from texas .
we felt welcome and enjoyed every minute of our tour , which took us to all those famous , beautiful places .
the german people were courteous and most of them spoke english , so nobody felt stranded .
since we came from texas , we felt very comfy in bavaria . - horst and rita klauser my friend and i have made numerous trips and love it .
we were in leipzig and were going to munich .
we jumped on the train , fell asleep and awoke to the conductor .
he asked where we were going and then waved his fingers and said , " no , no , you 're going to hamburg ! "
we all got a good laugh , as we were already in berlin .
the whole train car caught the joke and came to our assistance , offering suggestions of things to see and to do while there .

i was a tourist in berlin in 2005 and , overall , i think berliners are generally polite .
however , somewhat surprisingly , an assistant at a transport information desk was rude and dismissive towards me .
i assume it was because my german language skills are weak .
also , the receptionist at our hotel was impatient with us when we questioned him about our assigned room .
that said , i found all shopkeepers and food vendors polite , and all the locals we encountered were very friendly .
the bad experiences have not put me off , and i look forward to returning to the wonderful city of berlin in the future . - lauren , australia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one traveler meant to go to munich but ended up in berlin my favorite hotel in germany ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 29.01.2007 amid debate , germany 's heroin injection clinics fight to survive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for severe addicts , the injection clinics could prove life-saving germany 's conservatives are opposed to liberalizing heroin and giving free doses to the country 's worst addicts .
some say the rigid stance may jeopardize the health of hundreds of patients . last week , the cities of hamburg and frankfurt warned that injection clinics where severe heroin addicts are administered free doses of the drug under medical supervision are in danger of closure by the middle of the year if the german government doesn ’ t extend their lifetime . a failure to do so wouldn ’ t just threaten the future of the clinics in hamburg and frankfurt , but also hit heroin injection centers in five other german cities where hard-core addicts can inject themselves with diamorphine , a chemically pure form of heroin .
in addition to providing clean needles , the clinics also offer crucial psychiatric support . heroin versus methadone they were all set up in 2002 under the previous german government of social democrats and greens as part of a project modeled on similar experiments in switzerland and the netherlands to find the most effective way to treat hard-core heroin addicts , help them build a relatively normal life and eventually get them to kick the habit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the heroin injection clinic in frankfurt the project compared results between a group of patients who were put on heroin maintenance therapy and another on methadone , a heroin substitute . the findings , which were published in a study last year , found that the heroin group fared much better . " those on heroin stayed in treatment longer and the drop out is much less than the methadone group .
they had much less illicit drug use , using street heroin and cocaine , and so have better health records , ” said christian haase , a hamburg-based researcher who carried out the study . lower drug crime and better health the study ’ s conclusions in favor of heroin maintenance therapy to treat the country ’ s worst addicts has been boosted by the fact that germany ’ s heroin-overdose death rate has continually plunged in the past years and is currently at its lowest level since 1989 .
in addition , cities such as hamburg , long notorious for its open drug scene near the main railway station , have managed to stem illicit drug use and lower drug crime . “ our clinic ’ s priority has been to improve the health of patients and we have made good progress with that , ” said peter heine , a spokesman for the frankfurt mayor ’ s office .
the city ’ s heroin injection clinic has seen its patients dwindle to 59 from 93 .
“ and importantly , the clinic has helped to keep addicts off the street and prevent them from resorting to illegal means to obtain the drug , ” heine added . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is estimated to have around 1,500 severe smack addicts karin bonorden-kleij , head of the heroin injection clinic in hamburg said patient numbers had dropped to 70 from an original 200 who started therapy .
most turned clean with fewer health problems , a few dropped out while some went back to the streets . bonorden-kleij said that thanks to twice daily injections of diamorphine , more than 40 of her patients now had regular jobs - which was unthinkable when they first approached the center . conservatives resist heroin maintenance despite the therapy ’ s success , heroin maintenance treatment remains highly controversial .
the injection clinics initially sparked angry protests among residents living near them , particularly in hamburg and frankfurt .
but most have since dropped their resistance . however , politicians in germany remain split on whether the project - which has already been extended once - should be renewed beyond june 2007 . in particular , the conservatives in germany ’ s current grand coalition government are against the project . though members of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the christian social union , -lrb- csu -rrb- declined requests for interviews ; their resistance to the project on ideological and financial grounds is well known . last year , they reacted furiously to a proposal to make heroin available by prescription . " these plans are n't acceptable .
the csu wo n't approve any legislation that will make the state a drug dealer , " markus söder , general secretary of the csu told daily die welt , adding there was no way " the state will pay for the junkies ' fix " when citizens were paying ever more for their health .
the heroin maintenance project has so far cost over 12 million euros . " a big chance for germany " experts however rebuff the too-expensive argument , saying that though heroin maintenance is admittedly more expensive than methadone therapy ; the benefits far outweigh the costs . " you have to look at the bigger picture .
heroin therapy is n't expensive if you take into account the indirect costs that you save in terms of improved quality of life , productivity and improved health , " hamburg researcher haase said .
he says the therapy will cost just around 10,000 euros per patient every year for the estimated small group of germany 's 1,500 severe heroin addicts . " this is a big chance for germany to take a step forward and create a modern therapy to tackle drug dependency , " haase said . legalizing heroin a sticking point the conservatives - who control the upper house of parliament and can thus block legislation - are also against changing germany ’ s drug laws to legalize heroin and approve it for medical use , a point that experts say is absolutely essential . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the opium that makes its way to the west comes from central asia " it 's really annoying that a medical discussion has been hijacked by politics , " said ralf hüllinghorst , head of the german head office for dependency matters -lrb- dhs -rrb- who stressed that heroin administration had to made part of regular health care in germany . " if heroin maintenance has proved to be effective , we have to be able to make use of it .
heroin has to be legalized and doctors should be allowed to prescribe it like in the netherlands and in switzerland . " the matter however is far from decided .
conservative members of germany 's parliament face a challenge from their own party members on the issue at the state level . hamburg which is ruled by a cdu government said last week it was kicking off a campaign to lobby support in the upper house of parliament to amend german drug laws to legalize heroin .
frankfurt too saw a rare show of support across party lines for extending its heroin injection clinic . patients stand to lose everything as the debate rumbles on , advocates of the project warn that if the german government doesn ’ t extend the project and legalize heroin it would spell disaster for hundreds of patients . " if the clinic closes and we stop the diamorphine doses , it will make everything worse for the patients who have managed to stabilize their lives , " said karin bonorden-kleij who pointed out that most of her patients had managed to break away from a life of criminality and abuse and painstakingly build a normal life . " if you take this away from them , i fear that some will not see the point of living anymore and commit suicide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 29.01.2007 amid debate , germany 's heroin injection clinics fight to survive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for severe addicts , the injection clinics could prove life-saving germany 's conservatives are opposed to liberalizing heroin and giving free doses to the country 's worst addicts .
some say the rigid stance may jeopardize the health of hundreds of patients . last week , the cities of hamburg and frankfurt warned that injection clinics where severe heroin addicts are administered free doses of the drug under medical supervision are in danger of closure by the middle of the year if the german government doesn ’ t extend their lifetime . a failure to do so wouldn ’ t just threaten the future of the clinics in hamburg and frankfurt , but also hit heroin injection centers in five other german cities where hard-core addicts can inject themselves with diamorphine , a chemically pure form of heroin .
in addition to providing clean needles , the clinics also offer crucial psychiatric support . heroin versus methadone they were all set up in 2002 under the previous german government of social democrats and greens as part of a project modeled on similar experiments in switzerland and the netherlands to find the most effective way to treat hard-core heroin addicts , help them build a relatively normal life and eventually get them to kick the habit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the heroin injection clinic in frankfurt the project compared results between a group of patients who were put on heroin maintenance therapy and another on methadone , a heroin substitute . the findings , which were published in a study last year , found that the heroin group fared much better . " those on heroin stayed in treatment longer and the drop out is much less than the methadone group .
they had much less illicit drug use , using street heroin and cocaine , and so have better health records , ” said christian haase , a hamburg-based researcher who carried out the study . lower drug crime and better health the study ’ s conclusions in favor of heroin maintenance therapy to treat the country ’ s worst addicts has been boosted by the fact that germany ’ s heroin-overdose death rate has continually plunged in the past years and is currently at its lowest level since 1989 .
in addition , cities such as hamburg , long notorious for its open drug scene near the main railway station , have managed to stem illicit drug use and lower drug crime . “ our clinic ’ s priority has been to improve the health of patients and we have made good progress with that , ” said peter heine , a spokesman for the frankfurt mayor ’ s office .
the city ’ s heroin injection clinic has seen its patients dwindle to 59 from 93 .
“ and importantly , the clinic has helped to keep addicts off the street and prevent them from resorting to illegal means to obtain the drug , ” heine added . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is estimated to have around 1,500 severe smack addicts karin bonorden-kleij , head of the heroin injection clinic in hamburg said patient numbers had dropped to 70 from an original 200 who started therapy .
most turned clean with fewer health problems , a few dropped out while some went back to the streets . bonorden-kleij said that thanks to twice daily injections of diamorphine , more than 40 of her patients now had regular jobs - which was unthinkable when they first approached the center . conservatives resist heroin maintenance despite the therapy ’ s success , heroin maintenance treatment remains highly controversial .
the injection clinics initially sparked angry protests among residents living near them , particularly in hamburg and frankfurt .
but most have since dropped their resistance . however , politicians in germany remain split on whether the project - which has already been extended once - should be renewed beyond june 2007 . in particular , the conservatives in germany ’ s current grand coalition government are against the project . though members of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the christian social union , -lrb- csu -rrb- declined requests for interviews ; their resistance to the project on ideological and financial grounds is well known . last year , they reacted furiously to a proposal to make heroin available by prescription . " these plans are n't acceptable .
the csu wo n't approve any legislation that will make the state a drug dealer , " markus söder , general secretary of the csu told daily die welt , adding there was no way " the state will pay for the junkies ' fix " when citizens were paying ever more for their health .
the heroin maintenance project has so far cost over 12 million euros . " a big chance for germany " experts however rebuff the too-expensive argument , saying that though heroin maintenance is admittedly more expensive than methadone therapy ; the benefits far outweigh the costs . " you have to look at the bigger picture .
heroin therapy is n't expensive if you take into account the indirect costs that you save in terms of improved quality of life , productivity and improved health , " hamburg researcher haase said .
he says the therapy will cost just around 10,000 euros per patient every year for the estimated small group of germany 's 1,500 severe heroin addicts . " this is a big chance for germany to take a step forward and create a modern therapy to tackle drug dependency , " haase said . legalizing heroin a sticking point the conservatives - who control the upper house of parliament and can thus block legislation - are also against changing germany ’ s drug laws to legalize heroin and approve it for medical use , a point that experts say is absolutely essential . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the opium that makes its way to the west comes from central asia " it 's really annoying that a medical discussion has been hijacked by politics , " said ralf hüllinghorst , head of the german head office for dependency matters -lrb- dhs -rrb- who stressed that heroin administration had to made part of regular health care in germany . " if heroin maintenance has proved to be effective , we have to be able to make use of it .
heroin has to be legalized and doctors should be allowed to prescribe it like in the netherlands and in switzerland . " the matter however is far from decided .
conservative members of germany 's parliament face a challenge from their own party members on the issue at the state level . hamburg which is ruled by a cdu government said last week it was kicking off a campaign to lobby support in the upper house of parliament to amend german drug laws to legalize heroin .
frankfurt too saw a rare show of support across party lines for extending its heroin injection clinic . patients stand to lose everything as the debate rumbles on , advocates of the project warn that if the german government doesn ’ t extend the project and legalize heroin it would spell disaster for hundreds of patients . " if the clinic closes and we stop the diamorphine doses , it will make everything worse for the patients who have managed to stabilize their lives , " said karin bonorden-kleij who pointed out that most of her patients had managed to break away from a life of criminality and abuse and painstakingly build a normal life . " if you take this away from them , i fear that some will not see the point of living anymore and commit suicide .

according to a news report , german pilots may be preparing for more than that , however . germany is expected to decide soon on a nato request to send reconnaissance aircraft to southern afghanistan .

traditionally , the party has staunchly opposed cutting coal subsidies . politicians promise no layoffs both glos and jürgen rüttgers , premier of north rhine-westphalia , said in the zdf interview on monday that no layoffs would be made and that coal workers should n't be worried about their livelihood . " we want to make the associated restructuring of labor as tolerable as possible , " glos said . rüttgers added that investments needed to be made in new jobs that would be more secure in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 25 million tons are mined annually in germany " in reality , it 's about starting a new chapter in the history of the ruhr valley , " he said . currently , some 34,000 miners extract 25 million tons of coal annually from eight mines in germany .
state and federal governments pay up to 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- per year in coal subsidies . merkel to continue talks monday according to the agreement made sunday , subsidy cutbacks are to be financed by putting up parts of the mining conglomerate raf for an initial public offering .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the basic idea of the principle of free speech is that you have a right , issuing from your dignity as a human being , to say what you honestly think is true .
those who believe in the arguments of holocaust revisionism meet this criterion .
there is very good evidence behind these arguments and those who support them are intellectually honest .
they are not hateful propagandists .
if the eu makes holocaust denial a crime , it makes itself a criminal against classical liberalism and the dignity of man . - kendra blewitt , san francisco how can one deny the holocaust ?
it happened .
how can one not admit the existence of israel ?
there it is .
but how long do we have to cow-tow to the wishes of the israelis ?
just get over it . - james wilder , us these laws prohibiting holocaust skepticism are evil .
it is the right of a free people to question their government publicly .
the founding fathers of the united states drew upon great european thinkers and philosophers such as voltaire and john stuart mill .
european tradition is what today 's europe should espouse , not stalinist laws to placate interest groups .
i can not express the evil with which i view any law which proscribes my right to believe or not to believe in any aspect of any historical event and to publicly state my opinion . - joseph kochanek bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did nazis carry out systematic murder ?
in germany it 's a crime to say no as long as the european union does not have a common constitution approved by all its members , it will be difficult to find consensus on the criminalization of holocaust denial . - jose nigrin the german government has a moral obligation to uphold its constitution , which guarantees any of its citizens the right to free speech .
also , a murder is a crime no matter who commits it .
to exempt one group from the rest is a violation of article 14 of the un 's international covenant on civil and political rights . - rudolf pueschel passing laws that illegalize holocaust denial is a victory against freedom of speech . - brad harris to put a man at mr. zundel 's advanced age in jail is criminal to say the least .
i thought people were allowed to think .
mr. zundel chooses to think differently .
it is n't a crime .
how many people will germany put in jail for thinking or writing books ?
shame ! - sheila fox merely expressing one 's opinion or belief , or even ignorance , will not change what has already happened and will also not make a non-occurrence an occurrence .
in this light , such a ban is laughable and infantile .
it also shows that the eu is held hostage by jewish groups and lobbies .
moreover , it is now 2007 and everyone has got over the world war two itch , other than germany , that is .
there are far more pressing issues to be taken care of than this pet obsession .
if the government wants to be a stooge to the jewish lobby , then it is up to its members to decide , but it can at no point of time force others to subscribe to its point of view . - suvrajit saha bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria , belgium , france , germany , poland , romania and spain already have laws against holocaust denial sixty years after the war 's end , nazism is again rearing its ugly head : jailing people for their speech , laws against free thought and burning books .
how can you people be so stupid ?
do you really think you are any different then hitler ? - lynda , uk what the hell is wrong with germany ?
they have been sitting around like a whipped puppy since world war two .
germany needs to openly look at the issue of the holocaust .
there is sufficient evidence that all the claims are not true .
germany has zero national pride .
you need to act like the father land and stand strong and see to what is best for your nation .
you have so much to offer god 's world .

27 was holocaust memorial day in germany .
meanwhile , germany 's efforts to criminalize holocaust denial in the eu are increasing coming up against resistance .
see what other readers had to say on the matter . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the basic idea of the principle of free speech is that you have a right , issuing from your dignity as a human being , to say what you honestly think is true .
those who believe in the arguments of holocaust revisionism meet this criterion .
there is very good evidence behind these arguments and those who support them are intellectually honest .
they are not hateful propagandists .
if the eu makes holocaust denial a crime , it makes itself a criminal against classical liberalism and the dignity of man . - kendra blewitt , san francisco how can one deny the holocaust ?
it happened .
how can one not admit the existence of israel ?
there it is .
but how long do we have to cow-tow to the wishes of the israelis ?
just get over it . - james wilder , us these laws prohibiting holocaust skepticism are evil .
it is the right of a free people to question their government publicly .
the founding fathers of the united states drew upon great european thinkers and philosophers such as voltaire and john stuart mill .
european tradition is what today 's europe should espouse , not stalinist laws to placate interest groups .
i can not express the evil with which i view any law which proscribes my right to believe or not to believe in any aspect of any historical event and to publicly state my opinion . - joseph kochanek bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did nazis carry out systematic murder ?
in germany it 's a crime to say no as long as the european union does not have a common constitution approved by all its members , it will be difficult to find consensus on the criminalization of holocaust denial . - jose nigrin the german government has a moral obligation to uphold its constitution , which guarantees any of its citizens the right to free speech .
also , a murder is a crime no matter who commits it .
to exempt one group from the rest is a violation of article 14 of the un 's international covenant on civil and political rights . - rudolf pueschel passing laws that illegalize holocaust denial is a victory against freedom of speech . - brad harris to put a man at mr. zundel 's advanced age in jail is criminal to say the least .
i thought people were allowed to think .
mr. zundel chooses to think differently .
it is n't a crime .
how many people will germany put in jail for thinking or writing books ?
shame ! - sheila fox merely expressing one 's opinion or belief , or even ignorance , will not change what has already happened and will also not make a non-occurrence an occurrence .
in this light , such a ban is laughable and infantile .
it also shows that the eu is held hostage by jewish groups and lobbies .
moreover , it is now 2007 and everyone has got over the world war two itch , other than germany , that is .
there are far more pressing issues to be taken care of than this pet obsession .
if the government wants to be a stooge to the jewish lobby , then it is up to its members to decide , but it can at no point of time force others to subscribe to its point of view . - suvrajit saha bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria , belgium , france , germany , poland , romania and spain already have laws against holocaust denial sixty years after the war 's end , nazism is again rearing its ugly head : jailing people for their speech , laws against free thought and burning books .
how can you people be so stupid ?
do you really think you are any different then hitler ? - lynda , uk what the hell is wrong with germany ?
they have been sitting around like a whipped puppy since world war two .
germany needs to openly look at the issue of the holocaust .
there is sufficient evidence that all the claims are not true .
germany has zero national pride .
you need to act like the father land and stand strong and see to what is best for your nation .
you have so much to offer god 's world .
you first need to break this " holocaust poison " that has ruined your spirit as a people . - andrew compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's pursuit of holocaust denial resolution hits skids germany 's hope of using its eu presidency to persuade all 27 member states to make holocaust denial a crime has received a setback in italy and is expected to run into more resistance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 29.01.2007 amid debate , germany 's heroin injection clinics fight to survive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for severe addicts , the injection clinics could prove life-saving germany 's conservatives are opposed to liberalizing heroin and giving free doses to the country 's worst addicts .
some say the rigid stance may jeopardize the health of hundreds of patients . last week , the cities of hamburg and frankfurt warned that injection clinics where severe heroin addicts are administered free doses of the drug under medical supervision are in danger of closure by the middle of the year if the german government doesn ’ t extend their lifetime . a failure to do so wouldn ’ t just threaten the future of the clinics in hamburg and frankfurt , but also hit heroin injection centers in five other german cities where hard-core addicts can inject themselves with diamorphine , a chemically pure form of heroin .
in addition to providing clean needles , the clinics also offer crucial psychiatric support . heroin versus methadone they were all set up in 2002 under the previous german government of social democrats and greens as part of a project modeled on similar experiments in switzerland and the netherlands to find the most effective way to treat hard-core heroin addicts , help them build a relatively normal life and eventually get them to kick the habit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the heroin injection clinic in frankfurt the project compared results between a group of patients who were put on heroin maintenance therapy and another on methadone , a heroin substitute . the findings , which were published in a study last year , found that the heroin group fared much better . " those on heroin stayed in treatment longer and the drop out is much less than the methadone group .
they had much less illicit drug use , using street heroin and cocaine , and so have better health records , ” said christian haase , a hamburg-based researcher who carried out the study . lower drug crime and better health the study ’ s conclusions in favor of heroin maintenance therapy to treat the country ’ s worst addicts has been boosted by the fact that germany ’ s heroin-overdose death rate has continually plunged in the past years and is currently at its lowest level since 1989 .
in addition , cities such as hamburg , long notorious for its open drug scene near the main railway station , have managed to stem illicit drug use and lower drug crime . “ our clinic ’ s priority has been to improve the health of patients and we have made good progress with that , ” said peter heine , a spokesman for the frankfurt mayor ’ s office .
the city ’ s heroin injection clinic has seen its patients dwindle to 59 from 93 .
“ and importantly , the clinic has helped to keep addicts off the street and prevent them from resorting to illegal means to obtain the drug , ” heine added . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is estimated to have around 1,500 severe smack addicts karin bonorden-kleij , head of the heroin injection clinic in hamburg said patient numbers had dropped to 70 from an original 200 who started therapy .
most turned clean with fewer health problems , a few dropped out while some went back to the streets . bonorden-kleij said that thanks to twice daily injections of diamorphine , more than 40 of her patients now had regular jobs - which was unthinkable when they first approached the center . conservatives resist heroin maintenance despite the therapy ’ s success , heroin maintenance treatment remains highly controversial .
the injection clinics initially sparked angry protests among residents living near them , particularly in hamburg and frankfurt .
but most have since dropped their resistance . however , politicians in germany remain split on whether the project - which has already been extended once - should be renewed beyond june 2007 . in particular , the conservatives in germany ’ s current grand coalition government are against the project . though members of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the christian social union , -lrb- csu -rrb- declined requests for interviews ; their resistance to the project on ideological and financial grounds is well known . last year , they reacted furiously to a proposal to make heroin available by prescription . " these plans are n't acceptable .
the csu wo n't approve any legislation that will make the state a drug dealer , " markus söder , general secretary of the csu told daily die welt , adding there was no way " the state will pay for the junkies ' fix " when citizens were paying ever more for their health .
the heroin maintenance project has so far cost over 12 million euros . " a big chance for germany " experts however rebuff the too-expensive argument , saying that though heroin maintenance is admittedly more expensive than methadone therapy ; the benefits far outweigh the costs . " you have to look at the bigger picture .
heroin therapy is n't expensive if you take into account the indirect costs that you save in terms of improved quality of life , productivity and improved health , " hamburg researcher haase said .

" this is a big chance for germany to take a step forward and create a modern therapy to tackle drug dependency , " haase said . legalizing heroin a sticking point the conservatives - who control the upper house of parliament and can thus block legislation - are also against changing germany ’ s drug laws to legalize heroin and approve it for medical use , a point that experts say is absolutely essential . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the opium that makes its way to the west comes from central asia " it 's really annoying that a medical discussion has been hijacked by politics , " said ralf hüllinghorst , head of the german head office for dependency matters -lrb- dhs -rrb- who stressed that heroin administration had to made part of regular health care in germany . " if heroin maintenance has proved to be effective , we have to be able to make use of it .
heroin has to be legalized and doctors should be allowed to prescribe it like in the netherlands and in switzerland . " the matter however is far from decided .
conservative members of germany 's parliament face a challenge from their own party members on the issue at the state level . hamburg which is ruled by a cdu government said last week it was kicking off a campaign to lobby support in the upper house of parliament to amend german drug laws to legalize heroin .
frankfurt too saw a rare show of support across party lines for extending its heroin injection clinic . patients stand to lose everything as the debate rumbles on , advocates of the project warn that if the german government doesn ’ t extend the project and legalize heroin it would spell disaster for hundreds of patients . " if the clinic closes and we stop the diamorphine doses , it will make everything worse for the patients who have managed to stabilize their lives , " said karin bonorden-kleij who pointed out that most of her patients had managed to break away from a life of criminality and abuse and painstakingly build a normal life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 29.01.2007 amid debate , germany 's heroin injection clinics fight to survive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for severe addicts , the injection clinics could prove life-saving germany 's conservatives are opposed to liberalizing heroin and giving free doses to the country 's worst addicts .
some say the rigid stance may jeopardize the health of hundreds of patients . last week , the cities of hamburg and frankfurt warned that injection clinics where severe heroin addicts are administered free doses of the drug under medical supervision are in danger of closure by the middle of the year if the german government doesn ’ t extend their lifetime . a failure to do so wouldn ’ t just threaten the future of the clinics in hamburg and frankfurt , but also hit heroin injection centers in five other german cities where hard-core addicts can inject themselves with diamorphine , a chemically pure form of heroin .
in addition to providing clean needles , the clinics also offer crucial psychiatric support . heroin versus methadone they were all set up in 2002 under the previous german government of social democrats and greens as part of a project modeled on similar experiments in switzerland and the netherlands to find the most effective way to treat hard-core heroin addicts , help them build a relatively normal life and eventually get them to kick the habit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the heroin injection clinic in frankfurt the project compared results between a group of patients who were put on heroin maintenance therapy and another on methadone , a heroin substitute . the findings , which were published in a study last year , found that the heroin group fared much better . " those on heroin stayed in treatment longer and the drop out is much less than the methadone group .
they had much less illicit drug use , using street heroin and cocaine , and so have better health records , ” said christian haase , a hamburg-based researcher who carried out the study . lower drug crime and better health the study ’ s conclusions in favor of heroin maintenance therapy to treat the country ’ s worst addicts has been boosted by the fact that germany ’ s heroin-overdose death rate has continually plunged in the past years and is currently at its lowest level since 1989 .
in addition , cities such as hamburg , long notorious for its open drug scene near the main railway station , have managed to stem illicit drug use and lower drug crime . “ our clinic ’ s priority has been to improve the health of patients and we have made good progress with that , ” said peter heine , a spokesman for the frankfurt mayor ’ s office .
the city ’ s heroin injection clinic has seen its patients dwindle to 59 from 93 .
“ and importantly , the clinic has helped to keep addicts off the street and prevent them from resorting to illegal means to obtain the drug , ” heine added . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is estimated to have around 1,500 severe smack addicts karin bonorden-kleij , head of the heroin injection clinic in hamburg said patient numbers had dropped to 70 from an original 200 who started therapy .
most turned clean with fewer health problems , a few dropped out while some went back to the streets . bonorden-kleij said that thanks to twice daily injections of diamorphine , more than 40 of her patients now had regular jobs - which was unthinkable when they first approached the center . conservatives resist heroin maintenance despite the therapy ’ s success , heroin maintenance treatment remains highly controversial .
the injection clinics initially sparked angry protests among residents living near them , particularly in hamburg and frankfurt .
but most have since dropped their resistance . however , politicians in germany remain split on whether the project - which has already been extended once - should be renewed beyond june 2007 . in particular , the conservatives in germany ’ s current grand coalition government are against the project . though members of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the christian social union , -lrb- csu -rrb- declined requests for interviews ; their resistance to the project on ideological and financial grounds is well known . last year , they reacted furiously to a proposal to make heroin available by prescription . " these plans are n't acceptable .
the csu wo n't approve any legislation that will make the state a drug dealer , " markus söder , general secretary of the csu told daily die welt , adding there was no way " the state will pay for the junkies ' fix " when citizens were paying ever more for their health .
the heroin maintenance project has so far cost over 12 million euros . " a big chance for germany " experts however rebuff the too-expensive argument , saying that though heroin maintenance is admittedly more expensive than methadone therapy ; the benefits far outweigh the costs . " you have to look at the bigger picture .
heroin therapy is n't expensive if you take into account the indirect costs that you save in terms of improved quality of life , productivity and improved health , " hamburg researcher haase said .
he says the therapy will cost just around 10,000 euros per patient every year for the estimated small group of germany 's 1,500 severe heroin addicts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 29.01.2007 amid debate , germany 's heroin injection clinics fight to survive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for severe addicts , the injection clinics could prove life-saving germany 's conservatives are opposed to liberalizing heroin and giving free doses to the country 's worst addicts .
some say the rigid stance may jeopardize the health of hundreds of patients . last week , the cities of hamburg and frankfurt warned that injection clinics where severe heroin addicts are administered free doses of the drug under medical supervision are in danger of closure by the middle of the year if the german government doesn ’ t extend their lifetime . a failure to do so wouldn ’ t just threaten the future of the clinics in hamburg and frankfurt , but also hit heroin injection centers in five other german cities where hard-core addicts can inject themselves with diamorphine , a chemically pure form of heroin .
in addition to providing clean needles , the clinics also offer crucial psychiatric support . heroin versus methadone they were all set up in 2002 under the previous german government of social democrats and greens as part of a project modeled on similar experiments in switzerland and the netherlands to find the most effective way to treat hard-core heroin addicts , help them build a relatively normal life and eventually get them to kick the habit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glimpse of the heroin injection clinic in frankfurt the project compared results between a group of patients who were put on heroin maintenance therapy and another on methadone , a heroin substitute . the findings , which were published in a study last year , found that the heroin group fared much better . " those on heroin stayed in treatment longer and the drop out is much less than the methadone group .
they had much less illicit drug use , using street heroin and cocaine , and so have better health records , ” said christian haase , a hamburg-based researcher who carried out the study . lower drug crime and better health the study ’ s conclusions in favor of heroin maintenance therapy to treat the country ’ s worst addicts has been boosted by the fact that germany ’ s heroin-overdose death rate has continually plunged in the past years and is currently at its lowest level since 1989 .
in addition , cities such as hamburg , long notorious for its open drug scene near the main railway station , have managed to stem illicit drug use and lower drug crime . “ our clinic ’ s priority has been to improve the health of patients and we have made good progress with that , ” said peter heine , a spokesman for the frankfurt mayor ’ s office .
the city ’ s heroin injection clinic has seen its patients dwindle to 59 from 93 .
“ and importantly , the clinic has helped to keep addicts off the street and prevent them from resorting to illegal means to obtain the drug , ” heine added . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is estimated to have around 1,500 severe smack addicts karin bonorden-kleij , head of the heroin injection clinic in hamburg said patient numbers had dropped to 70 from an original 200 who started therapy .
most turned clean with fewer health problems , a few dropped out while some went back to the streets . bonorden-kleij said that thanks to twice daily injections of diamorphine , more than 40 of her patients now had regular jobs - which was unthinkable when they first approached the center . conservatives resist heroin maintenance despite the therapy ’ s success , heroin maintenance treatment remains highly controversial .
the injection clinics initially sparked angry protests among residents living near them , particularly in hamburg and frankfurt .
but most have since dropped their resistance . however , politicians in germany remain split on whether the project - which has already been extended once - should be renewed beyond june 2007 . in particular , the conservatives in germany ’ s current grand coalition government are against the project . though members of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its sister party , the christian social union , -lrb- csu -rrb- declined requests for interviews ; their resistance to the project on ideological and financial grounds is well known . last year , they reacted furiously to a proposal to make heroin available by prescription . " these plans are n't acceptable .
the csu wo n't approve any legislation that will make the state a drug dealer , " markus söder , general secretary of the csu told daily die welt , adding there was no way " the state will pay for the junkies ' fix " when citizens were paying ever more for their health .
the heroin maintenance project has so far cost over 12 million euros . " a big chance for germany " experts however rebuff the too-expensive argument , saying that though heroin maintenance is admittedly more expensive than methadone therapy ; the benefits far outweigh the costs . " you have to look at the bigger picture .
heroin therapy is n't expensive if you take into account the indirect costs that you save in terms of improved quality of life , productivity and improved health , " hamburg researcher haase said .
he says the therapy will cost just around 10,000 euros per patient every year for the estimated small group of germany 's 1,500 severe heroin addicts . " this is a big chance for germany to take a step forward and create a modern therapy to tackle drug dependency , " haase said . legalizing heroin a sticking point the conservatives - who control the upper house of parliament and can thus block legislation - are also against changing germany ’ s drug laws to legalize heroin and approve it for medical use , a point that experts say is absolutely essential . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the opium that makes its way to the west comes from central asia " it 's really annoying that a medical discussion has been hijacked by politics , " said ralf hüllinghorst , head of the german head office for dependency matters -lrb- dhs -rrb- who stressed that heroin administration had to made part of regular health care in germany . " if heroin maintenance has proved to be effective , we have to be able to make use of it .
heroin has to be legalized and doctors should be allowed to prescribe it like in the netherlands and in switzerland . " the matter however is far from decided .
conservative members of germany 's parliament face a challenge from their own party members on the issue at the state level . hamburg which is ruled by a cdu government said last week it was kicking off a campaign to lobby support in the upper house of parliament to amend german drug laws to legalize heroin .
frankfurt too saw a rare show of support across party lines for extending its heroin injection clinic . patients stand to lose everything as the debate rumbles on , advocates of the project warn that if the german government doesn ’ t extend the project and legalize heroin it would spell disaster for hundreds of patients . " if the clinic closes and we stop the diamorphine doses , it will make everything worse for the patients who have managed to stabilize their lives , " said karin bonorden-kleij who pointed out that most of her patients had managed to break away from a life of criminality and abuse and painstakingly build a normal life . " if you take this away from them , i fear that some will not see the point of living anymore and commit suicide .

portuguese foreign minister luis amado attended as the representative of the next eu presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benita ferrero-waldner ferrero-waldner said the aim of the program was to ensure that judges " can do in the future what we take for granted " in the west . the eu funding would also go towards developing alternative crops to combat the narcotics industry in afghanistan , which is the world 's biggest opium producer . stabilizing the situation the pledge follows the announcement last week that the united states plans to spend an extra $ 10.6 billion in afghanistan over two years and to extend the tour of duty of more than 3,000 us troops there by four months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british nato soldier in kabul at washington 's urging , nato has agreed to step up military efforts in spring when taliban insurgents are expected to intensify their offensive .

the new package for the period 2007-2010 , will also focus on health , apart from rural development and the reform of the justice sector . over the next few months , the eu 's executive arm plans to place experts in key justice institutions - the justice ministry , supreme court and the attorney general 's office - to help draw up reform plans for afghanistan 's judiciary and legal services . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in berlin on monday that it was increasingly likely that eu badge-wearing police advisors would be sent to afghanistan soon .
" an eu police mission in afghanistan is very likely , " solana said in a speech to a conference on european security and defence policy which followed the aid announcement .
eu member states last week gave the green light for such a mission to support the nato-led military and reconstruction campaign in afghanistan . german experts are already helping to train afghanistan 's police force . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : german pilots train for combat in afghanistan germany is expected to decide soon on a nato request to send reconnaissance aircraft to southern afghanistan .

premier peter beattie said he had scrapped a referendum on the issue , because there was no longer a choice .
he also warned other australian states might eventually have to do the same because of mounting water shortages .
water is already recycled in places like singapore and the uk , but the idea is still unpopular in australia .
but the country is currently suffering from a severe drought - the worst on record .
last week prime minister john howard declared water security to be the biggest challenge currently facing australia , and he announced a a $ 10bn -lrb- $ 7.7bn ; £ 3.9bn -rrb- package to tackle the problem .
mr beattie said that falling water levels had left his state administration with no option but to introduce recycled water in south-eastern queensland , starting from next year .
" we 're not getting rain ; we 've got no choice , " he told abc radio .
" these are ugly decisions , but you either drink water or you die .
there 's no choice .
it 's liquid gold , it 's a matter of life and death , " he said .
mr howard supported mr beattie 's comments , telling a sydney radio station : " i 've advocated recycling for a long time ...
i am very strongly in favour of recycling , and mr beattie is right . "
but mike rann , the premier of south australia , and morris iemma , the premier of new south wales , rejected the queensland plan - with mr rann ruling out using recycled sewage for anything but irrigation .
malcolm turnbull , the new environment and water resources minister , asked other states to be more open-minded on the issue .
" do n't rule out desalination because it is expensive , or recycling because it sounds yucky , or building a dam , " mr turnbull told australian media .
" put everything on the table , assess all the economic , environmental and financial costs and then make a decision . "
river row ahead of an election next year , mr howard and his federal administration are eager to be seen to be tackling environmental problems .
mr howard announced last week that the federal government wanted to take over the murray-darling river system - the country 's most precious water resource , which provides supplies for most of australia 's irrigated farm land .
the controversial plan would be the biggest reform of water management in the country 's history .
the four state governments which manage it are currently controlled by the opposition labor party , which has argued that the new proposals represent an unacceptable power grab by the prime minister .

premier peter beattie said he had scrapped a referendum on the issue , because there was no longer a choice .
he also warned other australian states might eventually have to do the same because of mounting water shortages .
water is already recycled in places like singapore and the uk , but the idea is still unpopular in australia .
but the country is currently suffering from a severe drought - the worst on record .
last week prime minister john howard declared water security to be the biggest challenge currently facing australia , and he announced a a $ 10bn -lrb- $ 7.7bn ; £ 3.9bn -rrb- package to tackle the problem .
mr beattie said that falling water levels had left his state administration with no option but to introduce recycled water in south-eastern queensland , starting from next year .
" we 're not getting rain ; we 've got no choice , " he told abc radio .
" these are ugly decisions , but you either drink water or you die .
there 's no choice .
it 's liquid gold , it 's a matter of life and death , " he said .
mr howard supported mr beattie 's comments , telling a sydney radio station : " i 've advocated recycling for a long time ...
i am very strongly in favour of recycling , and mr beattie is right . "
but mike rann , the premier of south australia , and morris iemma , the premier of new south wales , rejected the queensland plan - with mr rann ruling out using recycled sewage for anything but irrigation .
malcolm turnbull , the new environment and water resources minister , asked other states to be more open-minded on the issue .
" do n't rule out desalination because it is expensive , or recycling because it sounds yucky , or building a dam , " mr turnbull told australian media .
" put everything on the table , assess all the economic , environmental and financial costs and then make a decision . "
river row ahead of an election next year , mr howard and his federal administration are eager to be seen to be tackling environmental problems .
mr howard announced last week that the federal government wanted to take over the murray-darling river system - the country 's most precious water resource , which provides supplies for most of australia 's irrigated farm land .
the controversial plan would be the biggest reform of water management in the country 's history .
the four state governments which manage it are currently controlled by the opposition labor party , which has argued that the new proposals represent an unacceptable power grab by the prime minister .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- panorama -pipe- secrets of the drug trials bbc news / panorama graphics version bbc sport home 05:58 gmt , monday , 29 january 2007 secrets of the drug trials secret emails reveal that the uk 's biggest drug company distorted trial results of an anti-depressant , covering up a link with suicide in teenagers .
panorama reveals that glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- attempted to show that seroxat worked for depressed children despite failed clinical trials .
and that gsk-employed ghostwriters influenced ' independent ' academics .
gsk told panorama : " gsk utterly rejects any suggestion that it has improperly withheld drug trial information . "
read a statement from gsk your stories and views read transcript gsk faces action in the us where bereaved families have joined together to sue the company .
as a result , gsk has been forced to open its confidential internal archive .
karen barth menzies is a partner in one of the firms representing many of the families .
she has examined thousands of the documents which are stored , box upon box , in an apartment in malibu , california .
she said : " even when they have negative studies that show that this drug seroxat is going to harm some kids they still spin that study as remarkably effective and safe for children . "
gsk 's biggest clinical trial of seroxat on children was held in the us in the 1990s and called study 329 .
child psychiatrist dr neal ryan of the university of pittsburgh was paid by gsk as a co-author of study 329 .
in 2002 he also gave a talk on childhood depression at a medical conference sponsored by gsk .
he said that seroxat could be a suitable treatment for children and later told panorama reporter shelley jofre that it probably lowered rather than raised suicide rates .
in amongst the archive of emails in malibu , shelley was surprised to find that her own emails to dr ryan from 2002 asking questions about the safety of seroxat had been forwarded to gsk asking for advice on how to respond to her .
she also found an email from a public relations executive working for gsk which said : " originally we had planned to do extensive media relations surrounding this study until we actually viewed the results .
" essentially the study did not really show it was effective in treating adolescent depression , which is not something we want to publicise . "
but the article was published in the journal of the american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry which says it ranks as number one in child mental health in the world .
the editor in chief of the british medical journal , fiona godlee , said that what she calls the " blind-eye culture of medicine " should be exposed by professionals .
she has written in response to the panorama film : " we should n't have to rely on investigative journalists to ask the difficult questions .
" reputations for sale are reputations at risk .
we need to make that risk so high it 's not worth taking . "
read fiona godlee 's reaction to panorama the medicine and healthcare products regulatory authority -lrb- mhra -rrb- began a criminal investigation into gsk three years ago but no action has been taken yet .
a spokesperson told panorama that the investigation has been given substantial additional resources and remains a high priority .
seroxat was banned for under 18s in 2003 after the mhra , revealed that gsk 's own studies showed the drug actually trebles the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviour in depressed children .

panorama reveals that glaxosmithkline -lrb- gsk -rrb- attempted to show that seroxat worked for depressed children despite failed clinical trials .
and that gsk-employed ghostwriters influenced ' independent ' academics .
gsk told panorama : " gsk utterly rejects any suggestion that it has improperly withheld drug trial information . "
read a statement from gsk your stories and views read transcript gsk faces action in the us where bereaved families have joined together to sue the company .
as a result , gsk has been forced to open its confidential internal archive .
karen barth menzies is a partner in one of the firms representing many of the families .
she has examined thousands of the documents which are stored , box upon box , in an apartment in malibu , california .
she said : " even when they have negative studies that show that this drug seroxat is going to harm some kids they still spin that study as remarkably effective and safe for children . "
gsk 's biggest clinical trial of seroxat on children was held in the us in the 1990s and called study 329 .
child psychiatrist dr neal ryan of the university of pittsburgh was paid by gsk as a co-author of study 329 .
in 2002 he also gave a talk on childhood depression at a medical conference sponsored by gsk .
he said that seroxat could be a suitable treatment for children and later told panorama reporter shelley jofre that it probably lowered rather than raised suicide rates .
in amongst the archive of emails in malibu , shelley was surprised to find that her own emails to dr ryan from 2002 asking questions about the safety of seroxat had been forwarded to gsk asking for advice on how to respond to her .
she also found an email from a public relations executive working for gsk which said : " originally we had planned to do extensive media relations surrounding this study until we actually viewed the results .
" essentially the study did not really show it was effective in treating adolescent depression , which is not something we want to publicise . "
but the article was published in the journal of the american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry which says it ranks as number one in child mental health in the world .
the editor in chief of the british medical journal , fiona godlee , said that what she calls the " blind-eye culture of medicine " should be exposed by professionals .
she has written in response to the panorama film : " we should n't have to rely on investigative journalists to ask the difficult questions .
" reputations for sale are reputations at risk .
we need to make that risk so high it 's not worth taking . "
read fiona godlee 's reaction to panorama the medicine and healthcare products regulatory authority -lrb- mhra -rrb- began a criminal investigation into gsk three years ago but no action has been taken yet .
a spokesperson told panorama that the investigation has been given substantial additional resources and remains a high priority .
seroxat was banned for under 18s in 2003 after the mhra , revealed that gsk 's own studies showed the drug actually trebles the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviour in depressed children .

both sides want to reach an agreement to avoid a 48-hour walkout on tuesday 30 january and wednesday 31 january .
the dispute is over sickness absence , pay and staffing at the airline .
ba has already cancelled all flights out of heathrow and domestic and european flights out of gatwick for the duration of the strike .
the talks - being personally led by ba chief executive willie walsh - were adjourned on sunday night , and will restart just hours before the proposed industrial action is due to start .
ba 's mr walsh will be meeting with the t & g 's general secretary , tony woodley , and senior members of both organisations will also be attending the talks .
' day and night ' earlier , ba had sent an e-mail to customers to say that the strikes were going ahead .
in its message ba said that it " was committed to finding a resolution " to the proposed strike .
it had been reported in the mail on sunday that the company was paying cash " sweeteners " to tempt staff to break any potential strike , but ba says any money is simply expenses to cover taxi journeys made by non-union staff who will work during the strike and want to avoid picket lines .
" we are working day and night to try to come to an agreement with the t & g that will stop any further planned strikes from taking place , " it added .
unless a solution to the dispute is found , a second three-day strike is possible for 5 to 7 february , and a third three-day strike possible for 12 to 14 february .
sick leave row if the strike goes ahead , all flights from heathrow airport will be cancelled , as well as all domestic and european ba-operated flights to and from gatwick .

ba has said it wants customers to have sufficient warning of its contingency plans for the strike days , to give them enough time to make alternative travel arrangements .
passengers due to travel on one of the strike days can either change their flights to another date , at no extra charge , or else gain a full refund .
new rules in all , 1,300 ba flights will be cancelled over the two days .
out of the airline 's 14,000 cabin crew , about 11,000 are members of the t & g - 96 % of whom voted for strike action .
have your say it is the travelling public that suffers from disruptions due to industrial actions such as these diana , johannesburg send us your comments profile : willie walsh they have complained that a new regime on sickness pay , introduced 18 months ago , means they are forced to work when they are ill .
ba insists the measures were needed to cut high levels of sickness absence .
staff now take an average of 12 days sick leave each year - down from 22 days before the new rules were brought in , the airline says .
starter pay rates for crew members , overall pay grading and promotion opportunities are also subject to dispute , with the union unhappy that the starting wage for staff is £ 10,000 .
the union also wants the introduction of a single pay arrangement for cabin crew staff , rather than the existing two tier system , with staff who joined after 1997 being paid less than those employed before that date .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- panorama -pipe- seroxat : statement from glaxosmithkline bbc news / panorama graphics version bbc sport home monday , 29 january 2007 , 06:15 gmt seroxat : statement from glaxosmithkline " in developing seroxat , gsk has always been strongly conscious of the duty it owes to the millions of patients who suffer from depression and refutes any allegation that it has failed in this duty .
gsk utterly rejects any suggestion that it has improperly withheld drug trial information .
depression is a severe and disabling condition and a well-recognised tragic outcome of the disease , particularly among young people , is suicide .
careful monitoring of all patients is essential , regardless of whether they are taking medication or not .
gsk conducted nine studies over eight years to examine the use of seroxat in treating children , those under the age of 18 , with depression and other psychiatric disorders as treatment options for these vulnerable patients are extremely limited .
results from these studies were documented and submitted to regulators in accordance with regulatory requirements .
no suicides were reported in any of the nine paediatric trials conducted by gsk and when reviewed individually none of these trials were considered by gsk or independent investigators to show a clinically meaningful increase in the rate of suicidal thinking or attempted suicide .
only when all the data became available , at the end of the research programme , and were analysed together was an increased rate of suicidal thinking or attempted suicide revealed in those paediatric patients taking seroxat .
gsk brought this analysis to the attention of the regulatory authorities , including in the uk .
seroxat has never been approved by eu or us regulators as a medicine for those under 18 years of age and gsk 's uk product labelling has been entirely consistent with that position stating : " the use of seroxat in children is not recommended , as safety and efficacy have not been established in this population . "
disclosure of paediatric clinical trial results from 1994 to 2002 , nine paediatric trials were conducted in depression , obsessive compulsive disorder , and social anxiety disorder , involving over 1,000 patients treated with seroxat .
the study results from the individual trials were provided to regulatory agencies worldwide in accordance with regulatory requirements .
upon completion of the individual studies , safety and efficacy data were also communicated publicly in a variety of formats such as peer-reviewed journals , and poster presentations at scientific meetings , as is common practice in the disclosure of data .
study 329 was complete in late 1998 and was first submitted for journal publication in mid 1999 .
full results of the trial were published in the journal of the american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry in 2001 .
the study was also presented at several scientific meetings between 1998 to 2000 .
study 377 was also completed in late 1998 .
it was presented at the american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry meeting in 1999 and was referenced in a number of psychiatry journals from 2000 .
however , opportunities to publish these data in a scientific journal were limited as the study failed to establish efficacy for seroxat .
study 701 was completed in 2001 .
the data were presented as part of a combine publication at the scientific meeting ncdeu -lrb- new clinical drug evaluation unit -rrb- in 2002 and referenced in the psychopharmacology bulletin in 2003 .
analysis of data from paediatric clinical trial results no suicides were reported in any of the nine paediatric trials conducted by gsk and none of these trials when reviewed individually by gsk or independent investigator showed a clinically meaningful increase in the rate of suicidal thinking or attempted suicide .
in the case of study 329 although a numerical difference in adverse events was observed by the company and the study 's investigators , for patients taking seroxat compared to placebo , these findings were not , by themselves , considered clinically meaningful due to the limited number of patients involved and the fact that suicidal thinking and behaviour is a recognised symptom of the underlying disease .
of the adverse events reported in this blinded study -lrb- where the patient , investigator and company do not know whether the patient received seroxat or a dummy pill -rrb- only one - headache - was attributed by the independent investors to seroxat .
this opinion was published in the journal of american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry in july 2001 .
the subsequent paediatric studies - 377 and 710 - also were not considered to show any increased rate of suicidal thinking or attempted suicide .
only when all the data became available at the end of the research programme and were analysed together was an increased rate revealed in those paediatric patients taking seroxat .
gsk brought this analysis to the attention of the regulatory authorities , including in the uk .
your reference to " the possibility of obtaining a safety statement was considered but rejected " needs clarification .
this showed that gsk had an honest belief that these preliminary data on safety were reassuring as the company was considering whether to submit new -lrb- more positive -rrb- safety wording for inclusion in the product 's label to regulators for approval .
however , it was recognised that any submission could only be made in the context of efficacy as well as safety .
given the failure of study 377 to demonstrate efficacy , it was rightly concluded that a submission for new wording on safety should not be made .
promotion of seroxat for treatment of paediatric depression seroxat has never been approved by eu or us regulators as a medicine for those under 18 years of age .
any decision to prescribe a medicine outside its authorised indications , in the eu or the us , is made by a doctor on the basis of his / her clinical judgement and the interests of their patient .
gsk does not promote its medicines for indications for which they are not approved and the company strongly refutes any suggestion that seroxat was promoted to uk doctors for use outside the terms of the uk marketing authorisation , whether through clinical experts -lrb- kols -rrb- or any other route .
internal documents prepared by gsk 's us subsidiary were specific to that subsidiary and were not distributed to the company 's uk subsidiary or market .
a memo sent to the company 's us sales force was produced to inform the sales force of the publication of study 329 in the journal of american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry .
as is clearly stated in the memo , this information was not to be used with , or distributed to , physicians , consistent with gsk 's global policy prohibiting off-label promotion .
this memo was never issued or used by sales representatives outside of the united states , and would not have been seen in the uk .
the company did periodically receive direct unsolicited requests from doctors for medical information about use of seroxat to treat children and adolescents with depression .
as is standard practice , a ' medical information letter ' , was sent to the individual doctor .
this letter identified published literature and clearly stated that seroxat was not authorised for use in depression in patients under 18 years of age . "

careful monitoring of all patients is essential , regardless of whether they are taking medication or not .
gsk conducted nine studies over eight years to examine the use of seroxat in treating children , those under the age of 18 , with depression and other psychiatric disorders as treatment options for these vulnerable patients are extremely limited .
results from these studies were documented and submitted to regulators in accordance with regulatory requirements .
no suicides were reported in any of the nine paediatric trials conducted by gsk and when reviewed individually none of these trials were considered by gsk or independent investigators to show a clinically meaningful increase in the rate of suicidal thinking or attempted suicide .
only when all the data became available , at the end of the research programme , and were analysed together was an increased rate of suicidal thinking or attempted suicide revealed in those paediatric patients taking seroxat .
gsk brought this analysis to the attention of the regulatory authorities , including in the uk .
seroxat has never been approved by eu or us regulators as a medicine for those under 18 years of age and gsk 's uk product labelling has been entirely consistent with that position stating : " the use of seroxat in children is not recommended , as safety and efficacy have not been established in this population . "
disclosure of paediatric clinical trial results from 1994 to 2002 , nine paediatric trials were conducted in depression , obsessive compulsive disorder , and social anxiety disorder , involving over 1,000 patients treated with seroxat .
the study results from the individual trials were provided to regulatory agencies worldwide in accordance with regulatory requirements .
upon completion of the individual studies , safety and efficacy data were also communicated publicly in a variety of formats such as peer-reviewed journals , and poster presentations at scientific meetings , as is common practice in the disclosure of data .
study 329 was complete in late 1998 and was first submitted for journal publication in mid 1999 .
full results of the trial were published in the journal of the american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry in 2001 .
the study was also presented at several scientific meetings between 1998 to 2000 .
study 377 was also completed in late 1998 .
it was presented at the american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry meeting in 1999 and was referenced in a number of psychiatry journals from 2000 .
however , opportunities to publish these data in a scientific journal were limited as the study failed to establish efficacy for seroxat .
study 701 was completed in 2001 .
the data were presented as part of a combine publication at the scientific meeting ncdeu -lrb- new clinical drug evaluation unit -rrb- in 2002 and referenced in the psychopharmacology bulletin in 2003 .
analysis of data from paediatric clinical trial results no suicides were reported in any of the nine paediatric trials conducted by gsk and none of these trials when reviewed individually by gsk or independent investigator showed a clinically meaningful increase in the rate of suicidal thinking or attempted suicide .
in the case of study 329 although a numerical difference in adverse events was observed by the company and the study 's investigators , for patients taking seroxat compared to placebo , these findings were not , by themselves , considered clinically meaningful due to the limited number of patients involved and the fact that suicidal thinking and behaviour is a recognised symptom of the underlying disease .
of the adverse events reported in this blinded study -lrb- where the patient , investigator and company do not know whether the patient received seroxat or a dummy pill -rrb- only one - headache - was attributed by the independent investors to seroxat .
this opinion was published in the journal of american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry in july 2001 .
the subsequent paediatric studies - 377 and 710 - also were not considered to show any increased rate of suicidal thinking or attempted suicide .
only when all the data became available at the end of the research programme and were analysed together was an increased rate revealed in those paediatric patients taking seroxat .
gsk brought this analysis to the attention of the regulatory authorities , including in the uk .
your reference to " the possibility of obtaining a safety statement was considered but rejected " needs clarification .
this showed that gsk had an honest belief that these preliminary data on safety were reassuring as the company was considering whether to submit new -lrb- more positive -rrb- safety wording for inclusion in the product 's label to regulators for approval .
however , it was recognised that any submission could only be made in the context of efficacy as well as safety .
given the failure of study 377 to demonstrate efficacy , it was rightly concluded that a submission for new wording on safety should not be made .
promotion of seroxat for treatment of paediatric depression seroxat has never been approved by eu or us regulators as a medicine for those under 18 years of age .
any decision to prescribe a medicine outside its authorised indications , in the eu or the us , is made by a doctor on the basis of his / her clinical judgement and the interests of their patient .
gsk does not promote its medicines for indications for which they are not approved and the company strongly refutes any suggestion that seroxat was promoted to uk doctors for use outside the terms of the uk marketing authorisation , whether through clinical experts -lrb- kols -rrb- or any other route .
internal documents prepared by gsk 's us subsidiary were specific to that subsidiary and were not distributed to the company 's uk subsidiary or market .
a memo sent to the company 's us sales force was produced to inform the sales force of the publication of study 329 in the journal of american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry .
as is clearly stated in the memo , this information was not to be used with , or distributed to , physicians , consistent with gsk 's global policy prohibiting off-label promotion .
this memo was never issued or used by sales representatives outside of the united states , and would not have been seen in the uk .
the company did periodically receive direct unsolicited requests from doctors for medical information about use of seroxat to treat children and adolescents with depression .
as is standard practice , a ' medical information letter ' , was sent to the individual doctor .
this letter identified published literature and clearly stated that seroxat was not authorised for use in depression in patients under 18 years of age .

in the case of study 329 although a numerical difference in adverse events was observed by the company and the study 's investigators , for patients taking seroxat compared to placebo , these findings were not , by themselves , considered clinically meaningful due to the limited number of patients involved and the fact that suicidal thinking and behaviour is a recognised symptom of the underlying disease .
of the adverse events reported in this blinded study -lrb- where the patient , investigator and company do not know whether the patient received seroxat or a dummy pill -rrb- only one - headache - was attributed by the independent investors to seroxat .
this opinion was published in the journal of american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry in july 2001 .
the subsequent paediatric studies - 377 and 710 - also were not considered to show any increased rate of suicidal thinking or attempted suicide .
only when all the data became available at the end of the research programme and were analysed together was an increased rate revealed in those paediatric patients taking seroxat .
gsk brought this analysis to the attention of the regulatory authorities , including in the uk .
your reference to " the possibility of obtaining a safety statement was considered but rejected " needs clarification .
this showed that gsk had an honest belief that these preliminary data on safety were reassuring as the company was considering whether to submit new -lrb- more positive -rrb- safety wording for inclusion in the product 's label to regulators for approval .
however , it was recognised that any submission could only be made in the context of efficacy as well as safety .
given the failure of study 377 to demonstrate efficacy , it was rightly concluded that a submission for new wording on safety should not be made .
promotion of seroxat for treatment of paediatric depression seroxat has never been approved by eu or us regulators as a medicine for those under 18 years of age .
any decision to prescribe a medicine outside its authorised indications , in the eu or the us , is made by a doctor on the basis of his / her clinical judgement and the interests of their patient .
gsk does not promote its medicines for indications for which they are not approved and the company strongly refutes any suggestion that seroxat was promoted to uk doctors for use outside the terms of the uk marketing authorisation , whether through clinical experts -lrb- kols -rrb- or any other route .
internal documents prepared by gsk 's us subsidiary were specific to that subsidiary and were not distributed to the company 's uk subsidiary or market .
a memo sent to the company 's us sales force was produced to inform the sales force of the publication of study 329 in the journal of american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry .
as is clearly stated in the memo , this information was not to be used with , or distributed to , physicians , consistent with gsk 's global policy prohibiting off-label promotion .
this memo was never issued or used by sales representatives outside of the united states , and would not have been seen in the uk .
the company did periodically receive direct unsolicited requests from doctors for medical information about use of seroxat to treat children and adolescents with depression .
as is standard practice , a ' medical information letter ' , was sent to the individual doctor .
this letter identified published literature and clearly stated that seroxat was not authorised for use in depression in patients under 18 years of age .

fiona godlee is the editor in chief of the british medical journal and has written this article about secrets of the drugs trials .
panorama 's account of glaxosmithkline 's successful attempts to market seroxat for use in children , despite the fact that its own published trial found evidence of serious adverse effects and failed to show benefit , is fascinating but depressingly familiar .
what is even more depressing is that such behaviour is still so widely tolerated within medicine .
there has been no shortage of outcry or official condemnation - including clear statements from the world association of medical editors , the international committee of medical journal editors , and industry itself through its good publication practice guidelines - that undeclared conflicts of interest and ghost writing are unacceptable .
but , you might reasonably ask , what use are such huffings and puffings in the face of the individual rewards on offer from drug companies .
let 's be clear what is and is not acceptable .
there is nothing wrong with getting help from medical writers , provided they and their source of funding are clearly acknowledged .
nor is there anything wrong with academics or clinicians working with industry , provided they remain personally accountable for everything they say .
what is clearly wrong is writers , academics , or clinicians concealing under their coat tails an army of company spin doctors intent on distorting the scientific record .
legislation is not going to happen soon - the powerful industry lobby will make sure of that .
regulation is still inadequate .
so what can we do to change the blind-eye culture of medicine ?
in the interests of patients and professional integrity i suggest intolerance and exposure .
we should n't have to rely on investigative journalists to ask the difficult questions .
so at meetings , why not slow hand clap any speaker who does not begin their talk with a sentence or slide declaring their conflicts of interest ?
and if journals discover authors who are guests on their own papers , they should report them to their institution , admonish them in the journal and probably retract the paper .

the mother of a teenager from cwmbran , torfaen , who died in her bedroom in 2005 , said not enough was known about carbon monoxide dangers in the home .
the co gas safety campaign told bbc wales ' eye on wales that the industry should pay for mainstream tv adverts .
the energy retail association said it was spending " millions " on campaigning .
anne mitchell said that she knew little about the dangers of carbon monoxide , when her 14-year-old daughter alex died in march 2005 .
she was overcome by fumes from a faulty fire , installed only three months earlier .
the man who fitted the fire was not qualified .
he later admitted manslaughter and was jailed for two years last october . "
we 've already risen to the challenge and achieved a target of reducing the number of fatal incidents by a minimum of 20 % by 2010 " energy retail association " you 'd heard of it , but it always happens to someone else , " said mrs mitchell .
" there was n't any information available that was given to me by the installer ; the fitter never ever mentioned carbon monoxide at any time or told me of any dangers .
had he done or said ' get an alarm ' , alex would still be here . "
on the day alex died , she had been at home alone with the family 's pet dog and they were found when mrs mitchell returned home from work .
at the time , the health and safety executive -lrb- hse -rrb- said the case proved the dangers posed by faulty or incorrectly fitted or tested gas appliances .
official figures suggest that every year in the uk , between 20 and 30 people are killed by fumes leaking from faulty home gas appliances .
the hse has undertaken a year-long review of gas safety and its recommendations are awaiting ministerial approval .
the review included a survey of 600 homes by dr ben croxford of university college , london .
he found that one in five of all homes with gas had a problem appliance - usually a fire or cooker .
while the fieldwork was carried out in london , dr croxford told bbc wales that it was " common sense " that the figure was likely to be as bad in wales .

ms trotter said : " we have a very wealthy fuel industry .
why is n't the government forcing the companies to provide the money by imposing a mandatory levy - or the government could provide the money itself ? "

the mother of a teenager from cwmbran , torfaen , who died in her bedroom in 2005 , said not enough was known about carbon monoxide dangers in the home .
the co gas safety campaign told bbc wales ' eye on wales that the industry should pay for mainstream tv adverts .
the energy retail association said it was spending " millions " on campaigning .
anne mitchell said that she knew little about the dangers of carbon monoxide , when her 14-year-old daughter alex died in march 2005 .
she was overcome by fumes from a faulty fire , installed only three months earlier .
the man who fitted the fire was not qualified .
he later admitted manslaughter and was jailed for two years last october .
we 've already risen to the challenge and achieved a target of reducing the number of fatal incidents by a minimum of 20 % by 2010 energy retail association " you 'd heard of it , but it always happens to someone else , " said mrs mitchell .
" there was n't any information available that was given to me by the installer ; the fitter never ever mentioned carbon monoxide at any time or told me of any dangers .
had he done or said ' get an alarm ' , alex would still be here . "
on the day alex died , she had been at home alone with the family 's pet dog and they were found when mrs mitchell returned home from work .
at the time , the health and safety executive -lrb- hse -rrb- said the case proved the dangers posed by faulty or incorrectly fitted or tested gas appliances .
official figures suggest that every year in the uk , between 20 and 30 people are killed by fumes leaking from faulty home gas appliances .
the hse has undertaken a year-long review of gas safety and its recommendations are awaiting ministerial approval .
the review included a survey of 600 homes by dr ben croxford of university college , london .
he found that one in five of all homes with gas had a problem appliance - usually a fire or cooker .
while the fieldwork was carried out in london , dr croxford told bbc wales that it was " common sense " that the figure was likely to be as bad in wales .
tell-tale signs on appliances yellow or orange flames , unless fuel-effect fire soot or stains around the appliance a pilot light that frequently blows out source : hse stephanie trotter , director of campaign group co gas safety , said the industry should finance network tv adverts to raise public awareness .
she criticised the winter advertising campaign only being run on cable and satellite channels and said it needed a profile , similar to anti-smoking and anti-drink driving campaigns .
ms trotter said : " we have a very wealthy fuel industry .
why is n't the government forcing the companies to provide the money by imposing a mandatory levy - or the government could provide the money itself ? "
the energy retail association defended its members ' safety record .
a spokesman said : " we 've already risen to the challenge and achieved a target of reducing the number of fatal incidents by a minimum of 20 % by 2010 .

ravi chopra , son of director br chopra , told the indian express newspaper : " his music had a signature feel of its own , it made listeners go crazy - remember those signature hoof beats ? "
br chopra directed the hugely successful naya daur -lrb- a new era -rrb- which stood out not just for its star cast including dilip kumar and vyjantimala bali , but also for its foot-tapping music .
nayyar , who was born in lahore in undivided india in 1926 , is survived by his wife , son and three daughters .
but he was living with a friend 's family after having split from his own more than a decade ago .
his lawyer and friend , shailesh sadekar , told the bbc that nayyar went about his normal routine during the day .
" around the afternoon , he went to the bathroom where he suddenly became unwell and collapsed , " mr sadekar said .
he said nayyar had often told them that on his demise , his family should not be called and they have respected his wish .
all-time favourite nayyar got his first break in films in 1949 , and his career was at its peak in the 1950s and 1960s when he composed music for scores of bollywood films .

from 1 february the new higher rates of air passenger duty -lrb- apd -rrb- come into force .
most airlines , both uk and foreign , have started collecting it retrospectively from passengers who bought their tickets before 6 december 2006 -lrb- or in some cases a bit later -rrb- when the chancellor made his announcement to increase the tax .
some passengers though may have to pay up at the check-in desk .
from thursday , the duty will double to : economy class flights in europe , including internal uk flights : £ 10 business and first class flights in europe : £ 20 economy class long-haul flights : £ 40 business and first class long-haul flights : £ 80 the tax rise does not affect package holiday bookings made before the chancellor 's announcement as the tour operators have had to absorb this increase themselves .
given the disruption already facing ba , the airline must now be grateful that it decided right from the start that it would be too much hassle to collect the extra tax from its passengers .
instead it will take the extra £ 11m cost on the chin .
however things are different at other uk airlines .
virgin atlantic virgin has already levied the tax on tickets bought from 13 december 2006 onwards where the flight is from 1 february .
it has been urging its customers who bought tickets before that date to pay the extra tax via its web site at least 48hrs ahead of flying , to print off the receipt and bring it with them .
those handing a receipt in at the check-in desk will get a sweetener - a discount voucher for a future flight with virgin , amounting to £ 20 off an economy trip or £ 40 off a premium economy or upper class ticket . "
staff will be going up and down the queues telling people if they have to pay " virgin atlantic spokeswoman in other words they are being offered the extra tax back if they fly again with the airline .
" staff will be going up and down the queues telling people if they have to pay , " said a spokeswoman .
those passengers who have not paid in advance will have to pay when they check in , either by cash or debit or credit card .
cheques will not be accepted .
anyone paying in advance but who is not on the airline 's list -lrb- perhaps because they have paid very late -rrb- and who also forgets to bring the receipt with them , will have to pay again .
but they will be able to reclaim the excess payment later .
anyone refusing to pay the extra duty will not be allowed to fly .
extra staff will be on duty to handle the situation , the airline says .
easyjet e-mails have been sent out three times to between 300,000 and 350,000 customers who will be flying in the two months from this thursday , but who bought their tickets before gordon brown 's announcement . "
we are not expecting any significant trouble collecting the money on the day " toby nicol , easyjet they have been urged to pay £ 5 each to cover the extra tax via the easyjet website .
travellers who have not done so will simply have to pay up when they check in .
" we are not expecting any significant trouble collecting the money on the day , " said easyjet spokesman toby nicol .
however the airline does not know how many of its passengers have paid in advance or will pay on the day .
cash , cheques , credit and debt cards will all be accepted .
ryanair ryanair has been engaged in a high-profile campaign against the tax , denouncing it as " ridiculous and anti-consumer " .
customers who bought tickets before 7 december for travel from thursday onwards have had the extra tax deducted from the credit or debit card used to make the original booking .
customers have been told in advance by e-mail that this would happen .
flybe the airline is based at regional airports like exeter , southampton , birmingham , glasgow and aberdeen and more than 80 % of its booking are over the internet . "
we expect little more than a trickle of passengers paying on the day " niall duffy , flybe it has already collected more than 70 % of the extra tax being levied for february .
it is charging its customers a flat £ 5 for flights booked before 11 december .
" we are asking them to pay seven days before - and they will have to pay before they get on the plane " said spokesman niall duffy .
but this has not happened automatically - with customers having to pay via the airline 's website or by calling its customer booking number .
anyone failing to do so will have to pay on the day at check-in .
" we expect little more than a trickle of passengers paying on the day " , mr duffy said .
bmi & bmibaby bmi and its low cost subsidiary bmibaby have adopted different policies , so far .
bmi has not been collecting the tax from those passengers who bought tickets before the chancellor 's announcement .
however bmibaby , has been doing so .
passengers who bought their tickets before december 9th are having their debit or credit cards automatically debited for the extra tax .
all affected passengers should have received an e-mail telling them this would happen .
and if they bought their ticket through a travel agent then the agent may now be asking for the top-up payment .
but what if the original credit card has expired or been cancelled so that no payment can be deducted ?
bmibaby says if the tax has not been collected by the day of departure then it must be paid at the airport - otherwise the passenger will not be allowed to board .

a senior manager at lottery operator camelot has discovered that adopting different online identities is not as straightforward as it might appear , and it seems to have cost her her job .
the contract to run the uk national lottery comes up for renewal in 2009 , and camelot is obviously very interested in the competition .
however things got out of hand when the company 's media relations manager alexia latham used a fake google mail address to try to find information about other companies bidding for the contract .
posing as an mba student she sent e-mails to independent lottery consultant glenn barry , but unfortunately she did not do a very good job of covering her tracks .
e-mails to the fake account were automatically sent to her work address , but she forgot to turn this off when she went away for christmas .
as a result an e-mail from barry to her google account received an " out of office " response from her camelot e-mail address , and her deception was uncovered .
latham , who resigned in january , is not the only person to assume that e-mails and other online activities can easily be protected from prying eyes .
these days television is just one way of using a screen , and not necessarily the most popular one bill thompson last week 's newspapers featured several stories about the ongoing investigation into allegations of sales of honours by the labour government , and many of them focused on e-mail messages that the police are believed to have recovered from computers .
while the police have refused to comment on this aspect of their investigation it is certainly possible to recover apparently deleted e-mails or other files from computers and it would not be at all surprising if messages which had been " deleted " were still accessible .
e-mails are particularly hard to get rid of , since as well as the copies on the sending and receiving computers they pass through mail servers as they are transmitted , and the servers may have their own archives .
you might think that the people responsible for running the country would be aware of this aspect of the technology they use , but very few of us seem to know what is going on when we sit down at a computer .
in fact this sort of thing has been going on for a surprisingly long time .
back in 1986 ronald reagan 's presidency was rocked when it was discovered that his officials had secretly been funding the nicaraguan contras from the proceeds of arms sales to iran , ignoring laws passed by congress making both sides of the deal illegal .
part of the evidence against conspirators oliver north and john poindexter came from 5,000 e-mails which they had tried to delete but which were retrieved from back-up tapes .
it would be ironic if tony blair 's premiership was blighted by a scandal uncovered because of the careless use of e-mail , given the attention this government has lavished on broadband take-up , the digital divide and the importance of the internet .
for some digital literacy is just a lottery but it might serve a higher purpose if it makes people think more carefully about the secrets they entrust to their computers and to the network .
one minister who should be watching closely is culture secretary tessa jowell .
she used her recent appearance at the oxford media convention to reiterate the importance of " media literacy " in the modern world , but unfortunately the official line on what this means does n't cover taking good care of our online secrets or making sure that e-mails are properly deleted .
communications regulator ofcom defines media literacy as " the ability to access , understand and create communications in a variety of contexts " , which is good as far as it goes but clearly does not go far enough .
most of the attention still goes on teaching children how to tell the adverts from the programmes on tv , yet the brutal reality is that we are moving into a world where television is no longer the primary visual medium and the obvious focus of regulatory and commercial attention .
these days television is just one way of using a screen , and not necessarily the most popular one .
banning commercials aimed at selling junk food to children from early-evening television may seem like progress but when mcdonalds can team up with neopets to push happy meals to more than 30 million young net users then restrictions on tv advertising seem irrelevant .
and adults who get their holiday advice from review sites that are open to faked postings or filled with unchecked comments are not helped by rigid guidance on endorsements for tv travel shows .
we need a much broader approach to literacy in the digital age , one that helps users of social network sites take good care of their personal information and avoid scams or snares , one that encourages e-mail users to use available tools for encrypting messages or adding digital signatures .
as computers and the internet become more and more important in our daily lives it is vital that we know how they work and understand the risks we take when we surf websites , chat to colleagues or send e-mails off into the uncharted wastes of the network .
extending current thinking about media literacy to cover the wider area of digital literacy would be one way forward , and there is already a lot of work being done to refine and clarify what it would mean to be a well-rounded citizen of a networked society .
the schools it agency becta and educational technology advocates naace are among the groups trying to ensure that the education system keeps up , but it is also important to make sure that everyone outside school is helped to catch up too .
otherwise more and more of us will lose our jobs , friends or political influence because we did n't understand the network .

a senior manager at lottery operator camelot has discovered that adopting different online identities is not as straightforward as it might appear , and it seems to have cost her her job .
the contract to run the uk national lottery comes up for renewal in 2009 , and camelot is obviously very interested in the competition .
however things got out of hand when the company 's media relations manager alexia latham used a fake google mail address to try to find information about other companies bidding for the contract .
posing as an mba student she sent e-mails to independent lottery consultant glenn barry , but unfortunately she did not do a very good job of covering her tracks .
e-mails to the fake account were automatically sent to her work address , but she forgot to turn this off when she went away for christmas .
as a result an e-mail from barry to her google account received an " out of office " response from her camelot e-mail address , and her deception was uncovered .
latham , who resigned in january , is not the only person to assume that e-mails and other online activities can easily be protected from prying eyes .
these days television is just one way of using a screen , and not necessarily the most popular one bill thompson last week 's newspapers featured several stories about the ongoing investigation into allegations of sales of honours by the labour government , and many of them focused on e-mail messages that the police are believed to have recovered from computers .
while the police have refused to comment on this aspect of their investigation it is certainly possible to recover apparently deleted e-mails or other files from computers and it would not be at all surprising if messages which had been " deleted " were still accessible .
e-mails are particularly hard to get rid of , since as well as the copies on the sending and receiving computers they pass through mail servers as they are transmitted , and the servers may have their own archives .
you might think that the people responsible for running the country would be aware of this aspect of the technology they use , but very few of us seem to know what is going on when we sit down at a computer .
in fact this sort of thing has been going on for a surprisingly long time .
back in 1986 ronald reagan 's presidency was rocked when it was discovered that his officials had secretly been funding the nicaraguan contras from the proceeds of arms sales to iran , ignoring laws passed by congress making both sides of the deal illegal .
part of the evidence against conspirators oliver north and john poindexter came from 5,000 e-mails which they had tried to delete but which were retrieved from back-up tapes .
it would be ironic if tony blair 's premiership was blighted by a scandal uncovered because of the careless use of e-mail , given the attention this government has lavished on broadband take-up , the digital divide and the importance of the internet .
for some digital literacy is just a lottery but it might serve a higher purpose if it makes people think more carefully about the secrets they entrust to their computers and to the network .
one minister who should be watching closely is culture secretary tessa jowell .
she used her recent appearance at the oxford media convention to reiterate the importance of " media literacy " in the modern world , but unfortunately the official line on what this means does n't cover taking good care of our online secrets or making sure that e-mails are properly deleted .
communications regulator ofcom defines media literacy as " the ability to access , understand and create communications in a variety of contexts " , which is good as far as it goes but clearly does not go far enough .
most of the attention still goes on teaching children how to tell the adverts from the programmes on tv , yet the brutal reality is that we are moving into a world where television is no longer the primary visual medium and the obvious focus of regulatory and commercial attention .
these days television is just one way of using a screen , and not necessarily the most popular one .
banning commercials aimed at selling junk food to children from early-evening television may seem like progress but when mcdonalds can team up with neopets to push happy meals to more than 30 million young net users then restrictions on tv advertising seem irrelevant .
and adults who get their holiday advice from review sites that are open to faked postings or filled with unchecked comments are not helped by rigid guidance on endorsements for tv travel shows .
we need a much broader approach to literacy in the digital age , one that helps users of social network sites take good care of their personal information and avoid scams or snares , one that encourages e-mail users to use available tools for encrypting messages or adding digital signatures .
as computers and the internet become more and more important in our daily lives it is vital that we know how they work and understand the risks we take when we surf websites , chat to colleagues or send e-mails off into the uncharted wastes of the network .
extending current thinking about media literacy to cover the wider area of digital literacy would be one way forward , and there is already a lot of work being done to refine and clarify what it would mean to be a well-rounded citizen of a networked society .
the schools it agency becta and educational technology advocates naace are among the groups trying to ensure that the education system keeps up , but it is also important to make sure that everyone outside school is helped to catch up too .
otherwise more and more of us will lose our jobs , friends or political influence because we did n't understand the network .

a senior manager at lottery operator camelot has discovered that adopting different online identities is not as straightforward as it might appear , and it seems to have cost her her job .
the contract to run the uk national lottery comes up for renewal in 2009 , and camelot is obviously very interested in the competition .
however things got out of hand when the company 's media relations manager alexia latham used a fake google mail address to try to find information about other companies bidding for the contract .
posing as an mba student she sent e-mails to independent lottery consultant glenn barry , but unfortunately she did not do a very good job of covering her tracks .
e-mails to the fake account were automatically sent to her work address , but she forgot to turn this off when she went away for christmas .
as a result an e-mail from barry to her google account received an " out of office " response from her camelot e-mail address , and her deception was uncovered .
latham , who resigned in january , is not the only person to assume that e-mails and other online activities can easily be protected from prying eyes .
these days television is just one way of using a screen , and not necessarily the most popular one bill thompson last week 's newspapers featured several stories about the ongoing investigation into allegations of sales of honours by the labour government , and many of them focused on e-mail messages that the police are believed to have recovered from computers .
while the police have refused to comment on this aspect of their investigation it is certainly possible to recover apparently deleted e-mails or other files from computers and it would not be at all surprising if messages which had been " deleted " were still accessible .
e-mails are particularly hard to get rid of , since as well as the copies on the sending and receiving computers they pass through mail servers as they are transmitted , and the servers may have their own archives .
you might think that the people responsible for running the country would be aware of this aspect of the technology they use , but very few of us seem to know what is going on when we sit down at a computer .
in fact this sort of thing has been going on for a surprisingly long time .
back in 1986 ronald reagan 's presidency was rocked when it was discovered that his officials had secretly been funding the nicaraguan contras from the proceeds of arms sales to iran , ignoring laws passed by congress making both sides of the deal illegal .
part of the evidence against conspirators oliver north and john poindexter came from 5,000 e-mails which they had tried to delete but which were retrieved from back-up tapes .
it would be ironic if tony blair 's premiership was blighted by a scandal uncovered because of the careless use of e-mail , given the attention this government has lavished on broadband take-up , the digital divide and the importance of the internet .
for some digital literacy is just a lottery but it might serve a higher purpose if it makes people think more carefully about the secrets they entrust to their computers and to the network .
one minister who should be watching closely is culture secretary tessa jowell .
she used her recent appearance at the oxford media convention to reiterate the importance of " media literacy " in the modern world , but unfortunately the official line on what this means does n't cover taking good care of our online secrets or making sure that e-mails are properly deleted .
communications regulator ofcom defines media literacy as " the ability to access , understand and create communications in a variety of contexts " , which is good as far as it goes but clearly does not go far enough .
most of the attention still goes on teaching children how to tell the adverts from the programmes on tv , yet the brutal reality is that we are moving into a world where television is no longer the primary visual medium and the obvious focus of regulatory and commercial attention .

a " bottleneck " occurs in the brain when people attempt to carry out two simultaneous tasks , the research shows .
the study found the brain slows down when attempting a second task less than 300 milliseconds after the first .
the findings , published in neuron , support the case for a complete ban on the use of mobile phones when driving , the team said .
participants were asked to press an appropriate computer key in response to one of eight different sounds and call out a syllable in response to eight different images .
the researchers from vanderbilt university used functional mri scans to detect changes in oxygenated blood in the brain - a way of monitoring the activity in different brain regions .
they found that the lateral frontal and prefrontal cortex , and also the superior frontal cortex , were unable to process two tasks at once , leading to a bottleneck .
but when tasks were presented a second apart there was no delay .
study leader dr paul dux said previous studies had shown people were limited in being able to do two simple tasks at once - a phenomenon known as " dual-task interference " .
" we were interested in trying to understand these limitations and in finding where in the brain this bottleneck might be taking place , " he said .
" we determined these brain regions responded to tasks irrespective of the senses involved , they were engaged in selecting the appropriate response , and , most importantly , they showed ' queuing ' of neural activity .
" the neural response to the second task was postponed until the response to the first was completed , " he added .
mobile phones the researchers said the study was particularly relevant to tasks that people have to do in a complex environment , such as flying a plane .
talking on mobile phones when driving was also dangerous , they said because motorists are bombarded with visual information and might also be talking to passengers .
" our new research offers neurological evidence that the brain can not effectively do two things at once .
people think if they are using a headset with their cell phone while driving they are safe , but they 're not because they are still doing two cognitively demanding tasks at once , " said co-author , dr rene marois dr dux added " dual-task costs can be up to a second , and that 's a long time when you 're travelling at 60 miles per hour . "
the law banning use of mobile phones while driving is to be strengthened from the 27th february when drivers who are caught will get three points on their licence as well as a £ 60 fine .
a spokesperson for the royal society for the prevention of accidents said the research confirmed what other studies had shown .
" the research we have seen is whether your on your mobile phone or a hands free kit , you 're four times more likely to have a crash .
" it is why we keep saying to people , that the safe thing to do is to turn your mobile off when you are in the car .
" generally we need people to take on board this research and understand just how dangerous it is . "
dr narender ramnani , reader in cognitive neuroscience at royal holloway university of london said : " we 've always known that doing two things at once is difficult but what mri tells us is where that bottleneck is occurring .
" we tend to overestimate our ability to do two things at once .
" it highlights that even areas such as the prefrontal cortex , which are very sophisticated , can only do one thing at a time . "

a " bottleneck " occurs in the brain when people attempt to carry out two simultaneous tasks , the research shows .
the study found the brain slows down when attempting a second task less than 300 milliseconds after the first .
the findings , published in neuron , support the case for a complete ban on the use of mobile phones when driving , the team said .
participants were asked to press an appropriate computer key in response to one of eight different sounds and call out a syllable in response to eight different images .
the researchers from vanderbilt university used functional mri scans to detect changes in oxygenated blood in the brain - a way of monitoring the activity in different brain regions .
they found that the lateral frontal and prefrontal cortex , and also the superior frontal cortex , were unable to process two tasks at once , leading to a bottleneck .
but when tasks were presented a second apart there was no delay .
study leader dr paul dux said previous studies had shown people were limited in being able to do two simple tasks at once - a phenomenon known as " dual-task interference " .
" we were interested in trying to understand these limitations and in finding where in the brain this bottleneck might be taking place , " he said .
" we determined these brain regions responded to tasks irrespective of the senses involved , they were engaged in selecting the appropriate response , and , most importantly , they showed ' queuing ' of neural activity .
" the neural response to the second task was postponed until the response to the first was completed , " he added .
mobile phones the researchers said the study was particularly relevant to tasks that people have to do in a complex environment , such as flying a plane .
talking on mobile phones when driving was also dangerous , they said because motorists are bombarded with visual information and might also be talking to passengers .
" our new research offers neurological evidence that the brain can not effectively do two things at once .
people think if they are using a headset with their cell phone while driving they are safe , but they 're not because they are still doing two cognitively demanding tasks at once , " said co-author , dr rene marois dr dux added " dual-task costs can be up to a second , and that 's a long time when you 're travelling at 60 miles per hour . "
the law banning use of mobile phones while driving is to be strengthened from the 27th february when drivers who are caught will get three points on their licence as well as a £ 60 fine .
a spokesperson for the royal society for the prevention of accidents said the research confirmed what other studies had shown .
" the research we have seen is whether your on your mobile phone or a hands free kit , you 're four times more likely to have a crash .
" it is why we keep saying to people , that the safe thing to do is to turn your mobile off when you are in the car .
" generally we need people to take on board this research and understand just how dangerous it is . "
dr narender ramnani , reader in cognitive neuroscience at royal holloway university of london said : " we 've always known that doing two things at once is difficult but what mri tells us is where that bottleneck is occurring .
" we tend to overestimate our ability to do two things at once .
" it highlights that even areas such as the prefrontal cortex , which are very sophisticated , can only do one thing at a time . "
