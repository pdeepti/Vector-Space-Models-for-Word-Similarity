the issue is set to dominate the political debate early next year . peter struck , head of the spd 's parliamentary group , said that the party 's strong stance on the issue will take center stage in three upcoming regional polls .
in the state of hesse , one of two states going to the polls on jan 27 , the spd is to begin collecting signatures in favour of a statutory minimum wage . " we will start petition drives during the state elections next year .
then the voters will have their say , " struck told daily bild . " we will turn these regional elections and the general election in 2009 into a referendum on the minimum wage , " he added . the view was echoed by spd acting vice chairwoman , andrea nahles this week when she said a national minimum wage will be one of the top goals of her party in the coming year . " the spd wants an overall minimum wage .
we will not budge from this , " said nahles . crucial campaigning tool trailing in most national polls by about ten percent , the spd believes that their support of a minimum wage will be a winning strategy as they look ahead into 2008 and general elections in sept 2009 . although they are political rivals , the spd and chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have been ruling together at the federal level in a " grand coalition " since sept 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minimum wage debate has split the ruling coalition the spd 's across-the-board support of a national minimum wage is part of the party 's larger campaign to distinguish itself from merkel 's cdu in upcoming elections . in an effort to reach out to leftwing voters and cashing in on a groundswell of popular feeling on the issue , the spd has also opposed soaring executive pay against the backdrop of stagnating disposable income for most ordinary workers . germany is one of only five european union countries without a statutory minimum wage .
the spd is pushing for the minimum hourly rate to be set at 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10.77 -rrb- . conservatives oppose statutory minimum wag e the issue of a national minimum wage has been simmering ever since chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government approved a 9.80 euro per hour minimum wage for the postal sector this fall .
it was the spd , the junior partner , that drove the change to the law with members of merkel 's cdu and business opposing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's postal sector got a minimum wage this year many in the cdu fear that a statutory minimum wage would drive jobs out of germany to eastern europe and asia . economy minister michael glos of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister-party to merkel 's christian democrats , warned that a minimum wage would lead companies to cut back on legitimate staff and force workers to take illegal jobs . " production and services would move abroad , " glos told weekly newspaper die zeit . germany 's ifo economic institute estimates that the minimum hourly rate of 7.50 euros demanded by the spd would cost the economy up to 1 million jobs . the minimum wage deal in the postal sector has triggered calls for speedy minimum wages by top representatives in sectors such as temporary work , security and garbage disposal .
however , they want to set the wage ceiling significantly lower than the 9.80 euros per hour in the post industry . volker enkerts , president of the national association of temporary work , said this week he planned to open negotiations with the unions for a minimum wage in january . " temp work quickly needs a sector-specific minimum wage , " enkerts told daily frankfurter rundschau .
most industry heads however are unwilling to go beyond 4 to 5 euros per hour . low minimum wage will not hurt economy many economists point out that a low universal minimum wage would be less damaging to the economy than the sector-specific approach favored so far by merkel 's party .
the construction sector and office cleaning are already subject to minimum wage legislation . last week , bert rürup , chairman of the " council of wise men " - five highly regarded academics who advise the government on economic policy - came out in favor of universal hourly minimum wage of 4.50 euros last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the world 's largest exporting nation economist peter bofinger , who is part of the council , told frankfurter rundschau recently that " germany would be significantly better off if wages in the past years had risen by one percent per year . " he denied that higher personnel costs would weaken exports , arguing that even if wages were five percent higher right now , it would make german exports more expensive by just one percent . some members of the cdu too believe that a national minimum wage is inevitable . " germany can not ignore the fact that 22 of the 27 countries in the european union have a minimum wage , " lower saxony state premier christian wulff of the cdu told die welt newspaper . dw staff -lrb- ot / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a recent spate of child murders and a survey showing growing fears in the population about the welfare of children have prompted germany to ask whether the state is failing to help overwhelmed parents . german president horst köhler called on germans this week to be more alert following the most recent incidents of two parents killing their children in separate cases over christmas .
in one a father in munich killed his eight-year-old son before suffocating himself with a plastic bag .
in the second , a mother admitted to killing her infant sons after the grandmother found the children , aged two and three , dead in the bath .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler has weighed in the debate over providing better care for children " we need to be attentive to children , particularly in the hearts and minds of adults , " köhler told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on friday , dec 28 .
" do we want to accept that a child starves or has to suffer behind closed doors in germany ? "
köhler said .
fear of social isolation that question is plaguing germany and has now turned into a national debate about how germany cares for its children and how large a role the government can and should play in protecting them .
the soul-searching was reflected in the results of a recent survey aimed at identifying germans ' biggest fears for the future .
conducted by the foundation for questions of the future based in hamburg , the representative poll found that the number of germans who pinpointed hostility against children as the biggest concern for the future had almost doubled in the past eight years - from 22 to nearly 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans fear being socially isolated the same study showed that social isolation is the biggest fear among germans .
58 percent of the population is worried that it 's growing , up from 52 percent in 2003 and only 42 percent in 1999 .
the survey , which was conducted in nine european countries , quizzed 2,000 germans aged 14 and above on their fears .
" in comparison to other countries , germany unfortunately leads the way -lrb- in the two fears -rrb- , " head of the foundation and researcher horst opaschowski told news agency dpa .
" on a personal level , the germans largely long for trust , affection and human warmth . "
germany " deeply shaken " the christmas child murders are n't the first to rock the country .
earlier this month police found the bodies of five brothers , aged three to nine , in a home in the northern hamlet of darry after their 31-year-old mother confessed to a psychiatrist that she had killed them .
in plauen , near chemnitz in eastern germany , another woman was arrested after the gruesome discovery of the bodies of three babies in her home .
she told investigators they had each died shortly after birth at different times over the past years .
" these incomprehensible cases leave us deeply shaken , " chancellor angela merkel said in a recent newspaper interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cases of child abuse and neglect have risen the federal crime office says that statistics show the number of children killed at home was not on the rise overall .
but reported child-abuse cases had climbed to more than 3,000 in 2006 from about 1,900 in 1995 .
german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung reported recently that between 80 and 100 children die in germany each year from neglect and abuse .
authorities removed about 170,000 children and teenagers from their parents ' homes in 2006 and placed them in state care .
boosting preventive measures the incidents of abuse , neglect and killing of children have forced the government to take action .
the social democrats have spoken of enshrining children 's rights in the constitution .
last week , merkel called a crisis meeting with the heads of the 16 federal states to launch a raft of measures aimed at preventing families from falling into the desperate situations believed to be at least partially responsible for some of the abuse and crimes .
they approved a package that allows authorities to take swifter action when abuse or neglect of a child is suspected .
it also includes regular checkups for babies and toddlers and obliges doctors to report suspicious cases .
in addition a national database is to be created that will compile information from social welfare offices , family courts , health care providers , child protection services and the police .
the integrated database will enable authorities to form a more comprehensive profile of each family , and better access the risk of violence for children at home .
growing poverty to blame though germany has moved to pass child-friendly measures such as increasing benefits for stay-at-home parents and increasing kindergarten capacities , it 's widely believed that the worsening situation is connected to the unpopular labor market reforms known as hartz iv .
it reduces the amount of time in which people can receive unemployment benefits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing poverty has aggravated the problem of child abuse and neglect the non-profit children 's charity of germany said in a recent report that the number of children dependent on some form of social assistance had doubled to 2.5 million since the hartz iv reforms went into effect at the beginning of 2005 .

germany " deeply shaken " the christmas child murders are n't the first to rock the country .

a recent spate of child murders and a survey showing growing fears in the population about the welfare of children have prompted germany to ask whether the state is failing to help overwhelmed parents . german president horst köhler called on germans this week to be more alert following the most recent incidents of two parents killing their children in separate cases over christmas .
in one a father in munich killed his eight-year-old son before suffocating himself with a plastic bag .
in the second , a mother admitted to killing her infant sons after the grandmother found the children , aged two and three , dead in the bath .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler has weighed in the debate over providing better care for children " we need to be attentive to children , particularly in the hearts and minds of adults , " köhler told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on friday , dec 28 .
" do we want to accept that a child starves or has to suffer behind closed doors in germany ? "
köhler said .
fear of social isolation that question is plaguing germany and has now turned into a national debate about how germany cares for its children and how large a role the government can and should play in protecting them .
the soul-searching was reflected in the results of a recent survey aimed at identifying germans ' biggest fears for the future .
conducted by the foundation for questions of the future based in hamburg , the representative poll found that the number of germans who pinpointed hostility against children as the biggest concern for the future had almost doubled in the past eight years - from 22 to nearly 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans fear being socially isolated the same study showed that social isolation is the biggest fear among germans .
58 percent of the population is worried that it 's growing , up from 52 percent in 2003 and only 42 percent in 1999 .
the survey , which was conducted in nine european countries , quizzed 2,000 germans aged 14 and above on their fears .
" in comparison to other countries , germany unfortunately leads the way -lrb- in the two fears -rrb- , " head of the foundation and researcher horst opaschowski told news agency dpa .
" on a personal level , the germans largely long for trust , affection and human warmth . "
germany " deeply shaken " the christmas child murders are n't the first to rock the country .
earlier this month police found the bodies of five brothers , aged three to nine , in a home in the northern hamlet of darry after their 31-year-old mother confessed to a psychiatrist that she had killed them .
in plauen , near chemnitz in eastern germany , another woman was arrested after the gruesome discovery of the bodies of three babies in her home .
she told investigators they had each died shortly after birth at different times over the past years .
" these incomprehensible cases leave us deeply shaken , " chancellor angela merkel said in a recent newspaper interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cases of child abuse and neglect have risen the federal crime office says that statistics show the number of children killed at home was not on the rise overall .
but reported child-abuse cases had climbed to more than 3,000 in 2006 from about 1,900 in 1995 .
german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung reported recently that between 80 and 100 children die in germany each year from neglect and abuse .
authorities removed about 170,000 children and teenagers from their parents ' homes in 2006 and placed them in state care .
boosting preventive measures the incidents of abuse , neglect and killing of children have forced the government to take action .
the social democrats have spoken of enshrining children 's rights in the constitution .
last week , merkel called a crisis meeting with the heads of the 16 federal states to launch a raft of measures aimed at preventing families from falling into the desperate situations believed to be at least partially responsible for some of the abuse and crimes .
they approved a package that allows authorities to take swifter action when abuse or neglect of a child is suspected .
it also includes regular checkups for babies and toddlers and obliges doctors to report suspicious cases .
in addition a national database is to be created that will compile information from social welfare offices , family courts , health care providers , child protection services and the police .
the integrated database will enable authorities to form a more comprehensive profile of each family , and better access the risk of violence for children at home .
growing poverty to blame though germany has moved to pass child-friendly measures such as increasing benefits for stay-at-home parents and increasing kindergarten capacities , it 's widely believed that the worsening situation is connected to the unpopular labor market reforms known as hartz iv .
it reduces the amount of time in which people can receive unemployment benefits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing poverty has aggravated the problem of child abuse and neglect the non-profit children 's charity of germany said in a recent report that the number of children dependent on some form of social assistance had doubled to 2.5 million since the hartz iv reforms went into effect at the beginning of 2005 .
" -lsb- charities -rsb- and poverty researchers like me warned that this labor market reform would be a slide into poverty and that children would be those mainly affected , " christoph butterwegge , a political scientist in cologne said in an interview with the associated press . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this compares to about 48.6 million tons in 2007 .

the issue is set to dominate the political debate early next year . peter struck , head of the spd 's parliamentary group , said that the party 's strong stance on the issue will take center stage in three upcoming regional polls .
in the state of hesse , one of two states going to the polls on jan 27 , the spd is to begin collecting signatures in favour of a statutory minimum wage . " we will start petition drives during the state elections next year .
then the voters will have their say , " struck told daily bild . " we will turn these regional elections and the general election in 2009 into a referendum on the minimum wage , " he added . the view was echoed by spd acting vice chairwoman , andrea nahles this week when she said a national minimum wage will be one of the top goals of her party in the coming year . " the spd wants an overall minimum wage .
we will not budge from this , " said nahles . crucial campaigning tool trailing in most national polls by about ten percent , the spd believes that their support of a minimum wage will be a winning strategy as they look ahead into 2008 and general elections in sept 2009 . although they are political rivals , the spd and chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have been ruling together at the federal level in a " grand coalition " since sept 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minimum wage debate has split the ruling coalition the spd 's across-the-board support of a national minimum wage is part of the party 's larger campaign to distinguish itself from merkel 's cdu in upcoming elections . in an effort to reach out to leftwing voters and cashing in on a groundswell of popular feeling on the issue , the spd has also opposed soaring executive pay against the backdrop of stagnating disposable income for most ordinary workers . germany is one of only five european union countries without a statutory minimum wage .
the spd is pushing for the minimum hourly rate to be set at 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10.77 -rrb- . conservatives oppose statutory minimum wag e the issue of a national minimum wage has been simmering ever since chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government approved a 9.80 euro per hour minimum wage for the postal sector this fall .
it was the spd , the junior partner , that drove the change to the law with members of merkel 's cdu and business opposing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's postal sector got a minimum wage this year many in the cdu fear that a statutory minimum wage would drive jobs out of germany to eastern europe and asia . economy minister michael glos of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister-party to merkel 's christian democrats , warned that a minimum wage would lead companies to cut back on legitimate staff and force workers to take illegal jobs . " production and services would move abroad , " glos told weekly newspaper die zeit . germany 's ifo economic institute estimates that the minimum hourly rate of 7.50 euros demanded by the spd would cost the economy up to 1 million jobs . the minimum wage deal in the postal sector has triggered calls for speedy minimum wages by top representatives in sectors such as temporary work , security and garbage disposal .
however , they want to set the wage ceiling significantly lower than the 9.80 euros per hour in the post industry . volker enkerts , president of the national association of temporary work , said this week he planned to open negotiations with the unions for a minimum wage in january . " temp work quickly needs a sector-specific minimum wage , " enkerts told daily frankfurter rundschau .
most industry heads however are unwilling to go beyond 4 to 5 euros per hour . low minimum wage will not hurt economy many economists point out that a low universal minimum wage would be less damaging to the economy than the sector-specific approach favored so far by merkel 's party .
the construction sector and office cleaning are already subject to minimum wage legislation . last week , bert rürup , chairman of the " council of wise men " - five highly regarded academics who advise the government on economic policy - came out in favor of universal hourly minimum wage of 4.50 euros last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the world 's largest exporting nation economist peter bofinger , who is part of the council , told frankfurter rundschau recently that " germany would be significantly better off if wages in the past years had risen by one percent per year . " he denied that higher personnel costs would weaken exports , arguing that even if wages were five percent higher right now , it would make german exports more expensive by just one percent . some members of the cdu too believe that a national minimum wage is inevitable . " germany can not ignore the fact that 22 of the 27 countries in the european union have a minimum wage , " lower saxony state premier christian wulff of the cdu told die welt newspaper . dw staff -lrb- ot / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he denied that higher personnel costs would weaken exports , arguing that even if wages were five percent higher right now , it would make german exports more expensive by just one percent . some members of the cdu too believe that a national minimum wage is inevitable . " germany can not ignore the fact that 22 of the 27 countries in the european union have a minimum wage , " lower saxony state premier christian wulff of the cdu told die welt newspaper . dw staff -lrb- ot / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a recent spate of child murders and a survey showing growing fears in the population about the welfare of children have prompted germany to ask whether the state is failing to help overwhelmed parents . german president horst köhler called on germans this week to be more alert following the most recent incidents of two parents killing their children in separate cases over christmas .
in one a father in munich killed his eight-year-old son before suffocating himself with a plastic bag .
in the second , a mother admitted to killing her infant sons after the grandmother found the children , aged two and three , dead in the bath .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler has weighed in the debate over providing better care for children " we need to be attentive to children , particularly in the hearts and minds of adults , " köhler told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on friday , dec 28 .
" do we want to accept that a child starves or has to suffer behind closed doors in germany ? "
köhler said .
fear of social isolation that question is plaguing germany and has now turned into a national debate about how germany cares for its children and how large a role the government can and should play in protecting them .
the soul-searching was reflected in the results of a recent survey aimed at identifying germans ' biggest fears for the future .
conducted by the foundation for questions of the future based in hamburg , the representative poll found that the number of germans who pinpointed hostility against children as the biggest concern for the future had almost doubled in the past eight years - from 22 to nearly 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans fear being socially isolated the same study showed that social isolation is the biggest fear among germans .
58 percent of the population is worried that it 's growing , up from 52 percent in 2003 and only 42 percent in 1999 .

" on a personal level , the germans largely long for trust , affection and human warmth . "
germany " deeply shaken " the christmas child murders are n't the first to rock the country .
earlier this month police found the bodies of five brothers , aged three to nine , in a home in the northern hamlet of darry after their 31-year-old mother confessed to a psychiatrist that she had killed them .
in plauen , near chemnitz in eastern germany , another woman was arrested after the gruesome discovery of the bodies of three babies in her home .
she told investigators they had each died shortly after birth at different times over the past years .
" these incomprehensible cases leave us deeply shaken , " chancellor angela merkel said in a recent newspaper interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cases of child abuse and neglect have risen the federal crime office says that statistics show the number of children killed at home was not on the rise overall .

german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung reported recently that between 80 and 100 children die in germany each year from neglect and abuse .

boosting preventive measures the incidents of abuse , neglect and killing of children have forced the government to take action .
the social democrats have spoken of enshrining children 's rights in the constitution .
last week , merkel called a crisis meeting with the heads of the 16 federal states to launch a raft of measures aimed at preventing families from falling into the desperate situations believed to be at least partially responsible for some of the abuse and crimes .
they approved a package that allows authorities to take swifter action when abuse or neglect of a child is suspected .
it also includes regular checkups for babies and toddlers and obliges doctors to report suspicious cases .
in addition a national database is to be created that will compile information from social welfare offices , family courts , health care providers , child protection services and the police .
the integrated database will enable authorities to form a more comprehensive profile of each family , and better access the risk of violence for children at home .
growing poverty to blame though germany has moved to pass child-friendly measures such as increasing benefits for stay-at-home parents and increasing kindergarten capacities , it 's widely believed that the worsening situation is connected to the unpopular labor market reforms known as hartz iv .

a recent spate of child murders and a survey showing growing fears in the population about the welfare of children have prompted germany to ask whether the state is failing to help overwhelmed parents . german president horst köhler called on germans this week to be more alert following the most recent incidents of two parents killing their children in separate cases over christmas .
in one a father in munich killed his eight-year-old son before suffocating himself with a plastic bag .
in the second , a mother admitted to killing her infant sons after the grandmother found the children , aged two and three , dead in the bath .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler has weighed in the debate over providing better care for children " we need to be attentive to children , particularly in the hearts and minds of adults , " köhler told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on friday , dec 28 .
" do we want to accept that a child starves or has to suffer behind closed doors in germany ? "
köhler said .
fear of social isolation that question is plaguing germany and has now turned into a national debate about how germany cares for its children and how large a role the government can and should play in protecting them .
the soul-searching was reflected in the results of a recent survey aimed at identifying germans ' biggest fears for the future .
conducted by the foundation for questions of the future based in hamburg , the representative poll found that the number of germans who pinpointed hostility against children as the biggest concern for the future had almost doubled in the past eight years - from 22 to nearly 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans fear being socially isolated the same study showed that social isolation is the biggest fear among germans .
58 percent of the population is worried that it 's growing , up from 52 percent in 2003 and only 42 percent in 1999 .
the survey , which was conducted in nine european countries , quizzed 2,000 germans aged 14 and above on their fears .
" in comparison to other countries , germany unfortunately leads the way -lrb- in the two fears -rrb- , " head of the foundation and researcher horst opaschowski told news agency dpa .
" on a personal level , the germans largely long for trust , affection and human warmth . "
germany " deeply shaken " the christmas child murders are n't the first to rock the country .
earlier this month police found the bodies of five brothers , aged three to nine , in a home in the northern hamlet of darry after their 31-year-old mother confessed to a psychiatrist that she had killed them .
in plauen , near chemnitz in eastern germany , another woman was arrested after the gruesome discovery of the bodies of three babies in her home .
she told investigators they had each died shortly after birth at different times over the past years .
" these incomprehensible cases leave us deeply shaken , " chancellor angela merkel said in a recent newspaper interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cases of child abuse and neglect have risen the federal crime office says that statistics show the number of children killed at home was not on the rise overall .
but reported child-abuse cases had climbed to more than 3,000 in 2006 from about 1,900 in 1995 .
german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung reported recently that between 80 and 100 children die in germany each year from neglect and abuse .
authorities removed about 170,000 children and teenagers from their parents ' homes in 2006 and placed them in state care .
boosting preventive measures the incidents of abuse , neglect and killing of children have forced the government to take action .
the social democrats have spoken of enshrining children 's rights in the constitution .
last week , merkel called a crisis meeting with the heads of the 16 federal states to launch a raft of measures aimed at preventing families from falling into the desperate situations believed to be at least partially responsible for some of the abuse and crimes .
they approved a package that allows authorities to take swifter action when abuse or neglect of a child is suspected .
it also includes regular checkups for babies and toddlers and obliges doctors to report suspicious cases .
in addition a national database is to be created that will compile information from social welfare offices , family courts , health care providers , child protection services and the police .
the integrated database will enable authorities to form a more comprehensive profile of each family , and better access the risk of violence for children at home .
growing poverty to blame though germany has moved to pass child-friendly measures such as increasing benefits for stay-at-home parents and increasing kindergarten capacities , it 's widely believed that the worsening situation is connected to the unpopular labor market reforms known as hartz iv .
it reduces the amount of time in which people can receive unemployment benefits .

the issue is set to dominate the political debate early next year . peter struck , head of the spd 's parliamentary group , said that the party 's strong stance on the issue will take center stage in three upcoming regional polls .
in the state of hesse , one of two states going to the polls on jan 27 , the spd is to begin collecting signatures in favour of a statutory minimum wage . " we will start petition drives during the state elections next year .
then the voters will have their say , " struck told daily bild . " we will turn these regional elections and the general election in 2009 into a referendum on the minimum wage , " he added . the view was echoed by spd acting vice chairwoman , andrea nahles this week when she said a national minimum wage will be one of the top goals of her party in the coming year . " the spd wants an overall minimum wage .
we will not budge from this , " said nahles . crucial campaigning tool trailing in most national polls by about ten percent , the spd believes that their support of a minimum wage will be a winning strategy as they look ahead into 2008 and general elections in sept 2009 . although they are political rivals , the spd and chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have been ruling together at the federal level in a " grand coalition " since sept 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minimum wage debate has split the ruling coalition the spd 's across-the-board support of a national minimum wage is part of the party 's larger campaign to distinguish itself from merkel 's cdu in upcoming elections . in an effort to reach out to leftwing voters and cashing in on a groundswell of popular feeling on the issue , the spd has also opposed soaring executive pay against the backdrop of stagnating disposable income for most ordinary workers . germany is one of only five european union countries without a statutory minimum wage .

" production and services would move abroad , " glos told weekly newspaper die zeit . germany 's ifo economic institute estimates that the minimum hourly rate of 7.50 euros demanded by the spd would cost the economy up to 1 million jobs . the minimum wage deal in the postal sector has triggered calls for speedy minimum wages by top representatives in sectors such as temporary work , security and garbage disposal .
however , they want to set the wage ceiling significantly lower than the 9.80 euros per hour in the post industry . volker enkerts , president of the national association of temporary work , said this week he planned to open negotiations with the unions for a minimum wage in january .

a recent spate of child murders and a survey showing growing fears in the population about the welfare of children have prompted germany to ask whether the state is failing to help overwhelmed parents . german president horst köhler called on germans this week to be more alert following the most recent incidents of two parents killing their children in separate cases over christmas .
in one a father in munich killed his eight-year-old son before suffocating himself with a plastic bag .
in the second , a mother admitted to killing her infant sons after the grandmother found the children , aged two and three , dead in the bath .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler has weighed in the debate over providing better care for children " we need to be attentive to children , particularly in the hearts and minds of adults , " köhler told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on friday , dec 28 .
" do we want to accept that a child starves or has to suffer behind closed doors in germany ? "
köhler said .
fear of social isolation that question is plaguing germany and has now turned into a national debate about how germany cares for its children and how large a role the government can and should play in protecting them .
the soul-searching was reflected in the results of a recent survey aimed at identifying germans ' biggest fears for the future .
conducted by the foundation for questions of the future based in hamburg , the representative poll found that the number of germans who pinpointed hostility against children as the biggest concern for the future had almost doubled in the past eight years - from 22 to nearly 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans fear being socially isolated the same study showed that social isolation is the biggest fear among germans .
58 percent of the population is worried that it 's growing , up from 52 percent in 2003 and only 42 percent in 1999 .
the survey , which was conducted in nine european countries , quizzed 2,000 germans aged 14 and above on their fears .
" in comparison to other countries , germany unfortunately leads the way -lrb- in the two fears -rrb- , " head of the foundation and researcher horst opaschowski told news agency dpa .
" on a personal level , the germans largely long for trust , affection and human warmth . "
germany " deeply shaken " the christmas child murders are n't the first to rock the country .
earlier this month police found the bodies of five brothers , aged three to nine , in a home in the northern hamlet of darry after their 31-year-old mother confessed to a psychiatrist that she had killed them .
in plauen , near chemnitz in eastern germany , another woman was arrested after the gruesome discovery of the bodies of three babies in her home .
she told investigators they had each died shortly after birth at different times over the past years .
" these incomprehensible cases leave us deeply shaken , " chancellor angela merkel said in a recent newspaper interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cases of child abuse and neglect have risen the federal crime office says that statistics show the number of children killed at home was not on the rise overall .
but reported child-abuse cases had climbed to more than 3,000 in 2006 from about 1,900 in 1995 .
german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung reported recently that between 80 and 100 children die in germany each year from neglect and abuse .
authorities removed about 170,000 children and teenagers from their parents ' homes in 2006 and placed them in state care .

the issue is set to dominate the political debate early next year . peter struck , head of the spd 's parliamentary group , said that the party 's strong stance on the issue will take center stage in three upcoming regional polls .
in the state of hesse , one of two states going to the polls on jan 27 , the spd is to begin collecting signatures in favour of a statutory minimum wage . " we will start petition drives during the state elections next year .
then the voters will have their say , " struck told daily bild . " we will turn these regional elections and the general election in 2009 into a referendum on the minimum wage , " he added . the view was echoed by spd acting vice chairwoman , andrea nahles this week when she said a national minimum wage will be one of the top goals of her party in the coming year . " the spd wants an overall minimum wage .
we will not budge from this , " said nahles . crucial campaigning tool trailing in most national polls by about ten percent , the spd believes that their support of a minimum wage will be a winning strategy as they look ahead into 2008 and general elections in sept 2009 . although they are political rivals , the spd and chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have been ruling together at the federal level in a " grand coalition " since sept 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minimum wage debate has split the ruling coalition the spd 's across-the-board support of a national minimum wage is part of the party 's larger campaign to distinguish itself from merkel 's cdu in upcoming elections . in an effort to reach out to leftwing voters and cashing in on a groundswell of popular feeling on the issue , the spd has also opposed soaring executive pay against the backdrop of stagnating disposable income for most ordinary workers . germany is one of only five european union countries without a statutory minimum wage .
the spd is pushing for the minimum hourly rate to be set at 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10.77 -rrb- . conservatives oppose statutory minimum wag e the issue of a national minimum wage has been simmering ever since chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government approved a 9.80 euro per hour minimum wage for the postal sector this fall .
it was the spd , the junior partner , that drove the change to the law with members of merkel 's cdu and business opposing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's postal sector got a minimum wage this year many in the cdu fear that a statutory minimum wage would drive jobs out of germany to eastern europe and asia . economy minister michael glos of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister-party to merkel 's christian democrats , warned that a minimum wage would lead companies to cut back on legitimate staff and force workers to take illegal jobs . " production and services would move abroad , " glos told weekly newspaper die zeit . germany 's ifo economic institute estimates that the minimum hourly rate of 7.50 euros demanded by the spd would cost the economy up to 1 million jobs . the minimum wage deal in the postal sector has triggered calls for speedy minimum wages by top representatives in sectors such as temporary work , security and garbage disposal .
however , they want to set the wage ceiling significantly lower than the 9.80 euros per hour in the post industry . volker enkerts , president of the national association of temporary work , said this week he planned to open negotiations with the unions for a minimum wage in january . " temp work quickly needs a sector-specific minimum wage , " enkerts told daily frankfurter rundschau .
most industry heads however are unwilling to go beyond 4 to 5 euros per hour . low minimum wage will not hurt economy many economists point out that a low universal minimum wage would be less damaging to the economy than the sector-specific approach favored so far by merkel 's party .
the construction sector and office cleaning are already subject to minimum wage legislation . last week , bert rürup , chairman of the " council of wise men " - five highly regarded academics who advise the government on economic policy - came out in favor of universal hourly minimum wage of 4.50 euros last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the world 's largest exporting nation economist peter bofinger , who is part of the council , told frankfurter rundschau recently that " germany would be significantly better off if wages in the past years had risen by one percent per year . " he denied that higher personnel costs would weaken exports , arguing that even if wages were five percent higher right now , it would make german exports more expensive by just one percent . some members of the cdu too believe that a national minimum wage is inevitable . " germany can not ignore the fact that 22 of the 27 countries in the european union have a minimum wage , " lower saxony state premier christian wulff of the cdu told die welt newspaper . dw staff -lrb- ot / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a recent spate of child murders and a survey showing growing fears in the population about the welfare of children have prompted germany to ask whether the state is failing to help overwhelmed parents . german president horst köhler called on germans this week to be more alert following the most recent incidents of two parents killing their children in separate cases over christmas .
in one a father in munich killed his eight-year-old son before suffocating himself with a plastic bag .
in the second , a mother admitted to killing her infant sons after the grandmother found the children , aged two and three , dead in the bath .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler has weighed in the debate over providing better care for children " we need to be attentive to children , particularly in the hearts and minds of adults , " köhler told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on friday , dec 28 .
" do we want to accept that a child starves or has to suffer behind closed doors in germany ? "
köhler said .
fear of social isolation that question is plaguing germany and has now turned into a national debate about how germany cares for its children and how large a role the government can and should play in protecting them .
the soul-searching was reflected in the results of a recent survey aimed at identifying germans ' biggest fears for the future .
conducted by the foundation for questions of the future based in hamburg , the representative poll found that the number of germans who pinpointed hostility against children as the biggest concern for the future had almost doubled in the past eight years - from 22 to nearly 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans fear being socially isolated the same study showed that social isolation is the biggest fear among germans .
58 percent of the population is worried that it 's growing , up from 52 percent in 2003 and only 42 percent in 1999 .
the survey , which was conducted in nine european countries , quizzed 2,000 germans aged 14 and above on their fears .
" in comparison to other countries , germany unfortunately leads the way -lrb- in the two fears -rrb- , " head of the foundation and researcher horst opaschowski told news agency dpa .
" on a personal level , the germans largely long for trust , affection and human warmth . "
germany " deeply shaken " the christmas child murders are n't the first to rock the country .
earlier this month police found the bodies of five brothers , aged three to nine , in a home in the northern hamlet of darry after their 31-year-old mother confessed to a psychiatrist that she had killed them .
in plauen , near chemnitz in eastern germany , another woman was arrested after the gruesome discovery of the bodies of three babies in her home .
she told investigators they had each died shortly after birth at different times over the past years .
" these incomprehensible cases leave us deeply shaken , " chancellor angela merkel said in a recent newspaper interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cases of child abuse and neglect have risen the federal crime office says that statistics show the number of children killed at home was not on the rise overall .
but reported child-abuse cases had climbed to more than 3,000 in 2006 from about 1,900 in 1995 .
german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung reported recently that between 80 and 100 children die in germany each year from neglect and abuse .
authorities removed about 170,000 children and teenagers from their parents ' homes in 2006 and placed them in state care .
boosting preventive measures the incidents of abuse , neglect and killing of children have forced the government to take action .
the social democrats have spoken of enshrining children 's rights in the constitution .
last week , merkel called a crisis meeting with the heads of the 16 federal states to launch a raft of measures aimed at preventing families from falling into the desperate situations believed to be at least partially responsible for some of the abuse and crimes .
they approved a package that allows authorities to take swifter action when abuse or neglect of a child is suspected .
it also includes regular checkups for babies and toddlers and obliges doctors to report suspicious cases .
in addition a national database is to be created that will compile information from social welfare offices , family courts , health care providers , child protection services and the police .
the integrated database will enable authorities to form a more comprehensive profile of each family , and better access the risk of violence for children at home .
growing poverty to blame though germany has moved to pass child-friendly measures such as increasing benefits for stay-at-home parents and increasing kindergarten capacities , it 's widely believed that the worsening situation is connected to the unpopular labor market reforms known as hartz iv .

the issue is set to dominate the political debate early next year . peter struck , head of the spd 's parliamentary group , said that the party 's strong stance on the issue will take center stage in three upcoming regional polls .
in the state of hesse , one of two states going to the polls on jan 27 , the spd is to begin collecting signatures in favour of a statutory minimum wage . " we will start petition drives during the state elections next year .
then the voters will have their say , " struck told daily bild . " we will turn these regional elections and the general election in 2009 into a referendum on the minimum wage , " he added . the view was echoed by spd acting vice chairwoman , andrea nahles this week when she said a national minimum wage will be one of the top goals of her party in the coming year . " the spd wants an overall minimum wage .
we will not budge from this , " said nahles . crucial campaigning tool trailing in most national polls by about ten percent , the spd believes that their support of a minimum wage will be a winning strategy as they look ahead into 2008 and general elections in sept 2009 . although they are political rivals , the spd and chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have been ruling together at the federal level in a " grand coalition " since sept 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minimum wage debate has split the ruling coalition the spd 's across-the-board support of a national minimum wage is part of the party 's larger campaign to distinguish itself from merkel 's cdu in upcoming elections . in an effort to reach out to leftwing voters and cashing in on a groundswell of popular feeling on the issue , the spd has also opposed soaring executive pay against the backdrop of stagnating disposable income for most ordinary workers . germany is one of only five european union countries without a statutory minimum wage .
the spd is pushing for the minimum hourly rate to be set at 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10.77 -rrb- . conservatives oppose statutory minimum wag e the issue of a national minimum wage has been simmering ever since chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government approved a 9.80 euro per hour minimum wage for the postal sector this fall .
it was the spd , the junior partner , that drove the change to the law with members of merkel 's cdu and business opposing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's postal sector got a minimum wage this year many in the cdu fear that a statutory minimum wage would drive jobs out of germany to eastern europe and asia . economy minister michael glos of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister-party to merkel 's christian democrats , warned that a minimum wage would lead companies to cut back on legitimate staff and force workers to take illegal jobs . " production and services would move abroad , " glos told weekly newspaper die zeit . germany 's ifo economic institute estimates that the minimum hourly rate of 7.50 euros demanded by the spd would cost the economy up to 1 million jobs . the minimum wage deal in the postal sector has triggered calls for speedy minimum wages by top representatives in sectors such as temporary work , security and garbage disposal .
however , they want to set the wage ceiling significantly lower than the 9.80 euros per hour in the post industry . volker enkerts , president of the national association of temporary work , said this week he planned to open negotiations with the unions for a minimum wage in january .

a recent spate of child murders and a survey showing growing fears in the population about the welfare of children have prompted germany to ask whether the state is failing to help overwhelmed parents . german president horst köhler called on germans this week to be more alert following the most recent incidents of two parents killing their children in separate cases over christmas .
in one a father in munich killed his eight-year-old son before suffocating himself with a plastic bag .
in the second , a mother admitted to killing her infant sons after the grandmother found the children , aged two and three , dead in the bath .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler has weighed in the debate over providing better care for children " we need to be attentive to children , particularly in the hearts and minds of adults , " köhler told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on friday , dec 28 .
" do we want to accept that a child starves or has to suffer behind closed doors in germany ? "
köhler said .
fear of social isolation that question is plaguing germany and has now turned into a national debate about how germany cares for its children and how large a role the government can and should play in protecting them .
the soul-searching was reflected in the results of a recent survey aimed at identifying germans ' biggest fears for the future .
conducted by the foundation for questions of the future based in hamburg , the representative poll found that the number of germans who pinpointed hostility against children as the biggest concern for the future had almost doubled in the past eight years - from 22 to nearly 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans fear being socially isolated the same study showed that social isolation is the biggest fear among germans .
58 percent of the population is worried that it 's growing , up from 52 percent in 2003 and only 42 percent in 1999 .
the survey , which was conducted in nine european countries , quizzed 2,000 germans aged 14 and above on their fears .

" on a personal level , the germans largely long for trust , affection and human warmth . "
germany " deeply shaken " the christmas child murders are n't the first to rock the country .
earlier this month police found the bodies of five brothers , aged three to nine , in a home in the northern hamlet of darry after their 31-year-old mother confessed to a psychiatrist that she had killed them .
in plauen , near chemnitz in eastern germany , another woman was arrested after the gruesome discovery of the bodies of three babies in her home .
she told investigators they had each died shortly after birth at different times over the past years .
" these incomprehensible cases leave us deeply shaken , " chancellor angela merkel said in a recent newspaper interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cases of child abuse and neglect have risen the federal crime office says that statistics show the number of children killed at home was not on the rise overall .
but reported child-abuse cases had climbed to more than 3,000 in 2006 from about 1,900 in 1995 .
german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung reported recently that between 80 and 100 children die in germany each year from neglect and abuse .
authorities removed about 170,000 children and teenagers from their parents ' homes in 2006 and placed them in state care .
boosting preventive measures the incidents of abuse , neglect and killing of children have forced the government to take action .
the social democrats have spoken of enshrining children 's rights in the constitution .
last week , merkel called a crisis meeting with the heads of the 16 federal states to launch a raft of measures aimed at preventing families from falling into the desperate situations believed to be at least partially responsible for some of the abuse and crimes .
they approved a package that allows authorities to take swifter action when abuse or neglect of a child is suspected .
it also includes regular checkups for babies and toddlers and obliges doctors to report suspicious cases .
in addition a national database is to be created that will compile information from social welfare offices , family courts , health care providers , child protection services and the police .
the integrated database will enable authorities to form a more comprehensive profile of each family , and better access the risk of violence for children at home .
growing poverty to blame though germany has moved to pass child-friendly measures such as increasing benefits for stay-at-home parents and increasing kindergarten capacities , it 's widely believed that the worsening situation is connected to the unpopular labor market reforms known as hartz iv .
it reduces the amount of time in which people can receive unemployment benefits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing poverty has aggravated the problem of child abuse and neglect the non-profit children 's charity of germany said in a recent report that the number of children dependent on some form of social assistance had doubled to 2.5 million since the hartz iv reforms went into effect at the beginning of 2005 .

a recent spate of child murders and a survey showing growing fears in the population about the welfare of children have prompted germany to ask whether the state is failing to help overwhelmed parents . german president horst köhler called on germans this week to be more alert following the most recent incidents of two parents killing their children in separate cases over christmas .
in one a father in munich killed his eight-year-old son before suffocating himself with a plastic bag .
in the second , a mother admitted to killing her infant sons after the grandmother found the children , aged two and three , dead in the bath .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler has weighed in the debate over providing better care for children " we need to be attentive to children , particularly in the hearts and minds of adults , " köhler told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on friday , dec 28 .
" do we want to accept that a child starves or has to suffer behind closed doors in germany ? "
köhler said .
fear of social isolation that question is plaguing germany and has now turned into a national debate about how germany cares for its children and how large a role the government can and should play in protecting them .
the soul-searching was reflected in the results of a recent survey aimed at identifying germans ' biggest fears for the future .
conducted by the foundation for questions of the future based in hamburg , the representative poll found that the number of germans who pinpointed hostility against children as the biggest concern for the future had almost doubled in the past eight years - from 22 to nearly 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans fear being socially isolated the same study showed that social isolation is the biggest fear among germans .
58 percent of the population is worried that it 's growing , up from 52 percent in 2003 and only 42 percent in 1999 .
the survey , which was conducted in nine european countries , quizzed 2,000 germans aged 14 and above on their fears .
" in comparison to other countries , germany unfortunately leads the way -lrb- in the two fears -rrb- , " head of the foundation and researcher horst opaschowski told news agency dpa .
" on a personal level , the germans largely long for trust , affection and human warmth . "
germany " deeply shaken " the christmas child murders are n't the first to rock the country .
earlier this month police found the bodies of five brothers , aged three to nine , in a home in the northern hamlet of darry after their 31-year-old mother confessed to a psychiatrist that she had killed them .
in plauen , near chemnitz in eastern germany , another woman was arrested after the gruesome discovery of the bodies of three babies in her home .
she told investigators they had each died shortly after birth at different times over the past years .
" these incomprehensible cases leave us deeply shaken , " chancellor angela merkel said in a recent newspaper interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cases of child abuse and neglect have risen the federal crime office says that statistics show the number of children killed at home was not on the rise overall .
but reported child-abuse cases had climbed to more than 3,000 in 2006 from about 1,900 in 1995 .
german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung reported recently that between 80 and 100 children die in germany each year from neglect and abuse .
authorities removed about 170,000 children and teenagers from their parents ' homes in 2006 and placed them in state care .
boosting preventive measures the incidents of abuse , neglect and killing of children have forced the government to take action .
the social democrats have spoken of enshrining children 's rights in the constitution .
last week , merkel called a crisis meeting with the heads of the 16 federal states to launch a raft of measures aimed at preventing families from falling into the desperate situations believed to be at least partially responsible for some of the abuse and crimes .
they approved a package that allows authorities to take swifter action when abuse or neglect of a child is suspected .
it also includes regular checkups for babies and toddlers and obliges doctors to report suspicious cases .
in addition a national database is to be created that will compile information from social welfare offices , family courts , health care providers , child protection services and the police .
the integrated database will enable authorities to form a more comprehensive profile of each family , and better access the risk of violence for children at home .
growing poverty to blame though germany has moved to pass child-friendly measures such as increasing benefits for stay-at-home parents and increasing kindergarten capacities , it 's widely believed that the worsening situation is connected to the unpopular labor market reforms known as hartz iv .
it reduces the amount of time in which people can receive unemployment benefits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing poverty has aggravated the problem of child abuse and neglect the non-profit children 's charity of germany said in a recent report that the number of children dependent on some form of social assistance had doubled to 2.5 million since the hartz iv reforms went into effect at the beginning of 2005 .
" -lsb- charities -rsb- and poverty researchers like me warned that this labor market reform would be a slide into poverty and that children would be those mainly affected , " christoph butterwegge , a political scientist in cologne said in an interview with the associated press . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 30.12.2007 minimum wage to loom large in political debate next year großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fate of millions of workers hangs in the balance as germany debates a minimum wage germany 's social democrats plan to put their demand for a universal minimum wage at the top of their campaign agenda for key regional polls in 2008 .
the issue is set to dominate the political debate early next year . peter struck , head of the spd 's parliamentary group , said that the party 's strong stance on the issue will take center stage in three upcoming regional polls .
in the state of hesse , one of two states going to the polls on jan 27 , the spd is to begin collecting signatures in favour of a statutory minimum wage . " we will start petition drives during the state elections next year .
then the voters will have their say , " struck told daily bild . " we will turn these regional elections and the general election in 2009 into a referendum on the minimum wage , " he added . the view was echoed by spd acting vice chairwoman , andrea nahles this week when she said a national minimum wage will be one of the top goals of her party in the coming year . " the spd wants an overall minimum wage .
we will not budge from this , " said nahles . crucial campaigning tool trailing in most national polls by about ten percent , the spd believes that their support of a minimum wage will be a winning strategy as they look ahead into 2008 and general elections in sept 2009 . although they are political rivals , the spd and chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have been ruling together at the federal level in a " grand coalition " since sept 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minimum wage debate has split the ruling coalition the spd 's across-the-board support of a national minimum wage is part of the party 's larger campaign to distinguish itself from merkel 's cdu in upcoming elections . in an effort to reach out to leftwing voters and cashing in on a groundswell of popular feeling on the issue , the spd has also opposed soaring executive pay against the backdrop of stagnating disposable income for most ordinary workers . germany is one of only five european union countries without a statutory minimum wage .
the spd is pushing for the minimum hourly rate to be set at 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10.77 -rrb- . conservatives oppose statutory minimum wag e the issue of a national minimum wage has been simmering ever since chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government approved a 9.80 euro per hour minimum wage for the postal sector this fall .
it was the spd , the junior partner , that drove the change to the law with members of merkel 's cdu and business opposing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's postal sector got a minimum wage this year many in the cdu fear that a statutory minimum wage would drive jobs out of germany to eastern europe and asia . economy minister michael glos of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister-party to merkel 's christian democrats , warned that a minimum wage would lead companies to cut back on legitimate staff and force workers to take illegal jobs . " production and services would move abroad , " glos told weekly newspaper die zeit . germany 's ifo economic institute estimates that the minimum hourly rate of 7.50 euros demanded by the spd would cost the economy up to 1 million jobs . the minimum wage deal in the postal sector has triggered calls for speedy minimum wages by top representatives in sectors such as temporary work , security and garbage disposal .
however , they want to set the wage ceiling significantly lower than the 9.80 euros per hour in the post industry . volker enkerts , president of the national association of temporary work , said this week he planned to open negotiations with the unions for a minimum wage in january . " temp work quickly needs a sector-specific minimum wage , " enkerts told daily frankfurter rundschau .
most industry heads however are unwilling to go beyond 4 to 5 euros per hour . low minimum wage will not hurt economy many economists point out that a low universal minimum wage would be less damaging to the economy than the sector-specific approach favored so far by merkel 's party .
the construction sector and office cleaning are already subject to minimum wage legislation . last week , bert rürup , chairman of the " council of wise men " - five highly regarded academics who advise the government on economic policy - came out in favor of universal hourly minimum wage of 4.50 euros last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the world 's largest exporting nation economist peter bofinger , who is part of the council , told frankfurter rundschau recently that " germany would be significantly better off if wages in the past years had risen by one percent per year . " he denied that higher personnel costs would weaken exports , arguing that even if wages were five percent higher right now , it would make german exports more expensive by just one percent . some members of the cdu too believe that a national minimum wage is inevitable . " germany can not ignore the fact that 22 of the 27 countries in the european union have a minimum wage , " lower saxony state premier christian wulff of the cdu told die welt newspaper . dw staff -lrb- ot / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the issue is set to dominate the political debate early next year . peter struck , head of the spd 's parliamentary group , said that the party 's strong stance on the issue will take center stage in three upcoming regional polls .
in the state of hesse , one of two states going to the polls on jan 27 , the spd is to begin collecting signatures in favour of a statutory minimum wage . " we will start petition drives during the state elections next year .
then the voters will have their say , " struck told daily bild . " we will turn these regional elections and the general election in 2009 into a referendum on the minimum wage , " he added . the view was echoed by spd acting vice chairwoman , andrea nahles this week when she said a national minimum wage will be one of the top goals of her party in the coming year . " the spd wants an overall minimum wage .
we will not budge from this , " said nahles . crucial campaigning tool trailing in most national polls by about ten percent , the spd believes that their support of a minimum wage will be a winning strategy as they look ahead into 2008 and general elections in sept 2009 . although they are political rivals , the spd and chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have been ruling together at the federal level in a " grand coalition " since sept 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minimum wage debate has split the ruling coalition the spd 's across-the-board support of a national minimum wage is part of the party 's larger campaign to distinguish itself from merkel 's cdu in upcoming elections . in an effort to reach out to leftwing voters and cashing in on a groundswell of popular feeling on the issue , the spd has also opposed soaring executive pay against the backdrop of stagnating disposable income for most ordinary workers . germany is one of only five european union countries without a statutory minimum wage .
the spd is pushing for the minimum hourly rate to be set at 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10.77 -rrb- . conservatives oppose statutory minimum wag e the issue of a national minimum wage has been simmering ever since chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government approved a 9.80 euro per hour minimum wage for the postal sector this fall .
it was the spd , the junior partner , that drove the change to the law with members of merkel 's cdu and business opposing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's postal sector got a minimum wage this year many in the cdu fear that a statutory minimum wage would drive jobs out of germany to eastern europe and asia . economy minister michael glos of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister-party to merkel 's christian democrats , warned that a minimum wage would lead companies to cut back on legitimate staff and force workers to take illegal jobs . " production and services would move abroad , " glos told weekly newspaper die zeit . germany 's ifo economic institute estimates that the minimum hourly rate of 7.50 euros demanded by the spd would cost the economy up to 1 million jobs . the minimum wage deal in the postal sector has triggered calls for speedy minimum wages by top representatives in sectors such as temporary work , security and garbage disposal .
however , they want to set the wage ceiling significantly lower than the 9.80 euros per hour in the post industry . volker enkerts , president of the national association of temporary work , said this week he planned to open negotiations with the unions for a minimum wage in january . " temp work quickly needs a sector-specific minimum wage , " enkerts told daily frankfurter rundschau .
most industry heads however are unwilling to go beyond 4 to 5 euros per hour . low minimum wage will not hurt economy many economists point out that a low universal minimum wage would be less damaging to the economy than the sector-specific approach favored so far by merkel 's party .
the construction sector and office cleaning are already subject to minimum wage legislation . last week , bert rürup , chairman of the " council of wise men " - five highly regarded academics who advise the government on economic policy - came out in favor of universal hourly minimum wage of 4.50 euros last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the world 's largest exporting nation economist peter bofinger , who is part of the council , told frankfurter rundschau recently that " germany would be significantly better off if wages in the past years had risen by one percent per year . " he denied that higher personnel costs would weaken exports , arguing that even if wages were five percent higher right now , it would make german exports more expensive by just one percent . some members of the cdu too believe that a national minimum wage is inevitable .

we will not budge from this , " said nahles . crucial campaigning tool trailing in most national polls by about ten percent , the spd believes that their support of a minimum wage will be a winning strategy as they look ahead into 2008 and general elections in sept 2009 . although they are political rivals , the spd and chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have been ruling together at the federal level in a " grand coalition " since sept 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minimum wage debate has split the ruling coalition the spd 's across-the-board support of a national minimum wage is part of the party 's larger campaign to distinguish itself from merkel 's cdu in upcoming elections . in an effort to reach out to leftwing voters and cashing in on a groundswell of popular feeling on the issue , the spd has also opposed soaring executive pay against the backdrop of stagnating disposable income for most ordinary workers . germany is one of only five european union countries without a statutory minimum wage .
the spd is pushing for the minimum hourly rate to be set at 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10.77 -rrb- . conservatives oppose statutory minimum wag e the issue of a national minimum wage has been simmering ever since chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government approved a 9.80 euro per hour minimum wage for the postal sector this fall .
it was the spd , the junior partner , that drove the change to the law with members of merkel 's cdu and business opposing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's postal sector got a minimum wage this year many in the cdu fear that a statutory minimum wage would drive jobs out of germany to eastern europe and asia . economy minister michael glos of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister-party to merkel 's christian democrats , warned that a minimum wage would lead companies to cut back on legitimate staff and force workers to take illegal jobs . " production and services would move abroad , " glos told weekly newspaper die zeit . germany 's ifo economic institute estimates that the minimum hourly rate of 7.50 euros demanded by the spd would cost the economy up to 1 million jobs . the minimum wage deal in the postal sector has triggered calls for speedy minimum wages by top representatives in sectors such as temporary work , security and garbage disposal .
however , they want to set the wage ceiling significantly lower than the 9.80 euros per hour in the post industry . volker enkerts , president of the national association of temporary work , said this week he planned to open negotiations with the unions for a minimum wage in january . " temp work quickly needs a sector-specific minimum wage , " enkerts told daily frankfurter rundschau .
most industry heads however are unwilling to go beyond 4 to 5 euros per hour . low minimum wage will not hurt economy many economists point out that a low universal minimum wage would be less damaging to the economy than the sector-specific approach favored so far by merkel 's party .
the construction sector and office cleaning are already subject to minimum wage legislation . last week , bert rürup , chairman of the " council of wise men " - five highly regarded academics who advise the government on economic policy - came out in favor of universal hourly minimum wage of 4.50 euros last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the world 's largest exporting nation economist peter bofinger , who is part of the council , told frankfurter rundschau recently that " germany would be significantly better off if wages in the past years had risen by one percent per year . " he denied that higher personnel costs would weaken exports , arguing that even if wages were five percent higher right now , it would make german exports more expensive by just one percent . some members of the cdu too believe that a national minimum wage is inevitable . " germany can not ignore the fact that 22 of the 27 countries in the european union have a minimum wage , " lower saxony state premier christian wulff of the cdu told die welt newspaper . dw staff -lrb- ot / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a recent spate of child murders and a survey showing growing fears in the population about the welfare of children have prompted germany to ask whether the state is failing to help overwhelmed parents . german president horst köhler called on germans this week to be more alert following the most recent incidents of two parents killing their children in separate cases over christmas .
in one a father in munich killed his eight-year-old son before suffocating himself with a plastic bag .
in the second , a mother admitted to killing her infant sons after the grandmother found the children , aged two and three , dead in the bath .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler has weighed in the debate over providing better care for children " we need to be attentive to children , particularly in the hearts and minds of adults , " köhler told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on friday , dec 28 .
" do we want to accept that a child starves or has to suffer behind closed doors in germany ? "
köhler said .
fear of social isolation that question is plaguing germany and has now turned into a national debate about how germany cares for its children and how large a role the government can and should play in protecting them .
the soul-searching was reflected in the results of a recent survey aimed at identifying germans ' biggest fears for the future .
conducted by the foundation for questions of the future based in hamburg , the representative poll found that the number of germans who pinpointed hostility against children as the biggest concern for the future had almost doubled in the past eight years - from 22 to nearly 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans fear being socially isolated the same study showed that social isolation is the biggest fear among germans .
58 percent of the population is worried that it 's growing , up from 52 percent in 2003 and only 42 percent in 1999 .

germany " deeply shaken " the christmas child murders are n't the first to rock the country .
earlier this month police found the bodies of five brothers , aged three to nine , in a home in the northern hamlet of darry after their 31-year-old mother confessed to a psychiatrist that she had killed them .
in plauen , near chemnitz in eastern germany , another woman was arrested after the gruesome discovery of the bodies of three babies in her home .

german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung reported recently that between 80 and 100 children die in germany each year from neglect and abuse .
authorities removed about 170,000 children and teenagers from their parents ' homes in 2006 and placed them in state care .
boosting preventive measures the incidents of abuse , neglect and killing of children have forced the government to take action .
the social democrats have spoken of enshrining children 's rights in the constitution .
last week , merkel called a crisis meeting with the heads of the 16 federal states to launch a raft of measures aimed at preventing families from falling into the desperate situations believed to be at least partially responsible for some of the abuse and crimes .
they approved a package that allows authorities to take swifter action when abuse or neglect of a child is suspected .
it also includes regular checkups for babies and toddlers and obliges doctors to report suspicious cases .
in addition a national database is to be created that will compile information from social welfare offices , family courts , health care providers , child protection services and the police .
the integrated database will enable authorities to form a more comprehensive profile of each family , and better access the risk of violence for children at home .
growing poverty to blame though germany has moved to pass child-friendly measures such as increasing benefits for stay-at-home parents and increasing kindergarten capacities , it 's widely believed that the worsening situation is connected to the unpopular labor market reforms known as hartz iv .

the issue is set to dominate the political debate early next year . peter struck , head of the spd 's parliamentary group , said that the party 's strong stance on the issue will take center stage in three upcoming regional polls .
in the state of hesse , one of two states going to the polls on jan 27 , the spd is to begin collecting signatures in favour of a statutory minimum wage . " we will start petition drives during the state elections next year .
then the voters will have their say , " struck told daily bild . " we will turn these regional elections and the general election in 2009 into a referendum on the minimum wage , " he added . the view was echoed by spd acting vice chairwoman , andrea nahles this week when she said a national minimum wage will be one of the top goals of her party in the coming year . " the spd wants an overall minimum wage .
we will not budge from this , " said nahles . crucial campaigning tool trailing in most national polls by about ten percent , the spd believes that their support of a minimum wage will be a winning strategy as they look ahead into 2008 and general elections in sept 2009 . although they are political rivals , the spd and chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have been ruling together at the federal level in a " grand coalition " since sept 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minimum wage debate has split the ruling coalition the spd 's across-the-board support of a national minimum wage is part of the party 's larger campaign to distinguish itself from merkel 's cdu in upcoming elections . in an effort to reach out to leftwing voters and cashing in on a groundswell of popular feeling on the issue , the spd has also opposed soaring executive pay against the backdrop of stagnating disposable income for most ordinary workers . germany is one of only five european union countries without a statutory minimum wage .
the spd is pushing for the minimum hourly rate to be set at 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10.77 -rrb- . conservatives oppose statutory minimum wag e the issue of a national minimum wage has been simmering ever since chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government approved a 9.80 euro per hour minimum wage for the postal sector this fall .
it was the spd , the junior partner , that drove the change to the law with members of merkel 's cdu and business opposing it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's postal sector got a minimum wage this year many in the cdu fear that a statutory minimum wage would drive jobs out of germany to eastern europe and asia . economy minister michael glos of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister-party to merkel 's christian democrats , warned that a minimum wage would lead companies to cut back on legitimate staff and force workers to take illegal jobs . " production and services would move abroad , " glos told weekly newspaper die zeit . germany 's ifo economic institute estimates that the minimum hourly rate of 7.50 euros demanded by the spd would cost the economy up to 1 million jobs . the minimum wage deal in the postal sector has triggered calls for speedy minimum wages by top representatives in sectors such as temporary work , security and garbage disposal .
however , they want to set the wage ceiling significantly lower than the 9.80 euros per hour in the post industry . volker enkerts , president of the national association of temporary work , said this week he planned to open negotiations with the unions for a minimum wage in january . " temp work quickly needs a sector-specific minimum wage , " enkerts told daily frankfurter rundschau .
most industry heads however are unwilling to go beyond 4 to 5 euros per hour . low minimum wage will not hurt economy many economists point out that a low universal minimum wage would be less damaging to the economy than the sector-specific approach favored so far by merkel 's party .
the construction sector and office cleaning are already subject to minimum wage legislation . last week , bert rürup , chairman of the " council of wise men " - five highly regarded academics who advise the government on economic policy - came out in favor of universal hourly minimum wage of 4.50 euros last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the world 's largest exporting nation economist peter bofinger , who is part of the council , told frankfurter rundschau recently that " germany would be significantly better off if wages in the past years had risen by one percent per year . " he denied that higher personnel costs would weaken exports , arguing that even if wages were five percent higher right now , it would make german exports more expensive by just one percent . some members of the cdu too believe that a national minimum wage is inevitable .

a recent spate of child murders and a survey showing growing fears in the population about the welfare of children have prompted germany to ask whether the state is failing to help overwhelmed parents . german president horst köhler called on germans this week to be more alert following the most recent incidents of two parents killing their children in separate cases over christmas .
in one a father in munich killed his eight-year-old son before suffocating himself with a plastic bag .
in the second , a mother admitted to killing her infant sons after the grandmother found the children , aged two and three , dead in the bath .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler has weighed in the debate over providing better care for children " we need to be attentive to children , particularly in the hearts and minds of adults , " köhler told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on friday , dec 28 .
" do we want to accept that a child starves or has to suffer behind closed doors in germany ? "
köhler said .
fear of social isolation that question is plaguing germany and has now turned into a national debate about how germany cares for its children and how large a role the government can and should play in protecting them .
the soul-searching was reflected in the results of a recent survey aimed at identifying germans ' biggest fears for the future .
conducted by the foundation for questions of the future based in hamburg , the representative poll found that the number of germans who pinpointed hostility against children as the biggest concern for the future had almost doubled in the past eight years - from 22 to nearly 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans fear being socially isolated the same study showed that social isolation is the biggest fear among germans .
58 percent of the population is worried that it 's growing , up from 52 percent in 2003 and only 42 percent in 1999 .
the survey , which was conducted in nine european countries , quizzed 2,000 germans aged 14 and above on their fears .
" in comparison to other countries , germany unfortunately leads the way -lrb- in the two fears -rrb- , " head of the foundation and researcher horst opaschowski told news agency dpa .
" on a personal level , the germans largely long for trust , affection and human warmth . "
germany " deeply shaken " the christmas child murders are n't the first to rock the country .
earlier this month police found the bodies of five brothers , aged three to nine , in a home in the northern hamlet of darry after their 31-year-old mother confessed to a psychiatrist that she had killed them .
in plauen , near chemnitz in eastern germany , another woman was arrested after the gruesome discovery of the bodies of three babies in her home .
she told investigators they had each died shortly after birth at different times over the past years .
" these incomprehensible cases leave us deeply shaken , " chancellor angela merkel said in a recent newspaper interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cases of child abuse and neglect have risen the federal crime office says that statistics show the number of children killed at home was not on the rise overall .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans fear being socially isolated the same study showed that social isolation is the biggest fear among germans .
58 percent of the population is worried that it 's growing , up from 52 percent in 2003 and only 42 percent in 1999 .
the survey , which was conducted in nine european countries , quizzed 2,000 germans aged 14 and above on their fears .
" in comparison to other countries , germany unfortunately leads the way -lrb- in the two fears -rrb- , " head of the foundation and researcher horst opaschowski told news agency dpa .
" on a personal level , the germans largely long for trust , affection and human warmth . "
germany " deeply shaken " the christmas child murders are n't the first to rock the country .
earlier this month police found the bodies of five brothers , aged three to nine , in a home in the northern hamlet of darry after their 31-year-old mother confessed to a psychiatrist that she had killed them .
in plauen , near chemnitz in eastern germany , another woman was arrested after the gruesome discovery of the bodies of three babies in her home .
she told investigators they had each died shortly after birth at different times over the past years .
" these incomprehensible cases leave us deeply shaken , " chancellor angela merkel said in a recent newspaper interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cases of child abuse and neglect have risen the federal crime office says that statistics show the number of children killed at home was not on the rise overall .
but reported child-abuse cases had climbed to more than 3,000 in 2006 from about 1,900 in 1995 .
german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung reported recently that between 80 and 100 children die in germany each year from neglect and abuse .
authorities removed about 170,000 children and teenagers from their parents ' homes in 2006 and placed them in state care .
boosting preventive measures the incidents of abuse , neglect and killing of children have forced the government to take action .
the social democrats have spoken of enshrining children 's rights in the constitution .
last week , merkel called a crisis meeting with the heads of the 16 federal states to launch a raft of measures aimed at preventing families from falling into the desperate situations believed to be at least partially responsible for some of the abuse and crimes .
they approved a package that allows authorities to take swifter action when abuse or neglect of a child is suspected .
it also includes regular checkups for babies and toddlers and obliges doctors to report suspicious cases .
in addition a national database is to be created that will compile information from social welfare offices , family courts , health care providers , child protection services and the police .
the integrated database will enable authorities to form a more comprehensive profile of each family , and better access the risk of violence for children at home .
growing poverty to blame though germany has moved to pass child-friendly measures such as increasing benefits for stay-at-home parents and increasing kindergarten capacities , it 's widely believed that the worsening situation is connected to the unpopular labor market reforms known as hartz iv .
it reduces the amount of time in which people can receive unemployment benefits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing poverty has aggravated the problem of child abuse and neglect the non-profit children 's charity of germany said in a recent report that the number of children dependent on some form of social assistance had doubled to 2.5 million since the hartz iv reforms went into effect at the beginning of 2005 .

a recent spate of child murders and a survey showing growing fears in the population about the welfare of children have prompted germany to ask whether the state is failing to help overwhelmed parents . german president horst köhler called on germans this week to be more alert following the most recent incidents of two parents killing their children in separate cases over christmas .
in one a father in munich killed his eight-year-old son before suffocating himself with a plastic bag .
in the second , a mother admitted to killing her infant sons after the grandmother found the children , aged two and three , dead in the bath .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler has weighed in the debate over providing better care for children " we need to be attentive to children , particularly in the hearts and minds of adults , " köhler told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on friday , dec 28 .
" do we want to accept that a child starves or has to suffer behind closed doors in germany ? "
köhler said .
fear of social isolation that question is plaguing germany and has now turned into a national debate about how germany cares for its children and how large a role the government can and should play in protecting them .
the soul-searching was reflected in the results of a recent survey aimed at identifying germans ' biggest fears for the future .

a recent spate of child murders and a survey showing growing fears in the population about the welfare of children have prompted germany to ask whether the state is failing to help overwhelmed parents . german president horst köhler called on germans this week to be more alert following the most recent incidents of two parents killing their children in separate cases over christmas .
in one a father in munich killed his eight-year-old son before suffocating himself with a plastic bag .
in the second , a mother admitted to killing her infant sons after the grandmother found the children , aged two and three , dead in the bath .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler has weighed in the debate over providing better care for children " we need to be attentive to children , particularly in the hearts and minds of adults , " köhler told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on friday , dec 28 .
" do we want to accept that a child starves or has to suffer behind closed doors in germany ? "
köhler said .
fear of social isolation that question is plaguing germany and has now turned into a national debate about how germany cares for its children and how large a role the government can and should play in protecting them .
the soul-searching was reflected in the results of a recent survey aimed at identifying germans ' biggest fears for the future .
conducted by the foundation for questions of the future based in hamburg , the representative poll found that the number of germans who pinpointed hostility against children as the biggest concern for the future had almost doubled in the past eight years - from 22 to nearly 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans fear being socially isolated the same study showed that social isolation is the biggest fear among germans .
58 percent of the population is worried that it 's growing , up from 52 percent in 2003 and only 42 percent in 1999 .
the survey , which was conducted in nine european countries , quizzed 2,000 germans aged 14 and above on their fears .
" in comparison to other countries , germany unfortunately leads the way -lrb- in the two fears -rrb- , " head of the foundation and researcher horst opaschowski told news agency dpa .
" on a personal level , the germans largely long for trust , affection and human warmth . "
germany " deeply shaken " the christmas child murders are n't the first to rock the country .
earlier this month police found the bodies of five brothers , aged three to nine , in a home in the northern hamlet of darry after their 31-year-old mother confessed to a psychiatrist that she had killed them .
in plauen , near chemnitz in eastern germany , another woman was arrested after the gruesome discovery of the bodies of three babies in her home .
she told investigators they had each died shortly after birth at different times over the past years .
" these incomprehensible cases leave us deeply shaken , " chancellor angela merkel said in a recent newspaper interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cases of child abuse and neglect have risen the federal crime office says that statistics show the number of children killed at home was not on the rise overall .
but reported child-abuse cases had climbed to more than 3,000 in 2006 from about 1,900 in 1995 .
german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung reported recently that between 80 and 100 children die in germany each year from neglect and abuse .
authorities removed about 170,000 children and teenagers from their parents ' homes in 2006 and placed them in state care .
boosting preventive measures the incidents of abuse , neglect and killing of children have forced the government to take action .
the social democrats have spoken of enshrining children 's rights in the constitution .
last week , merkel called a crisis meeting with the heads of the 16 federal states to launch a raft of measures aimed at preventing families from falling into the desperate situations believed to be at least partially responsible for some of the abuse and crimes .
they approved a package that allows authorities to take swifter action when abuse or neglect of a child is suspected .
it also includes regular checkups for babies and toddlers and obliges doctors to report suspicious cases .
in addition a national database is to be created that will compile information from social welfare offices , family courts , health care providers , child protection services and the police .
the integrated database will enable authorities to form a more comprehensive profile of each family , and better access the risk of violence for children at home .
growing poverty to blame though germany has moved to pass child-friendly measures such as increasing benefits for stay-at-home parents and increasing kindergarten capacities , it 's widely believed that the worsening situation is connected to the unpopular labor market reforms known as hartz iv .
it reduces the amount of time in which people can receive unemployment benefits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing poverty has aggravated the problem of child abuse and neglect the non-profit children 's charity of germany said in a recent report that the number of children dependent on some form of social assistance had doubled to 2.5 million since the hartz iv reforms went into effect at the beginning of 2005 .

a recent spate of child murders and a survey showing growing fears in the population about the welfare of children have prompted germany to ask whether the state is failing to help overwhelmed parents . german president horst köhler called on germans this week to be more alert following the most recent incidents of two parents killing their children in separate cases over christmas .
in one a father in munich killed his eight-year-old son before suffocating himself with a plastic bag .
in the second , a mother admitted to killing her infant sons after the grandmother found the children , aged two and three , dead in the bath .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler has weighed in the debate over providing better care for children " we need to be attentive to children , particularly in the hearts and minds of adults , " köhler told german newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on friday , dec 28 .
" do we want to accept that a child starves or has to suffer behind closed doors in germany ? "
köhler said .
fear of social isolation that question is plaguing germany and has now turned into a national debate about how germany cares for its children and how large a role the government can and should play in protecting them .
the soul-searching was reflected in the results of a recent survey aimed at identifying germans ' biggest fears for the future .
conducted by the foundation for questions of the future based in hamburg , the representative poll found that the number of germans who pinpointed hostility against children as the biggest concern for the future had almost doubled in the past eight years - from 22 to nearly 40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans fear being socially isolated the same study showed that social isolation is the biggest fear among germans .
58 percent of the population is worried that it 's growing , up from 52 percent in 2003 and only 42 percent in 1999 .
the survey , which was conducted in nine european countries , quizzed 2,000 germans aged 14 and above on their fears .
" in comparison to other countries , germany unfortunately leads the way -lrb- in the two fears -rrb- , " head of the foundation and researcher horst opaschowski told news agency dpa .
" on a personal level , the germans largely long for trust , affection and human warmth . "
germany " deeply shaken " the christmas child murders are n't the first to rock the country .
earlier this month police found the bodies of five brothers , aged three to nine , in a home in the northern hamlet of darry after their 31-year-old mother confessed to a psychiatrist that she had killed them .
in plauen , near chemnitz in eastern germany , another woman was arrested after the gruesome discovery of the bodies of three babies in her home .
she told investigators they had each died shortly after birth at different times over the past years .
" these incomprehensible cases leave us deeply shaken , " chancellor angela merkel said in a recent newspaper interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cases of child abuse and neglect have risen the federal crime office says that statistics show the number of children killed at home was not on the rise overall .
but reported child-abuse cases had climbed to more than 3,000 in 2006 from about 1,900 in 1995 .
german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung reported recently that between 80 and 100 children die in germany each year from neglect and abuse .
authorities removed about 170,000 children and teenagers from their parents ' homes in 2006 and placed them in state care .
boosting preventive measures the incidents of abuse , neglect and killing of children have forced the government to take action .
the social democrats have spoken of enshrining children 's rights in the constitution .
last week , merkel called a crisis meeting with the heads of the 16 federal states to launch a raft of measures aimed at preventing families from falling into the desperate situations believed to be at least partially responsible for some of the abuse and crimes .
they approved a package that allows authorities to take swifter action when abuse or neglect of a child is suspected .
it also includes regular checkups for babies and toddlers and obliges doctors to report suspicious cases .
in addition a national database is to be created that will compile information from social welfare offices , family courts , health care providers , child protection services and the police .
the integrated database will enable authorities to form a more comprehensive profile of each family , and better access the risk of violence for children at home .

this compares to about 48.6 million tons in 2007 . " the car industry is our most important customer but the tendency to purchase has been significantly curtailed , " said ameling , pointing to additional economic risks unleashed by the global credit crunch . strong demand from asia expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's demand for steel has soared the steel industry , however , remained confident that strong demand from china and the world 's leading emerging economies in asia would continue in 2008 , consequently helping to underpin investment in the domestic german steel sector . while ameling expects consolidation to continue in the global steel sector , he believes that the european commission monopoly authorities would be unlikely to give the green light to the merger between the giant australian steel producers bhp billiton and rio tinto . as a reason for continuing consolidation in the steel sector , ameling said that unlike the car or aluminum industries - where the top five companies together control a 50-percent global market share - the leading five producers in the steel sector have only a 20-percent market share worldwide . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mr fukuda said the neighbours could do more for the world by co-operating than each would achieve single-handedly .
despite the remarks , earlier talks with his chinese counterpart , wen jiabao , and president hu jintao did not resolve a dispute over maritime gas fields .
mr fukuda 's visit to china was his first since taking office in september .
china refused high-level contact with japan from 2001 to 2006 during the premiership of junichiro koizumi , after he made annual visits to the controversial yasukuni war shrine .
mr fukuda has said he will not visit the shrine while he is in power and has called for japan to be humble about its past .
' meaningful ' talks speaking after visiting the birthplace of the philosopher confucius in the eastern town of qufu in shandong province , mr fukuda said his trip to china had been " very meaningful " .
" i had in-depth discussions with chinese leaders and agreed that japan and china can do more if they co-operate than each can do single-handedly , " he told reporters .
" there will be nothing good for the region and the world unless japan and china have co-operative relations , " he added .
before visiting qufu , mr fukuda travelled to tianjin to tour a toyota car factory in the city .
he had earlier played a game of catch with mr wen jiabao in beijing following three days of talks aimed at improving sino-japanese relations .
the two men agreed to co-operate on climate change and trade , and to increase youth exchanges between their countries .
but despite 11 previous rounds of talks , no agreement has been reached on the two countries ' territorial dispute over lucrative gas fields in the east china sea .
china does not accept the maritime border which japan has proposed as a starting point for negotiations .
the two leaders agreed only to raise discussions to vice-ministerial level .

vivid eyewitness accounts refer to a gunman firing shots , and then apparently blowing himself up .
others say there were two attackers .
and while the government says she was killed as her head was slammed against her vehicle , her associates said she died from gunshot wounds .
one of the most direct reports has come from getty picture agency photographer john moore , who had been covering the rally all day .
as he was preparing to leave , he told the london newspaper the guardian , he was " shocked " to notice that ms bhutto was standing out of her car 's sunroof waving to supporters as her vehicle slowly pushed its way through the crowds .
he continued : " as this happened , i was aware of bhutto ducking back into the car and heard at least two gunshots .
i picked up my camera unaware of exactly what was happening .
map : scene of the assassination " as i did so a bomb detonated next to the car about 30ft -lrb- 10m -rrb- from where i was in the crowd .
" i kept the motordrive running as i was pushed back in the crowd , getting pictures of the blast as it went off and crowd members reeling from it .
" the volume of people stopped me getting any closer . "
many of the pictures he took have since appeared in newspapers , television and news websites around the world - including this one .
' kalashnikov ' a bbc correspondent at the rally , shahzad malik , said : " i heard a blast .
i rushed across to where so many people were lying injured and dead . "
speaking from his hospital bed , an unnamed eyewitness gave this account : " madame benazir came outside the gate -lsb- after the rally -rsb- .
after that there was commotion , there were shots and there was an explosion and then it was chaos . "
another eyewitness - also unnamed - was even closer : " we were standing right in front of her .
in that instant a young man , fair , about 20 to 21 years of age , he fired a kalashnikov aiming at bb -lsb- bhutto -rsb- .
" he was standing beside me , moved a little back , so i thrust my hand out at him and just then there was a blast .
asked if it was the suicide bomber himself that he 'd seen , he replied : " i ca n't really say .
was it him or someone else , i ca n't say . "
a member of ms bhutto 's ppp party , mohammad zaman , told the bbc : " the meeting went perfectly well .
she delivered her speech , she came down the stage and got on the land-cruiser .
" she started coming out , we heard three -lsb- shots -rsb- fired , and after that the bomb blast went -lsb- off -rsb- .
" and when i came down the road i saw there was loads and loads of injured .
and i really thought that her vehicle was safe and left the place safely .
i was hoping she would be okay . "
in fact , she had been fatally injured .
ppp supporters have been accusing president musharraf 's government of failing to protect ms bhutto .
but this has been vehemently denied by the acting interior minister , retired general hamid narwaz khan .
' dedicated security ' he told the bbc the government had had reports of threats to her life , and had passed them on . "
in the heat of the moment i think she got up just to wave at her supporters , and that is the time and the chance which the suicide bomber got to hit her " hamid narwaz khan acting interior minister he continued : " she was protected , and we had provided a dedicated officer ... to take care of her security .
" her rallies were also secured .
" this rally in liaqat bagh ... the venue was totally secured through screen doors and a bullet-proof rostrum .
all other security arrangements had been made with a very large deployment of police .
" she came out after the rally and sat in her vehicle and the movement started .
" even at that time there were about 20 police escorting her , and the security officer assigned to her was travelling with her in the same vehicle . "
the minister went on to describe how the road was blocked by a group of her supporters , and ms bhutto stood up through the open sunroof of her car to greet them .
" that was the time she was hit by the suicide bomber , " he said .
" this was the best we could do , " he added .
" there were four other people travelling with her in the same vehicle ... if she had stayed down she would be safe , as all four of them are absolutely scratch-free .
" but in the heat of the moment i think she got up just to wave at her supporters , and that is the time and the chance which the suicide bomber got to hit her . "
interior ministry spokesman javed iqbal cheema presented a video showing ms bhutto in the final moments before the attack .
it showed her waving from the sun roof of her vehicle .
brig cheema said she ducked back inside after the shots rang out , but that the shock waves from the bomb slammed her head into a lever on the sun roof , and that this was the fatal wound .
this did not convince some of her aides at the scene , who said she died from two bullet wounds .
meanwhile , a surgeon who treated her believed she had died from the impact of shrapnel to her head .
the assassination of benazir bhutto 1 .
benazir bhutto had addressed a rally of thousands of supporters in rawalpindi 's liaqat bagh park 2 .
as her convoy was leaving the park via the rear gate onto murree road , a gunman fired at her .

an explosion then tore through the crowd , killing at least 16 people 4 .
ms bhutto was taken to rawalpindi general hospital , but was pronounced dead at 1816 local time .

i rushed across to where so many people were lying injured and dead . "
speaking from his hospital bed , an unnamed eyewitness gave this account : " madame benazir came outside the gate -lsb- after the rally -rsb- .
after that there was commotion , there were shots and there was an explosion and then it was chaos . "
the bomber caused carnage -lrb- warning : graphic content ! -rrb-
enlarge image another eyewitness - also unnamed - was even closer : " we were standing right in front of her .
in that instant a young man , fair , about 20 to 21 years of age , he fired a kalashnikov aiming at bb -lsb- bhutto -rsb- .
" he was standing beside me , moved a little back , so i thrust my hand out at him and just then there was a blast .
asked if it was the suicide bomber himself that he 'd seen , he replied : " i ca n't really say .
was it him or someone else , i ca n't say . "
a member of ms bhutto 's ppp party , mohammad zaman , told the bbc : " the meeting went perfectly well .
she delivered her speech , she came down the stage and got on the land-cruiser .
" she started coming out , we heard three -lsb- shots -rsb- fired , and after that the bomb blast went -lsb- off -rsb- .
" and when i came down the road i saw there was loads and loads of injured .
and i really thought that her vehicle was safe and left the place safely .
i was hoping she would be okay . "
in fact , she had been fatally injured .
ppp supporters have been accusing president musharraf 's government of failing to protect ms bhutto .
but this has been vehemently denied by the acting interior minister , retired general hamid narwaz khan .
' dedicated security ' he told the bbc the government had had reports of threats to her life , and had passed them on .
in the heat of the moment i think she got up just to wave at her supporters , and that is the time and the chance which the suicide bomber got to hit her hamid narwaz khan acting interior minister he continued : " she was protected , and we had provided a dedicated officer ... to take care of her security .
" her rallies were also secured .
" this rally in liaqat bagh ... the venue was totally secured through screen doors and a bullet-proof rostrum .
all other security arrangements had been made with a very large deployment of police .
" she came out after the rally and sat in her vehicle and the movement started .
" even at that time there were about 20 police escorting her , and the security officer assigned to her was travelling with her in the same vehicle . "
the minister went on to describe how the road was blocked by a group of her supporters , and ms bhutto stood up through the open sunroof of her car to greet them .
" that was the time she was hit by the suicide bomber , " he said .
" this was the best we could do , " he added .
" there were four other people travelling with her in the same vehicle ... if she had stayed down she would be safe , as all four of them are absolutely scratch-free .
" but in the heat of the moment i think she got up just to wave at her supporters , and that is the time and the chance which the suicide bomber got to hit her . "
interior ministry spokesman javed iqbal cheema presented a video showing ms bhutto in the final moments before the attack .
it showed her waving from the sun roof of her vehicle .
brig cheema said she ducked back inside after the shots rang out , but that the shock waves from the bomb slammed her head into a lever on the sun roof , and that this was the fatal wound .
this did not convince some of her aides at the scene , who said she died from two bullet wounds .
meanwhile , a surgeon who treated her believed she had died from the impact of shrapnel to her head .
the assassination of benazir bhutto 1 .
benazir bhutto had addressed a rally of thousands of supporters in rawalpindi 's liaqat bagh park 2 .
as her convoy was leaving the park via the rear gate onto murree road , a gunman fired at her .
aides said she was hit in the neck and chest 3 .
an explosion then tore through the crowd , killing at least 16 people 4 .
ms bhutto was taken to rawalpindi general hospital , but was pronounced dead at 1816 local time .

writing in the observer , he also warns 2008 will be labour 's most challenging year since its 1992 election defeat .
the appeal comes after an embattled few months for mr brown and underlines labour nerves about a tory resurgence .
but the olive branch also comes with a warning that mr brown will need a broader appeal if labour is to see off the conservative threat .
mr byers , the mp for north tyneside and a prominent blair supporter , previously called for a high-profile challenger to take on mr brown in the race to succeed tony blair . "
each issue labour has to deal with no longer has to be seen through the blair-brown prism " stephen byers he also indicated he did not expect labour to " slavishly " follow mr brown 's agenda if he became leader .
but he now writes : " tony blair is history .
he is the political past and will not be part of the future of domestic politics in our country .
" 2008 will be a tough year .
with tony blair gone from domestic politics , the task of leading labour to victory falls to gordon brown .
past divisions " it is the responsibility of all of us who want to see a fourth election victory to give him our support . "
according to the observer , the article was written in consultation with blairite former cabinet allies , alan milburn and charles clarke .
mr byers stresses that the former pm - now a middle east peace envoy - expects total support for his successor , noting his publicly stated intention not to be " a back-seat driver " .
" this means that each issue labour has to deal with no longer has to be seen through the blair-brown prism , " he argues .
" such a new freedom places a responsibility on all of us to resist fighting old battles or revisiting past divisions . "
but he also warns the prime minister - who faces his first key electoral test in may 's local elections - that motivating labour 's core vote is not enough .
" we also have to appeal to the promiscuous voter by demonstrating that we can be the party of aspiration and ambition as well as social justice and fairness . "

"
i want 2008 to be the year in which we offer the people of this country the hope of real change , by setting out a clear and inspiring vision of what britain will look like with a conservative government .
so in place of labour 's hopeless mismanagement of the nhs , we will offer the hope of a health service where we get rid of the top-down centralisation and bureaucracy and make sure that taxpayers ' money delivers the high quality service they 've paid for and have a right to expect .
in the year of the 60th anniversary of the nhs , we will be the party standing up for the nhs against yet more onslaughts from the labour bureaucracy machine .
in place of labour 's hopeless acceptance of mediocrity in education , which has seen britain tumble down the world league tables just when we need our children to be doing better than those in other countries , we will offer the hope of a decent education for every child , with immediate action to raise standards and radical reform to end the state monopoly over new school places . "
this will be the year in which we show that there is hope for the future , that there is a clear and credible alternative to this hopeless and incompetent labour government " in place of labour 's hopeless surrender to violence on our streets , with overcrowded prisons and police tied up in red tape , we will offer the hope of civilised communities which are safe for everyone , based on radical police reform and more prison places in prisons which actually reduce re-offending .
in place of labour 's hopeless failure on social breakdown which has left britain with more children growing up in broken homes , higher unemployment and a £ 100 billion a year bill for social failure , we will offer the hope of real change - to strengthen families , reform welfare , and make british poverty history .
on the economy , on the environment , on defence and fighting terrorism , there are tremendous challenges ahead .
in the fight against terrorism , we were reminded last week how hard the road to democracy is .
the death of benazir bhutto must strengthen , not weaken our resolve to defeat the enemies of freedom .
this will be the year in which we show that there is hope for the future , that there is a clear and credible alternative to this hopeless and incompetent labour government .
and let us be clear about the reason why . "
we must show from the very beginning of and throughout this year that we can set the agenda with our new thinking and clear understanding of what people want for themselves and their family " it is not just that we offer the hope of a strong team of competent ministers to replace these weak , exhausted and second-rate labour politicians .
it is not just that we offer the hope of a fresh start on policy after so many years of labour headline-chasing short-term tricks with no real substance behind them .
it is that we offer a clear vision of the britain we want to see , and a clear idea of how we will govern differently .
my vision for britain is clear : to give people more opportunity and power over their lives , to make families stronger and society more responsible , and to make britain safer and greener .
and we will inaugurate a new era in government - government for the post-bureaucratic age , where we devolve power to people and communities because we understand that a government that tries to control everything ends up not being able to run anything i sense that britain feels it 's time for a change .
there probably wo n't be a general election this year but we will behave and work as though there is .
and in doing so prove that you can once again trust a conservative government to take this country forward .
we must show from the very beginning of and throughout this year that we can set the agenda with our new thinking and clear understanding of what people want for themselves and their family . "

i want 2008 to be the year in which we offer the people of this country the hope of real change , by setting out a clear and inspiring vision of what britain will look like with a conservative government .
so in place of labour 's hopeless mismanagement of the nhs , we will offer the hope of a health service where we get rid of the top-down centralisation and bureaucracy and make sure that taxpayers ' money delivers the high quality service they 've paid for and have a right to expect .
in the year of the 60th anniversary of the nhs , we will be the party standing up for the nhs against yet more onslaughts from the labour bureaucracy machine .
in place of labour 's hopeless acceptance of mediocrity in education , which has seen britain tumble down the world league tables just when we need our children to be doing better than those in other countries , we will offer the hope of a decent education for every child , with immediate action to raise standards and radical reform to end the state monopoly over new school places .
this will be the year in which we show that there is hope for the future , that there is a clear and credible alternative to this hopeless and incompetent labour government in place of labour 's hopeless surrender to violence on our streets , with overcrowded prisons and police tied up in red tape , we will offer the hope of civilised communities which are safe for everyone , based on radical police reform and more prison places in prisons which actually reduce re-offending .
in place of labour 's hopeless failure on social breakdown which has left britain with more children growing up in broken homes , higher unemployment and a £ 100 billion a year bill for social failure , we will offer the hope of real change - to strengthen families , reform welfare , and make british poverty history .
on the economy , on the environment , on defence and fighting terrorism , there are tremendous challenges ahead .
in the fight against terrorism , we were reminded last week how hard the road to democracy is .
the death of benazir bhutto must strengthen , not weaken our resolve to defeat the enemies of freedom .

in place of labour 's hopeless acceptance of mediocrity in education , which has seen britain tumble down the world league tables just when we need our children to be doing better than those in other countries , we will offer the hope of a decent education for every child , with immediate action to raise standards and radical reform to end the state monopoly over new school places .
this will be the year in which we show that there is hope for the future , that there is a clear and credible alternative to this hopeless and incompetent labour government in place of labour 's hopeless surrender to violence on our streets , with overcrowded prisons and police tied up in red tape , we will offer the hope of civilised communities which are safe for everyone , based on radical police reform and more prison places in prisons which actually reduce re-offending .
in place of labour 's hopeless failure on social breakdown which has left britain with more children growing up in broken homes , higher unemployment and a £ 100 billion a year bill for social failure , we will offer the hope of real change - to strengthen families , reform welfare , and make british poverty history .
on the economy , on the environment , on defence and fighting terrorism , there are tremendous challenges ahead .
in the fight against terrorism , we were reminded last week how hard the road to democracy is .
the death of benazir bhutto must strengthen , not weaken our resolve to defeat the enemies of freedom .
this will be the year in which we show that there is hope for the future , that there is a clear and credible alternative to this hopeless and incompetent labour government .
and let us be clear about the reason why .
we must show from the very beginning of and throughout this year that we can set the agenda with our new thinking and clear understanding of what people want for themselves and their family it is not just that we offer the hope of a strong team of competent ministers to replace these weak , exhausted and second-rate labour politicians .
it is not just that we offer the hope of a fresh start on policy after so many years of labour headline-chasing short-term tricks with no real substance behind them .
it is that we offer a clear vision of the britain we want to see , and a clear idea of how we will govern differently .
my vision for britain is clear : to give people more opportunity and power over their lives , to make families stronger and society more responsible , and to make britain safer and greener .
and we will inaugurate a new era in government - government for the post-bureaucratic age , where we devolve power to people and communities because we understand that a government that tries to control everything ends up not being able to run anything i sense that britain feels it 's time for a change .
there probably wo n't be a general election this year but we will behave and work as though there is .
and in doing so prove that you can once again trust a conservative government to take this country forward .
we must show from the very beginning of and throughout this year that we can set the agenda with our new thinking and clear understanding of what people want for themselves and their family .
