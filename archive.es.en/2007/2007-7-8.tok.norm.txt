bosnia may have seen the worst war crimes since world war ii during the 1990s , with 8,000 bosnians murdered during the srebrenica massacre alone . but human rights activists , lawyers and the international community began to deal with the war crimes early on .
while the war was still ongoing in 1993 , the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia was established in the hague .

" justice is important for them in order to continue living and being ready for reconciliation , " rehn said . court symbolism experts agree that lasting peace is impossible without uncovering conflicts and violence that took place .

" when the first mass rape trials took place , i went to sarajevo and met representatives of the organization of raped women , " rehn said .
" i asked them naively whether they were n't pleased that the perpetrators got such high penalties .

museum staff use modern technology and enlist the help of schoolchildren in an effort to preserve artifacts from the death camp . during the holocaust more than 1.1 million people died at the auschwitz-birkenau death camp .
one million of them were jews from nazi-occupied europe .
some died from overwork , starvation and disease .
most were murdered in the camp 's notorious gas chambers .
the nazis collected the belongings of their victims .
there are 4,000 suitcases , tens of thousands of shoes , a heap of hair brushes and human hair , which the nazis used to fill mattresses .
all of these items became part of the museum , which was set up by the polish government in 1947 .
auschwitz is located on the outskirts of the polish town of oswiecim - named auschwitz in german .
nine months after invading poland in 1939 , the nazis set up auschwitz for captured members of the polish resistance .
auschwitz was house in a former polish army barracks .
two years later it was expanded at nearby brzezinka or birkenau .
personal artifacts tell story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz survivors return to the site of their imprisonment prisoners left behind not only personal artifacts but also created 2,000 works of art , most of which are in storage because there 's no place to display them in the museum .
the museum draws approximately 1 million visitors yearly .
recently , the museum has focused on telling the stories of individual victims through the objects they owned .
this has made conservation essential .
a team of eight conservation specialists works in the museum 's hi-tech laboratory , which was built three years ago .
" there are well-developed techniques for conserving centuries-old rembrandts of goyas , or egyptian mummies which are thousands of years old , " piotr cywinski , the director of the auschwitz museum , said in an interview with afp .

the laboratory has trained hundreds of local school children to help deal with the massive number of shoes .

the auschwitz site looks much as it does during the war .
birkenau was heavily damaged when the nazis destroyed the gas chambers and crematoria in an effort to cover up their crimes from the advancing soviet army in january 1945 .

personal artifacts tell story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz survivors return to the site of their imprisonment prisoners left behind not only personal artifacts but also created 2,000 works of art , most of which are in storage because there 's no place to display them in the museum .
the museum draws approximately 1 million visitors yearly .
recently , the museum has focused on telling the stories of individual victims through the objects they owned .
this has made conservation essential .
a team of eight conservation specialists works in the museum 's hi-tech laboratory , which was built three years ago .
" there are well-developed techniques for conserving centuries-old rembrandts of goyas , or egyptian mummies which are thousands of years old , " piotr cywinski , the director of the auschwitz museum , said in an interview with afp .
" but not for 60-year-old toothbrushes or suitcases .
new conservation techniques bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in auschwitz " we 're in unchartered territory where we have to develop new techniques , " he said .
" on top of that , the very numbers of items takes us beyond the usual methods of conservation . "
that 's why he 's turned to the help of school children .
the laboratory has trained hundreds of local school children to help deal with the massive number of shoes .
ewelina bisaga , a conservationist who specializes in paper , worked at an enormous white table recently .
she had a special eraser she used to clean a copy of a musical score by norwegian composer edvard grieg .
" these are the scores used by the camp prisoners ' orchestra , " bisaga said .
preserving the site bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum is responsible for conserving the site besides conserving objects , the team is responsible for the upkeep of the auschwitz-birkenau site .
" we have big problems with water leaks , particularly in the buildings constructed by the prisoners at birkenau , " cywinski said .
the auschwitz site looks much as it does during the war .
birkenau was heavily damaged when the nazis destroyed the gas chambers and crematoria in an effort to cover up their crimes from the advancing soviet army in january 1945 .
today , the ruins are open to the elements .
" we have to preserve them in their current state , while also ensuring we do n't change anything , " said laboratory director dorota kuczynska . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts believe the healing wo n't begin until the crimes have been dealt with . germany 's christian schwarz schilling was in good spirits when he handed over his office to his successor , slovak diplomat miroslave lajcak , this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarz-schilling -lrb- right -rrb- with lajcak in sarajevo on monday " i think that this will be a very important time for bosnia and hercegovina and i am confident that -lrb- lajcak -rrb- will be able , together with the bosnian leaders , to take this county forward , " he said . during the 1990s , the people of bosnia hercegovina witnessed the worst war crimes committed since the end of world war ii .
these crimes are far from having been solved . adnan hasanbegovic was a soldier in bosnia during the occupation of sarajevo .
it was the worst time of his life . " on the other hand , it led me to think about peace building , " said hasanbegovic , who now works at the center for non-violent action in sarajevo .
" i started thinking about justice , life and death and the meaning of life - about why there 's so much violence .
it made me become a peace activist after the war . " hasanbegovic said he hopes that his work now plays a role in securing a peaceful and stable future for bosnia and hercegovina . early intervention the chances are that he and his allies will reach their goal are better than in many other conflict regions .
bosnia may have seen the worst war crimes since world war ii during the 1990s , with 8,000 bosnians murdered during the srebrenica massacre alone . but human rights activists , lawyers and the international community began to deal with the war crimes early on .
while the war was still ongoing in 1993 , the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia was established in the hague .
nobody thought about staging trials back then , but the court was meant as a signal that the international community was n't going to tolerate massacres and mass rape .
since then , many cases have been tried before the court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian children play in front of a banner reading " peace , no more wars " in tuzla , bosnia märtha elisabeth rehn , a former un special envoy for bosnia , said that she 's sometimes asked why it 's so important that war criminals such as bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic or bosnian serb army general ratko mladic are brought to the hague .
but when she talks to the women of srebrenica , she realizes how unhappy they are that nobody worries about their suffering . " justice is important for them in order to continue living and being ready for reconciliation , " rehn said . court symbolism experts agree that lasting peace is impossible without uncovering conflicts and violence that took place .
luis moreno-ocamp , the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court , said that the tribunal in the hague is an important instrument - and not just for bosnia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bosnian serb president biljana plavsic was sentenced to 11 years in prison for crimes against humanity " the worst criminals , the dictators are brought to justice there , " he said , adding that this contributes to a lasting peace . while justice is administered , this does n't necessarily mean that justice is served as far as the victims are concerned . " when the first mass rape trials took place , i went to sarajevo and met representatives of the organization of raped women , " rehn said .
" i asked them naively whether they were n't pleased that the perpetrators got such high penalties .
they looked at me as if i 'd come from a different planet and said : ' what are you talking about ?
we 'll suffer for the rest of our lives because of these rapes and they barely got 12 or 20 years . " ' a nightmare for criminals ? most bosnians also continue to avoid the issue .
the dayton agreement ended the fighting 12 years ago , but many people remain traumatized .
the war is n't over for them .
bosnian muslims and croats also consider dayton to be unfair - a peace agreement , but not a just one , they say . the division in two separate republic effectively split the country and politicians are not ready to overcome this and agree on one system .
but there 's another reason for the lack of interest in dealing with the war : karadzic and mladic are still at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic and karadzic remain at large hasanbegovic said he does n't think that tribunals can solve all crimes .
after all , there are thousands that participated , but only a few hundred have been punished so far . " i still believe that the work of the courts is important , because they punish criminals , " he said .
" they make sure that all war criminals can not sleep well any longer .
they can only seek out a hole in the forest to hide , like karadzic and mladic have done . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us white house is a neoclassical mansion .
for 35 years , the leaders of west germany lived in a modest-looking bungalow in bonn .
the building is now being renovated . a far cry from the swanky living spaces normally associated with heads of state , the flat-roofed chancellor 's bungalow was fitted with plastic lamps and sported imitation wood .
the bungalow , located near the rhine river and next to the chancellery , served as the official residence of the german chancellors from 1963 until the government moved to berlin .
empty since 1999 , the historic building will soon open to the public .
a restoration project is underway that will allow the building to host tour groups and special events .
needs some work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bungalow served as kohl 's home for 16 years " it was built extremely well 40 years ago , but in the meantime , the roof is in need of rehabilitation , " said georg adlbert , head of the wüstenrot foundation , which is investing approximately 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- in the renovations .
the renovation is scheduled to finish by late 2008 , adlbert said at a recent press conference to announce the remodel .
west german chancellors ludwig erhard , kurt georg kiesinger , helmut schmidt and helmut kohl all used the building as their bonn home .
chancellor willy brandt used it only for ceremonial events .
preserving history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor 's residence will be opened to the public the renovation will take care to preserve evidence of the stays of its famous residents .

the us white house is a neoclassical mansion .
for 35 years , the leaders of west germany lived in a modest-looking bungalow in bonn .
the building is now being renovated . a far cry from the swanky living spaces normally associated with heads of state , the flat-roofed chancellor 's bungalow was fitted with plastic lamps and sported imitation wood .
the bungalow , located near the rhine river and next to the chancellery , served as the official residence of the german chancellors from 1963 until the government moved to berlin .
empty since 1999 , the historic building will soon open to the public .
a restoration project is underway that will allow the building to host tour groups and special events .
needs some work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bungalow served as kohl 's home for 16 years " it was built extremely well 40 years ago , but in the meantime , the roof is in need of rehabilitation , " said georg adlbert , head of the wüstenrot foundation , which is investing approximately 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- in the renovations .
the renovation is scheduled to finish by late 2008 , adlbert said at a recent press conference to announce the remodel .
west german chancellors ludwig erhard , kurt georg kiesinger , helmut schmidt and helmut kohl all used the building as their bonn home .
chancellor willy brandt used it only for ceremonial events .

museum staff use modern technology and enlist the help of schoolchildren in an effort to preserve artifacts from the death camp . during the holocaust more than 1.1 million people died at the auschwitz-birkenau death camp .
one million of them were jews from nazi-occupied europe .
some died from overwork , starvation and disease .
most were murdered in the camp 's notorious gas chambers .
the nazis collected the belongings of their victims .
there are 4,000 suitcases , tens of thousands of shoes , a heap of hair brushes and human hair , which the nazis used to fill mattresses .
all of these items became part of the museum , which was set up by the polish government in 1947 .
auschwitz is located on the outskirts of the polish town of oswiecim - named auschwitz in german .
nine months after invading poland in 1939 , the nazis set up auschwitz for captured members of the polish resistance .
auschwitz was house in a former polish army barracks .
two years later it was expanded at nearby brzezinka or birkenau .
personal artifacts tell story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz survivors return to the site of their imprisonment prisoners left behind not only personal artifacts but also created 2,000 works of art , most of which are in storage because there 's no place to display them in the museum .
the museum draws approximately 1 million visitors yearly .
recently , the museum has focused on telling the stories of individual victims through the objects they owned .
this has made conservation essential .
a team of eight conservation specialists works in the museum 's hi-tech laboratory , which was built three years ago .
" there are well-developed techniques for conserving centuries-old rembrandts of goyas , or egyptian mummies which are thousands of years old , " piotr cywinski , the director of the auschwitz museum , said in an interview with afp .
" but not for 60-year-old toothbrushes or suitcases .
new conservation techniques bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in auschwitz " we 're in unchartered territory where we have to develop new techniques , " he said .
" on top of that , the very numbers of items takes us beyond the usual methods of conservation . "
that 's why he 's turned to the help of school children .
the laboratory has trained hundreds of local school children to help deal with the massive number of shoes .
ewelina bisaga , a conservationist who specializes in paper , worked at an enormous white table recently .
she had a special eraser she used to clean a copy of a musical score by norwegian composer edvard grieg .
" these are the scores used by the camp prisoners ' orchestra , " bisaga said .
preserving the site bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum is responsible for conserving the site besides conserving objects , the team is responsible for the upkeep of the auschwitz-birkenau site .
" we have big problems with water leaks , particularly in the buildings constructed by the prisoners at birkenau , " cywinski said .
the auschwitz site looks much as it does during the war .
birkenau was heavily damaged when the nazis destroyed the gas chambers and crematoria in an effort to cover up their crimes from the advancing soviet army in january 1945 .
today , the ruins are open to the elements .
" we have to preserve them in their current state , while also ensuring we do n't change anything , " said laboratory director dorota kuczynska . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts believe the healing wo n't begin until the crimes have been dealt with . germany 's christian schwarz schilling was in good spirits when he handed over his office to his successor , slovak diplomat miroslave lajcak , this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarz-schilling -lrb- right -rrb- with lajcak in sarajevo on monday " i think that this will be a very important time for bosnia and hercegovina and i am confident that -lrb- lajcak -rrb- will be able , together with the bosnian leaders , to take this county forward , " he said . during the 1990s , the people of bosnia hercegovina witnessed the worst war crimes committed since the end of world war ii .
these crimes are far from having been solved . adnan hasanbegovic was a soldier in bosnia during the occupation of sarajevo .
it was the worst time of his life . " on the other hand , it led me to think about peace building , " said hasanbegovic , who now works at the center for non-violent action in sarajevo .
" i started thinking about justice , life and death and the meaning of life - about why there 's so much violence .
it made me become a peace activist after the war . " hasanbegovic said he hopes that his work now plays a role in securing a peaceful and stable future for bosnia and hercegovina . early intervention the chances are that he and his allies will reach their goal are better than in many other conflict regions .
bosnia may have seen the worst war crimes since world war ii during the 1990s , with 8,000 bosnians murdered during the srebrenica massacre alone . but human rights activists , lawyers and the international community began to deal with the war crimes early on .
while the war was still ongoing in 1993 , the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia was established in the hague .
nobody thought about staging trials back then , but the court was meant as a signal that the international community was n't going to tolerate massacres and mass rape .
since then , many cases have been tried before the court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian children play in front of a banner reading " peace , no more wars " in tuzla , bosnia märtha elisabeth rehn , a former un special envoy for bosnia , said that she 's sometimes asked why it 's so important that war criminals such as bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic or bosnian serb army general ratko mladic are brought to the hague .
but when she talks to the women of srebrenica , she realizes how unhappy they are that nobody worries about their suffering . " justice is important for them in order to continue living and being ready for reconciliation , " rehn said . court symbolism experts agree that lasting peace is impossible without uncovering conflicts and violence that took place .
luis moreno-ocamp , the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court , said that the tribunal in the hague is an important instrument - and not just for bosnia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bosnian serb president biljana plavsic was sentenced to 11 years in prison for crimes against humanity " the worst criminals , the dictators are brought to justice there , " he said , adding that this contributes to a lasting peace . while justice is administered , this does n't necessarily mean that justice is served as far as the victims are concerned . " when the first mass rape trials took place , i went to sarajevo and met representatives of the organization of raped women , " rehn said .
" i asked them naively whether they were n't pleased that the perpetrators got such high penalties .
they looked at me as if i 'd come from a different planet and said : ' what are you talking about ?
we 'll suffer for the rest of our lives because of these rapes and they barely got 12 or 20 years . " ' a nightmare for criminals ? most bosnians also continue to avoid the issue .
the dayton agreement ended the fighting 12 years ago , but many people remain traumatized .
the war is n't over for them .
bosnian muslims and croats also consider dayton to be unfair - a peace agreement , but not a just one , they say . the division in two separate republic effectively split the country and politicians are not ready to overcome this and agree on one system .
but there 's another reason for the lack of interest in dealing with the war : karadzic and mladic are still at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic and karadzic remain at large hasanbegovic said he does n't think that tribunals can solve all crimes .
after all , there are thousands that participated , but only a few hundred have been punished so far . " i still believe that the work of the courts is important , because they punish criminals , " he said .
" they make sure that all war criminals can not sleep well any longer .
they can only seek out a hole in the forest to hide , like karadzic and mladic have done . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

museum staff use modern technology and enlist the help of schoolchildren in an effort to preserve artifacts from the death camp . during the holocaust more than 1.1 million people died at the auschwitz-birkenau death camp .
one million of them were jews from nazi-occupied europe .
some died from overwork , starvation and disease .
most were murdered in the camp 's notorious gas chambers .
the nazis collected the belongings of their victims .
there are 4,000 suitcases , tens of thousands of shoes , a heap of hair brushes and human hair , which the nazis used to fill mattresses .
all of these items became part of the museum , which was set up by the polish government in 1947 .
auschwitz is located on the outskirts of the polish town of oswiecim - named auschwitz in german .
nine months after invading poland in 1939 , the nazis set up auschwitz for captured members of the polish resistance .
auschwitz was house in a former polish army barracks .

new conservation techniques bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in auschwitz " we 're in unchartered territory where we have to develop new techniques , " he said .
" on top of that , the very numbers of items takes us beyond the usual methods of conservation . "
that 's why he 's turned to the help of school children .
the laboratory has trained hundreds of local school children to help deal with the massive number of shoes .
ewelina bisaga , a conservationist who specializes in paper , worked at an enormous white table recently .
she had a special eraser she used to clean a copy of a musical score by norwegian composer edvard grieg .
" these are the scores used by the camp prisoners ' orchestra , " bisaga said .
preserving the site bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum is responsible for conserving the site besides conserving objects , the team is responsible for the upkeep of the auschwitz-birkenau site .
" we have big problems with water leaks , particularly in the buildings constructed by the prisoners at birkenau , " cywinski said .
the auschwitz site looks much as it does during the war .
birkenau was heavily damaged when the nazis destroyed the gas chambers and crematoria in an effort to cover up their crimes from the advancing soviet army in january 1945 .
today , the ruins are open to the elements .
" we have to preserve them in their current state , while also ensuring we do n't change anything , " said laboratory director dorota kuczynska . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

museum staff use modern technology and enlist the help of schoolchildren in an effort to preserve artifacts from the death camp . during the holocaust more than 1.1 million people died at the auschwitz-birkenau death camp .
one million of them were jews from nazi-occupied europe .
some died from overwork , starvation and disease .
most were murdered in the camp 's notorious gas chambers .
the nazis collected the belongings of their victims .
there are 4,000 suitcases , tens of thousands of shoes , a heap of hair brushes and human hair , which the nazis used to fill mattresses .
all of these items became part of the museum , which was set up by the polish government in 1947 .
auschwitz is located on the outskirts of the polish town of oswiecim - named auschwitz in german .
nine months after invading poland in 1939 , the nazis set up auschwitz for captured members of the polish resistance .
auschwitz was house in a former polish army barracks .
two years later it was expanded at nearby brzezinka or birkenau .
personal artifacts tell story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz survivors return to the site of their imprisonment prisoners left behind not only personal artifacts but also created 2,000 works of art , most of which are in storage because there 's no place to display them in the museum .
the museum draws approximately 1 million visitors yearly .
recently , the museum has focused on telling the stories of individual victims through the objects they owned .
this has made conservation essential .
a team of eight conservation specialists works in the museum 's hi-tech laboratory , which was built three years ago .
" there are well-developed techniques for conserving centuries-old rembrandts of goyas , or egyptian mummies which are thousands of years old , " piotr cywinski , the director of the auschwitz museum , said in an interview with afp .
" but not for 60-year-old toothbrushes or suitcases .
new conservation techniques bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in auschwitz " we 're in unchartered territory where we have to develop new techniques , " he said .

museum staff use modern technology and enlist the help of schoolchildren in an effort to preserve artifacts from the death camp . during the holocaust more than 1.1 million people died at the auschwitz-birkenau death camp .
one million of them were jews from nazi-occupied europe .
some died from overwork , starvation and disease .
most were murdered in the camp 's notorious gas chambers .
the nazis collected the belongings of their victims .
there are 4,000 suitcases , tens of thousands of shoes , a heap of hair brushes and human hair , which the nazis used to fill mattresses .
all of these items became part of the museum , which was set up by the polish government in 1947 .
auschwitz is located on the outskirts of the polish town of oswiecim - named auschwitz in german .
nine months after invading poland in 1939 , the nazis set up auschwitz for captured members of the polish resistance .
auschwitz was house in a former polish army barracks .
two years later it was expanded at nearby brzezinka or birkenau .
personal artifacts tell story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz survivors return to the site of their imprisonment prisoners left behind not only personal artifacts but also created 2,000 works of art , most of which are in storage because there 's no place to display them in the museum .
the museum draws approximately 1 million visitors yearly .
recently , the museum has focused on telling the stories of individual victims through the objects they owned .
this has made conservation essential .
a team of eight conservation specialists works in the museum 's hi-tech laboratory , which was built three years ago .
" there are well-developed techniques for conserving centuries-old rembrandts of goyas , or egyptian mummies which are thousands of years old , " piotr cywinski , the director of the auschwitz museum , said in an interview with afp .
" but not for 60-year-old toothbrushes or suitcases .

experts believe the healing wo n't begin until the crimes have been dealt with . germany 's christian schwarz schilling was in good spirits when he handed over his office to his successor , slovak diplomat miroslave lajcak , this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarz-schilling -lrb- right -rrb- with lajcak in sarajevo on monday " i think that this will be a very important time for bosnia and hercegovina and i am confident that -lrb- lajcak -rrb- will be able , together with the bosnian leaders , to take this county forward , " he said . during the 1990s , the people of bosnia hercegovina witnessed the worst war crimes committed since the end of world war ii .
these crimes are far from having been solved . adnan hasanbegovic was a soldier in bosnia during the occupation of sarajevo .
it was the worst time of his life . " on the other hand , it led me to think about peace building , " said hasanbegovic , who now works at the center for non-violent action in sarajevo .
" i started thinking about justice , life and death and the meaning of life - about why there 's so much violence .
it made me become a peace activist after the war . " hasanbegovic said he hopes that his work now plays a role in securing a peaceful and stable future for bosnia and hercegovina . early intervention the chances are that he and his allies will reach their goal are better than in many other conflict regions .
bosnia may have seen the worst war crimes since world war ii during the 1990s , with 8,000 bosnians murdered during the srebrenica massacre alone . but human rights activists , lawyers and the international community began to deal with the war crimes early on .
while the war was still ongoing in 1993 , the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia was established in the hague .
nobody thought about staging trials back then , but the court was meant as a signal that the international community was n't going to tolerate massacres and mass rape .
since then , many cases have been tried before the court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian children play in front of a banner reading " peace , no more wars " in tuzla , bosnia märtha elisabeth rehn , a former un special envoy for bosnia , said that she 's sometimes asked why it 's so important that war criminals such as bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic or bosnian serb army general ratko mladic are brought to the hague .
but when she talks to the women of srebrenica , she realizes how unhappy they are that nobody worries about their suffering . " justice is important for them in order to continue living and being ready for reconciliation , " rehn said . court symbolism experts agree that lasting peace is impossible without uncovering conflicts and violence that took place .
luis moreno-ocamp , the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court , said that the tribunal in the hague is an important instrument - and not just for bosnia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bosnian serb president biljana plavsic was sentenced to 11 years in prison for crimes against humanity " the worst criminals , the dictators are brought to justice there , " he said , adding that this contributes to a lasting peace . while justice is administered , this does n't necessarily mean that justice is served as far as the victims are concerned . " when the first mass rape trials took place , i went to sarajevo and met representatives of the organization of raped women , " rehn said .
" i asked them naively whether they were n't pleased that the perpetrators got such high penalties .
they looked at me as if i 'd come from a different planet and said : ' what are you talking about ?
we 'll suffer for the rest of our lives because of these rapes and they barely got 12 or 20 years . " ' a nightmare for criminals ? most bosnians also continue to avoid the issue .
the dayton agreement ended the fighting 12 years ago , but many people remain traumatized .
the war is n't over for them .
bosnian muslims and croats also consider dayton to be unfair - a peace agreement , but not a just one , they say . the division in two separate republic effectively split the country and politicians are not ready to overcome this and agree on one system .
but there 's another reason for the lack of interest in dealing with the war : karadzic and mladic are still at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic and karadzic remain at large hasanbegovic said he does n't think that tribunals can solve all crimes .
after all , there are thousands that participated , but only a few hundred have been punished so far . " i still believe that the work of the courts is important , because they punish criminals , " he said .
" they make sure that all war criminals can not sleep well any longer .
they can only seek out a hole in the forest to hide , like karadzic and mladic have done . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" hasanbegovic said he hopes that his work now plays a role in securing a peaceful and stable future for bosnia and hercegovina . early intervention the chances are that he and his allies will reach their goal are better than in many other conflict regions .
bosnia may have seen the worst war crimes since world war ii during the 1990s , with 8,000 bosnians murdered during the srebrenica massacre alone . but human rights activists , lawyers and the international community began to deal with the war crimes early on .
while the war was still ongoing in 1993 , the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia was established in the hague .
nobody thought about staging trials back then , but the court was meant as a signal that the international community was n't going to tolerate massacres and mass rape .
since then , many cases have been tried before the court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian children play in front of a banner reading " peace , no more wars " in tuzla , bosnia märtha elisabeth rehn , a former un special envoy for bosnia , said that she 's sometimes asked why it 's so important that war criminals such as bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic or bosnian serb army general ratko mladic are brought to the hague .
but when she talks to the women of srebrenica , she realizes how unhappy they are that nobody worries about their suffering . " justice is important for them in order to continue living and being ready for reconciliation , " rehn said . court symbolism experts agree that lasting peace is impossible without uncovering conflicts and violence that took place .
luis moreno-ocamp , the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court , said that the tribunal in the hague is an important instrument - and not just for bosnia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bosnian serb president biljana plavsic was sentenced to 11 years in prison for crimes against humanity " the worst criminals , the dictators are brought to justice there , " he said , adding that this contributes to a lasting peace . while justice is administered , this does n't necessarily mean that justice is served as far as the victims are concerned . " when the first mass rape trials took place , i went to sarajevo and met representatives of the organization of raped women , " rehn said .
" i asked them naively whether they were n't pleased that the perpetrators got such high penalties .
they looked at me as if i 'd come from a different planet and said : ' what are you talking about ?
we 'll suffer for the rest of our lives because of these rapes and they barely got 12 or 20 years . " ' a nightmare for criminals ? most bosnians also continue to avoid the issue .
the dayton agreement ended the fighting 12 years ago , but many people remain traumatized .
the war is n't over for them .
bosnian muslims and croats also consider dayton to be unfair - a peace agreement , but not a just one , they say . the division in two separate republic effectively split the country and politicians are not ready to overcome this and agree on one system .
but there 's another reason for the lack of interest in dealing with the war : karadzic and mladic are still at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic and karadzic remain at large hasanbegovic said he does n't think that tribunals can solve all crimes .
after all , there are thousands that participated , but only a few hundred have been punished so far . " i still believe that the work of the courts is important , because they punish criminals , " he said .
" they make sure that all war criminals can not sleep well any longer .
they can only seek out a hole in the forest to hide , like karadzic and mladic have done . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sarkozy asked in an interview with french newspaper le journal du dimanche , adding that strauss-kahn is " the most able candidate for the post " and shares his " vision of the imf 's operating . "
sarkozy said that he had already proposed strauss-kahn 's candidacy to us president george w. bush , british prime minister gordon brown and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero .

the ministry spokesman also said that germany 's aim was to find a strong , suitable european candidate for the job , adding that chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet would make the final decision about the german top choice .
strauss-kahn is one of the socialist heavy-weights and has so far canvassed in vain for a social democratic relaunch of his party .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy " could i deprive france of his candidacy just because he 's a socialist ? "
sarkozy asked in an interview with french newspaper le journal du dimanche , adding that strauss-kahn is " the most able candidate for the post " and shares his " vision of the imf 's operating . "
sarkozy said that he had already proposed strauss-kahn 's candidacy to us president george w. bush , british prime minister gordon brown and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero .

a german finance ministry spokesman meanwhile told reporters that germany considered strauss-kahn to be a very good , strong , european candidate , adding that ministry officials had been in close contact with the french counterparts about finding a new imf head .
the ministry spokesman also said that germany 's aim was to find a strong , suitable european candidate for the job , adding that chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet would make the final decision about the german top choice .
strauss-kahn is one of the socialist heavy-weights and has so far canvassed in vain for a social democratic relaunch of his party .
he has not said whether he would be willing to take on the imf job .

museum staff use modern technology and enlist the help of schoolchildren in an effort to preserve artifacts from the death camp . during the holocaust more than 1.1 million people died at the auschwitz-birkenau death camp .
one million of them were jews from nazi-occupied europe .
some died from overwork , starvation and disease .
most were murdered in the camp 's notorious gas chambers .
the nazis collected the belongings of their victims .
there are 4,000 suitcases , tens of thousands of shoes , a heap of hair brushes and human hair , which the nazis used to fill mattresses .
all of these items became part of the museum , which was set up by the polish government in 1947 .
auschwitz is located on the outskirts of the polish town of oswiecim - named auschwitz in german .
nine months after invading poland in 1939 , the nazis set up auschwitz for captured members of the polish resistance .
auschwitz was house in a former polish army barracks .
two years later it was expanded at nearby brzezinka or birkenau .
personal artifacts tell story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz survivors return to the site of their imprisonment prisoners left behind not only personal artifacts but also created 2,000 works of art , most of which are in storage because there 's no place to display them in the museum .
the museum draws approximately 1 million visitors yearly .
recently , the museum has focused on telling the stories of individual victims through the objects they owned .
this has made conservation essential .
a team of eight conservation specialists works in the museum 's hi-tech laboratory , which was built three years ago .
" there are well-developed techniques for conserving centuries-old rembrandts of goyas , or egyptian mummies which are thousands of years old , " piotr cywinski , the director of the auschwitz museum , said in an interview with afp .
" but not for 60-year-old toothbrushes or suitcases .
new conservation techniques bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in auschwitz " we 're in unchartered territory where we have to develop new techniques , " he said .
" on top of that , the very numbers of items takes us beyond the usual methods of conservation . "
that 's why he 's turned to the help of school children .
the laboratory has trained hundreds of local school children to help deal with the massive number of shoes .
ewelina bisaga , a conservationist who specializes in paper , worked at an enormous white table recently .
she had a special eraser she used to clean a copy of a musical score by norwegian composer edvard grieg .
" these are the scores used by the camp prisoners ' orchestra , " bisaga said .
preserving the site bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum is responsible for conserving the site besides conserving objects , the team is responsible for the upkeep of the auschwitz-birkenau site .
" we have big problems with water leaks , particularly in the buildings constructed by the prisoners at birkenau , " cywinski said .
the auschwitz site looks much as it does during the war .
birkenau was heavily damaged when the nazis destroyed the gas chambers and crematoria in an effort to cover up their crimes from the advancing soviet army in january 1945 .
today , the ruins are open to the elements .
" we have to preserve them in their current state , while also ensuring we do n't change anything , " said laboratory director dorota kuczynska . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

personal artifacts tell story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz survivors return to the site of their imprisonment prisoners left behind not only personal artifacts but also created 2,000 works of art , most of which are in storage because there 's no place to display them in the museum .
the museum draws approximately 1 million visitors yearly .
recently , the museum has focused on telling the stories of individual victims through the objects they owned .
this has made conservation essential .
a team of eight conservation specialists works in the museum 's hi-tech laboratory , which was built three years ago .
" there are well-developed techniques for conserving centuries-old rembrandts of goyas , or egyptian mummies which are thousands of years old , " piotr cywinski , the director of the auschwitz museum , said in an interview with afp .
" but not for 60-year-old toothbrushes or suitcases .
new conservation techniques bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in auschwitz " we 're in unchartered territory where we have to develop new techniques , " he said .
" on top of that , the very numbers of items takes us beyond the usual methods of conservation . "
that 's why he 's turned to the help of school children .
the laboratory has trained hundreds of local school children to help deal with the massive number of shoes .
ewelina bisaga , a conservationist who specializes in paper , worked at an enormous white table recently .
she had a special eraser she used to clean a copy of a musical score by norwegian composer edvard grieg .
" these are the scores used by the camp prisoners ' orchestra , " bisaga said .
preserving the site bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum is responsible for conserving the site besides conserving objects , the team is responsible for the upkeep of the auschwitz-birkenau site .
" we have big problems with water leaks , particularly in the buildings constructed by the prisoners at birkenau , " cywinski said .
the auschwitz site looks much as it does during the war .
birkenau was heavily damaged when the nazis destroyed the gas chambers and crematoria in an effort to cover up their crimes from the advancing soviet army in january 1945 .
today , the ruins are open to the elements .
" we have to preserve them in their current state , while also ensuring we do n't change anything , " said laboratory director dorota kuczynska . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" justice is important for them in order to continue living and being ready for reconciliation , " rehn said . court symbolism experts agree that lasting peace is impossible without uncovering conflicts and violence that took place .
luis moreno-ocamp , the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court , said that the tribunal in the hague is an important instrument - and not just for bosnia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bosnian serb president biljana plavsic was sentenced to 11 years in prison for crimes against humanity " the worst criminals , the dictators are brought to justice there , " he said , adding that this contributes to a lasting peace . while justice is administered , this does n't necessarily mean that justice is served as far as the victims are concerned . " when the first mass rape trials took place , i went to sarajevo and met representatives of the organization of raped women , " rehn said .
" i asked them naively whether they were n't pleased that the perpetrators got such high penalties .

nobody thought about staging trials back then , but the court was meant as a signal that the international community was n't going to tolerate massacres and mass rape .
since then , many cases have been tried before the court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian children play in front of a banner reading " peace , no more wars " in tuzla , bosnia märtha elisabeth rehn , a former un special envoy for bosnia , said that she 's sometimes asked why it 's so important that war criminals such as bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic or bosnian serb army general ratko mladic are brought to the hague .
but when she talks to the women of srebrenica , she realizes how unhappy they are that nobody worries about their suffering . " justice is important for them in order to continue living and being ready for reconciliation , " rehn said . court symbolism experts agree that lasting peace is impossible without uncovering conflicts and violence that took place .
luis moreno-ocamp , the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court , said that the tribunal in the hague is an important instrument - and not just for bosnia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bosnian serb president biljana plavsic was sentenced to 11 years in prison for crimes against humanity " the worst criminals , the dictators are brought to justice there , " he said , adding that this contributes to a lasting peace . while justice is administered , this does n't necessarily mean that justice is served as far as the victims are concerned . " when the first mass rape trials took place , i went to sarajevo and met representatives of the organization of raped women , " rehn said .
" i asked them naively whether they were n't pleased that the perpetrators got such high penalties .
they looked at me as if i 'd come from a different planet and said : ' what are you talking about ?
we 'll suffer for the rest of our lives because of these rapes and they barely got 12 or 20 years . " ' a nightmare for criminals ? most bosnians also continue to avoid the issue .
the dayton agreement ended the fighting 12 years ago , but many people remain traumatized .
the war is n't over for them .
bosnian muslims and croats also consider dayton to be unfair - a peace agreement , but not a just one , they say . the division in two separate republic effectively split the country and politicians are not ready to overcome this and agree on one system .

museum staff use modern technology and enlist the help of schoolchildren in an effort to preserve artifacts from the death camp . during the holocaust more than 1.1 million people died at the auschwitz-birkenau death camp .
one million of them were jews from nazi-occupied europe .
some died from overwork , starvation and disease .
most were murdered in the camp 's notorious gas chambers .
the nazis collected the belongings of their victims .
there are 4,000 suitcases , tens of thousands of shoes , a heap of hair brushes and human hair , which the nazis used to fill mattresses .
all of these items became part of the museum , which was set up by the polish government in 1947 .
auschwitz is located on the outskirts of the polish town of oswiecim - named auschwitz in german .

experts believe the healing wo n't begin until the crimes have been dealt with . germany 's christian schwarz schilling was in good spirits when he handed over his office to his successor , slovak diplomat miroslave lajcak , this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarz-schilling -lrb- right -rrb- with lajcak in sarajevo on monday " i think that this will be a very important time for bosnia and hercegovina and i am confident that -lrb- lajcak -rrb- will be able , together with the bosnian leaders , to take this county forward , " he said . during the 1990s , the people of bosnia hercegovina witnessed the worst war crimes committed since the end of world war ii .
these crimes are far from having been solved . adnan hasanbegovic was a soldier in bosnia during the occupation of sarajevo .
it was the worst time of his life . " on the other hand , it led me to think about peace building , " said hasanbegovic , who now works at the center for non-violent action in sarajevo .
" i started thinking about justice , life and death and the meaning of life - about why there 's so much violence .
it made me become a peace activist after the war . " hasanbegovic said he hopes that his work now plays a role in securing a peaceful and stable future for bosnia and hercegovina . early intervention the chances are that he and his allies will reach their goal are better than in many other conflict regions .
bosnia may have seen the worst war crimes since world war ii during the 1990s , with 8,000 bosnians murdered during the srebrenica massacre alone . but human rights activists , lawyers and the international community began to deal with the war crimes early on .
while the war was still ongoing in 1993 , the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia was established in the hague .
nobody thought about staging trials back then , but the court was meant as a signal that the international community was n't going to tolerate massacres and mass rape .
since then , many cases have been tried before the court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian children play in front of a banner reading " peace , no more wars " in tuzla , bosnia märtha elisabeth rehn , a former un special envoy for bosnia , said that she 's sometimes asked why it 's so important that war criminals such as bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic or bosnian serb army general ratko mladic are brought to the hague .
but when she talks to the women of srebrenica , she realizes how unhappy they are that nobody worries about their suffering . " justice is important for them in order to continue living and being ready for reconciliation , " rehn said . court symbolism experts agree that lasting peace is impossible without uncovering conflicts and violence that took place .
luis moreno-ocamp , the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court , said that the tribunal in the hague is an important instrument - and not just for bosnia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bosnian serb president biljana plavsic was sentenced to 11 years in prison for crimes against humanity " the worst criminals , the dictators are brought to justice there , " he said , adding that this contributes to a lasting peace . while justice is administered , this does n't necessarily mean that justice is served as far as the victims are concerned . " when the first mass rape trials took place , i went to sarajevo and met representatives of the organization of raped women , " rehn said .
" i asked them naively whether they were n't pleased that the perpetrators got such high penalties .
they looked at me as if i 'd come from a different planet and said : ' what are you talking about ?
we 'll suffer for the rest of our lives because of these rapes and they barely got 12 or 20 years . " ' a nightmare for criminals ? most bosnians also continue to avoid the issue .
the dayton agreement ended the fighting 12 years ago , but many people remain traumatized .
the war is n't over for them .
bosnian muslims and croats also consider dayton to be unfair - a peace agreement , but not a just one , they say . the division in two separate republic effectively split the country and politicians are not ready to overcome this and agree on one system .
but there 's another reason for the lack of interest in dealing with the war : karadzic and mladic are still at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic and karadzic remain at large hasanbegovic said he does n't think that tribunals can solve all crimes .
after all , there are thousands that participated , but only a few hundred have been punished so far . " i still believe that the work of the courts is important , because they punish criminals , " he said .
" they make sure that all war criminals can not sleep well any longer .
they can only seek out a hole in the forest to hide , like karadzic and mladic have done . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

museum staff use modern technology and enlist the help of schoolchildren in an effort to preserve artifacts from the death camp . during the holocaust more than 1.1 million people died at the auschwitz-birkenau death camp .
one million of them were jews from nazi-occupied europe .
some died from overwork , starvation and disease .
most were murdered in the camp 's notorious gas chambers .
the nazis collected the belongings of their victims .
there are 4,000 suitcases , tens of thousands of shoes , a heap of hair brushes and human hair , which the nazis used to fill mattresses .
all of these items became part of the museum , which was set up by the polish government in 1947 .
auschwitz is located on the outskirts of the polish town of oswiecim - named auschwitz in german .
nine months after invading poland in 1939 , the nazis set up auschwitz for captured members of the polish resistance .
auschwitz was house in a former polish army barracks .
two years later it was expanded at nearby brzezinka or birkenau .
personal artifacts tell story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz survivors return to the site of their imprisonment prisoners left behind not only personal artifacts but also created 2,000 works of art , most of which are in storage because there 's no place to display them in the museum .
the museum draws approximately 1 million visitors yearly .
recently , the museum has focused on telling the stories of individual victims through the objects they owned .
this has made conservation essential .
a team of eight conservation specialists works in the museum 's hi-tech laboratory , which was built three years ago .
" there are well-developed techniques for conserving centuries-old rembrandts of goyas , or egyptian mummies which are thousands of years old , " piotr cywinski , the director of the auschwitz museum , said in an interview with afp .
" but not for 60-year-old toothbrushes or suitcases .
new conservation techniques bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in auschwitz " we 're in unchartered territory where we have to develop new techniques , " he said .
" on top of that , the very numbers of items takes us beyond the usual methods of conservation . "
that 's why he 's turned to the help of school children .
the laboratory has trained hundreds of local school children to help deal with the massive number of shoes .
ewelina bisaga , a conservationist who specializes in paper , worked at an enormous white table recently .
she had a special eraser she used to clean a copy of a musical score by norwegian composer edvard grieg .
" these are the scores used by the camp prisoners ' orchestra , " bisaga said .
preserving the site bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum is responsible for conserving the site besides conserving objects , the team is responsible for the upkeep of the auschwitz-birkenau site .
" we have big problems with water leaks , particularly in the buildings constructed by the prisoners at birkenau , " cywinski said .
the auschwitz site looks much as it does during the war .
birkenau was heavily damaged when the nazis destroyed the gas chambers and crematoria in an effort to cover up their crimes from the advancing soviet army in january 1945 .
today , the ruins are open to the elements .
" we have to preserve them in their current state , while also ensuring we do n't change anything , " said laboratory director dorota kuczynska . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these crimes are far from having been solved . adnan hasanbegovic was a soldier in bosnia during the occupation of sarajevo .
it was the worst time of his life . " on the other hand , it led me to think about peace building , " said hasanbegovic , who now works at the center for non-violent action in sarajevo .
" i started thinking about justice , life and death and the meaning of life - about why there 's so much violence .
it made me become a peace activist after the war . " hasanbegovic said he hopes that his work now plays a role in securing a peaceful and stable future for bosnia and hercegovina . early intervention the chances are that he and his allies will reach their goal are better than in many other conflict regions .
bosnia may have seen the worst war crimes since world war ii during the 1990s , with 8,000 bosnians murdered during the srebrenica massacre alone . but human rights activists , lawyers and the international community began to deal with the war crimes early on .
while the war was still ongoing in 1993 , the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia was established in the hague .
nobody thought about staging trials back then , but the court was meant as a signal that the international community was n't going to tolerate massacres and mass rape .
since then , many cases have been tried before the court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian children play in front of a banner reading " peace , no more wars " in tuzla , bosnia märtha elisabeth rehn , a former un special envoy for bosnia , said that she 's sometimes asked why it 's so important that war criminals such as bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic or bosnian serb army general ratko mladic are brought to the hague .
but when she talks to the women of srebrenica , she realizes how unhappy they are that nobody worries about their suffering . " justice is important for them in order to continue living and being ready for reconciliation , " rehn said . court symbolism experts agree that lasting peace is impossible without uncovering conflicts and violence that took place .
luis moreno-ocamp , the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court , said that the tribunal in the hague is an important instrument - and not just for bosnia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bosnian serb president biljana plavsic was sentenced to 11 years in prison for crimes against humanity " the worst criminals , the dictators are brought to justice there , " he said , adding that this contributes to a lasting peace . while justice is administered , this does n't necessarily mean that justice is served as far as the victims are concerned . " when the first mass rape trials took place , i went to sarajevo and met representatives of the organization of raped women , " rehn said .
" i asked them naively whether they were n't pleased that the perpetrators got such high penalties .
they looked at me as if i 'd come from a different planet and said : ' what are you talking about ?

a german finance ministry spokesman meanwhile told reporters that germany considered strauss-kahn to be a very good , strong , european candidate , adding that ministry officials had been in close contact with the french counterparts about finding a new imf head .
the ministry spokesman also said that germany 's aim was to find a strong , suitable european candidate for the job , adding that chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet would make the final decision about the german top choice .

he has not said whether he would be willing to take on the imf job .
european union finance ministers early next week are due to discuss a european candidate for the imf vacancy .

museum staff use modern technology and enlist the help of schoolchildren in an effort to preserve artifacts from the death camp . during the holocaust more than 1.1 million people died at the auschwitz-birkenau death camp .
one million of them were jews from nazi-occupied europe .
some died from overwork , starvation and disease .
most were murdered in the camp 's notorious gas chambers .
the nazis collected the belongings of their victims .
there are 4,000 suitcases , tens of thousands of shoes , a heap of hair brushes and human hair , which the nazis used to fill mattresses .
all of these items became part of the museum , which was set up by the polish government in 1947 .
auschwitz is located on the outskirts of the polish town of oswiecim - named auschwitz in german .
nine months after invading poland in 1939 , the nazis set up auschwitz for captured members of the polish resistance .
auschwitz was house in a former polish army barracks .
two years later it was expanded at nearby brzezinka or birkenau .

the museum draws approximately 1 million visitors yearly .
recently , the museum has focused on telling the stories of individual victims through the objects they owned .
this has made conservation essential .
a team of eight conservation specialists works in the museum 's hi-tech laboratory , which was built three years ago .

experts believe the healing wo n't begin until the crimes have been dealt with . germany 's christian schwarz schilling was in good spirits when he handed over his office to his successor , slovak diplomat miroslave lajcak , this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarz-schilling -lrb- right -rrb- with lajcak in sarajevo on monday " i think that this will be a very important time for bosnia and hercegovina and i am confident that -lrb- lajcak -rrb- will be able , together with the bosnian leaders , to take this county forward , " he said . during the 1990s , the people of bosnia hercegovina witnessed the worst war crimes committed since the end of world war ii .
these crimes are far from having been solved . adnan hasanbegovic was a soldier in bosnia during the occupation of sarajevo .
it was the worst time of his life . " on the other hand , it led me to think about peace building , " said hasanbegovic , who now works at the center for non-violent action in sarajevo .
" i started thinking about justice , life and death and the meaning of life - about why there 's so much violence .
it made me become a peace activist after the war . " hasanbegovic said he hopes that his work now plays a role in securing a peaceful and stable future for bosnia and hercegovina . early intervention the chances are that he and his allies will reach their goal are better than in many other conflict regions .
bosnia may have seen the worst war crimes since world war ii during the 1990s , with 8,000 bosnians murdered during the srebrenica massacre alone . but human rights activists , lawyers and the international community began to deal with the war crimes early on .
while the war was still ongoing in 1993 , the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia was established in the hague .
nobody thought about staging trials back then , but the court was meant as a signal that the international community was n't going to tolerate massacres and mass rape .
since then , many cases have been tried before the court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian children play in front of a banner reading " peace , no more wars " in tuzla , bosnia märtha elisabeth rehn , a former un special envoy for bosnia , said that she 's sometimes asked why it 's so important that war criminals such as bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic or bosnian serb army general ratko mladic are brought to the hague .
but when she talks to the women of srebrenica , she realizes how unhappy they are that nobody worries about their suffering . " justice is important for them in order to continue living and being ready for reconciliation , " rehn said . court symbolism experts agree that lasting peace is impossible without uncovering conflicts and violence that took place .
luis moreno-ocamp , the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court , said that the tribunal in the hague is an important instrument - and not just for bosnia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bosnian serb president biljana plavsic was sentenced to 11 years in prison for crimes against humanity " the worst criminals , the dictators are brought to justice there , " he said , adding that this contributes to a lasting peace . while justice is administered , this does n't necessarily mean that justice is served as far as the victims are concerned . " when the first mass rape trials took place , i went to sarajevo and met representatives of the organization of raped women , " rehn said .
" i asked them naively whether they were n't pleased that the perpetrators got such high penalties .
they looked at me as if i 'd come from a different planet and said : ' what are you talking about ?
we 'll suffer for the rest of our lives because of these rapes and they barely got 12 or 20 years . " ' a nightmare for criminals ? most bosnians also continue to avoid the issue .
the dayton agreement ended the fighting 12 years ago , but many people remain traumatized .
the war is n't over for them .
bosnian muslims and croats also consider dayton to be unfair - a peace agreement , but not a just one , they say . the division in two separate republic effectively split the country and politicians are not ready to overcome this and agree on one system .
but there 's another reason for the lack of interest in dealing with the war : karadzic and mladic are still at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic and karadzic remain at large hasanbegovic said he does n't think that tribunals can solve all crimes .
after all , there are thousands that participated , but only a few hundred have been punished so far . " i still believe that the work of the courts is important , because they punish criminals , " he said .
" they make sure that all war criminals can not sleep well any longer .
they can only seek out a hole in the forest to hide , like karadzic and mladic have done . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy " could i deprive france of his candidacy just because he 's a socialist ? "
sarkozy asked in an interview with french newspaper le journal du dimanche , adding that strauss-kahn is " the most able candidate for the post " and shares his " vision of the imf 's operating . "
sarkozy said that he had already proposed strauss-kahn 's candidacy to us president george w. bush , british prime minister gordon brown and spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero .
germans hesitate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's horst köhler headed the imf before becoming his country 's president in 2004 according to media reports , the german government was irritated by sarkozy 's move .
a german finance ministry spokesman meanwhile told reporters that germany considered strauss-kahn to be a very good , strong , european candidate , adding that ministry officials had been in close contact with the french counterparts about finding a new imf head .
the ministry spokesman also said that germany 's aim was to find a strong , suitable european candidate for the job , adding that chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet would make the final decision about the german top choice .
strauss-kahn is one of the socialist heavy-weights and has so far canvassed in vain for a social democratic relaunch of his party .
he has not said whether he would be willing to take on the imf job .
european union finance ministers early next week are due to discuss a european candidate for the imf vacancy .

luis moreno-ocamp , the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court , said that the tribunal in the hague is an important instrument - and not just for bosnia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bosnian serb president biljana plavsic was sentenced to 11 years in prison for crimes against humanity " the worst criminals , the dictators are brought to justice there , " he said , adding that this contributes to a lasting peace . while justice is administered , this does n't necessarily mean that justice is served as far as the victims are concerned . " when the first mass rape trials took place , i went to sarajevo and met representatives of the organization of raped women , " rehn said .
" i asked them naively whether they were n't pleased that the perpetrators got such high penalties .
they looked at me as if i 'd come from a different planet and said : ' what are you talking about ?
we 'll suffer for the rest of our lives because of these rapes and they barely got 12 or 20 years . " ' a nightmare for criminals ? most bosnians also continue to avoid the issue .
the dayton agreement ended the fighting 12 years ago , but many people remain traumatized .
the war is n't over for them .
bosnian muslims and croats also consider dayton to be unfair - a peace agreement , but not a just one , they say . the division in two separate republic effectively split the country and politicians are not ready to overcome this and agree on one system .
but there 's another reason for the lack of interest in dealing with the war : karadzic and mladic are still at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic and karadzic remain at large hasanbegovic said he does n't think that tribunals can solve all crimes .
after all , there are thousands that participated , but only a few hundred have been punished so far . " i still believe that the work of the courts is important , because they punish criminals , " he said .
" they make sure that all war criminals can not sleep well any longer .
they can only seek out a hole in the forest to hide , like karadzic and mladic have done . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us white house is a neoclassical mansion .
for 35 years , the leaders of west germany lived in a modest-looking bungalow in bonn .
the building is now being renovated . a far cry from the swanky living spaces normally associated with heads of state , the flat-roofed chancellor 's bungalow was fitted with plastic lamps and sported imitation wood .
the bungalow , located near the rhine river and next to the chancellery , served as the official residence of the german chancellors from 1963 until the government moved to berlin .
empty since 1999 , the historic building will soon open to the public .
a restoration project is underway that will allow the building to host tour groups and special events .
needs some work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bungalow served as kohl 's home for 16 years " it was built extremely well 40 years ago , but in the meantime , the roof is in need of rehabilitation , " said georg adlbert , head of the wüstenrot foundation , which is investing approximately 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- in the renovations .
the renovation is scheduled to finish by late 2008 , adlbert said at a recent press conference to announce the remodel .
west german chancellors ludwig erhard , kurt georg kiesinger , helmut schmidt and helmut kohl all used the building as their bonn home .

kohl stayed 16 years , the longest of anyone .
kohl moved his family to bonn soon after becoming chancellor , bringing with him his wife , two sons and a hammond organ to the bungalow .
he paid 2,600 german deutsche marks -lrb- about 1,300 euros -rrb- rent each month and added personal touches such as heavy curtains and large square ceiling lamps .

experts believe the healing wo n't begin until the crimes have been dealt with . germany 's christian schwarz schilling was in good spirits when he handed over his office to his successor , slovak diplomat miroslave lajcak , this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarz-schilling -lrb- right -rrb- with lajcak in sarajevo on monday " i think that this will be a very important time for bosnia and hercegovina and i am confident that -lrb- lajcak -rrb- will be able , together with the bosnian leaders , to take this county forward , " he said . during the 1990s , the people of bosnia hercegovina witnessed the worst war crimes committed since the end of world war ii .
these crimes are far from having been solved . adnan hasanbegovic was a soldier in bosnia during the occupation of sarajevo .
it was the worst time of his life . " on the other hand , it led me to think about peace building , " said hasanbegovic , who now works at the center for non-violent action in sarajevo .
" i started thinking about justice , life and death and the meaning of life - about why there 's so much violence .

" hasanbegovic said he hopes that his work now plays a role in securing a peaceful and stable future for bosnia and hercegovina . early intervention the chances are that he and his allies will reach their goal are better than in many other conflict regions .
bosnia may have seen the worst war crimes since world war ii during the 1990s , with 8,000 bosnians murdered during the srebrenica massacre alone . but human rights activists , lawyers and the international community began to deal with the war crimes early on .
while the war was still ongoing in 1993 , the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia was established in the hague .
nobody thought about staging trials back then , but the court was meant as a signal that the international community was n't going to tolerate massacres and mass rape .
since then , many cases have been tried before the court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian children play in front of a banner reading " peace , no more wars " in tuzla , bosnia märtha elisabeth rehn , a former un special envoy for bosnia , said that she 's sometimes asked why it 's so important that war criminals such as bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic or bosnian serb army general ratko mladic are brought to the hague .
but when she talks to the women of srebrenica , she realizes how unhappy they are that nobody worries about their suffering . " justice is important for them in order to continue living and being ready for reconciliation , " rehn said . court symbolism experts agree that lasting peace is impossible without uncovering conflicts and violence that took place .
luis moreno-ocamp , the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court , said that the tribunal in the hague is an important instrument - and not just for bosnia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bosnian serb president biljana plavsic was sentenced to 11 years in prison for crimes against humanity " the worst criminals , the dictators are brought to justice there , " he said , adding that this contributes to a lasting peace . while justice is administered , this does n't necessarily mean that justice is served as far as the victims are concerned . " when the first mass rape trials took place , i went to sarajevo and met representatives of the organization of raped women , " rehn said .
" i asked them naively whether they were n't pleased that the perpetrators got such high penalties .

one million of them were jews from nazi-occupied europe .
some died from overwork , starvation and disease .
most were murdered in the camp 's notorious gas chambers .

museum staff use modern technology and enlist the help of schoolchildren in an effort to preserve artifacts from the death camp . during the holocaust more than 1.1 million people died at the auschwitz-birkenau death camp .
one million of them were jews from nazi-occupied europe .
some died from overwork , starvation and disease .
most were murdered in the camp 's notorious gas chambers .
the nazis collected the belongings of their victims .
there are 4,000 suitcases , tens of thousands of shoes , a heap of hair brushes and human hair , which the nazis used to fill mattresses .
all of these items became part of the museum , which was set up by the polish government in 1947 .
auschwitz is located on the outskirts of the polish town of oswiecim - named auschwitz in german .
nine months after invading poland in 1939 , the nazis set up auschwitz for captured members of the polish resistance .
auschwitz was house in a former polish army barracks .
two years later it was expanded at nearby brzezinka or birkenau .
personal artifacts tell story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz survivors return to the site of their imprisonment prisoners left behind not only personal artifacts but also created 2,000 works of art , most of which are in storage because there 's no place to display them in the museum .
the museum draws approximately 1 million visitors yearly .
recently , the museum has focused on telling the stories of individual victims through the objects they owned .
this has made conservation essential .
a team of eight conservation specialists works in the museum 's hi-tech laboratory , which was built three years ago .
" there are well-developed techniques for conserving centuries-old rembrandts of goyas , or egyptian mummies which are thousands of years old , " piotr cywinski , the director of the auschwitz museum , said in an interview with afp .
" but not for 60-year-old toothbrushes or suitcases .

experts believe the healing wo n't begin until the crimes have been dealt with . germany 's christian schwarz schilling was in good spirits when he handed over his office to his successor , slovak diplomat miroslave lajcak , this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarz-schilling -lrb- right -rrb- with lajcak in sarajevo on monday " i think that this will be a very important time for bosnia and hercegovina and i am confident that -lrb- lajcak -rrb- will be able , together with the bosnian leaders , to take this county forward , " he said . during the 1990s , the people of bosnia hercegovina witnessed the worst war crimes committed since the end of world war ii .
these crimes are far from having been solved . adnan hasanbegovic was a soldier in bosnia during the occupation of sarajevo .
it was the worst time of his life . " on the other hand , it led me to think about peace building , " said hasanbegovic , who now works at the center for non-violent action in sarajevo .
" i started thinking about justice , life and death and the meaning of life - about why there 's so much violence .
it made me become a peace activist after the war . " hasanbegovic said he hopes that his work now plays a role in securing a peaceful and stable future for bosnia and hercegovina . early intervention the chances are that he and his allies will reach their goal are better than in many other conflict regions .
bosnia may have seen the worst war crimes since world war ii during the 1990s , with 8,000 bosnians murdered during the srebrenica massacre alone . but human rights activists , lawyers and the international community began to deal with the war crimes early on .
while the war was still ongoing in 1993 , the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia was established in the hague .
nobody thought about staging trials back then , but the court was meant as a signal that the international community was n't going to tolerate massacres and mass rape .
since then , many cases have been tried before the court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian children play in front of a banner reading " peace , no more wars " in tuzla , bosnia märtha elisabeth rehn , a former un special envoy for bosnia , said that she 's sometimes asked why it 's so important that war criminals such as bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic or bosnian serb army general ratko mladic are brought to the hague .
but when she talks to the women of srebrenica , she realizes how unhappy they are that nobody worries about their suffering . " justice is important for them in order to continue living and being ready for reconciliation , " rehn said . court symbolism experts agree that lasting peace is impossible without uncovering conflicts and violence that took place .
luis moreno-ocamp , the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court , said that the tribunal in the hague is an important instrument - and not just for bosnia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bosnian serb president biljana plavsic was sentenced to 11 years in prison for crimes against humanity " the worst criminals , the dictators are brought to justice there , " he said , adding that this contributes to a lasting peace . while justice is administered , this does n't necessarily mean that justice is served as far as the victims are concerned . " when the first mass rape trials took place , i went to sarajevo and met representatives of the organization of raped women , " rehn said .
" i asked them naively whether they were n't pleased that the perpetrators got such high penalties .
they looked at me as if i 'd come from a different planet and said : ' what are you talking about ?
we 'll suffer for the rest of our lives because of these rapes and they barely got 12 or 20 years . " ' a nightmare for criminals ? most bosnians also continue to avoid the issue .
the dayton agreement ended the fighting 12 years ago , but many people remain traumatized .
the war is n't over for them .
bosnian muslims and croats also consider dayton to be unfair - a peace agreement , but not a just one , they say . the division in two separate republic effectively split the country and politicians are not ready to overcome this and agree on one system .
but there 's another reason for the lack of interest in dealing with the war : karadzic and mladic are still at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic and karadzic remain at large hasanbegovic said he does n't think that tribunals can solve all crimes .
after all , there are thousands that participated , but only a few hundred have been punished so far . " i still believe that the work of the courts is important , because they punish criminals , " he said .
" they make sure that all war criminals can not sleep well any longer .
they can only seek out a hole in the forest to hide , like karadzic and mladic have done . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 62-year-old singer abandoned his familiar routine of kicking footballs into the crowd at the millennium stadium in cardiff on saturday night .
instead , he was persuaded to punt rugby balls in honour of the welsh crowd .
stadium manager gerry toms said rugby balls were kept handy for stewart 's first stage appearance at the venue .
stewart has never hidden his love of football during a long career .
he has been to the stadium once before - but to watch an fa cup final rather than to perform . "
i 'm not retiring , but i wo n't be doing any tours that long and , to be honest , i ca n't imagine me doing these big stadiums in britain anymore " rod stewart the singer , who needed 10 stitches after injuring his leg on stage in manchester in june , has vowed to downsize his concerts after recently finishing a " punishing " five-month american tour .
as such , his millennium stadium gig , and two other dates at the ricoh stadium in coventry , could be the last of their kind , he said before the cardiff show .
" i 'm not retiring , but i wo n't be doing any tours that long and , to be honest , i ca n't imagine me doing these big stadiums in britain anymore , " said stewart , who in june married his third wife , model penny lancaster .
" i 've done them and i 've done the other arenas , next time round i 'd like to do it in a totally different way . "

citing high crime rates , drug abuse and teenage pregnancies , he said there was something " deeply wrong " and " long-term generational change " was needed .
mr cameron was speaking to the bbc 's sunday am show ahead of a report by the party 's social justice policy group .
a rise in the tax on alcohol to help tackle binge drinking is among the proposals it will contain .
' cultural change ' in a wide-ranging interview , mr cameron called for changes to the tax and benefits system to encourage couples to stay together and marry .
" we need a big cultural change in favour of fatherhood , in favour of parenting , in favour of marriage , " he added .
have your say " tax rise can be a motivation for people to stop drinking too much , but it will take time before we see the actual results " billy gionis , london send us your comments he said the conservatives would make a greater effort to reach out to muslims with the help of newly appointed shadow minister for community cohesion , sayeeda warsi .
and he insisted there was a still " a huge gulf " between the conservatives and labour , despite the parties sharing several advisors , including former metropolitan police chief lord stevens .
" we come into politics to get things done .
if sensible ideas that we 've put forward are going to be taken up -lrb- by the government -rrb- that 's great , " he said .
cannabis classing the policy group , led by former conservative leader iain duncan smith , is due to publish its report , entitled breakthrough britain , on tuesday .
its idea on higher alcohol taxes would add about 7p to the cost of a pint , and raise an extra £ 400m a year to help fund treatment of alcohol abuse .
however , this is not expected to be backed by mr cameron , after a source close to the tory leadership said some proposals " will be adopted , others wont be " .
among the group 's other proposals are that state schools in england judged by ofsted to be " failing " should be freed from local authority control and run by charities and parents .
it says pupils in disadvantaged schools should each get £ 500 for extra academic , musical or sport tuition .
the report will also recommend reversing the downgrading of cannabis from a class b to a class c drug .
and it will also say that heroin users should be encouraged to tackle their abuse by going " cold turkey " , rather than be treated with substitutes such as methadone .

carlyle may choose to distance itself from sir richard branson and the virgin empire to improve relations with bskyb and rupert murdoch , the observer said .

quoting city sources , it suggested that the private equity firm would be able to swiftly settle the differences by making the move .
however one industry observer told the paper that about £ 25m had been spent on promoting the virgin media brand , which came into existence last year after a takeover of ntl .
" it seems odd that carlyle is prepared to write that money off and start again , especially as virgin strikes a chord with the british public , " they said .
sir richard is the largest investor in virgin media , which has 9 million customers and a £ 4bn annual turnover , from its cable tv , internet and mobile phone businesses .
his 10 % stake has grown by about £ 150m to be worth £ 577m since the takeover of ntl last autumn .
he also owns the rights to the virgin name .
losses stemmed if carlyle 's offer was accepted , the merger would value virgin at approximately £ 5.6bn.
the total value of the takeover deal , including virgin 's debt of almost £ 6bn , would be about £ 11.5bn.
if it goes through , it would be the second biggest takeover of a british business by private equity , after boots .
it is believed virgin 's managers feel the business would be in a better position to grow as a private company , bbc business editor robert peston says .
in its last results , virgin said it had three million users of its television services , 3.4 million broadband customers , 4.5 million subscribers to its mobile phone service and 4.1 million fixed-line telephone customers .
it has stemmed its loss of customers in the battle with bskyb , saying that its number of viewers was " roughly flat " during april and may , thanks largely to promotion campaigns .
the company had earlier said it lost 46,900 customers in the three months to the end of march .
this was prompted after sky basic channels - also including sky news and sky sports news - were withdrawn at the end of february .
