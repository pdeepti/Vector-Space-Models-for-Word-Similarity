program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 04.01.2007 reducing europe 's reliance on russian gas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's gas rows with its neighbors have sparked concerns in europe russia 's energy spat with neighboring belarus has once again highlighed europe 's dependence on russian gas .
german energy expert claudia kemfert talked to dw-world.de about ways to get around the problem . dw-world.de : the gas dispute between russia and belarus shows that moscow has been using the energy issue as a political tool .
what are the consequences for european and german energy policy ? claudia kemfert : both germany and europe realize from this dispute that we are dependent on russian gas exports .
a recurrent theme of european energy policy is to reduce such dependence , which means relying more on our own resources , such as renewable energy , but also nuclear energy .
at the same time we should try and avoid an energy squeeze by looking at tapping energy from other gas-supplying nations . which alternative countries are you referring to ? at the moment , gas is already supplied by norway -lrb- which is not an eu member -rrb- , but there are limits to the supply .
then there are countries such as qatar , which are capable of delivering gas to europe .
pipelines are also being built precisely for this reason .
there is also the potential of liquified natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- .
germany missed the opportunity to construct tankers specially designed to store the gas .
one is being planned at the port of wilhelmshaven , but it wo n't be in service until 2010 .
and one tanker wo n't be enough .
it 's obvious that we have n't prepared well in order to diversify our energy sources . what needs to change at the political level so that we can tap energy from other sources ? in the past we were hugely dependent on one energy provider . russia has been a reliable supplier , no doubt about it , but the kremlin also has a political agenda and puts pressure on the transit countries delivering gas .
we could have a delivery problem when belarus for example , decides to block its pipelines or if russia once again has a gas row with ukraine .
one can not rule out the fact that europe too , for whatever reason , could have a dispute with russia .
that would then threaten energy supplies . for this reason , europe must promote domestic energy providers in order to reduce its dependence on gas imports .
and it 's also important for europe to improve upon its energy effiiciency . you have already mentioned nuclear energy .
should germany rethink its planned phasing out of nuclear power ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy expert claudia kemfert problems could naturally arise when nuclear plants need to be replaced by gas or conventional coal power plants .
with gas-fired plants there is the danger that we could become too heavily dependent on energy imports , for instance from russia.we know that coal plants generate excessive carbon dioxide emissions and greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change . besides , germany is a signatory to the kyoto protocol , so there is a real danger that we may not stick to the promised cuts in co2 emissions .
that 's why we are pushing to extend the life span of safe nuclear plants so that we have enough time to strengthen domestic energy providers .
the focus in the long term should however not be on nuclear energy , but on strenghtening renewable energy sources so that we have a good energy mix . germany has in the past relied hugely on gas deliveries , a fact that has influenced the german position within europe . would a diversification of energy sources change this situation ?
a bit .
as head of the eu presidency , germany will make it clear that it wants to pursue a policy change and diversify its energy . besides , it has to be made further clear that we are aware that there could be delivery problems and that germany would like to see more transparency in the russian energy market .
we have to make it clear to the russians where our interests lie .
but at the same time we should be prepared to accept the russian need to sell gas .
we all have legitimate economic interests , but when political interests begin to play a role , it must be made clear that western europe and germany do n't want to play along . if we seek other energy providers too in future , this could threaten the very good russian-german relations .
claudia kemfert is head of the division " energy , transport , environment " at the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw berlin -rrb- and is chair of environmental economics at berlin 's humboldt university . olga solonari interviewed claudia kemfert -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belarus official : deal reached in row with gazprom belarus said saturday it had reached an agreement with russian gas giant gazprom in their row over gas import prices , but gazprom said nothing had been signed yet .
-lrb- 30.12.2006 -rrb- russia , belarus sign last-minute gas deal russia and belarus signed a last-gasp agreement sunday on russian gas supplies in a deal that averts a threatened supply cut that would likely have hit deliveries to western europe .

the spat raises new concerns about eu energy dependence on russia .

german energy expert claudia kemfert talked to dw-world.de about ways to get around the problem . dw-world.de : the gas dispute between russia and belarus shows that moscow has been using the energy issue as a political tool .
what are the consequences for european and german energy policy ? claudia kemfert : both germany and europe realize from this dispute that we are dependent on russian gas exports .
a recurrent theme of european energy policy is to reduce such dependence , which means relying more on our own resources , such as renewable energy , but also nuclear energy .
at the same time we should try and avoid an energy squeeze by looking at tapping energy from other gas-supplying nations . which alternative countries are you referring to ? at the moment , gas is already supplied by norway -lrb- which is not an eu member -rrb- , but there are limits to the supply .
then there are countries such as qatar , which are capable of delivering gas to europe .
pipelines are also being built precisely for this reason .
there is also the potential of liquified natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- .
germany missed the opportunity to construct tankers specially designed to store the gas .
one is being planned at the port of wilhelmshaven , but it wo n't be in service until 2010 .
and one tanker wo n't be enough .
it 's obvious that we have n't prepared well in order to diversify our energy sources . what needs to change at the political level so that we can tap energy from other sources ? in the past we were hugely dependent on one energy provider . russia has been a reliable supplier , no doubt about it , but the kremlin also has a political agenda and puts pressure on the transit countries delivering gas .
we could have a delivery problem when belarus for example , decides to block its pipelines or if russia once again has a gas row with ukraine .
one can not rule out the fact that europe too , for whatever reason , could have a dispute with russia .
that would then threaten energy supplies . for this reason , europe must promote domestic energy providers in order to reduce its dependence on gas imports .
and it 's also important for europe to improve upon its energy effiiciency . you have already mentioned nuclear energy .
should germany rethink its planned phasing out of nuclear power ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy expert claudia kemfert problems could naturally arise when nuclear plants need to be replaced by gas or conventional coal power plants .
with gas-fired plants there is the danger that we could become too heavily dependent on energy imports , for instance from russia.we know that coal plants generate excessive carbon dioxide emissions and greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change . besides , germany is a signatory to the kyoto protocol , so there is a real danger that we may not stick to the promised cuts in co2 emissions .
that 's why we are pushing to extend the life span of safe nuclear plants so that we have enough time to strengthen domestic energy providers .
the focus in the long term should however not be on nuclear energy , but on strenghtening renewable energy sources so that we have a good energy mix . germany has in the past relied hugely on gas deliveries , a fact that has influenced the german position within europe . would a diversification of energy sources change this situation ?
a bit .
as head of the eu presidency , germany will make it clear that it wants to pursue a policy change and diversify its energy . besides , it has to be made further clear that we are aware that there could be delivery problems and that germany would like to see more transparency in the russian energy market .
we have to make it clear to the russians where our interests lie .
but at the same time we should be prepared to accept the russian need to sell gas .
we all have legitimate economic interests , but when political interests begin to play a role , it must be made clear that western europe and germany do n't want to play along . if we seek other energy providers too in future , this could threaten the very good russian-german relations .

before you pack your bag , check out what other dw-world.de readers had to say about their german travel experience . cycling in germany is a pleasure .
i spent three weeks riding from berlin to munich following the world cup last summer and i am still reveling in the experience .
it was like getting reacquainted an old friend i thought i already knew everything about , only to find i have only scratched the surface .
pleasures of the trip included traveling without a set itinerary and knowing that with inclement weather or fatigue or curiosity i could throw my bike on a train and zoom to new surprises .
happily , the weather was amazing and , actually , i only took the train once on a side trip to the bike-friendly city of münster .
next time , i look forward to riding in the alps .
i became excited for that adventure reading a book i found in a globetrotter travel store in berlin , an excellent starting point for any traveler to germany - and beyond , for that matter . - matt furber i have visited both england and germany many times and i always return home to the us heavier from germany .
my absolute favorite meals are breakfasts in small town hotels with the meats and breads from local providers . - john r. grum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : splurge on german specialities , just do n't break the scale germany has my admiration .
i just come back from a week in leipzig where the town was wearing the best christmas decorations i have seen in my whole life .
it was a fairyland .
people were very kind , organized and clean and german food was of the highest standard . - myriam on our recent visit to germany we had the pleasure of going to the town of jever .
known for its great tasting beer , a tour of the brewery was awesome .
we could n't have been more pleased by the hospitality we received at our stay at the hotel schwarzer adler .
the food was great and the jever beer on tap was well worth the visit . - rich solecki i recently traveled to germany with my brother .
we stayed for two weeks in different parts of it .
i must tell you , everything that one hears about the big glasses of real good beer is all true .
we arrived in munich to pick up the car my brother had just bought , and we stay there for a couple of days .
in december it was a little cold for us but not too cold to spoil the vacation .
as tourists we took photos of every big and old building , and everything else .
we ate in every german restaurant we could find and drank the local beer .
one night at the hofbrauhaus we felt like real bavarians with our big glasses , wheat beer , folk music , long wood benches that could seat 10 people and everybody singing and dancing .
i do n't remember if we had six or seven beers each , but they charged us only 26 euros .
lucky for us , the hotel was nearby .
i love germany !
some say germans are cold - it is better to travel and prove them wrong .
p.s. autobahn in english means happiness . - pedro olivencia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exploring the former gdr was a highlight for one reader i hired a car and visited germany in october 2006 .
i took my seven-year-old son and we stayed in braunlage , schierke and wiehe in thuringia .
it was very fascinating and historical .
i felt i could freely ask the locals walking if the were originally from the east or the west .
a german would probably feel more hesitant to ask that simple question .
in scheirke , you could really feel the former gdr .
the atmosphere is somehow inexplicably different from braunlage , and even formerly eastern eland and drei annen hohne .
parts of saxony-anhalt seem so well reconstructed that it is often difficult to imagine that less than 20 years ago it was part of east germany .
for both lower saxony and saxony-anhalt , the change after 1989 must have been very spectacular and unforeseen .
i had the impression that for people older than 25 to 30 , the border is still very much remembered . - charles beadle compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world.de 's readers share german travel highlights planning a trip to germany ?

we ate in every german restaurant we could find and drank the local beer .
one night at the hofbrauhaus we felt like real bavarians with our big glasses , wheat beer , folk music , long wood benches that could seat 10 people and everybody singing and dancing .

german energy expert claudia kemfert talked to dw-world.de about ways to get around the problem . dw-world.de : the gas dispute between russia and belarus shows that moscow has been using the energy issue as a political tool .
what are the consequences for european and german energy policy ? claudia kemfert : both germany and europe realize from this dispute that we are dependent on russian gas exports .
a recurrent theme of european energy policy is to reduce such dependence , which means relying more on our own resources , such as renewable energy , but also nuclear energy .
at the same time we should try and avoid an energy squeeze by looking at tapping energy from other gas-supplying nations . which alternative countries are you referring to ? at the moment , gas is already supplied by norway -lrb- which is not an eu member -rrb- , but there are limits to the supply .
then there are countries such as qatar , which are capable of delivering gas to europe .
pipelines are also being built precisely for this reason .
there is also the potential of liquified natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- .
germany missed the opportunity to construct tankers specially designed to store the gas .
one is being planned at the port of wilhelmshaven , but it wo n't be in service until 2010 .
and one tanker wo n't be enough .
it 's obvious that we have n't prepared well in order to diversify our energy sources . what needs to change at the political level so that we can tap energy from other sources ? in the past we were hugely dependent on one energy provider . russia has been a reliable supplier , no doubt about it , but the kremlin also has a political agenda and puts pressure on the transit countries delivering gas .
we could have a delivery problem when belarus for example , decides to block its pipelines or if russia once again has a gas row with ukraine .
one can not rule out the fact that europe too , for whatever reason , could have a dispute with russia .
that would then threaten energy supplies . for this reason , europe must promote domestic energy providers in order to reduce its dependence on gas imports .
and it 's also important for europe to improve upon its energy effiiciency . you have already mentioned nuclear energy .
should germany rethink its planned phasing out of nuclear power ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy expert claudia kemfert problems could naturally arise when nuclear plants need to be replaced by gas or conventional coal power plants .
with gas-fired plants there is the danger that we could become too heavily dependent on energy imports , for instance from russia.we know that coal plants generate excessive carbon dioxide emissions and greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change . besides , germany is a signatory to the kyoto protocol , so there is a real danger that we may not stick to the promised cuts in co2 emissions .
that 's why we are pushing to extend the life span of safe nuclear plants so that we have enough time to strengthen domestic energy providers .
the focus in the long term should however not be on nuclear energy , but on strenghtening renewable energy sources so that we have a good energy mix . germany has in the past relied hugely on gas deliveries , a fact that has influenced the german position within europe . would a diversification of energy sources change this situation ?
a bit .
as head of the eu presidency , germany will make it clear that it wants to pursue a policy change and diversify its energy . besides , it has to be made further clear that we are aware that there could be delivery problems and that germany would like to see more transparency in the russian energy market .
we have to make it clear to the russians where our interests lie .
but at the same time we should be prepared to accept the russian need to sell gas .
we all have legitimate economic interests , but when political interests begin to play a role , it must be made clear that western europe and germany do n't want to play along . if we seek other energy providers too in future , this could threaten the very good russian-german relations .
claudia kemfert is head of the division " energy , transport , environment " at the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw berlin -rrb- and is chair of environmental economics at berlin 's humboldt university . olga solonari interviewed claudia kemfert -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belarus official : deal reached in row with gazprom belarus said saturday it had reached an agreement with russian gas giant gazprom in their row over gas import prices , but gazprom said nothing had been signed yet .

before you pack your bag , check out what other dw-world.de readers had to say about their german travel experience . cycling in germany is a pleasure .
i spent three weeks riding from berlin to munich following the world cup last summer and i am still reveling in the experience .
it was like getting reacquainted an old friend i thought i already knew everything about , only to find i have only scratched the surface .
pleasures of the trip included traveling without a set itinerary and knowing that with inclement weather or fatigue or curiosity i could throw my bike on a train and zoom to new surprises .
happily , the weather was amazing and , actually , i only took the train once on a side trip to the bike-friendly city of münster .
next time , i look forward to riding in the alps .
i became excited for that adventure reading a book i found in a globetrotter travel store in berlin , an excellent starting point for any traveler to germany - and beyond , for that matter . - matt furber i have visited both england and germany many times and i always return home to the us heavier from germany .

it also calls for improved police cooperation . germany will push for greater cooperation in european interior policies during its eu presidency , said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
international terrorism , organized crime and illegal migration were increasingly threatening european security , he said .
" all member states must be aware that they would be overtaxed to cope with global security challenges all on their own , " schäuble said wednesday at the presentation of germany 's security program for its eu presidency . schäuble said the eu 's police agency europol , in particular needed strengthening .
with additional powers , europol could fight international terrorism and cross-border crime more effectively , he said . " in the future , europol should be responsible for fighting all forms of serious cross-border crime , such as a serial killers active in more than one member state or major disruptions to internal security caused by hooligans , " schäuble told reporters . schäuble said he supported the european commission 's proposal last month to strengthen europol 's role .
the so-called europol convention needed to be transferred into the eu 's legal framework , he said .
europol was established in 1992 and took up its full activities in 1999 .
over the past years , critics have said it lacks the powers necessary to handle new threats in the growing eu . eu states should share criminal data another priority for germany is improving police cooperation between member states , schäuble said . " criminals must not have a chance to escape prosecution simply by crossing a border , " he said .
germany will work to have the provisions of the treaty of prüm turned into eu law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police had help from britain during the world cup this agreement aims to establish an infrastructure to step up cross-border cooperation , particularly to combat terrorism , cross-border crime and illegal immigration .
it was adopted by austria , belgium , france , germany , luxembourg , spain and the netherlands in 2005 . the treaty would give all member states access to dna and fingerprint data , as well as vehicle registries , for example .
it would allow them to ask other states for police reinforcements in cases of serious accidents or major international sport competitions , as it did during last year 's soccer world cup in germany . the german security program for its eu presidency also called for closer collaboration on monitoring and analyzing web sites used by terrorist organizations , as well as better protection for critical infrastructure against a terrorist attack . finding a common voice in eu foreign policy the ministry 's security program said that the distinctions between domestic and foreign security were disappearing .
threats were often rooted outside of the eu .
member states therefore must work even more closely together on foreign relations , the paper said . maintaining a dialogue with its neighbors , with the united states , russia and other third countries was in the basic security interest of the eu , the program said .
in particular , the strategically important transatlantic relations needed to be strengthened .
challenges such as fighting international terrorism affected the united states and europe equally and could be dealt with only by working together , the ministry said . germany will host an informal meeting of eu justice and interior ministers in dresden from january 14 to 16 , 2007 to discuss its recommendations . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german global clout grows as berlin heads eu , g8 germany 's growing economic , political and military role is under the spotlight in 2007 with berlin holding the rotating presidencies of both the european union and the g8 club of industrial nations .

it wants the european union to support its efforts . italy has asked the european union for support in its bid to impose a global moratorium on the death penalty in the wake of saddam hussein 's execution . " i believe this must constitute one of the top commitments of our international efforts because it is urgent to have an initiative to put an end to the barbarianism of the death penalty , " italian foreign minister massimo d 'alema told news agency ansa . in a statement released earlier this week , the italian foreign ministry said the 27-member bloc should discuss a common strategy designed to increase international support for the moratorium at an informal meeting of eu political directorates set for jan 11-12 in dresden , germany . " the recent cases of capital punishments and executions present us with the need to draw the attention of the international community to a renewed initiative designed to promote a moratorium on the death penalty , in view of its complete abolition , " the statement said . italy , a largely catholic country , was shocked by televised images of the former iraqi dictator hanging .
it is now leading diplomatic efforts to bring about a global ban on capital punishment . italy has just become a non-permanent member of the united nations security council .
its ambassador in new york , marcello spatafora , has asked officials to put the moratorium on the agenda of the un general assembly . italian politician on hunger strike is hospitalized meanwhile , the head of italy 's radical party , marco pannella , agreed to be hospitalized on thursday as he entered the second week of his hunger strike to push for a worldwide moratorium on capital punishment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 76-year-old pannella has carried out several hunger strikes in the past on wednesday , he had begun accepting water .
but a medical bulletin posted on the radical party 's web site thursday stated that doctors were deeply concerned by pannella 's condition and urged hospitalization . doctors said pannella was dehydrated and faced " potentially irreversible " damage to his kidneys and cardio-vascular system .
he has staged hunger strikes in support of a number of causes over his political career . pannella was a leading advocate of legalized abortion and divorce in the 1970s and 1980s . condemnation is not enough rome 's initiative will involve 85 un member states that signed a non-binding declaration in december against the death penalty , prime minister romano prodi said . " the government is not content with condemning the death penalty , it will act , " prodi said . capital punishment is outlawed in all european union countries , but it is widely practiced in two of the un security council 's five permanent members - china and the united states . iraq deflects italian criticism however , iraq has rebuffed italian criticism , noting that the italians themselves had executed former fascist leader benito mussolini during world war ii .
the dictator was executed by partisans and strung up in a square in milan in 1945 . " they have no right interfering with the affairs of another country , " iraqi government official yaseen majeed told italian newspaper la repubblica . " mussolini 's trial only lasted one minute .

and the waste is unlikely to end soon . german taxpayers have forked out the money to pay for the cost of government workers traveling between berlin and bonn and for special benefits these officials receive , according to a report on thursday in bild newspaper . no other country in the world seems to be willing to afford the doubtful luxury of a seat of government split between two cities .
germany 's unique situation arose from the so-called bonn-berlin law of 1994 which aimed to ensure that bonn would not suffer economically from large parts of the government moving to the new capital , berlin . even today , six ministries , including those for development , defence , environment and health have their headquarters in bonn and only smaller representations in berlin .
clearly , for the media the government and berlin form an inseparable unit .
but what is hardly known is that the majority of government officials still work in bonn - some 10 , 200 , while only a little over 8,000 work in berlin . commuting from one place to another has become a daily phenomenon for german government workers .
some officials say that even with the help of modern telecommunications technology , such as e-mail , video conferencing and instant messaging , traveling between berlin and bonn is an absolute necessity . " sheer madness " " i can use -lrb- those means -rrb- to have contacts with other people in the ministry in bonn , " said rolf eckermann , an official in the development ministry .
but that was not enough , he said .

since then , the magazine has unearthed scandal after scandal , while also occasionally coming under fire itself . for decades , the weekly der spiegel has been the leader in investigative journalism in germany .
as one of germany 's most influential news sources - it held almost a monopoly on forming german public opinion in the postwar decades - the magazine has revealed numerous scandals and shaped politics like no other german media outlet . in the best of times , it has been called the " independent conscience of politicians " that has never let a scandal slip through its fingers . one of most dramatic events spiegel covered was the " flick affair , " a bribery scandal the magazine investigated which eventually forced otto graf lambsdorff , then minister for economic affairs , to resign in 1984 . relentless digging bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der spiegel 's first issue on jan .
4 , 1947 other scandals spiegel unearthed include that of politician uwe barschel in 1987 .
barschel , then the incumbent state premier , allegedly had his opponent spied upon during an election campaign in the hope of finding incriminating evidence to use . spiegel revealed this and other unsavory dealings involving an assistant of barschel 's .
while barschel denied any knowledge of the tactics , he ended up withdrawing from the election race . he was found dead a short time later in a bathtub in geneva , and while some thought it was a suicide , many others speculated he was murdered . the " barschel affair " was just one in a string of scandalous episodes that continued to send shockwaves through the german political and cultural landscape well into the 1990s . der spiegel was at the center of much of it , both as muckraker and maverick . spiegel history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : augstein -lrb- c -rrb- going into court in jan .
1963 der spiegel succeeded the magazine diese woche -lrb- this week -rrb- , which the british press officer john chaloner had founded in 1946 . chaloner , however , was forced to abandon the paper as its critical view of the occupying allied forces in germany did not find favor among them . rudolf augstein , a 23-year-old reporter known for his lively and impertinent writing style at a newspaper in hanover , took over the license for diese woche .
he turned it into der spiegel and became its publisher and editor-in-chief , but maintained diese woche 's style of critically reporting on political and cultural events . the " spiegel affair " spiegel was so good at uncovering scandals that it even got one named after itself : the " spiegel affair . " in 1962 , the magazine published an article about a nato maneuver called " fallex 62 " that also threw a negative light on the state of the bundeswehr , or german army .
the article exposed the lack of in preparedness against the communist threat from the east at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf augstein -lrb- l -rrb- in early 1963 , after being arrested for treason and then released the magazine was accused of treason , with then minister of defense franz josef strauss having augstein , the article 's author , and other editors-in-chief arrested . spiegel 's offices were closed down for weeks ; augstein stayed in jail for months .
the events triggered riots and protests throughout germany , with the public accusing the government of supporting censorship . the affair eventually led to a groundbreaking ruling by the constitutional court , which laid down the basic tenets for freedom of the press for decades to come . having become the voice of conscience , der spiegel 's sales skyrocketed , hitting half a million copies in the following years . then and now since stefan aust took over as editor-in-chief in 1994 , and tried to ensure the magazine kept up with the changing times .
in 1994 it was the first magazine in the world to go online . but he also came under criticism , especially for breaking one of the publications long-standing cardinal rules : never fraternize with the powerful .
besides the critique about pandering to politicians , there are also accusations about more sensationalism and increasing amounts of fluff . still , the magazine manages to both mesmerize and polarize german society .
smart marketing seduces readers into wanting " the whole truth " each monday when they can find the new issue on newsstands , even if it 's been years since der spiegel actually uncovered a big scandal . fabian gartmann -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press council celebrates 50 years monday is the 50th anniversary of the german press council , an independent and self-regulating organization which was based on the british press council model .

and the waste is unlikely to end soon . german taxpayers have forked out the money to pay for the cost of government workers traveling between berlin and bonn and for special benefits these officials receive , according to a report on thursday in bild newspaper . no other country in the world seems to be willing to afford the doubtful luxury of a seat of government split between two cities .
germany 's unique situation arose from the so-called bonn-berlin law of 1994 which aimed to ensure that bonn would not suffer economically from large parts of the government moving to the new capital , berlin . even today , six ministries , including those for development , defence , environment and health have their headquarters in bonn and only smaller representations in berlin .
clearly , for the media the government and berlin form an inseparable unit .
but what is hardly known is that the majority of government officials still work in bonn - some 10 , 200 , while only a little over 8,000 work in berlin . commuting from one place to another has become a daily phenomenon for german government workers .
some officials say that even with the help of modern telecommunications technology , such as e-mail , video conferencing and instant messaging , traveling between berlin and bonn is an absolute necessity . " sheer madness " " i can use -lrb- those means -rrb- to have contacts with other people in the ministry in bonn , " said rolf eckermann , an official in the development ministry .
but that was not enough , he said .
" it is very difficult to work if the other people are 600 kilometers away .
you have modern technology , but you have to also have the personal contact . "

" i believe that where there 's a will , there 's a way , " wulff has said .
" the real question here is whether those affected on both sides are actually keen on a speedy solution . " opposition green party parliamentary spokesman jürgen trittin has been more direct .
he 's called the dual seat of government ' sheer madness . ' many officials working in bonn have no way of catching up with the speedy flow of information in berlin , the former federal environment minister has said .
trittin says the decision-making process was severely hampered by the dual offices .
at a time when ordinary germans are called upon to tighten their belts , wasting money on constant commuter flights between bonn and berlin is no longer acceptable , he has said . but opponents of a complete move to berlin find it relatively easy to ward off this financial argument .
they refer to a recent study compiled by an independent panel which said that the move would cost up to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- .

since then , the magazine has unearthed scandal after scandal , while also occasionally coming under fire itself . for decades , the weekly der spiegel has been the leader in investigative journalism in germany .
as one of germany 's most influential news sources - it held almost a monopoly on forming german public opinion in the postwar decades - the magazine has revealed numerous scandals and shaped politics like no other german media outlet . in the best of times , it has been called the " independent conscience of politicians " that has never let a scandal slip through its fingers . one of most dramatic events spiegel covered was the " flick affair , " a bribery scandal the magazine investigated which eventually forced otto graf lambsdorff , then minister for economic affairs , to resign in 1984 . relentless digging bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der spiegel 's first issue on jan .

while barschel denied any knowledge of the tactics , he ended up withdrawing from the election race . he was found dead a short time later in a bathtub in geneva , and while some thought it was a suicide , many others speculated he was murdered . the " barschel affair " was just one in a string of scandalous episodes that continued to send shockwaves through the german political and cultural landscape well into the 1990s . der spiegel was at the center of much of it , both as muckraker and maverick . spiegel history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : augstein -lrb- c -rrb- going into court in jan .

he turned it into der spiegel and became its publisher and editor-in-chief , but maintained diese woche 's style of critically reporting on political and cultural events . the " spiegel affair " spiegel was so good at uncovering scandals that it even got one named after itself : the " spiegel affair . " in 1962 , the magazine published an article about a nato maneuver called " fallex 62 " that also threw a negative light on the state of the bundeswehr , or german army .

the events triggered riots and protests throughout germany , with the public accusing the government of supporting censorship . the affair eventually led to a groundbreaking ruling by the constitutional court , which laid down the basic tenets for freedom of the press for decades to come . having become the voice of conscience , der spiegel 's sales skyrocketed , hitting half a million copies in the following years . then and now since stefan aust took over as editor-in-chief in 1994 , and tried to ensure the magazine kept up with the changing times .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 04.01.2007 italy calls for united european front against death penalty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein 's execution sparked sharp criticism in europe the italian government has said it will campaign to abolish the death penalty worldwide , using its position as one of 15 un security council members .
it wants the european union to support its efforts . italy has asked the european union for support in its bid to impose a global moratorium on the death penalty in the wake of saddam hussein 's execution . " i believe this must constitute one of the top commitments of our international efforts because it is urgent to have an initiative to put an end to the barbarianism of the death penalty , " italian foreign minister massimo d 'alema told news agency ansa . in a statement released earlier this week , the italian foreign ministry said the 27-member bloc should discuss a common strategy designed to increase international support for the moratorium at an informal meeting of eu political directorates set for jan 11-12 in dresden , germany . " the recent cases of capital punishments and executions present us with the need to draw the attention of the international community to a renewed initiative designed to promote a moratorium on the death penalty , in view of its complete abolition , " the statement said . italy , a largely catholic country , was shocked by televised images of the former iraqi dictator hanging .
it is now leading diplomatic efforts to bring about a global ban on capital punishment . italy has just become a non-permanent member of the united nations security council .
its ambassador in new york , marcello spatafora , has asked officials to put the moratorium on the agenda of the un general assembly . italian politician on hunger strike is hospitalized meanwhile , the head of italy 's radical party , marco pannella , agreed to be hospitalized on thursday as he entered the second week of his hunger strike to push for a worldwide moratorium on capital punishment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 76-year-old pannella has carried out several hunger strikes in the past on wednesday , he had begun accepting water .
but a medical bulletin posted on the radical party 's web site thursday stated that doctors were deeply concerned by pannella 's condition and urged hospitalization . doctors said pannella was dehydrated and faced " potentially irreversible " damage to his kidneys and cardio-vascular system .
he has staged hunger strikes in support of a number of causes over his political career . pannella was a leading advocate of legalized abortion and divorce in the 1970s and 1980s . condemnation is not enough rome 's initiative will involve 85 un member states that signed a non-binding declaration in december against the death penalty , prime minister romano prodi said . " the government is not content with condemning the death penalty , it will act , " prodi said . capital punishment is outlawed in all european union countries , but it is widely practiced in two of the un security council 's five permanent members - china and the united states . iraq deflects italian criticism however , iraq has rebuffed italian criticism , noting that the italians themselves had executed former fascist leader benito mussolini during world war ii .
the dictator was executed by partisans and strung up in a square in milan in 1945 . " they have no right interfering with the affairs of another country , " iraqi government official yaseen majeed told italian newspaper la repubblica . " mussolini 's trial only lasted one minute .

german energy expert claudia kemfert talked to dw-world.de about ways to get around the problem . dw-world.de : the gas dispute between russia and belarus shows that moscow has been using the energy issue as a political tool .
what are the consequences for european and german energy policy ? claudia kemfert : both germany and europe realize from this dispute that we are dependent on russian gas exports .
a recurrent theme of european energy policy is to reduce such dependence , which means relying more on our own resources , such as renewable energy , but also nuclear energy .
at the same time we should try and avoid an energy squeeze by looking at tapping energy from other gas-supplying nations . which alternative countries are you referring to ? at the moment , gas is already supplied by norway -lrb- which is not an eu member -rrb- , but there are limits to the supply .
then there are countries such as qatar , which are capable of delivering gas to europe .
pipelines are also being built precisely for this reason .
there is also the potential of liquified natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- .
germany missed the opportunity to construct tankers specially designed to store the gas .
one is being planned at the port of wilhelmshaven , but it wo n't be in service until 2010 .
and one tanker wo n't be enough .
it 's obvious that we have n't prepared well in order to diversify our energy sources . what needs to change at the political level so that we can tap energy from other sources ? in the past we were hugely dependent on one energy provider . russia has been a reliable supplier , no doubt about it , but the kremlin also has a political agenda and puts pressure on the transit countries delivering gas .
we could have a delivery problem when belarus for example , decides to block its pipelines or if russia once again has a gas row with ukraine .
one can not rule out the fact that europe too , for whatever reason , could have a dispute with russia .
that would then threaten energy supplies . for this reason , europe must promote domestic energy providers in order to reduce its dependence on gas imports .
and it 's also important for europe to improve upon its energy effiiciency . you have already mentioned nuclear energy .
should germany rethink its planned phasing out of nuclear power ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy expert claudia kemfert problems could naturally arise when nuclear plants need to be replaced by gas or conventional coal power plants .
with gas-fired plants there is the danger that we could become too heavily dependent on energy imports , for instance from russia.we know that coal plants generate excessive carbon dioxide emissions and greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change . besides , germany is a signatory to the kyoto protocol , so there is a real danger that we may not stick to the promised cuts in co2 emissions .
that 's why we are pushing to extend the life span of safe nuclear plants so that we have enough time to strengthen domestic energy providers .
the focus in the long term should however not be on nuclear energy , but on strenghtening renewable energy sources so that we have a good energy mix . germany has in the past relied hugely on gas deliveries , a fact that has influenced the german position within europe . would a diversification of energy sources change this situation ?
a bit .
as head of the eu presidency , germany will make it clear that it wants to pursue a policy change and diversify its energy . besides , it has to be made further clear that we are aware that there could be delivery problems and that germany would like to see more transparency in the russian energy market .
we have to make it clear to the russians where our interests lie .
but at the same time we should be prepared to accept the russian need to sell gas .
we all have legitimate economic interests , but when political interests begin to play a role , it must be made clear that western europe and germany do n't want to play along . if we seek other energy providers too in future , this could threaten the very good russian-german relations .

german energy expert claudia kemfert talked to dw-world.de about ways to get around the problem . dw-world.de : the gas dispute between russia and belarus shows that moscow has been using the energy issue as a political tool .
what are the consequences for european and german energy policy ? claudia kemfert : both germany and europe realize from this dispute that we are dependent on russian gas exports .
a recurrent theme of european energy policy is to reduce such dependence , which means relying more on our own resources , such as renewable energy , but also nuclear energy .
at the same time we should try and avoid an energy squeeze by looking at tapping energy from other gas-supplying nations . which alternative countries are you referring to ? at the moment , gas is already supplied by norway -lrb- which is not an eu member -rrb- , but there are limits to the supply .
then there are countries such as qatar , which are capable of delivering gas to europe .
pipelines are also being built precisely for this reason .
there is also the potential of liquified natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- .
germany missed the opportunity to construct tankers specially designed to store the gas .
one is being planned at the port of wilhelmshaven , but it wo n't be in service until 2010 .
and one tanker wo n't be enough .
it 's obvious that we have n't prepared well in order to diversify our energy sources . what needs to change at the political level so that we can tap energy from other sources ? in the past we were hugely dependent on one energy provider . russia has been a reliable supplier , no doubt about it , but the kremlin also has a political agenda and puts pressure on the transit countries delivering gas .
we could have a delivery problem when belarus for example , decides to block its pipelines or if russia once again has a gas row with ukraine .
one can not rule out the fact that europe too , for whatever reason , could have a dispute with russia .
that would then threaten energy supplies . for this reason , europe must promote domestic energy providers in order to reduce its dependence on gas imports .
and it 's also important for europe to improve upon its energy effiiciency . you have already mentioned nuclear energy .
should germany rethink its planned phasing out of nuclear power ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy expert claudia kemfert problems could naturally arise when nuclear plants need to be replaced by gas or conventional coal power plants .
with gas-fired plants there is the danger that we could become too heavily dependent on energy imports , for instance from russia.we know that coal plants generate excessive carbon dioxide emissions and greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change . besides , germany is a signatory to the kyoto protocol , so there is a real danger that we may not stick to the promised cuts in co2 emissions .
that 's why we are pushing to extend the life span of safe nuclear plants so that we have enough time to strengthen domestic energy providers .
the focus in the long term should however not be on nuclear energy , but on strenghtening renewable energy sources so that we have a good energy mix . germany has in the past relied hugely on gas deliveries , a fact that has influenced the german position within europe . would a diversification of energy sources change this situation ?
a bit .
as head of the eu presidency , germany will make it clear that it wants to pursue a policy change and diversify its energy . besides , it has to be made further clear that we are aware that there could be delivery problems and that germany would like to see more transparency in the russian energy market .
we have to make it clear to the russians where our interests lie .
but at the same time we should be prepared to accept the russian need to sell gas .
we all have legitimate economic interests , but when political interests begin to play a role , it must be made clear that western europe and germany do n't want to play along . if we seek other energy providers too in future , this could threaten the very good russian-german relations .

it also calls for improved police cooperation . germany will push for greater cooperation in european interior policies during its eu presidency , said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
international terrorism , organized crime and illegal migration were increasingly threatening european security , he said .
" all member states must be aware that they would be overtaxed to cope with global security challenges all on their own , " schäuble said wednesday at the presentation of germany 's security program for its eu presidency . schäuble said the eu 's police agency europol , in particular needed strengthening .
with additional powers , europol could fight international terrorism and cross-border crime more effectively , he said . " in the future , europol should be responsible for fighting all forms of serious cross-border crime , such as a serial killers active in more than one member state or major disruptions to internal security caused by hooligans , " schäuble told reporters . schäuble said he supported the european commission 's proposal last month to strengthen europol 's role .
the so-called europol convention needed to be transferred into the eu 's legal framework , he said .
europol was established in 1992 and took up its full activities in 1999 .
over the past years , critics have said it lacks the powers necessary to handle new threats in the growing eu . eu states should share criminal data another priority for germany is improving police cooperation between member states , schäuble said . " criminals must not have a chance to escape prosecution simply by crossing a border , " he said .
germany will work to have the provisions of the treaty of prüm turned into eu law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police had help from britain during the world cup this agreement aims to establish an infrastructure to step up cross-border cooperation , particularly to combat terrorism , cross-border crime and illegal immigration .
it was adopted by austria , belgium , france , germany , luxembourg , spain and the netherlands in 2005 . the treaty would give all member states access to dna and fingerprint data , as well as vehicle registries , for example .
it would allow them to ask other states for police reinforcements in cases of serious accidents or major international sport competitions , as it did during last year 's soccer world cup in germany . the german security program for its eu presidency also called for closer collaboration on monitoring and analyzing web sites used by terrorist organizations , as well as better protection for critical infrastructure against a terrorist attack . finding a common voice in eu foreign policy the ministry 's security program said that the distinctions between domestic and foreign security were disappearing .

before you pack your bag , check out what other dw-world.de readers had to say about their german travel experience . cycling in germany is a pleasure .
i spent three weeks riding from berlin to munich following the world cup last summer and i am still reveling in the experience .
it was like getting reacquainted an old friend i thought i already knew everything about , only to find i have only scratched the surface .
pleasures of the trip included traveling without a set itinerary and knowing that with inclement weather or fatigue or curiosity i could throw my bike on a train and zoom to new surprises .
happily , the weather was amazing and , actually , i only took the train once on a side trip to the bike-friendly city of münster .
next time , i look forward to riding in the alps .
i became excited for that adventure reading a book i found in a globetrotter travel store in berlin , an excellent starting point for any traveler to germany - and beyond , for that matter . - matt furber i have visited both england and germany many times and i always return home to the us heavier from germany .

i just come back from a week in leipzig where the town was wearing the best christmas decorations i have seen in my whole life .
it was a fairyland .
people were very kind , organized and clean and german food was of the highest standard . - myriam on our recent visit to germany we had the pleasure of going to the town of jever .
known for its great tasting beer , a tour of the brewery was awesome .
we could n't have been more pleased by the hospitality we received at our stay at the hotel schwarzer adler .
the food was great and the jever beer on tap was well worth the visit . - rich solecki i recently traveled to germany with my brother .
we stayed for two weeks in different parts of it .
i must tell you , everything that one hears about the big glasses of real good beer is all true .
we arrived in munich to pick up the car my brother had just bought , and we stay there for a couple of days .
in december it was a little cold for us but not too cold to spoil the vacation .
as tourists we took photos of every big and old building , and everything else .
we ate in every german restaurant we could find and drank the local beer .
one night at the hofbrauhaus we felt like real bavarians with our big glasses , wheat beer , folk music , long wood benches that could seat 10 people and everybody singing and dancing .
i do n't remember if we had six or seven beers each , but they charged us only 26 euros .
lucky for us , the hotel was nearby .
i love germany !
some say germans are cold - it is better to travel and prove them wrong .

i took my seven-year-old son and we stayed in braunlage , schierke and wiehe in thuringia .
it was very fascinating and historical .
i felt i could freely ask the locals walking if the were originally from the east or the west .
a german would probably feel more hesitant to ask that simple question .

before you pack your bag , check out what other dw-world.de readers had to say about their german travel experience . cycling in germany is a pleasure .
i spent three weeks riding from berlin to munich following the world cup last summer and i am still reveling in the experience .
it was like getting reacquainted an old friend i thought i already knew everything about , only to find i have only scratched the surface .
pleasures of the trip included traveling without a set itinerary and knowing that with inclement weather or fatigue or curiosity i could throw my bike on a train and zoom to new surprises .
happily , the weather was amazing and , actually , i only took the train once on a side trip to the bike-friendly city of münster .
next time , i look forward to riding in the alps .
i became excited for that adventure reading a book i found in a globetrotter travel store in berlin , an excellent starting point for any traveler to germany - and beyond , for that matter . - matt furber i have visited both england and germany many times and i always return home to the us heavier from germany .

the food was great and the jever beer on tap was well worth the visit . - rich solecki i recently traveled to germany with my brother .
we stayed for two weeks in different parts of it .
i must tell you , everything that one hears about the big glasses of real good beer is all true .
we arrived in munich to pick up the car my brother had just bought , and we stay there for a couple of days .
in december it was a little cold for us but not too cold to spoil the vacation .
as tourists we took photos of every big and old building , and everything else .
we ate in every german restaurant we could find and drank the local beer .
one night at the hofbrauhaus we felt like real bavarians with our big glasses , wheat beer , folk music , long wood benches that could seat 10 people and everybody singing and dancing .
i do n't remember if we had six or seven beers each , but they charged us only 26 euros .
lucky for us , the hotel was nearby .

it wants the european union to support its efforts . italy has asked the european union for support in its bid to impose a global moratorium on the death penalty in the wake of saddam hussein 's execution . " i believe this must constitute one of the top commitments of our international efforts because it is urgent to have an initiative to put an end to the barbarianism of the death penalty , " italian foreign minister massimo d 'alema told news agency ansa . in a statement released earlier this week , the italian foreign ministry said the 27-member bloc should discuss a common strategy designed to increase international support for the moratorium at an informal meeting of eu political directorates set for jan 11-12 in dresden , germany . " the recent cases of capital punishments and executions present us with the need to draw the attention of the international community to a renewed initiative designed to promote a moratorium on the death penalty , in view of its complete abolition , " the statement said . italy , a largely catholic country , was shocked by televised images of the former iraqi dictator hanging .
it is now leading diplomatic efforts to bring about a global ban on capital punishment . italy has just become a non-permanent member of the united nations security council .
its ambassador in new york , marcello spatafora , has asked officials to put the moratorium on the agenda of the un general assembly . italian politician on hunger strike is hospitalized meanwhile , the head of italy 's radical party , marco pannella , agreed to be hospitalized on thursday as he entered the second week of his hunger strike to push for a worldwide moratorium on capital punishment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 76-year-old pannella has carried out several hunger strikes in the past on wednesday , he had begun accepting water .

he has staged hunger strikes in support of a number of causes over his political career . pannella was a leading advocate of legalized abortion and divorce in the 1970s and 1980s . condemnation is not enough rome 's initiative will involve 85 un member states that signed a non-binding declaration in december against the death penalty , prime minister romano prodi said . " the government is not content with condemning the death penalty , it will act , " prodi said . capital punishment is outlawed in all european union countries , but it is widely practiced in two of the un security council 's five permanent members - china and the united states . iraq deflects italian criticism however , iraq has rebuffed italian criticism , noting that the italians themselves had executed former fascist leader benito mussolini during world war ii .
the dictator was executed by partisans and strung up in a square in milan in 1945 . " they have no right interfering with the affairs of another country , " iraqi government official yaseen majeed told italian newspaper la repubblica . " mussolini 's trial only lasted one minute .

" our economic systems are based on the same values , " she said .
" we must watch out that we do not drift apart but instead come closer together , where there are clear advantages for both sides . " she said it was her ambition to create a single transatlantic market for investors , with common rules and standards on issues such as intellectual property and financial regulation . merkel wants us support for mideast as europe 's biggest economy and most populous country , germany faces high expectations for the dual presidencies which by coincidence fall together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel plans to push for a solution to the mideast conflict spokesmen for the two leaders said merkel and bush would take up international crises including the stalled middle east peace process , efforts to quell violence in afghanistan and iraq , iran 's disputed nuclear ambitions , instability in lebanon and efforts to decide the final status of kosovo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 04.01.2007 dual seat of german government costs taxpayers dearly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellery has moved to berlin , but six ministries are still in bonn germany has over the past decade spent 196 million euros -lrb- $ 260 million -rrb- to maintain ministry offices in both berlin and bonn , according to a report .
and the waste is unlikely to end soon . german taxpayers have forked out the money to pay for the cost of government workers traveling between berlin and bonn and for special benefits these officials receive , according to a report on thursday in bild newspaper . no other country in the world seems to be willing to afford the doubtful luxury of a seat of government split between two cities .
germany 's unique situation arose from the so-called bonn-berlin law of 1994 which aimed to ensure that bonn would not suffer economically from large parts of the government moving to the new capital , berlin . even today , six ministries , including those for development , defence , environment and health have their headquarters in bonn and only smaller representations in berlin .
clearly , for the media the government and berlin form an inseparable unit .
but what is hardly known is that the majority of government officials still work in bonn - some 10 , 200 , while only a little over 8,000 work in berlin . commuting from one place to another has become a daily phenomenon for german government workers .
some officials say that even with the help of modern telecommunications technology , such as e-mail , video conferencing and instant messaging , traveling between berlin and bonn is an absolute necessity . " sheer madness " " i can use -lrb- those means -rrb- to have contacts with other people in the ministry in bonn , " said rolf eckermann , an official in the development ministry .
but that was not enough , he said .

it also calls for improved police cooperation . germany will push for greater cooperation in european interior policies during its eu presidency , said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
international terrorism , organized crime and illegal migration were increasingly threatening european security , he said .
" all member states must be aware that they would be overtaxed to cope with global security challenges all on their own , " schäuble said wednesday at the presentation of germany 's security program for its eu presidency . schäuble said the eu 's police agency europol , in particular needed strengthening .
with additional powers , europol could fight international terrorism and cross-border crime more effectively , he said . " in the future , europol should be responsible for fighting all forms of serious cross-border crime , such as a serial killers active in more than one member state or major disruptions to internal security caused by hooligans , " schäuble told reporters . schäuble said he supported the european commission 's proposal last month to strengthen europol 's role .
the so-called europol convention needed to be transferred into the eu 's legal framework , he said .
europol was established in 1992 and took up its full activities in 1999 .
over the past years , critics have said it lacks the powers necessary to handle new threats in the growing eu . eu states should share criminal data another priority for germany is improving police cooperation between member states , schäuble said .

the tax comes in retaliation for moscow cutting subsidies on energy supplies to belarus . " we have done everything that -lrb- russia -rrb- asked us to do , and today the time has come to demand that -lrb- russia -rrb- keeps its promises , " president alexander lukashenko told a cabinet meeting on wednesday .
" if it does not , we are within our rights to act in turn .
by that i mean to raise the question of the transit of oil through belarus , payment for this transit , payment for the land that is used for oil and gas pipelines , russian properties here , " the authoritarian leader said . market watchers said the duty would not affect world oil prices or cause shortages , but it could cause short-term disruptions to the supplies as refiners in germany and poland looked for cheaper alternative supplies , reuters reported .

" this situation is the result of a series of restrictive measures by the russian customs service , " ivan danchenko told reporters in minsk . danchenko denied rumors that that belarusian companies were sending south american-produced cane sugar to russia disguised as beet sugar to avoid customs duties . coming in the wake of a recently announced hike in russian duties on oil exports to belarus , sunday 's deal on gas appears to mark the end of an era of cheap energy supplies from russia that have subsidized the belarusian economy since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reducing europe 's reliance on russian gas russia 's energy spat with neighboring belarus has once again highlighed europe 's dependence on russian gas .

since then , the magazine has unearthed scandal after scandal , while also occasionally coming under fire itself . for decades , the weekly der spiegel has been the leader in investigative journalism in germany .
as one of germany 's most influential news sources - it held almost a monopoly on forming german public opinion in the postwar decades - the magazine has revealed numerous scandals and shaped politics like no other german media outlet . in the best of times , it has been called the " independent conscience of politicians " that has never let a scandal slip through its fingers . one of most dramatic events spiegel covered was the " flick affair , " a bribery scandal the magazine investigated which eventually forced otto graf lambsdorff , then minister for economic affairs , to resign in 1984 . relentless digging bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der spiegel 's first issue on jan .
4 , 1947 other scandals spiegel unearthed include that of politician uwe barschel in 1987 .
barschel , then the incumbent state premier , allegedly had his opponent spied upon during an election campaign in the hope of finding incriminating evidence to use . spiegel revealed this and other unsavory dealings involving an assistant of barschel 's .
while barschel denied any knowledge of the tactics , he ended up withdrawing from the election race . he was found dead a short time later in a bathtub in geneva , and while some thought it was a suicide , many others speculated he was murdered . the " barschel affair " was just one in a string of scandalous episodes that continued to send shockwaves through the german political and cultural landscape well into the 1990s . der spiegel was at the center of much of it , both as muckraker and maverick . spiegel history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : augstein -lrb- c -rrb- going into court in jan .
1963 der spiegel succeeded the magazine diese woche -lrb- this week -rrb- , which the british press officer john chaloner had founded in 1946 . chaloner , however , was forced to abandon the paper as its critical view of the occupying allied forces in germany did not find favor among them . rudolf augstein , a 23-year-old reporter known for his lively and impertinent writing style at a newspaper in hanover , took over the license for diese woche .
he turned it into der spiegel and became its publisher and editor-in-chief , but maintained diese woche 's style of critically reporting on political and cultural events . the " spiegel affair " spiegel was so good at uncovering scandals that it even got one named after itself : the " spiegel affair . " in 1962 , the magazine published an article about a nato maneuver called " fallex 62 " that also threw a negative light on the state of the bundeswehr , or german army .
the article exposed the lack of in preparedness against the communist threat from the east at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf augstein -lrb- l -rrb- in early 1963 , after being arrested for treason and then released the magazine was accused of treason , with then minister of defense franz josef strauss having augstein , the article 's author , and other editors-in-chief arrested . spiegel 's offices were closed down for weeks ; augstein stayed in jail for months .
the events triggered riots and protests throughout germany , with the public accusing the government of supporting censorship . the affair eventually led to a groundbreaking ruling by the constitutional court , which laid down the basic tenets for freedom of the press for decades to come . having become the voice of conscience , der spiegel 's sales skyrocketed , hitting half a million copies in the following years . then and now since stefan aust took over as editor-in-chief in 1994 , and tried to ensure the magazine kept up with the changing times .
in 1994 it was the first magazine in the world to go online . but he also came under criticism , especially for breaking one of the publications long-standing cardinal rules : never fraternize with the powerful .
besides the critique about pandering to politicians , there are also accusations about more sensationalism and increasing amounts of fluff . still , the magazine manages to both mesmerize and polarize german society .
smart marketing seduces readers into wanting " the whole truth " each monday when they can find the new issue on newsstands , even if it 's been years since der spiegel actually uncovered a big scandal . fabian gartmann -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press council celebrates 50 years monday is the 50th anniversary of the german press council , an independent and self-regulating organization which was based on the british press council model .

" in 1962 , the magazine published an article about a nato maneuver called " fallex 62 " that also threw a negative light on the state of the bundeswehr , or german army .
the article exposed the lack of in preparedness against the communist threat from the east at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf augstein -lrb- l -rrb- in early 1963 , after being arrested for treason and then released the magazine was accused of treason , with then minister of defense franz josef strauss having augstein , the article 's author , and other editors-in-chief arrested . spiegel 's offices were closed down for weeks ; augstein stayed in jail for months .
the events triggered riots and protests throughout germany , with the public accusing the government of supporting censorship . the affair eventually led to a groundbreaking ruling by the constitutional court , which laid down the basic tenets for freedom of the press for decades to come . having become the voice of conscience , der spiegel 's sales skyrocketed , hitting half a million copies in the following years . then and now since stefan aust took over as editor-in-chief in 1994 , and tried to ensure the magazine kept up with the changing times .
in 1994 it was the first magazine in the world to go online . but he also came under criticism , especially for breaking one of the publications long-standing cardinal rules : never fraternize with the powerful .
besides the critique about pandering to politicians , there are also accusations about more sensationalism and increasing amounts of fluff . still , the magazine manages to both mesmerize and polarize german society .
smart marketing seduces readers into wanting " the whole truth " each monday when they can find the new issue on newsstands , even if it 's been years since der spiegel actually uncovered a big scandal . fabian gartmann -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press council celebrates 50 years monday is the 50th anniversary of the german press council , an independent and self-regulating organization which was based on the british press council model .

" our economic systems are based on the same values , " she said .
" we must watch out that we do not drift apart but instead come closer together , where there are clear advantages for both sides . " she said it was her ambition to create a single transatlantic market for investors , with common rules and standards on issues such as intellectual property and financial regulation . merkel wants us support for mideast as europe 's biggest economy and most populous country , germany faces high expectations for the dual presidencies which by coincidence fall together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel plans to push for a solution to the mideast conflict spokesmen for the two leaders said merkel and bush would take up international crises including the stalled middle east peace process , efforts to quell violence in afghanistan and iraq , iran 's disputed nuclear ambitions , instability in lebanon and efforts to decide the final status of kosovo . " the german role on all of these issues will be especially important in 2007 , " white house deputy press secretary scott stanzel said . germany plans to call a meeting " as soon as possible " to revitalize the so-called middle east quartet grouping the eu , the united states , russia and the united nations amid grumbling in europe that washington has allowed the peace process to languish as iraq has consumed its attention . " we would like to see the quartet take on a stronger role , " merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said wednesday . tough talks on energy merkel will also press bush on cutting greenhouse gases amid mounting european frustration at a us refusal to ratify the kyoto protocol , which runs out in 2012 , or on proposing a viable alternative . " of course we must and will talk with the americans about the fact that they too should commit to reducing carbon dioxide -lrb- emissions -rrb- , " merkel told the january issue of the political monthly cicero .
" it is a tough problem to tackle . " the eu wants to forge a common position for negotiations on the successor to the kyoto pact by march .
germany would like the bloc to commit to reducing harmful emissions by 30 percent by 2020 . merkel and bush are also likely to discuss g8 plans to rein in highly speculative hedge funds , which have wrought instability on international financial markets . in a meeting last month , merkel and us treasury secretary henry paulson agreed that action was needed to avert risks and protect investors and that more transparency must be fostered with the g8 which groups britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states and russia . germany , us back on friendly terms the one-day visit to washington will be merkel 's third since she took office almost 14 months ago . she has moved to recalibrate german foreign policy at the helm of a " grand coalition " government grouping her conservative christian union bloc and their chief political rivals , the social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped the good chemistry between merkel and bush will translate into shared political positions merkel has also actively sought to heal the rift with washington she inherited from her predecessor gerhard schröder , whose ties with bush turned frosty over his vocal opposition to the us-led iraq war . carsten voigt , the german government 's coordinator for transatlantic relations , said german-american relations are back on a friendly footing now that the bush administration is apparently seeking a rapprochement with its allies and international partners . " there is a clear tendency now in the united states at least rhetorically to move more in the direction of listening to allies and friends than in the direction to dominate them , and that they move more in the direction of international organizations like the united nations , " voigt told dw-radio .

" we expect that the differences between the two parties are going to permit consumers to expect oil supplies at the prices that have been previously contracted , " he said . russia too said on thursday it did not expect the escalating trade row with belarus to disrupt supplies to europe .

it wants the european union to support its efforts . italy has asked the european union for support in its bid to impose a global moratorium on the death penalty in the wake of saddam hussein 's execution . " i believe this must constitute one of the top commitments of our international efforts because it is urgent to have an initiative to put an end to the barbarianism of the death penalty , " italian foreign minister massimo d 'alema told news agency ansa . in a statement released earlier this week , the italian foreign ministry said the 27-member bloc should discuss a common strategy designed to increase international support for the moratorium at an informal meeting of eu political directorates set for jan 11-12 in dresden , germany . " the recent cases of capital punishments and executions present us with the need to draw the attention of the international community to a renewed initiative designed to promote a moratorium on the death penalty , in view of its complete abolition , " the statement said . italy , a largely catholic country , was shocked by televised images of the former iraqi dictator hanging .

its ambassador in new york , marcello spatafora , has asked officials to put the moratorium on the agenda of the un general assembly . italian politician on hunger strike is hospitalized meanwhile , the head of italy 's radical party , marco pannella , agreed to be hospitalized on thursday as he entered the second week of his hunger strike to push for a worldwide moratorium on capital punishment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 76-year-old pannella has carried out several hunger strikes in the past on wednesday , he had begun accepting water .
but a medical bulletin posted on the radical party 's web site thursday stated that doctors were deeply concerned by pannella 's condition and urged hospitalization . doctors said pannella was dehydrated and faced " potentially irreversible " damage to his kidneys and cardio-vascular system .
he has staged hunger strikes in support of a number of causes over his political career . pannella was a leading advocate of legalized abortion and divorce in the 1970s and 1980s . condemnation is not enough rome 's initiative will involve 85 un member states that signed a non-binding declaration in december against the death penalty , prime minister romano prodi said . " the government is not content with condemning the death penalty , it will act , " prodi said . capital punishment is outlawed in all european union countries , but it is widely practiced in two of the un security council 's five permanent members - china and the united states . iraq deflects italian criticism however , iraq has rebuffed italian criticism , noting that the italians themselves had executed former fascist leader benito mussolini during world war ii .
the dictator was executed by partisans and strung up in a square in milan in 1945 . " they have no right interfering with the affairs of another country , " iraqi government official yaseen majeed told italian newspaper la repubblica . " mussolini 's trial only lasted one minute .

and the waste is unlikely to end soon . german taxpayers have forked out the money to pay for the cost of government workers traveling between berlin and bonn and for special benefits these officials receive , according to a report on thursday in bild newspaper . no other country in the world seems to be willing to afford the doubtful luxury of a seat of government split between two cities .
germany 's unique situation arose from the so-called bonn-berlin law of 1994 which aimed to ensure that bonn would not suffer economically from large parts of the government moving to the new capital , berlin . even today , six ministries , including those for development , defence , environment and health have their headquarters in bonn and only smaller representations in berlin .
clearly , for the media the government and berlin form an inseparable unit .
but what is hardly known is that the majority of government officials still work in bonn - some 10 , 200 , while only a little over 8,000 work in berlin . commuting from one place to another has become a daily phenomenon for german government workers .
some officials say that even with the help of modern telecommunications technology , such as e-mail , video conferencing and instant messaging , traveling between berlin and bonn is an absolute necessity . " sheer madness " " i can use -lrb- those means -rrb- to have contacts with other people in the ministry in bonn , " said rolf eckermann , an official in the development ministry .
but that was not enough , he said .
" it is very difficult to work if the other people are 600 kilometers away .

" i believe that where there 's a will , there 's a way , " wulff has said .
" the real question here is whether those affected on both sides are actually keen on a speedy solution . " opposition green party parliamentary spokesman jürgen trittin has been more direct .
he 's called the dual seat of government ' sheer madness . ' many officials working in bonn have no way of catching up with the speedy flow of information in berlin , the former federal environment minister has said .
trittin says the decision-making process was severely hampered by the dual offices .
at a time when ordinary germans are called upon to tighten their belts , wasting money on constant commuter flights between bonn and berlin is no longer acceptable , he has said . but opponents of a complete move to berlin find it relatively easy to ward off this financial argument .
they refer to a recent study compiled by an independent panel which said that the move would cost up to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- .

and the waste is unlikely to end soon . german taxpayers have forked out the money to pay for the cost of government workers traveling between berlin and bonn and for special benefits these officials receive , according to a report on thursday in bild newspaper . no other country in the world seems to be willing to afford the doubtful luxury of a seat of government split between two cities .
germany 's unique situation arose from the so-called bonn-berlin law of 1994 which aimed to ensure that bonn would not suffer economically from large parts of the government moving to the new capital , berlin . even today , six ministries , including those for development , defence , environment and health have their headquarters in bonn and only smaller representations in berlin .
clearly , for the media the government and berlin form an inseparable unit .
but what is hardly known is that the majority of government officials still work in bonn - some 10 , 200 , while only a little over 8,000 work in berlin . commuting from one place to another has become a daily phenomenon for german government workers .
some officials say that even with the help of modern telecommunications technology , such as e-mail , video conferencing and instant messaging , traveling between berlin and bonn is an absolute necessity . " sheer madness " " i can use -lrb- those means -rrb- to have contacts with other people in the ministry in bonn , " said rolf eckermann , an official in the development ministry .
but that was not enough , he said .
" it is very difficult to work if the other people are 600 kilometers away .
you have modern technology , but you have to also have the personal contact . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's state wo n't feel the brunt of the ministries leaving bonn lower saxony 's conservative state premier , christian wulff , is one of the small number of chancellor angela merkel 's party colleagues who have come out in favor of moving all ministries to berlin . " i believe that where there 's a will , there 's a way , " wulff has said .
" the real question here is whether those affected on both sides are actually keen on a speedy solution . " opposition green party parliamentary spokesman jürgen trittin has been more direct .
he 's called the dual seat of government ' sheer madness . ' many officials working in bonn have no way of catching up with the speedy flow of information in berlin , the former federal environment minister has said .
trittin says the decision-making process was severely hampered by the dual offices .
at a time when ordinary germans are called upon to tighten their belts , wasting money on constant commuter flights between bonn and berlin is no longer acceptable , he has said . but opponents of a complete move to berlin find it relatively easy to ward off this financial argument .
they refer to a recent study compiled by an independent panel which said that the move would cost up to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- .
compared to that , the 196 million euros spent on commuting so far seem like peanuts . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the reichstag : from political to architectural symbol kaiser wilhelm i laid the first stone in 1882 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 04.01.2007 reducing europe 's reliance on russian gas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's gas rows with its neighbors have sparked concerns in europe russia 's energy spat with neighboring belarus has once again highlighed europe 's dependence on russian gas .
german energy expert claudia kemfert talked to dw-world.de about ways to get around the problem . dw-world.de : the gas dispute between russia and belarus shows that moscow has been using the energy issue as a political tool .
what are the consequences for european and german energy policy ? claudia kemfert : both germany and europe realize from this dispute that we are dependent on russian gas exports .
a recurrent theme of european energy policy is to reduce such dependence , which means relying more on our own resources , such as renewable energy , but also nuclear energy .
at the same time we should try and avoid an energy squeeze by looking at tapping energy from other gas-supplying nations . which alternative countries are you referring to ? at the moment , gas is already supplied by norway -lrb- which is not an eu member -rrb- , but there are limits to the supply .
then there are countries such as qatar , which are capable of delivering gas to europe .
pipelines are also being built precisely for this reason .
there is also the potential of liquified natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- .
germany missed the opportunity to construct tankers specially designed to store the gas .
one is being planned at the port of wilhelmshaven , but it wo n't be in service until 2010 .
and one tanker wo n't be enough .
it 's obvious that we have n't prepared well in order to diversify our energy sources . what needs to change at the political level so that we can tap energy from other sources ? in the past we were hugely dependent on one energy provider . russia has been a reliable supplier , no doubt about it , but the kremlin also has a political agenda and puts pressure on the transit countries delivering gas .
we could have a delivery problem when belarus for example , decides to block its pipelines or if russia once again has a gas row with ukraine .
one can not rule out the fact that europe too , for whatever reason , could have a dispute with russia .
that would then threaten energy supplies . for this reason , europe must promote domestic energy providers in order to reduce its dependence on gas imports .
and it 's also important for europe to improve upon its energy effiiciency . you have already mentioned nuclear energy .
should germany rethink its planned phasing out of nuclear power ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy expert claudia kemfert problems could naturally arise when nuclear plants need to be replaced by gas or conventional coal power plants .
with gas-fired plants there is the danger that we could become too heavily dependent on energy imports , for instance from russia.we know that coal plants generate excessive carbon dioxide emissions and greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change . besides , germany is a signatory to the kyoto protocol , so there is a real danger that we may not stick to the promised cuts in co2 emissions .
that 's why we are pushing to extend the life span of safe nuclear plants so that we have enough time to strengthen domestic energy providers .
the focus in the long term should however not be on nuclear energy , but on strenghtening renewable energy sources so that we have a good energy mix . germany has in the past relied hugely on gas deliveries , a fact that has influenced the german position within europe . would a diversification of energy sources change this situation ?
a bit .
as head of the eu presidency , germany will make it clear that it wants to pursue a policy change and diversify its energy . besides , it has to be made further clear that we are aware that there could be delivery problems and that germany would like to see more transparency in the russian energy market .
we have to make it clear to the russians where our interests lie .
but at the same time we should be prepared to accept the russian need to sell gas .
we all have legitimate economic interests , but when political interests begin to play a role , it must be made clear that western europe and germany do n't want to play along . if we seek other energy providers too in future , this could threaten the very good russian-german relations .
claudia kemfert is head of the division " energy , transport , environment " at the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw berlin -rrb- and is chair of environmental economics at berlin 's humboldt university . olga solonari interviewed claudia kemfert -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belarus official : deal reached in row with gazprom belarus said saturday it had reached an agreement with russian gas giant gazprom in their row over gas import prices , but gazprom said nothing had been signed yet .

" in the context of a mild winter and considering the current situation of storage and gas flows , the measures taken by -lrb- eu -rrb- member states were considered appropriate to ensure security of supply , " the eu 's gas coordination group said on thursday . belarus ambassador vladimir senko gave the group , which supervises the security of eu natural gas supplies , a " factual presentation " of the deal with russia , a european commission spokesman said after a brussels meeting . a spokesman for the european commission , ferran tarradellas espuny , told a news briefing thursday he did not think the decision by belarus to impose duty on russian oil imports in transit through the country would affect eu supply security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mild winter in parts of europe has even seen crocuses in bloom in december -lrb- here in dresden -rrb- " the general impression is that measures taken are adequate , but we have considered we have had a mild winter , " tarradellas espuny said . he added that it was the first time belarus had taken part in the gas group meeting in brussels , but russia did not take part even though it had been invited . under the terms of an accord struck late on december 31 with russian energy monopoly gazprom , belarus agreed to pay $ 100 per 1,000 cubic metres of gas from russia , more than double the previous price of $ 45 . minsk also agreed to sell 50 percent of state pipeline operator beltransgaz . russia had threatened to cut its supplies to belarus on jan .
1 unless it agreed to a new supply contract with higher prices .
minsk had threatened to disrupt russian gas exports to western europe that pass through its territory . " no threat to deliveries " the eu is heavily dependent on russian energy .
russia supplied 24 percent of the eu 's total gas needs in 2005 , according to data from european gas federation eurogas , representing 40 percent of all gas imports to the bloc . of that , about 20 percent transits through belarus - mainly to germany , lithuania and poland - and some 80 percent through ukraine , meaning that about five percent of europe 's gas could have been hit . tarradellas espuny said the european commission did not expect the decision by belarus on wednesday to impose duty on russian oil exports to affect either supply or price . " we expect that the differences between the two parties are going to permit consumers to expect oil supplies at the prices that have been previously contracted , " he said . russia too said on thursday it did not expect the escalating trade row with belarus to disrupt supplies to europe .

before you pack your bag , check out what other dw-world.de readers had to say about their german travel experience . cycling in germany is a pleasure .
i spent three weeks riding from berlin to munich following the world cup last summer and i am still reveling in the experience .
it was like getting reacquainted an old friend i thought i already knew everything about , only to find i have only scratched the surface .
pleasures of the trip included traveling without a set itinerary and knowing that with inclement weather or fatigue or curiosity i could throw my bike on a train and zoom to new surprises .
happily , the weather was amazing and , actually , i only took the train once on a side trip to the bike-friendly city of münster .
next time , i look forward to riding in the alps .
i became excited for that adventure reading a book i found in a globetrotter travel store in berlin , an excellent starting point for any traveler to germany - and beyond , for that matter . - matt furber i have visited both england and germany many times and i always return home to the us heavier from germany .

i just come back from a week in leipzig where the town was wearing the best christmas decorations i have seen in my whole life .
it was a fairyland .
people were very kind , organized and clean and german food was of the highest standard . - myriam on our recent visit to germany we had the pleasure of going to the town of jever .
known for its great tasting beer , a tour of the brewery was awesome .
we could n't have been more pleased by the hospitality we received at our stay at the hotel schwarzer adler .
the food was great and the jever beer on tap was well worth the visit . - rich solecki i recently traveled to germany with my brother .
we stayed for two weeks in different parts of it .
i must tell you , everything that one hears about the big glasses of real good beer is all true .
we arrived in munich to pick up the car my brother had just bought , and we stay there for a couple of days .
in december it was a little cold for us but not too cold to spoil the vacation .
as tourists we took photos of every big and old building , and everything else .
we ate in every german restaurant we could find and drank the local beer .
one night at the hofbrauhaus we felt like real bavarians with our big glasses , wheat beer , folk music , long wood benches that could seat 10 people and everybody singing and dancing .
i do n't remember if we had six or seven beers each , but they charged us only 26 euros .
lucky for us , the hotel was nearby .
i love germany !
some say germans are cold - it is better to travel and prove them wrong .

german energy expert claudia kemfert talked to dw-world.de about ways to get around the problem . dw-world.de : the gas dispute between russia and belarus shows that moscow has been using the energy issue as a political tool .
what are the consequences for european and german energy policy ? claudia kemfert : both germany and europe realize from this dispute that we are dependent on russian gas exports .
a recurrent theme of european energy policy is to reduce such dependence , which means relying more on our own resources , such as renewable energy , but also nuclear energy .
at the same time we should try and avoid an energy squeeze by looking at tapping energy from other gas-supplying nations . which alternative countries are you referring to ? at the moment , gas is already supplied by norway -lrb- which is not an eu member -rrb- , but there are limits to the supply .
then there are countries such as qatar , which are capable of delivering gas to europe .
pipelines are also being built precisely for this reason .
there is also the potential of liquified natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- .
germany missed the opportunity to construct tankers specially designed to store the gas .
one is being planned at the port of wilhelmshaven , but it wo n't be in service until 2010 .
and one tanker wo n't be enough .
it 's obvious that we have n't prepared well in order to diversify our energy sources . what needs to change at the political level so that we can tap energy from other sources ? in the past we were hugely dependent on one energy provider . russia has been a reliable supplier , no doubt about it , but the kremlin also has a political agenda and puts pressure on the transit countries delivering gas .
we could have a delivery problem when belarus for example , decides to block its pipelines or if russia once again has a gas row with ukraine .
one can not rule out the fact that europe too , for whatever reason , could have a dispute with russia .
that would then threaten energy supplies . for this reason , europe must promote domestic energy providers in order to reduce its dependence on gas imports .
and it 's also important for europe to improve upon its energy effiiciency . you have already mentioned nuclear energy .
should germany rethink its planned phasing out of nuclear power ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy expert claudia kemfert problems could naturally arise when nuclear plants need to be replaced by gas or conventional coal power plants .
with gas-fired plants there is the danger that we could become too heavily dependent on energy imports , for instance from russia.we know that coal plants generate excessive carbon dioxide emissions and greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change . besides , germany is a signatory to the kyoto protocol , so there is a real danger that we may not stick to the promised cuts in co2 emissions .
that 's why we are pushing to extend the life span of safe nuclear plants so that we have enough time to strengthen domestic energy providers .
the focus in the long term should however not be on nuclear energy , but on strenghtening renewable energy sources so that we have a good energy mix . germany has in the past relied hugely on gas deliveries , a fact that has influenced the german position within europe . would a diversification of energy sources change this situation ?
a bit .
as head of the eu presidency , germany will make it clear that it wants to pursue a policy change and diversify its energy . besides , it has to be made further clear that we are aware that there could be delivery problems and that germany would like to see more transparency in the russian energy market .
we have to make it clear to the russians where our interests lie .
but at the same time we should be prepared to accept the russian need to sell gas .
we all have legitimate economic interests , but when political interests begin to play a role , it must be made clear that western europe and germany do n't want to play along . if we seek other energy providers too in future , this could threaten the very good russian-german relations .
claudia kemfert is head of the division " energy , transport , environment " at the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw berlin -rrb- and is chair of environmental economics at berlin 's humboldt university . olga solonari interviewed claudia kemfert -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belarus official : deal reached in row with gazprom belarus said saturday it had reached an agreement with russian gas giant gazprom in their row over gas import prices , but gazprom said nothing had been signed yet .

german energy expert claudia kemfert talked to dw-world.de about ways to get around the problem . dw-world.de : the gas dispute between russia and belarus shows that moscow has been using the energy issue as a political tool .
what are the consequences for european and german energy policy ? claudia kemfert : both germany and europe realize from this dispute that we are dependent on russian gas exports .
a recurrent theme of european energy policy is to reduce such dependence , which means relying more on our own resources , such as renewable energy , but also nuclear energy .
at the same time we should try and avoid an energy squeeze by looking at tapping energy from other gas-supplying nations . which alternative countries are you referring to ? at the moment , gas is already supplied by norway -lrb- which is not an eu member -rrb- , but there are limits to the supply .
then there are countries such as qatar , which are capable of delivering gas to europe .
pipelines are also being built precisely for this reason .
there is also the potential of liquified natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- .
germany missed the opportunity to construct tankers specially designed to store the gas .
one is being planned at the port of wilhelmshaven , but it wo n't be in service until 2010 .
and one tanker wo n't be enough .
it 's obvious that we have n't prepared well in order to diversify our energy sources . what needs to change at the political level so that we can tap energy from other sources ? in the past we were hugely dependent on one energy provider . russia has been a reliable supplier , no doubt about it , but the kremlin also has a political agenda and puts pressure on the transit countries delivering gas .
we could have a delivery problem when belarus for example , decides to block its pipelines or if russia once again has a gas row with ukraine .
one can not rule out the fact that europe too , for whatever reason , could have a dispute with russia .
that would then threaten energy supplies . for this reason , europe must promote domestic energy providers in order to reduce its dependence on gas imports .
and it 's also important for europe to improve upon its energy effiiciency . you have already mentioned nuclear energy .
should germany rethink its planned phasing out of nuclear power ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy expert claudia kemfert problems could naturally arise when nuclear plants need to be replaced by gas or conventional coal power plants .
with gas-fired plants there is the danger that we could become too heavily dependent on energy imports , for instance from russia.we know that coal plants generate excessive carbon dioxide emissions and greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change . besides , germany is a signatory to the kyoto protocol , so there is a real danger that we may not stick to the promised cuts in co2 emissions .
that 's why we are pushing to extend the life span of safe nuclear plants so that we have enough time to strengthen domestic energy providers .
the focus in the long term should however not be on nuclear energy , but on strenghtening renewable energy sources so that we have a good energy mix . germany has in the past relied hugely on gas deliveries , a fact that has influenced the german position within europe . would a diversification of energy sources change this situation ?
a bit .
as head of the eu presidency , germany will make it clear that it wants to pursue a policy change and diversify its energy . besides , it has to be made further clear that we are aware that there could be delivery problems and that germany would like to see more transparency in the russian energy market .
we have to make it clear to the russians where our interests lie .
but at the same time we should be prepared to accept the russian need to sell gas .
we all have legitimate economic interests , but when political interests begin to play a role , it must be made clear that western europe and germany do n't want to play along . if we seek other energy providers too in future , this could threaten the very good russian-german relations .
claudia kemfert is head of the division " energy , transport , environment " at the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw berlin -rrb- and is chair of environmental economics at berlin 's humboldt university . olga solonari interviewed claudia kemfert -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belarus official : deal reached in row with gazprom belarus said saturday it had reached an agreement with russian gas giant gazprom in their row over gas import prices , but gazprom said nothing had been signed yet .

since then , the magazine has unearthed scandal after scandal , while also occasionally coming under fire itself . for decades , the weekly der spiegel has been the leader in investigative journalism in germany .
as one of germany 's most influential news sources - it held almost a monopoly on forming german public opinion in the postwar decades - the magazine has revealed numerous scandals and shaped politics like no other german media outlet . in the best of times , it has been called the " independent conscience of politicians " that has never let a scandal slip through its fingers . one of most dramatic events spiegel covered was the " flick affair , " a bribery scandal the magazine investigated which eventually forced otto graf lambsdorff , then minister for economic affairs , to resign in 1984 . relentless digging bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der spiegel 's first issue on jan .
4 , 1947 other scandals spiegel unearthed include that of politician uwe barschel in 1987 .
barschel , then the incumbent state premier , allegedly had his opponent spied upon during an election campaign in the hope of finding incriminating evidence to use . spiegel revealed this and other unsavory dealings involving an assistant of barschel 's .
while barschel denied any knowledge of the tactics , he ended up withdrawing from the election race . he was found dead a short time later in a bathtub in geneva , and while some thought it was a suicide , many others speculated he was murdered . the " barschel affair " was just one in a string of scandalous episodes that continued to send shockwaves through the german political and cultural landscape well into the 1990s . der spiegel was at the center of much of it , both as muckraker and maverick . spiegel history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : augstein -lrb- c -rrb- going into court in jan .
1963 der spiegel succeeded the magazine diese woche -lrb- this week -rrb- , which the british press officer john chaloner had founded in 1946 . chaloner , however , was forced to abandon the paper as its critical view of the occupying allied forces in germany did not find favor among them . rudolf augstein , a 23-year-old reporter known for his lively and impertinent writing style at a newspaper in hanover , took over the license for diese woche .
he turned it into der spiegel and became its publisher and editor-in-chief , but maintained diese woche 's style of critically reporting on political and cultural events . the " spiegel affair " spiegel was so good at uncovering scandals that it even got one named after itself : the " spiegel affair . " in 1962 , the magazine published an article about a nato maneuver called " fallex 62 " that also threw a negative light on the state of the bundeswehr , or german army .
the article exposed the lack of in preparedness against the communist threat from the east at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf augstein -lrb- l -rrb- in early 1963 , after being arrested for treason and then released the magazine was accused of treason , with then minister of defense franz josef strauss having augstein , the article 's author , and other editors-in-chief arrested . spiegel 's offices were closed down for weeks ; augstein stayed in jail for months .
the events triggered riots and protests throughout germany , with the public accusing the government of supporting censorship . the affair eventually led to a groundbreaking ruling by the constitutional court , which laid down the basic tenets for freedom of the press for decades to come . having become the voice of conscience , der spiegel 's sales skyrocketed , hitting half a million copies in the following years . then and now since stefan aust took over as editor-in-chief in 1994 , and tried to ensure the magazine kept up with the changing times .
in 1994 it was the first magazine in the world to go online . but he also came under criticism , especially for breaking one of the publications long-standing cardinal rules : never fraternize with the powerful .
besides the critique about pandering to politicians , there are also accusations about more sensationalism and increasing amounts of fluff . still , the magazine manages to both mesmerize and polarize german society .
smart marketing seduces readers into wanting " the whole truth " each monday when they can find the new issue on newsstands , even if it 's been years since der spiegel actually uncovered a big scandal . fabian gartmann -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press council celebrates 50 years monday is the 50th anniversary of the german press council , an independent and self-regulating organization which was based on the british press council model .

since then , the magazine has unearthed scandal after scandal , while also occasionally coming under fire itself . for decades , the weekly der spiegel has been the leader in investigative journalism in germany .
as one of germany 's most influential news sources - it held almost a monopoly on forming german public opinion in the postwar decades - the magazine has revealed numerous scandals and shaped politics like no other german media outlet . in the best of times , it has been called the " independent conscience of politicians " that has never let a scandal slip through its fingers . one of most dramatic events spiegel covered was the " flick affair , " a bribery scandal the magazine investigated which eventually forced otto graf lambsdorff , then minister for economic affairs , to resign in 1984 . relentless digging bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der spiegel 's first issue on jan .
4 , 1947 other scandals spiegel unearthed include that of politician uwe barschel in 1987 .
barschel , then the incumbent state premier , allegedly had his opponent spied upon during an election campaign in the hope of finding incriminating evidence to use . spiegel revealed this and other unsavory dealings involving an assistant of barschel 's .
while barschel denied any knowledge of the tactics , he ended up withdrawing from the election race . he was found dead a short time later in a bathtub in geneva , and while some thought it was a suicide , many others speculated he was murdered . the " barschel affair " was just one in a string of scandalous episodes that continued to send shockwaves through the german political and cultural landscape well into the 1990s . der spiegel was at the center of much of it , both as muckraker and maverick . spiegel history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : augstein -lrb- c -rrb- going into court in jan .
1963 der spiegel succeeded the magazine diese woche -lrb- this week -rrb- , which the british press officer john chaloner had founded in 1946 . chaloner , however , was forced to abandon the paper as its critical view of the occupying allied forces in germany did not find favor among them . rudolf augstein , a 23-year-old reporter known for his lively and impertinent writing style at a newspaper in hanover , took over the license for diese woche .
he turned it into der spiegel and became its publisher and editor-in-chief , but maintained diese woche 's style of critically reporting on political and cultural events . the " spiegel affair " spiegel was so good at uncovering scandals that it even got one named after itself : the " spiegel affair . " in 1962 , the magazine published an article about a nato maneuver called " fallex 62 " that also threw a negative light on the state of the bundeswehr , or german army .
the article exposed the lack of in preparedness against the communist threat from the east at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf augstein -lrb- l -rrb- in early 1963 , after being arrested for treason and then released the magazine was accused of treason , with then minister of defense franz josef strauss having augstein , the article 's author , and other editors-in-chief arrested . spiegel 's offices were closed down for weeks ; augstein stayed in jail for months .
the events triggered riots and protests throughout germany , with the public accusing the government of supporting censorship . the affair eventually led to a groundbreaking ruling by the constitutional court , which laid down the basic tenets for freedom of the press for decades to come . having become the voice of conscience , der spiegel 's sales skyrocketed , hitting half a million copies in the following years . then and now since stefan aust took over as editor-in-chief in 1994 , and tried to ensure the magazine kept up with the changing times .
in 1994 it was the first magazine in the world to go online . but he also came under criticism , especially for breaking one of the publications long-standing cardinal rules : never fraternize with the powerful .
besides the critique about pandering to politicians , there are also accusations about more sensationalism and increasing amounts of fluff . still , the magazine manages to both mesmerize and polarize german society .

" our economic systems are based on the same values , " she said .
" we must watch out that we do not drift apart but instead come closer together , where there are clear advantages for both sides . " she said it was her ambition to create a single transatlantic market for investors , with common rules and standards on issues such as intellectual property and financial regulation . merkel wants us support for mideast as europe 's biggest economy and most populous country , germany faces high expectations for the dual presidencies which by coincidence fall together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel plans to push for a solution to the mideast conflict spokesmen for the two leaders said merkel and bush would take up international crises including the stalled middle east peace process , efforts to quell violence in afghanistan and iraq , iran 's disputed nuclear ambitions , instability in lebanon and efforts to decide the final status of kosovo . " the german role on all of these issues will be especially important in 2007 , " white house deputy press secretary scott stanzel said . germany plans to call a meeting " as soon as possible " to revitalize the so-called middle east quartet grouping the eu , the united states , russia and the united nations amid grumbling in europe that washington has allowed the peace process to languish as iraq has consumed its attention . " we would like to see the quartet take on a stronger role , " merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said wednesday . tough talks on energy merkel will also press bush on cutting greenhouse gases amid mounting european frustration at a us refusal to ratify the kyoto protocol , which runs out in 2012 , or on proposing a viable alternative . " of course we must and will talk with the americans about the fact that they too should commit to reducing carbon dioxide -lrb- emissions -rrb- , " merkel told the january issue of the political monthly cicero .
" it is a tough problem to tackle . " the eu wants to forge a common position for negotiations on the successor to the kyoto pact by march .
germany would like the bloc to commit to reducing harmful emissions by 30 percent by 2020 . merkel and bush are also likely to discuss g8 plans to rein in highly speculative hedge funds , which have wrought instability on international financial markets . in a meeting last month , merkel and us treasury secretary henry paulson agreed that action was needed to avert risks and protect investors and that more transparency must be fostered with the g8 which groups britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states and russia . germany , us back on friendly terms the one-day visit to washington will be merkel 's third since she took office almost 14 months ago . she has moved to recalibrate german foreign policy at the helm of a " grand coalition " government grouping her conservative christian union bloc and their chief political rivals , the social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped the good chemistry between merkel and bush will translate into shared political positions merkel has also actively sought to heal the rift with washington she inherited from her predecessor gerhard schröder , whose ties with bush turned frosty over his vocal opposition to the us-led iraq war . carsten voigt , the german government 's coordinator for transatlantic relations , said german-american relations are back on a friendly footing now that the bush administration is apparently seeking a rapprochement with its allies and international partners . " there is a clear tendency now in the united states at least rhetorically to move more in the direction of listening to allies and friends than in the direction to dominate them , and that they move more in the direction of international organizations like the united nations , " voigt told dw-radio . " everybody in europe is now looking whether these rhetorical changes in washington mean changes in substance , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel seeks closer us-eu economic cooperation in front of a trip to washington , german chancellor angela merkel said in an interview published on wednesday she wants to see " ever-closer economic cooperation " between the european union and the united states .

it also calls for improved police cooperation . germany will push for greater cooperation in european interior policies during its eu presidency , said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
international terrorism , organized crime and illegal migration were increasingly threatening european security , he said .
" all member states must be aware that they would be overtaxed to cope with global security challenges all on their own , " schäuble said wednesday at the presentation of germany 's security program for its eu presidency . schäuble said the eu 's police agency europol , in particular needed strengthening .
with additional powers , europol could fight international terrorism and cross-border crime more effectively , he said . " in the future , europol should be responsible for fighting all forms of serious cross-border crime , such as a serial killers active in more than one member state or major disruptions to internal security caused by hooligans , " schäuble told reporters . schäuble said he supported the european commission 's proposal last month to strengthen europol 's role .
the so-called europol convention needed to be transferred into the eu 's legal framework , he said .
europol was established in 1992 and took up its full activities in 1999 .
over the past years , critics have said it lacks the powers necessary to handle new threats in the growing eu . eu states should share criminal data another priority for germany is improving police cooperation between member states , schäuble said .

it would allow them to ask other states for police reinforcements in cases of serious accidents or major international sport competitions , as it did during last year 's soccer world cup in germany . the german security program for its eu presidency also called for closer collaboration on monitoring and analyzing web sites used by terrorist organizations , as well as better protection for critical infrastructure against a terrorist attack . finding a common voice in eu foreign policy the ministry 's security program said that the distinctions between domestic and foreign security were disappearing .
threats were often rooted outside of the eu .
member states therefore must work even more closely together on foreign relations , the paper said . maintaining a dialogue with its neighbors , with the united states , russia and other third countries was in the basic security interest of the eu , the program said .
in particular , the strategically important transatlantic relations needed to be strengthened .
challenges such as fighting international terrorism affected the united states and europe equally and could be dealt with only by working together , the ministry said . germany will host an informal meeting of eu justice and interior ministers in dresden from january 14 to 16 , 2007 to discuss its recommendations . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german global clout grows as berlin heads eu , g8 germany 's growing economic , political and military role is under the spotlight in 2007 with berlin holding the rotating presidencies of both the european union and the g8 club of industrial nations .

and the waste is unlikely to end soon . german taxpayers have forked out the money to pay for the cost of government workers traveling between berlin and bonn and for special benefits these officials receive , according to a report on thursday in bild newspaper . no other country in the world seems to be willing to afford the doubtful luxury of a seat of government split between two cities .
germany 's unique situation arose from the so-called bonn-berlin law of 1994 which aimed to ensure that bonn would not suffer economically from large parts of the government moving to the new capital , berlin . even today , six ministries , including those for development , defence , environment and health have their headquarters in bonn and only smaller representations in berlin .
clearly , for the media the government and berlin form an inseparable unit .
but what is hardly known is that the majority of government officials still work in bonn - some 10 , 200 , while only a little over 8,000 work in berlin . commuting from one place to another has become a daily phenomenon for german government workers .
some officials say that even with the help of modern telecommunications technology , such as e-mail , video conferencing and instant messaging , traveling between berlin and bonn is an absolute necessity . " sheer madness " " i can use -lrb- those means -rrb- to have contacts with other people in the ministry in bonn , " said rolf eckermann , an official in the development ministry .
but that was not enough , he said .
" it is very difficult to work if the other people are 600 kilometers away .
you have modern technology , but you have to also have the personal contact . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's state wo n't feel the brunt of the ministries leaving bonn lower saxony 's conservative state premier , christian wulff , is one of the small number of chancellor angela merkel 's party colleagues who have come out in favor of moving all ministries to berlin . " i believe that where there 's a will , there 's a way , " wulff has said .
" the real question here is whether those affected on both sides are actually keen on a speedy solution . " opposition green party parliamentary spokesman jürgen trittin has been more direct .
he 's called the dual seat of government ' sheer madness . ' many officials working in bonn have no way of catching up with the speedy flow of information in berlin , the former federal environment minister has said .
trittin says the decision-making process was severely hampered by the dual offices .
at a time when ordinary germans are called upon to tighten their belts , wasting money on constant commuter flights between bonn and berlin is no longer acceptable , he has said . but opponents of a complete move to berlin find it relatively easy to ward off this financial argument .
they refer to a recent study compiled by an independent panel which said that the move would cost up to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- .
compared to that , the 196 million euros spent on commuting so far seem like peanuts . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the reichstag : from political to architectural symbol kaiser wilhelm i laid the first stone in 1882 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's state wo n't feel the brunt of the ministries leaving bonn lower saxony 's conservative state premier , christian wulff , is one of the small number of chancellor angela merkel 's party colleagues who have come out in favor of moving all ministries to berlin . " i believe that where there 's a will , there 's a way , " wulff has said .
" the real question here is whether those affected on both sides are actually keen on a speedy solution . " opposition green party parliamentary spokesman jürgen trittin has been more direct .
he 's called the dual seat of government ' sheer madness . ' many officials working in bonn have no way of catching up with the speedy flow of information in berlin , the former federal environment minister has said .
trittin says the decision-making process was severely hampered by the dual offices .
at a time when ordinary germans are called upon to tighten their belts , wasting money on constant commuter flights between bonn and berlin is no longer acceptable , he has said . but opponents of a complete move to berlin find it relatively easy to ward off this financial argument .
they refer to a recent study compiled by an independent panel which said that the move would cost up to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- .
compared to that , the 196 million euros spent on commuting so far seem like peanuts . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the reichstag : from political to architectural symbol kaiser wilhelm i laid the first stone in 1882 .

" in the context of a mild winter and considering the current situation of storage and gas flows , the measures taken by -lrb- eu -rrb- member states were considered appropriate to ensure security of supply , " the eu 's gas coordination group said on thursday . belarus ambassador vladimir senko gave the group , which supervises the security of eu natural gas supplies , a " factual presentation " of the deal with russia , a european commission spokesman said after a brussels meeting . a spokesman for the european commission , ferran tarradellas espuny , told a news briefing thursday he did not think the decision by belarus to impose duty on russian oil imports in transit through the country would affect eu supply security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mild winter in parts of europe has even seen crocuses in bloom in december -lrb- here in dresden -rrb- " the general impression is that measures taken are adequate , but we have considered we have had a mild winter , " tarradellas espuny said . he added that it was the first time belarus had taken part in the gas group meeting in brussels , but russia did not take part even though it had been invited . under the terms of an accord struck late on december 31 with russian energy monopoly gazprom , belarus agreed to pay $ 100 per 1,000 cubic metres of gas from russia , more than double the previous price of $ 45 . minsk also agreed to sell 50 percent of state pipeline operator beltransgaz . russia had threatened to cut its supplies to belarus on jan .
1 unless it agreed to a new supply contract with higher prices .
minsk had threatened to disrupt russian gas exports to western europe that pass through its territory . " no threat to deliveries " the eu is heavily dependent on russian energy .
russia supplied 24 percent of the eu 's total gas needs in 2005 , according to data from european gas federation eurogas , representing 40 percent of all gas imports to the bloc . of that , about 20 percent transits through belarus - mainly to germany , lithuania and poland - and some 80 percent through ukraine , meaning that about five percent of europe 's gas could have been hit . tarradellas espuny said the european commission did not expect the decision by belarus on wednesday to impose duty on russian oil exports to affect either supply or price . " we expect that the differences between the two parties are going to permit consumers to expect oil supplies at the prices that have been previously contracted , " he said . russia too said on thursday it did not expect the escalating trade row with belarus to disrupt supplies to europe .

it also calls for improved police cooperation . germany will push for greater cooperation in european interior policies during its eu presidency , said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
international terrorism , organized crime and illegal migration were increasingly threatening european security , he said .
" all member states must be aware that they would be overtaxed to cope with global security challenges all on their own , " schäuble said wednesday at the presentation of germany 's security program for its eu presidency . schäuble said the eu 's police agency europol , in particular needed strengthening .
with additional powers , europol could fight international terrorism and cross-border crime more effectively , he said . " in the future , europol should be responsible for fighting all forms of serious cross-border crime , such as a serial killers active in more than one member state or major disruptions to internal security caused by hooligans , " schäuble told reporters . schäuble said he supported the european commission 's proposal last month to strengthen europol 's role .
the so-called europol convention needed to be transferred into the eu 's legal framework , he said .
europol was established in 1992 and took up its full activities in 1999 .
over the past years , critics have said it lacks the powers necessary to handle new threats in the growing eu . eu states should share criminal data another priority for germany is improving police cooperation between member states , schäuble said . " criminals must not have a chance to escape prosecution simply by crossing a border , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 04.01.2007 dual seat of german government costs taxpayers dearly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellery has moved to berlin , but six ministries are still in bonn germany has over the past decade spent 196 million euros -lrb- $ 260 million -rrb- to maintain ministry offices in both berlin and bonn , according to a report .
and the waste is unlikely to end soon . german taxpayers have forked out the money to pay for the cost of government workers traveling between berlin and bonn and for special benefits these officials receive , according to a report on thursday in bild newspaper . no other country in the world seems to be willing to afford the doubtful luxury of a seat of government split between two cities .
germany 's unique situation arose from the so-called bonn-berlin law of 1994 which aimed to ensure that bonn would not suffer economically from large parts of the government moving to the new capital , berlin . even today , six ministries , including those for development , defence , environment and health have their headquarters in bonn and only smaller representations in berlin .
clearly , for the media the government and berlin form an inseparable unit .
but what is hardly known is that the majority of government officials still work in bonn - some 10 , 200 , while only a little over 8,000 work in berlin . commuting from one place to another has become a daily phenomenon for german government workers .
some officials say that even with the help of modern telecommunications technology , such as e-mail , video conferencing and instant messaging , traveling between berlin and bonn is an absolute necessity . " sheer madness " " i can use -lrb- those means -rrb- to have contacts with other people in the ministry in bonn , " said rolf eckermann , an official in the development ministry .
but that was not enough , he said .
" it is very difficult to work if the other people are 600 kilometers away .
you have modern technology , but you have to also have the personal contact . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's state wo n't feel the brunt of the ministries leaving bonn lower saxony 's conservative state premier , christian wulff , is one of the small number of chancellor angela merkel 's party colleagues who have come out in favor of moving all ministries to berlin . " i believe that where there 's a will , there 's a way , " wulff has said .
" the real question here is whether those affected on both sides are actually keen on a speedy solution . " opposition green party parliamentary spokesman jürgen trittin has been more direct .
he 's called the dual seat of government ' sheer madness . ' many officials working in bonn have no way of catching up with the speedy flow of information in berlin , the former federal environment minister has said .
trittin says the decision-making process was severely hampered by the dual offices .
at a time when ordinary germans are called upon to tighten their belts , wasting money on constant commuter flights between bonn and berlin is no longer acceptable , he has said . but opponents of a complete move to berlin find it relatively easy to ward off this financial argument .
they refer to a recent study compiled by an independent panel which said that the move would cost up to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- .
compared to that , the 196 million euros spent on commuting so far seem like peanuts . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the reichstag : from political to architectural symbol kaiser wilhelm i laid the first stone in 1882 .
twelve years later , berlin 's reichstag , designed by paul wallot , was finished .
these days , there is hardly any other building in germany with such a storied existence .
-lrb- 31.07.2006 -rrb- questions arise about the future of " sexy but poor " berlin germany 's highest court ruled thursday that berlin is not getting a helping hand from the federal government to put its financial house in order .
what does that mean for the capital ? -lrb- 19.10.2006 -rrb- germany 's divided capital berlin became the german capital after reunification , but many civil servants remained in the old one , bonn .
despite a new debate about the costs of the divide , it 's likely to stay that way - at least for now .

while barschel denied any knowledge of the tactics , he ended up withdrawing from the election race . he was found dead a short time later in a bathtub in geneva , and while some thought it was a suicide , many others speculated he was murdered . the " barschel affair " was just one in a string of scandalous episodes that continued to send shockwaves through the german political and cultural landscape well into the 1990s . der spiegel was at the center of much of it , both as muckraker and maverick . spiegel history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : augstein -lrb- c -rrb- going into court in jan .

he turned it into der spiegel and became its publisher and editor-in-chief , but maintained diese woche 's style of critically reporting on political and cultural events . the " spiegel affair " spiegel was so good at uncovering scandals that it even got one named after itself : the " spiegel affair .

the events triggered riots and protests throughout germany , with the public accusing the government of supporting censorship . the affair eventually led to a groundbreaking ruling by the constitutional court , which laid down the basic tenets for freedom of the press for decades to come . having become the voice of conscience , der spiegel 's sales skyrocketed , hitting half a million copies in the following years . then and now since stefan aust took over as editor-in-chief in 1994 , and tried to ensure the magazine kept up with the changing times .

the tax will cause headaches for northern european refiners and do further damage to deteriorating relations between belarus and russia . belarusian prime minister sergei sidorsky said wednesday the duty would be $ 45 per ton of oil , which was being imposed retroactively from jan .
1 .
the tax comes in retaliation for moscow cutting subsidies on energy supplies to belarus . " we have done everything that -lrb- russia -rrb- asked us to do , and today the time has come to demand that -lrb- russia -rrb- keeps its promises , " president alexander lukashenko told a cabinet meeting on wednesday .
" if it does not , we are within our rights to act in turn .
by that i mean to raise the question of the transit of oil through belarus , payment for this transit , payment for the land that is used for oil and gas pipelines , russian properties here , " the authoritarian leader said . market watchers said the duty would not affect world oil prices or cause shortages , but it could cause short-term disruptions to the supplies as refiners in germany and poland looked for cheaper alternative supplies , reuters reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dispute has again made northern europe jittery about secure energy supplies under the terms of a gas deal struck late on dec .
31 , belarus reluctantly agreed to pay $ 100 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas from russia , more than double the previous price of $ 45 .
belarus , which is economically dependent on russia , also agreed to sell 50 percent of state pipeline operator beltransgaz to russia 's state-run gazprom as part of the deal .
tense relations moscow had threatened to cut its supplies to belarus on jan .
1 unless it agreed to the new supply contract , while belarus had threatened to disrupt russian exports to western europe which pass through its territory . this had caused concern in the european union , which imports five percent of its gas supplies through belarus from russia - most of it delivered to germany and poland - and revived memories of gas shortages this time last year caused by a dispute between ukraine and russia . lukashenko said wednesday he had told his officials to sign the deal with moscow " because russian leaders promised us to find a solution on oil . "
sugar dispute in another development , exports of belarusian sugar to russia have been suspended since jan .
1 , said the head of the state-run agricultural production concern belgospishcheprom . " this situation is the result of a series of restrictive measures by the russian customs service , " ivan danchenko told reporters in minsk . danchenko denied rumors that that belarusian companies were sending south american-produced cane sugar to russia disguised as beet sugar to avoid customs duties . coming in the wake of a recently announced hike in russian duties on oil exports to belarus , sunday 's deal on gas appears to mark the end of an era of cheap energy supplies from russia that have subsidized the belarusian economy since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reducing europe 's reliance on russian gas russia 's energy spat with neighboring belarus has once again highlighed europe 's dependence on russian gas .

german energy expert claudia kemfert talked to dw-world.de about ways to get around the problem . dw-world.de : the gas dispute between russia and belarus shows that moscow has been using the energy issue as a political tool .
what are the consequences for european and german energy policy ? claudia kemfert : both germany and europe realize from this dispute that we are dependent on russian gas exports .
a recurrent theme of european energy policy is to reduce such dependence , which means relying more on our own resources , such as renewable energy , but also nuclear energy .
at the same time we should try and avoid an energy squeeze by looking at tapping energy from other gas-supplying nations . which alternative countries are you referring to ? at the moment , gas is already supplied by norway -lrb- which is not an eu member -rrb- , but there are limits to the supply .
then there are countries such as qatar , which are capable of delivering gas to europe .
pipelines are also being built precisely for this reason .
there is also the potential of liquified natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- .
germany missed the opportunity to construct tankers specially designed to store the gas .
one is being planned at the port of wilhelmshaven , but it wo n't be in service until 2010 .
and one tanker wo n't be enough .
it 's obvious that we have n't prepared well in order to diversify our energy sources . what needs to change at the political level so that we can tap energy from other sources ? in the past we were hugely dependent on one energy provider . russia has been a reliable supplier , no doubt about it , but the kremlin also has a political agenda and puts pressure on the transit countries delivering gas .
we could have a delivery problem when belarus for example , decides to block its pipelines or if russia once again has a gas row with ukraine .
one can not rule out the fact that europe too , for whatever reason , could have a dispute with russia .
that would then threaten energy supplies . for this reason , europe must promote domestic energy providers in order to reduce its dependence on gas imports .
and it 's also important for europe to improve upon its energy effiiciency . you have already mentioned nuclear energy .
should germany rethink its planned phasing out of nuclear power ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy expert claudia kemfert problems could naturally arise when nuclear plants need to be replaced by gas or conventional coal power plants .
with gas-fired plants there is the danger that we could become too heavily dependent on energy imports , for instance from russia.we know that coal plants generate excessive carbon dioxide emissions and greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change . besides , germany is a signatory to the kyoto protocol , so there is a real danger that we may not stick to the promised cuts in co2 emissions .
that 's why we are pushing to extend the life span of safe nuclear plants so that we have enough time to strengthen domestic energy providers .

german energy expert claudia kemfert talked to dw-world.de about ways to get around the problem . dw-world.de : the gas dispute between russia and belarus shows that moscow has been using the energy issue as a political tool .
what are the consequences for european and german energy policy ? claudia kemfert : both germany and europe realize from this dispute that we are dependent on russian gas exports .
a recurrent theme of european energy policy is to reduce such dependence , which means relying more on our own resources , such as renewable energy , but also nuclear energy .
at the same time we should try and avoid an energy squeeze by looking at tapping energy from other gas-supplying nations . which alternative countries are you referring to ? at the moment , gas is already supplied by norway -lrb- which is not an eu member -rrb- , but there are limits to the supply .
then there are countries such as qatar , which are capable of delivering gas to europe .
pipelines are also being built precisely for this reason .
there is also the potential of liquified natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- .
germany missed the opportunity to construct tankers specially designed to store the gas .
one is being planned at the port of wilhelmshaven , but it wo n't be in service until 2010 .
and one tanker wo n't be enough .
it 's obvious that we have n't prepared well in order to diversify our energy sources . what needs to change at the political level so that we can tap energy from other sources ? in the past we were hugely dependent on one energy provider . russia has been a reliable supplier , no doubt about it , but the kremlin also has a political agenda and puts pressure on the transit countries delivering gas .
we could have a delivery problem when belarus for example , decides to block its pipelines or if russia once again has a gas row with ukraine .
one can not rule out the fact that europe too , for whatever reason , could have a dispute with russia .
that would then threaten energy supplies . for this reason , europe must promote domestic energy providers in order to reduce its dependence on gas imports .
and it 's also important for europe to improve upon its energy effiiciency . you have already mentioned nuclear energy .
should germany rethink its planned phasing out of nuclear power ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy expert claudia kemfert problems could naturally arise when nuclear plants need to be replaced by gas or conventional coal power plants .
with gas-fired plants there is the danger that we could become too heavily dependent on energy imports , for instance from russia.we know that coal plants generate excessive carbon dioxide emissions and greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change . besides , germany is a signatory to the kyoto protocol , so there is a real danger that we may not stick to the promised cuts in co2 emissions .
that 's why we are pushing to extend the life span of safe nuclear plants so that we have enough time to strengthen domestic energy providers .
the focus in the long term should however not be on nuclear energy , but on strenghtening renewable energy sources so that we have a good energy mix . germany has in the past relied hugely on gas deliveries , a fact that has influenced the german position within europe . would a diversification of energy sources change this situation ?

it also calls for improved police cooperation . germany will push for greater cooperation in european interior policies during its eu presidency , said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
international terrorism , organized crime and illegal migration were increasingly threatening european security , he said .
" all member states must be aware that they would be overtaxed to cope with global security challenges all on their own , " schäuble said wednesday at the presentation of germany 's security program for its eu presidency . schäuble said the eu 's police agency europol , in particular needed strengthening .
with additional powers , europol could fight international terrorism and cross-border crime more effectively , he said . " in the future , europol should be responsible for fighting all forms of serious cross-border crime , such as a serial killers active in more than one member state or major disruptions to internal security caused by hooligans , " schäuble told reporters . schäuble said he supported the european commission 's proposal last month to strengthen europol 's role .
the so-called europol convention needed to be transferred into the eu 's legal framework , he said .
europol was established in 1992 and took up its full activities in 1999 .
over the past years , critics have said it lacks the powers necessary to handle new threats in the growing eu . eu states should share criminal data another priority for germany is improving police cooperation between member states , schäuble said . " criminals must not have a chance to escape prosecution simply by crossing a border , " he said .
germany will work to have the provisions of the treaty of prüm turned into eu law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police had help from britain during the world cup this agreement aims to establish an infrastructure to step up cross-border cooperation , particularly to combat terrorism , cross-border crime and illegal immigration .
it was adopted by austria , belgium , france , germany , luxembourg , spain and the netherlands in 2005 . the treaty would give all member states access to dna and fingerprint data , as well as vehicle registries , for example .
it would allow them to ask other states for police reinforcements in cases of serious accidents or major international sport competitions , as it did during last year 's soccer world cup in germany . the german security program for its eu presidency also called for closer collaboration on monitoring and analyzing web sites used by terrorist organizations , as well as better protection for critical infrastructure against a terrorist attack . finding a common voice in eu foreign policy the ministry 's security program said that the distinctions between domestic and foreign security were disappearing .
threats were often rooted outside of the eu .
member states therefore must work even more closely together on foreign relations , the paper said . maintaining a dialogue with its neighbors , with the united states , russia and other third countries was in the basic security interest of the eu , the program said .
in particular , the strategically important transatlantic relations needed to be strengthened .
challenges such as fighting international terrorism affected the united states and europe equally and could be dealt with only by working together , the ministry said . germany will host an informal meeting of eu justice and interior ministers in dresden from january 14 to 16 , 2007 to discuss its recommendations . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german global clout grows as berlin heads eu , g8 germany 's growing economic , political and military role is under the spotlight in 2007 with berlin holding the rotating presidencies of both the european union and the g8 club of industrial nations .

the tax will cause headaches for northern european refiners and do further damage to deteriorating relations between belarus and russia . belarusian prime minister sergei sidorsky said wednesday the duty would be $ 45 per ton of oil , which was being imposed retroactively from jan .
1 .
the tax comes in retaliation for moscow cutting subsidies on energy supplies to belarus . " we have done everything that -lrb- russia -rrb- asked us to do , and today the time has come to demand that -lrb- russia -rrb- keeps its promises , " president alexander lukashenko told a cabinet meeting on wednesday .
" if it does not , we are within our rights to act in turn .
by that i mean to raise the question of the transit of oil through belarus , payment for this transit , payment for the land that is used for oil and gas pipelines , russian properties here , " the authoritarian leader said . market watchers said the duty would not affect world oil prices or cause shortages , but it could cause short-term disruptions to the supplies as refiners in germany and poland looked for cheaper alternative supplies , reuters reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dispute has again made northern europe jittery about secure energy supplies under the terms of a gas deal struck late on dec .
31 , belarus reluctantly agreed to pay $ 100 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas from russia , more than double the previous price of $ 45 .
belarus , which is economically dependent on russia , also agreed to sell 50 percent of state pipeline operator beltransgaz to russia 's state-run gazprom as part of the deal .
tense relations moscow had threatened to cut its supplies to belarus on jan .
1 unless it agreed to the new supply contract , while belarus had threatened to disrupt russian exports to western europe which pass through its territory . this had caused concern in the european union , which imports five percent of its gas supplies through belarus from russia - most of it delivered to germany and poland - and revived memories of gas shortages this time last year caused by a dispute between ukraine and russia . lukashenko said wednesday he had told his officials to sign the deal with moscow " because russian leaders promised us to find a solution on oil . "
sugar dispute in another development , exports of belarusian sugar to russia have been suspended since jan .
1 , said the head of the state-run agricultural production concern belgospishcheprom . " this situation is the result of a series of restrictive measures by the russian customs service , " ivan danchenko told reporters in minsk . danchenko denied rumors that that belarusian companies were sending south american-produced cane sugar to russia disguised as beet sugar to avoid customs duties . coming in the wake of a recently announced hike in russian duties on oil exports to belarus , sunday 's deal on gas appears to mark the end of an era of cheap energy supplies from russia that have subsidized the belarusian economy since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reducing europe 's reliance on russian gas russia 's energy spat with neighboring belarus has once again highlighed europe 's dependence on russian gas .

german energy expert claudia kemfert talked to dw-world.de about ways to get around the problem . dw-world.de : the gas dispute between russia and belarus shows that moscow has been using the energy issue as a political tool .
what are the consequences for european and german energy policy ? claudia kemfert : both germany and europe realize from this dispute that we are dependent on russian gas exports .
a recurrent theme of european energy policy is to reduce such dependence , which means relying more on our own resources , such as renewable energy , but also nuclear energy .
at the same time we should try and avoid an energy squeeze by looking at tapping energy from other gas-supplying nations . which alternative countries are you referring to ? at the moment , gas is already supplied by norway -lrb- which is not an eu member -rrb- , but there are limits to the supply .
then there are countries such as qatar , which are capable of delivering gas to europe .
pipelines are also being built precisely for this reason .
there is also the potential of liquified natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- .
germany missed the opportunity to construct tankers specially designed to store the gas .
one is being planned at the port of wilhelmshaven , but it wo n't be in service until 2010 .
and one tanker wo n't be enough .
it 's obvious that we have n't prepared well in order to diversify our energy sources . what needs to change at the political level so that we can tap energy from other sources ? in the past we were hugely dependent on one energy provider . russia has been a reliable supplier , no doubt about it , but the kremlin also has a political agenda and puts pressure on the transit countries delivering gas .
we could have a delivery problem when belarus for example , decides to block its pipelines or if russia once again has a gas row with ukraine .
one can not rule out the fact that europe too , for whatever reason , could have a dispute with russia .
that would then threaten energy supplies . for this reason , europe must promote domestic energy providers in order to reduce its dependence on gas imports .
and it 's also important for europe to improve upon its energy effiiciency . you have already mentioned nuclear energy .
should germany rethink its planned phasing out of nuclear power ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy expert claudia kemfert problems could naturally arise when nuclear plants need to be replaced by gas or conventional coal power plants .
with gas-fired plants there is the danger that we could become too heavily dependent on energy imports , for instance from russia.we know that coal plants generate excessive carbon dioxide emissions and greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change . besides , germany is a signatory to the kyoto protocol , so there is a real danger that we may not stick to the promised cuts in co2 emissions .
that 's why we are pushing to extend the life span of safe nuclear plants so that we have enough time to strengthen domestic energy providers .
the focus in the long term should however not be on nuclear energy , but on strenghtening renewable energy sources so that we have a good energy mix . germany has in the past relied hugely on gas deliveries , a fact that has influenced the german position within europe . would a diversification of energy sources change this situation ?
a bit .
as head of the eu presidency , germany will make it clear that it wants to pursue a policy change and diversify its energy . besides , it has to be made further clear that we are aware that there could be delivery problems and that germany would like to see more transparency in the russian energy market .
we have to make it clear to the russians where our interests lie .
but at the same time we should be prepared to accept the russian need to sell gas .
we all have legitimate economic interests , but when political interests begin to play a role , it must be made clear that western europe and germany do n't want to play along . if we seek other energy providers too in future , this could threaten the very good russian-german relations .
claudia kemfert is head of the division " energy , transport , environment " at the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw berlin -rrb- and is chair of environmental economics at berlin 's humboldt university . olga solonari interviewed claudia kemfert -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belarus official : deal reached in row with gazprom belarus said saturday it had reached an agreement with russian gas giant gazprom in their row over gas import prices , but gazprom said nothing had been signed yet .

and the waste is unlikely to end soon . german taxpayers have forked out the money to pay for the cost of government workers traveling between berlin and bonn and for special benefits these officials receive , according to a report on thursday in bild newspaper . no other country in the world seems to be willing to afford the doubtful luxury of a seat of government split between two cities .
germany 's unique situation arose from the so-called bonn-berlin law of 1994 which aimed to ensure that bonn would not suffer economically from large parts of the government moving to the new capital , berlin . even today , six ministries , including those for development , defence , environment and health have their headquarters in bonn and only smaller representations in berlin .
clearly , for the media the government and berlin form an inseparable unit .
but what is hardly known is that the majority of government officials still work in bonn - some 10 , 200 , while only a little over 8,000 work in berlin . commuting from one place to another has become a daily phenomenon for german government workers .
some officials say that even with the help of modern telecommunications technology , such as e-mail , video conferencing and instant messaging , traveling between berlin and bonn is an absolute necessity . " sheer madness " " i can use -lrb- those means -rrb- to have contacts with other people in the ministry in bonn , " said rolf eckermann , an official in the development ministry .
but that was not enough , he said .
" it is very difficult to work if the other people are 600 kilometers away .
you have modern technology , but you have to also have the personal contact . "

" the real question here is whether those affected on both sides are actually keen on a speedy solution . " opposition green party parliamentary spokesman jürgen trittin has been more direct .
he 's called the dual seat of government ' sheer madness . ' many officials working in bonn have no way of catching up with the speedy flow of information in berlin , the former federal environment minister has said .

at a time when ordinary germans are called upon to tighten their belts , wasting money on constant commuter flights between bonn and berlin is no longer acceptable , he has said . but opponents of a complete move to berlin find it relatively easy to ward off this financial argument .

the tax will cause headaches for northern european refiners and do further damage to deteriorating relations between belarus and russia . belarusian prime minister sergei sidorsky said wednesday the duty would be $ 45 per ton of oil , which was being imposed retroactively from jan .
1 .
the tax comes in retaliation for moscow cutting subsidies on energy supplies to belarus . " we have done everything that -lrb- russia -rrb- asked us to do , and today the time has come to demand that -lrb- russia -rrb- keeps its promises , " president alexander lukashenko told a cabinet meeting on wednesday .
" if it does not , we are within our rights to act in turn .
by that i mean to raise the question of the transit of oil through belarus , payment for this transit , payment for the land that is used for oil and gas pipelines , russian properties here , " the authoritarian leader said . market watchers said the duty would not affect world oil prices or cause shortages , but it could cause short-term disruptions to the supplies as refiners in germany and poland looked for cheaper alternative supplies , reuters reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dispute has again made northern europe jittery about secure energy supplies under the terms of a gas deal struck late on dec .
31 , belarus reluctantly agreed to pay $ 100 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas from russia , more than double the previous price of $ 45 .
belarus , which is economically dependent on russia , also agreed to sell 50 percent of state pipeline operator beltransgaz to russia 's state-run gazprom as part of the deal .
tense relations moscow had threatened to cut its supplies to belarus on jan .
1 unless it agreed to the new supply contract , while belarus had threatened to disrupt russian exports to western europe which pass through its territory . this had caused concern in the european union , which imports five percent of its gas supplies through belarus from russia - most of it delivered to germany and poland - and revived memories of gas shortages this time last year caused by a dispute between ukraine and russia . lukashenko said wednesday he had told his officials to sign the deal with moscow " because russian leaders promised us to find a solution on oil . "
sugar dispute in another development , exports of belarusian sugar to russia have been suspended since jan .
1 , said the head of the state-run agricultural production concern belgospishcheprom . " this situation is the result of a series of restrictive measures by the russian customs service , " ivan danchenko told reporters in minsk . danchenko denied rumors that that belarusian companies were sending south american-produced cane sugar to russia disguised as beet sugar to avoid customs duties . coming in the wake of a recently announced hike in russian duties on oil exports to belarus , sunday 's deal on gas appears to mark the end of an era of cheap energy supplies from russia that have subsidized the belarusian economy since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reducing europe 's reliance on russian gas russia 's energy spat with neighboring belarus has once again highlighed europe 's dependence on russian gas .

and the waste is unlikely to end soon . german taxpayers have forked out the money to pay for the cost of government workers traveling between berlin and bonn and for special benefits these officials receive , according to a report on thursday in bild newspaper . no other country in the world seems to be willing to afford the doubtful luxury of a seat of government split between two cities .
germany 's unique situation arose from the so-called bonn-berlin law of 1994 which aimed to ensure that bonn would not suffer economically from large parts of the government moving to the new capital , berlin . even today , six ministries , including those for development , defence , environment and health have their headquarters in bonn and only smaller representations in berlin .
clearly , for the media the government and berlin form an inseparable unit .
but what is hardly known is that the majority of government officials still work in bonn - some 10 , 200 , while only a little over 8,000 work in berlin . commuting from one place to another has become a daily phenomenon for german government workers .
some officials say that even with the help of modern telecommunications technology , such as e-mail , video conferencing and instant messaging , traveling between berlin and bonn is an absolute necessity . " sheer madness " " i can use -lrb- those means -rrb- to have contacts with other people in the ministry in bonn , " said rolf eckermann , an official in the development ministry .

" the real question here is whether those affected on both sides are actually keen on a speedy solution . " opposition green party parliamentary spokesman jürgen trittin has been more direct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 04.01.2007 dual seat of german government costs taxpayers dearly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellery has moved to berlin , but six ministries are still in bonn germany has over the past decade spent 196 million euros -lrb- $ 260 million -rrb- to maintain ministry offices in both berlin and bonn , according to a report .
and the waste is unlikely to end soon . german taxpayers have forked out the money to pay for the cost of government workers traveling between berlin and bonn and for special benefits these officials receive , according to a report on thursday in bild newspaper . no other country in the world seems to be willing to afford the doubtful luxury of a seat of government split between two cities .
germany 's unique situation arose from the so-called bonn-berlin law of 1994 which aimed to ensure that bonn would not suffer economically from large parts of the government moving to the new capital , berlin . even today , six ministries , including those for development , defence , environment and health have their headquarters in bonn and only smaller representations in berlin .
clearly , for the media the government and berlin form an inseparable unit .
but what is hardly known is that the majority of government officials still work in bonn - some 10 , 200 , while only a little over 8,000 work in berlin . commuting from one place to another has become a daily phenomenon for german government workers .
some officials say that even with the help of modern telecommunications technology , such as e-mail , video conferencing and instant messaging , traveling between berlin and bonn is an absolute necessity . " sheer madness " " i can use -lrb- those means -rrb- to have contacts with other people in the ministry in bonn , " said rolf eckermann , an official in the development ministry .
but that was not enough , he said .
" it is very difficult to work if the other people are 600 kilometers away .
you have modern technology , but you have to also have the personal contact . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's state wo n't feel the brunt of the ministries leaving bonn lower saxony 's conservative state premier , christian wulff , is one of the small number of chancellor angela merkel 's party colleagues who have come out in favor of moving all ministries to berlin . " i believe that where there 's a will , there 's a way , " wulff has said .
" the real question here is whether those affected on both sides are actually keen on a speedy solution . " opposition green party parliamentary spokesman jürgen trittin has been more direct .
he 's called the dual seat of government ' sheer madness . ' many officials working in bonn have no way of catching up with the speedy flow of information in berlin , the former federal environment minister has said .
trittin says the decision-making process was severely hampered by the dual offices .
at a time when ordinary germans are called upon to tighten their belts , wasting money on constant commuter flights between bonn and berlin is no longer acceptable , he has said . but opponents of a complete move to berlin find it relatively easy to ward off this financial argument .
they refer to a recent study compiled by an independent panel which said that the move would cost up to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- .
compared to that , the 196 million euros spent on commuting so far seem like peanuts . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the reichstag : from political to architectural symbol kaiser wilhelm i laid the first stone in 1882 .
twelve years later , berlin 's reichstag , designed by paul wallot , was finished .

despite a new debate about the costs of the divide , it 's likely to stay that way - at least for now .

german energy expert claudia kemfert talked to dw-world.de about ways to get around the problem . dw-world.de : the gas dispute between russia and belarus shows that moscow has been using the energy issue as a political tool .
what are the consequences for european and german energy policy ? claudia kemfert : both germany and europe realize from this dispute that we are dependent on russian gas exports .
a recurrent theme of european energy policy is to reduce such dependence , which means relying more on our own resources , such as renewable energy , but also nuclear energy .
at the same time we should try and avoid an energy squeeze by looking at tapping energy from other gas-supplying nations . which alternative countries are you referring to ? at the moment , gas is already supplied by norway -lrb- which is not an eu member -rrb- , but there are limits to the supply .
then there are countries such as qatar , which are capable of delivering gas to europe .
pipelines are also being built precisely for this reason .
there is also the potential of liquified natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- .
germany missed the opportunity to construct tankers specially designed to store the gas .
one is being planned at the port of wilhelmshaven , but it wo n't be in service until 2010 .
and one tanker wo n't be enough .
it 's obvious that we have n't prepared well in order to diversify our energy sources . what needs to change at the political level so that we can tap energy from other sources ? in the past we were hugely dependent on one energy provider . russia has been a reliable supplier , no doubt about it , but the kremlin also has a political agenda and puts pressure on the transit countries delivering gas .
we could have a delivery problem when belarus for example , decides to block its pipelines or if russia once again has a gas row with ukraine .
one can not rule out the fact that europe too , for whatever reason , could have a dispute with russia .
that would then threaten energy supplies . for this reason , europe must promote domestic energy providers in order to reduce its dependence on gas imports .
and it 's also important for europe to improve upon its energy effiiciency . you have already mentioned nuclear energy .
should germany rethink its planned phasing out of nuclear power ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy expert claudia kemfert problems could naturally arise when nuclear plants need to be replaced by gas or conventional coal power plants .
with gas-fired plants there is the danger that we could become too heavily dependent on energy imports , for instance from russia.we know that coal plants generate excessive carbon dioxide emissions and greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change . besides , germany is a signatory to the kyoto protocol , so there is a real danger that we may not stick to the promised cuts in co2 emissions .
that 's why we are pushing to extend the life span of safe nuclear plants so that we have enough time to strengthen domestic energy providers .
the focus in the long term should however not be on nuclear energy , but on strenghtening renewable energy sources so that we have a good energy mix . germany has in the past relied hugely on gas deliveries , a fact that has influenced the german position within europe . would a diversification of energy sources change this situation ?
a bit .
as head of the eu presidency , germany will make it clear that it wants to pursue a policy change and diversify its energy . besides , it has to be made further clear that we are aware that there could be delivery problems and that germany would like to see more transparency in the russian energy market .
we have to make it clear to the russians where our interests lie .
but at the same time we should be prepared to accept the russian need to sell gas .
we all have legitimate economic interests , but when political interests begin to play a role , it must be made clear that western europe and germany do n't want to play along . if we seek other energy providers too in future , this could threaten the very good russian-german relations .
claudia kemfert is head of the division " energy , transport , environment " at the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw berlin -rrb- and is chair of environmental economics at berlin 's humboldt university . olga solonari interviewed claudia kemfert -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belarus official : deal reached in row with gazprom belarus said saturday it had reached an agreement with russian gas giant gazprom in their row over gas import prices , but gazprom said nothing had been signed yet .

since then , the magazine has unearthed scandal after scandal , while also occasionally coming under fire itself . for decades , the weekly der spiegel has been the leader in investigative journalism in germany .
as one of germany 's most influential news sources - it held almost a monopoly on forming german public opinion in the postwar decades - the magazine has revealed numerous scandals and shaped politics like no other german media outlet . in the best of times , it has been called the " independent conscience of politicians " that has never let a scandal slip through its fingers . one of most dramatic events spiegel covered was the " flick affair , " a bribery scandal the magazine investigated which eventually forced otto graf lambsdorff , then minister for economic affairs , to resign in 1984 . relentless digging bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der spiegel 's first issue on jan .
4 , 1947 other scandals spiegel unearthed include that of politician uwe barschel in 1987 .
barschel , then the incumbent state premier , allegedly had his opponent spied upon during an election campaign in the hope of finding incriminating evidence to use . spiegel revealed this and other unsavory dealings involving an assistant of barschel 's .
while barschel denied any knowledge of the tactics , he ended up withdrawing from the election race . he was found dead a short time later in a bathtub in geneva , and while some thought it was a suicide , many others speculated he was murdered . the " barschel affair " was just one in a string of scandalous episodes that continued to send shockwaves through the german political and cultural landscape well into the 1990s . der spiegel was at the center of much of it , both as muckraker and maverick . spiegel history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : augstein -lrb- c -rrb- going into court in jan .
1963 der spiegel succeeded the magazine diese woche -lrb- this week -rrb- , which the british press officer john chaloner had founded in 1946 . chaloner , however , was forced to abandon the paper as its critical view of the occupying allied forces in germany did not find favor among them . rudolf augstein , a 23-year-old reporter known for his lively and impertinent writing style at a newspaper in hanover , took over the license for diese woche .
he turned it into der spiegel and became its publisher and editor-in-chief , but maintained diese woche 's style of critically reporting on political and cultural events . the " spiegel affair " spiegel was so good at uncovering scandals that it even got one named after itself : the " spiegel affair . " in 1962 , the magazine published an article about a nato maneuver called " fallex 62 " that also threw a negative light on the state of the bundeswehr , or german army .

the events triggered riots and protests throughout germany , with the public accusing the government of supporting censorship . the affair eventually led to a groundbreaking ruling by the constitutional court , which laid down the basic tenets for freedom of the press for decades to come . having become the voice of conscience , der spiegel 's sales skyrocketed , hitting half a million copies in the following years . then and now since stefan aust took over as editor-in-chief in 1994 , and tried to ensure the magazine kept up with the changing times .
in 1994 it was the first magazine in the world to go online . but he also came under criticism , especially for breaking one of the publications long-standing cardinal rules : never fraternize with the powerful .

before you pack your bag , check out what other dw-world.de readers had to say about their german travel experience . cycling in germany is a pleasure .
i spent three weeks riding from berlin to munich following the world cup last summer and i am still reveling in the experience .
it was like getting reacquainted an old friend i thought i already knew everything about , only to find i have only scratched the surface .
pleasures of the trip included traveling without a set itinerary and knowing that with inclement weather or fatigue or curiosity i could throw my bike on a train and zoom to new surprises .
happily , the weather was amazing and , actually , i only took the train once on a side trip to the bike-friendly city of münster .
next time , i look forward to riding in the alps .
i became excited for that adventure reading a book i found in a globetrotter travel store in berlin , an excellent starting point for any traveler to germany - and beyond , for that matter . - matt furber i have visited both england and germany many times and i always return home to the us heavier from germany .
my absolute favorite meals are breakfasts in small town hotels with the meats and breads from local providers . - john r. grum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : splurge on german specialities , just do n't break the scale germany has my admiration .
i just come back from a week in leipzig where the town was wearing the best christmas decorations i have seen in my whole life .
it was a fairyland .
people were very kind , organized and clean and german food was of the highest standard . - myriam on our recent visit to germany we had the pleasure of going to the town of jever .
known for its great tasting beer , a tour of the brewery was awesome .
we could n't have been more pleased by the hospitality we received at our stay at the hotel schwarzer adler .
the food was great and the jever beer on tap was well worth the visit . - rich solecki i recently traveled to germany with my brother .
we stayed for two weeks in different parts of it .
i must tell you , everything that one hears about the big glasses of real good beer is all true .
we arrived in munich to pick up the car my brother had just bought , and we stay there for a couple of days .
in december it was a little cold for us but not too cold to spoil the vacation .
as tourists we took photos of every big and old building , and everything else .
we ate in every german restaurant we could find and drank the local beer .
one night at the hofbrauhaus we felt like real bavarians with our big glasses , wheat beer , folk music , long wood benches that could seat 10 people and everybody singing and dancing .
i do n't remember if we had six or seven beers each , but they charged us only 26 euros .
lucky for us , the hotel was nearby .
i love germany !
some say germans are cold - it is better to travel and prove them wrong .
p.s. autobahn in english means happiness . - pedro olivencia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exploring the former gdr was a highlight for one reader i hired a car and visited germany in october 2006 .
i took my seven-year-old son and we stayed in braunlage , schierke and wiehe in thuringia .
it was very fascinating and historical .
i felt i could freely ask the locals walking if the were originally from the east or the west .
a german would probably feel more hesitant to ask that simple question .
in scheirke , you could really feel the former gdr .
the atmosphere is somehow inexplicably different from braunlage , and even formerly eastern eland and drei annen hohne .
parts of saxony-anhalt seem so well reconstructed that it is often difficult to imagine that less than 20 years ago it was part of east germany .
for both lower saxony and saxony-anhalt , the change after 1989 must have been very spectacular and unforeseen .
i had the impression that for people older than 25 to 30 , the border is still very much remembered . - charles beadle compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world.de 's readers share german travel highlights planning a trip to germany ?

before you pack your bag , check out what other dw-world.de readers had to say about their german travel experience . cycling in germany is a pleasure .
i spent three weeks riding from berlin to munich following the world cup last summer and i am still reveling in the experience .
it was like getting reacquainted an old friend i thought i already knew everything about , only to find i have only scratched the surface .
pleasures of the trip included traveling without a set itinerary and knowing that with inclement weather or fatigue or curiosity i could throw my bike on a train and zoom to new surprises .
happily , the weather was amazing and , actually , i only took the train once on a side trip to the bike-friendly city of münster .
next time , i look forward to riding in the alps .
i became excited for that adventure reading a book i found in a globetrotter travel store in berlin , an excellent starting point for any traveler to germany - and beyond , for that matter . - matt furber i have visited both england and germany many times and i always return home to the us heavier from germany .
my absolute favorite meals are breakfasts in small town hotels with the meats and breads from local providers . - john r. grum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : splurge on german specialities , just do n't break the scale germany has my admiration .
i just come back from a week in leipzig where the town was wearing the best christmas decorations i have seen in my whole life .
it was a fairyland .
people were very kind , organized and clean and german food was of the highest standard . - myriam on our recent visit to germany we had the pleasure of going to the town of jever .
known for its great tasting beer , a tour of the brewery was awesome .
we could n't have been more pleased by the hospitality we received at our stay at the hotel schwarzer adler .
the food was great and the jever beer on tap was well worth the visit . - rich solecki i recently traveled to germany with my brother .
we stayed for two weeks in different parts of it .
i must tell you , everything that one hears about the big glasses of real good beer is all true .
we arrived in munich to pick up the car my brother had just bought , and we stay there for a couple of days .
in december it was a little cold for us but not too cold to spoil the vacation .
as tourists we took photos of every big and old building , and everything else .
we ate in every german restaurant we could find and drank the local beer .
one night at the hofbrauhaus we felt like real bavarians with our big glasses , wheat beer , folk music , long wood benches that could seat 10 people and everybody singing and dancing .
i do n't remember if we had six or seven beers each , but they charged us only 26 euros .
lucky for us , the hotel was nearby .
i love germany !
some say germans are cold - it is better to travel and prove them wrong .
p.s. autobahn in english means happiness . - pedro olivencia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exploring the former gdr was a highlight for one reader i hired a car and visited germany in october 2006 .
i took my seven-year-old son and we stayed in braunlage , schierke and wiehe in thuringia .
it was very fascinating and historical .
i felt i could freely ask the locals walking if the were originally from the east or the west .
a german would probably feel more hesitant to ask that simple question .
in scheirke , you could really feel the former gdr .
the atmosphere is somehow inexplicably different from braunlage , and even formerly eastern eland and drei annen hohne .
parts of saxony-anhalt seem so well reconstructed that it is often difficult to imagine that less than 20 years ago it was part of east germany .

before you pack your bag , check out what other dw-world.de readers had to say about their german travel experience . cycling in germany is a pleasure .
i spent three weeks riding from berlin to munich following the world cup last summer and i am still reveling in the experience .
it was like getting reacquainted an old friend i thought i already knew everything about , only to find i have only scratched the surface .
pleasures of the trip included traveling without a set itinerary and knowing that with inclement weather or fatigue or curiosity i could throw my bike on a train and zoom to new surprises .
happily , the weather was amazing and , actually , i only took the train once on a side trip to the bike-friendly city of münster .
next time , i look forward to riding in the alps .
i became excited for that adventure reading a book i found in a globetrotter travel store in berlin , an excellent starting point for any traveler to germany - and beyond , for that matter . - matt furber i have visited both england and germany many times and i always return home to the us heavier from germany .
my absolute favorite meals are breakfasts in small town hotels with the meats and breads from local providers . - john r. grum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : splurge on german specialities , just do n't break the scale germany has my admiration .
i just come back from a week in leipzig where the town was wearing the best christmas decorations i have seen in my whole life .
it was a fairyland .
people were very kind , organized and clean and german food was of the highest standard . - myriam on our recent visit to germany we had the pleasure of going to the town of jever .
known for its great tasting beer , a tour of the brewery was awesome .
we could n't have been more pleased by the hospitality we received at our stay at the hotel schwarzer adler .
the food was great and the jever beer on tap was well worth the visit . - rich solecki i recently traveled to germany with my brother .
we stayed for two weeks in different parts of it .
i must tell you , everything that one hears about the big glasses of real good beer is all true .
we arrived in munich to pick up the car my brother had just bought , and we stay there for a couple of days .
in december it was a little cold for us but not too cold to spoil the vacation .
as tourists we took photos of every big and old building , and everything else .
we ate in every german restaurant we could find and drank the local beer .
one night at the hofbrauhaus we felt like real bavarians with our big glasses , wheat beer , folk music , long wood benches that could seat 10 people and everybody singing and dancing .
i do n't remember if we had six or seven beers each , but they charged us only 26 euros .
lucky for us , the hotel was nearby .
i love germany !
some say germans are cold - it is better to travel and prove them wrong .
p.s. autobahn in english means happiness . - pedro olivencia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exploring the former gdr was a highlight for one reader i hired a car and visited germany in october 2006 .
i took my seven-year-old son and we stayed in braunlage , schierke and wiehe in thuringia .
it was very fascinating and historical .
i felt i could freely ask the locals walking if the were originally from the east or the west .
a german would probably feel more hesitant to ask that simple question .
in scheirke , you could really feel the former gdr .
the atmosphere is somehow inexplicably different from braunlage , and even formerly eastern eland and drei annen hohne .
parts of saxony-anhalt seem so well reconstructed that it is often difficult to imagine that less than 20 years ago it was part of east germany .
for both lower saxony and saxony-anhalt , the change after 1989 must have been very spectacular and unforeseen .
i had the impression that for people older than 25 to 30 , the border is still very much remembered . - charles beadle compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world.de 's readers share german travel highlights planning a trip to germany ?

since then , the magazine has unearthed scandal after scandal , while also occasionally coming under fire itself . for decades , the weekly der spiegel has been the leader in investigative journalism in germany .
as one of germany 's most influential news sources - it held almost a monopoly on forming german public opinion in the postwar decades - the magazine has revealed numerous scandals and shaped politics like no other german media outlet . in the best of times , it has been called the " independent conscience of politicians " that has never let a scandal slip through its fingers . one of most dramatic events spiegel covered was the " flick affair , " a bribery scandal the magazine investigated which eventually forced otto graf lambsdorff , then minister for economic affairs , to resign in 1984 . relentless digging bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der spiegel 's first issue on jan .
4 , 1947 other scandals spiegel unearthed include that of politician uwe barschel in 1987 .
barschel , then the incumbent state premier , allegedly had his opponent spied upon during an election campaign in the hope of finding incriminating evidence to use . spiegel revealed this and other unsavory dealings involving an assistant of barschel 's .
while barschel denied any knowledge of the tactics , he ended up withdrawing from the election race . he was found dead a short time later in a bathtub in geneva , and while some thought it was a suicide , many others speculated he was murdered . the " barschel affair " was just one in a string of scandalous episodes that continued to send shockwaves through the german political and cultural landscape well into the 1990s . der spiegel was at the center of much of it , both as muckraker and maverick . spiegel history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : augstein -lrb- c -rrb- going into court in jan .
1963 der spiegel succeeded the magazine diese woche -lrb- this week -rrb- , which the british press officer john chaloner had founded in 1946 . chaloner , however , was forced to abandon the paper as its critical view of the occupying allied forces in germany did not find favor among them . rudolf augstein , a 23-year-old reporter known for his lively and impertinent writing style at a newspaper in hanover , took over the license for diese woche .
he turned it into der spiegel and became its publisher and editor-in-chief , but maintained diese woche 's style of critically reporting on political and cultural events . the " spiegel affair " spiegel was so good at uncovering scandals that it even got one named after itself : the " spiegel affair . " in 1962 , the magazine published an article about a nato maneuver called " fallex 62 " that also threw a negative light on the state of the bundeswehr , or german army .

" in the context of a mild winter and considering the current situation of storage and gas flows , the measures taken by -lrb- eu -rrb- member states were considered appropriate to ensure security of supply , " the eu 's gas coordination group said on thursday . belarus ambassador vladimir senko gave the group , which supervises the security of eu natural gas supplies , a " factual presentation " of the deal with russia , a european commission spokesman said after a brussels meeting . a spokesman for the european commission , ferran tarradellas espuny , told a news briefing thursday he did not think the decision by belarus to impose duty on russian oil imports in transit through the country would affect eu supply security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mild winter in parts of europe has even seen crocuses in bloom in december -lrb- here in dresden -rrb- " the general impression is that measures taken are adequate , but we have considered we have had a mild winter , " tarradellas espuny said . he added that it was the first time belarus had taken part in the gas group meeting in brussels , but russia did not take part even though it had been invited . under the terms of an accord struck late on december 31 with russian energy monopoly gazprom , belarus agreed to pay $ 100 per 1,000 cubic metres of gas from russia , more than double the previous price of $ 45 . minsk also agreed to sell 50 percent of state pipeline operator beltransgaz . russia had threatened to cut its supplies to belarus on jan .
1 unless it agreed to a new supply contract with higher prices .
minsk had threatened to disrupt russian gas exports to western europe that pass through its territory . " no threat to deliveries " the eu is heavily dependent on russian energy .
russia supplied 24 percent of the eu 's total gas needs in 2005 , according to data from european gas federation eurogas , representing 40 percent of all gas imports to the bloc . of that , about 20 percent transits through belarus - mainly to germany , lithuania and poland - and some 80 percent through ukraine , meaning that about five percent of europe 's gas could have been hit . tarradellas espuny said the european commission did not expect the decision by belarus on wednesday to impose duty on russian oil exports to affect either supply or price . " we expect that the differences between the two parties are going to permit consumers to expect oil supplies at the prices that have been previously contracted , " he said . russia too said on thursday it did not expect the escalating trade row with belarus to disrupt supplies to europe .

" we expect that the differences between the two parties are going to permit consumers to expect oil supplies at the prices that have been previously contracted , " he said . russia too said on thursday it did not expect the escalating trade row with belarus to disrupt supplies to europe .

and the waste is unlikely to end soon . german taxpayers have forked out the money to pay for the cost of government workers traveling between berlin and bonn and for special benefits these officials receive , according to a report on thursday in bild newspaper . no other country in the world seems to be willing to afford the doubtful luxury of a seat of government split between two cities .
germany 's unique situation arose from the so-called bonn-berlin law of 1994 which aimed to ensure that bonn would not suffer economically from large parts of the government moving to the new capital , berlin . even today , six ministries , including those for development , defence , environment and health have their headquarters in bonn and only smaller representations in berlin .
clearly , for the media the government and berlin form an inseparable unit .
but what is hardly known is that the majority of government officials still work in bonn - some 10 , 200 , while only a little over 8,000 work in berlin . commuting from one place to another has become a daily phenomenon for german government workers .
some officials say that even with the help of modern telecommunications technology , such as e-mail , video conferencing and instant messaging , traveling between berlin and bonn is an absolute necessity . " sheer madness " " i can use -lrb- those means -rrb- to have contacts with other people in the ministry in bonn , " said rolf eckermann , an official in the development ministry .
but that was not enough , he said .
" it is very difficult to work if the other people are 600 kilometers away .

" the real question here is whether those affected on both sides are actually keen on a speedy solution . " opposition green party parliamentary spokesman jürgen trittin has been more direct .

at a time when ordinary germans are called upon to tighten their belts , wasting money on constant commuter flights between bonn and berlin is no longer acceptable , he has said . but opponents of a complete move to berlin find it relatively easy to ward off this financial argument .

and the waste is unlikely to end soon . german taxpayers have forked out the money to pay for the cost of government workers traveling between berlin and bonn and for special benefits these officials receive , according to a report on thursday in bild newspaper . no other country in the world seems to be willing to afford the doubtful luxury of a seat of government split between two cities .
germany 's unique situation arose from the so-called bonn-berlin law of 1994 which aimed to ensure that bonn would not suffer economically from large parts of the government moving to the new capital , berlin . even today , six ministries , including those for development , defence , environment and health have their headquarters in bonn and only smaller representations in berlin .
clearly , for the media the government and berlin form an inseparable unit .
but what is hardly known is that the majority of government officials still work in bonn - some 10 , 200 , while only a little over 8,000 work in berlin . commuting from one place to another has become a daily phenomenon for german government workers .
some officials say that even with the help of modern telecommunications technology , such as e-mail , video conferencing and instant messaging , traveling between berlin and bonn is an absolute necessity . " sheer madness " " i can use -lrb- those means -rrb- to have contacts with other people in the ministry in bonn , " said rolf eckermann , an official in the development ministry .
but that was not enough , he said .
" it is very difficult to work if the other people are 600 kilometers away .
you have modern technology , but you have to also have the personal contact . "

" i believe that where there 's a will , there 's a way , " wulff has said .
" the real question here is whether those affected on both sides are actually keen on a speedy solution . " opposition green party parliamentary spokesman jürgen trittin has been more direct .
he 's called the dual seat of government ' sheer madness . ' many officials working in bonn have no way of catching up with the speedy flow of information in berlin , the former federal environment minister has said .
trittin says the decision-making process was severely hampered by the dual offices .
at a time when ordinary germans are called upon to tighten their belts , wasting money on constant commuter flights between bonn and berlin is no longer acceptable , he has said . but opponents of a complete move to berlin find it relatively easy to ward off this financial argument .
they refer to a recent study compiled by an independent panel which said that the move would cost up to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- .

it wants the european union to support its efforts . italy has asked the european union for support in its bid to impose a global moratorium on the death penalty in the wake of saddam hussein 's execution . " i believe this must constitute one of the top commitments of our international efforts because it is urgent to have an initiative to put an end to the barbarianism of the death penalty , " italian foreign minister massimo d 'alema told news agency ansa . in a statement released earlier this week , the italian foreign ministry said the 27-member bloc should discuss a common strategy designed to increase international support for the moratorium at an informal meeting of eu political directorates set for jan 11-12 in dresden , germany . " the recent cases of capital punishments and executions present us with the need to draw the attention of the international community to a renewed initiative designed to promote a moratorium on the death penalty , in view of its complete abolition , " the statement said . italy , a largely catholic country , was shocked by televised images of the former iraqi dictator hanging .
it is now leading diplomatic efforts to bring about a global ban on capital punishment . italy has just become a non-permanent member of the united nations security council .
its ambassador in new york , marcello spatafora , has asked officials to put the moratorium on the agenda of the un general assembly . italian politician on hunger strike is hospitalized meanwhile , the head of italy 's radical party , marco pannella , agreed to be hospitalized on thursday as he entered the second week of his hunger strike to push for a worldwide moratorium on capital punishment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 76-year-old pannella has carried out several hunger strikes in the past on wednesday , he had begun accepting water .
but a medical bulletin posted on the radical party 's web site thursday stated that doctors were deeply concerned by pannella 's condition and urged hospitalization . doctors said pannella was dehydrated and faced " potentially irreversible " damage to his kidneys and cardio-vascular system .
he has staged hunger strikes in support of a number of causes over his political career . pannella was a leading advocate of legalized abortion and divorce in the 1970s and 1980s . condemnation is not enough rome 's initiative will involve 85 un member states that signed a non-binding declaration in december against the death penalty , prime minister romano prodi said . " the government is not content with condemning the death penalty , it will act , " prodi said . capital punishment is outlawed in all european union countries , but it is widely practiced in two of the un security council 's five permanent members - china and the united states . iraq deflects italian criticism however , iraq has rebuffed italian criticism , noting that the italians themselves had executed former fascist leader benito mussolini during world war ii .
the dictator was executed by partisans and strung up in a square in milan in 1945 . " they have no right interfering with the affairs of another country , " iraqi government official yaseen majeed told italian newspaper la repubblica . " mussolini 's trial only lasted one minute .

i spent three weeks riding from berlin to munich following the world cup last summer and i am still reveling in the experience .

we ate in every german restaurant we could find and drank the local beer .
one night at the hofbrauhaus we felt like real bavarians with our big glasses , wheat beer , folk music , long wood benches that could seat 10 people and everybody singing and dancing .

it also calls for improved police cooperation . germany will push for greater cooperation in european interior policies during its eu presidency , said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
international terrorism , organized crime and illegal migration were increasingly threatening european security , he said .
" all member states must be aware that they would be overtaxed to cope with global security challenges all on their own , " schäuble said wednesday at the presentation of germany 's security program for its eu presidency . schäuble said the eu 's police agency europol , in particular needed strengthening .
with additional powers , europol could fight international terrorism and cross-border crime more effectively , he said . " in the future , europol should be responsible for fighting all forms of serious cross-border crime , such as a serial killers active in more than one member state or major disruptions to internal security caused by hooligans , " schäuble told reporters . schäuble said he supported the european commission 's proposal last month to strengthen europol 's role .
the so-called europol convention needed to be transferred into the eu 's legal framework , he said .
europol was established in 1992 and took up its full activities in 1999 .

" if it does not , we are within our rights to act in turn .
by that i mean to raise the question of the transit of oil through belarus , payment for this transit , payment for the land that is used for oil and gas pipelines , russian properties here , " the authoritarian leader said . market watchers said the duty would not affect world oil prices or cause shortages , but it could cause short-term disruptions to the supplies as refiners in germany and poland looked for cheaper alternative supplies , reuters reported .

" our economic systems are based on the same values , " she said .
" we must watch out that we do not drift apart but instead come closer together , where there are clear advantages for both sides . " she said it was her ambition to create a single transatlantic market for investors , with common rules and standards on issues such as intellectual property and financial regulation . merkel wants us support for mideast as europe 's biggest economy and most populous country , germany faces high expectations for the dual presidencies which by coincidence fall together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel plans to push for a solution to the mideast conflict spokesmen for the two leaders said merkel and bush would take up international crises including the stalled middle east peace process , efforts to quell violence in afghanistan and iraq , iran 's disputed nuclear ambitions , instability in lebanon and efforts to decide the final status of kosovo .

" we would like to see the quartet take on a stronger role , " merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said wednesday . tough talks on energy merkel will also press bush on cutting greenhouse gases amid mounting european frustration at a us refusal to ratify the kyoto protocol , which runs out in 2012 , or on proposing a viable alternative . " of course we must and will talk with the americans about the fact that they too should commit to reducing carbon dioxide -lrb- emissions -rrb- , " merkel told the january issue of the political monthly cicero .

german energy expert claudia kemfert talked to dw-world.de about ways to get around the problem . dw-world.de : the gas dispute between russia and belarus shows that moscow has been using the energy issue as a political tool .
what are the consequences for european and german energy policy ? claudia kemfert : both germany and europe realize from this dispute that we are dependent on russian gas exports .
a recurrent theme of european energy policy is to reduce such dependence , which means relying more on our own resources , such as renewable energy , but also nuclear energy .
at the same time we should try and avoid an energy squeeze by looking at tapping energy from other gas-supplying nations . which alternative countries are you referring to ? at the moment , gas is already supplied by norway -lrb- which is not an eu member -rrb- , but there are limits to the supply .
then there are countries such as qatar , which are capable of delivering gas to europe .
pipelines are also being built precisely for this reason .
there is also the potential of liquified natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- .
germany missed the opportunity to construct tankers specially designed to store the gas .
one is being planned at the port of wilhelmshaven , but it wo n't be in service until 2010 .
and one tanker wo n't be enough .
it 's obvious that we have n't prepared well in order to diversify our energy sources . what needs to change at the political level so that we can tap energy from other sources ? in the past we were hugely dependent on one energy provider . russia has been a reliable supplier , no doubt about it , but the kremlin also has a political agenda and puts pressure on the transit countries delivering gas .
we could have a delivery problem when belarus for example , decides to block its pipelines or if russia once again has a gas row with ukraine .
one can not rule out the fact that europe too , for whatever reason , could have a dispute with russia .
that would then threaten energy supplies . for this reason , europe must promote domestic energy providers in order to reduce its dependence on gas imports .
and it 's also important for europe to improve upon its energy effiiciency . you have already mentioned nuclear energy .
should germany rethink its planned phasing out of nuclear power ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy expert claudia kemfert problems could naturally arise when nuclear plants need to be replaced by gas or conventional coal power plants .
with gas-fired plants there is the danger that we could become too heavily dependent on energy imports , for instance from russia.we know that coal plants generate excessive carbon dioxide emissions and greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change . besides , germany is a signatory to the kyoto protocol , so there is a real danger that we may not stick to the promised cuts in co2 emissions .
that 's why we are pushing to extend the life span of safe nuclear plants so that we have enough time to strengthen domestic energy providers .
the focus in the long term should however not be on nuclear energy , but on strenghtening renewable energy sources so that we have a good energy mix . germany has in the past relied hugely on gas deliveries , a fact that has influenced the german position within europe . would a diversification of energy sources change this situation ?
a bit .
as head of the eu presidency , germany will make it clear that it wants to pursue a policy change and diversify its energy . besides , it has to be made further clear that we are aware that there could be delivery problems and that germany would like to see more transparency in the russian energy market .
we have to make it clear to the russians where our interests lie .
but at the same time we should be prepared to accept the russian need to sell gas .
we all have legitimate economic interests , but when political interests begin to play a role , it must be made clear that western europe and germany do n't want to play along . if we seek other energy providers too in future , this could threaten the very good russian-german relations .
claudia kemfert is head of the division " energy , transport , environment " at the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw berlin -rrb- and is chair of environmental economics at berlin 's humboldt university . olga solonari interviewed claudia kemfert -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belarus official : deal reached in row with gazprom belarus said saturday it had reached an agreement with russian gas giant gazprom in their row over gas import prices , but gazprom said nothing had been signed yet .

german energy expert claudia kemfert talked to dw-world.de about ways to get around the problem . dw-world.de : the gas dispute between russia and belarus shows that moscow has been using the energy issue as a political tool .
what are the consequences for european and german energy policy ? claudia kemfert : both germany and europe realize from this dispute that we are dependent on russian gas exports .
a recurrent theme of european energy policy is to reduce such dependence , which means relying more on our own resources , such as renewable energy , but also nuclear energy .
at the same time we should try and avoid an energy squeeze by looking at tapping energy from other gas-supplying nations . which alternative countries are you referring to ? at the moment , gas is already supplied by norway -lrb- which is not an eu member -rrb- , but there are limits to the supply .
then there are countries such as qatar , which are capable of delivering gas to europe .
pipelines are also being built precisely for this reason .
there is also the potential of liquified natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- .
germany missed the opportunity to construct tankers specially designed to store the gas .
one is being planned at the port of wilhelmshaven , but it wo n't be in service until 2010 .
and one tanker wo n't be enough .
it 's obvious that we have n't prepared well in order to diversify our energy sources . what needs to change at the political level so that we can tap energy from other sources ? in the past we were hugely dependent on one energy provider . russia has been a reliable supplier , no doubt about it , but the kremlin also has a political agenda and puts pressure on the transit countries delivering gas .
we could have a delivery problem when belarus for example , decides to block its pipelines or if russia once again has a gas row with ukraine .
one can not rule out the fact that europe too , for whatever reason , could have a dispute with russia .
that would then threaten energy supplies . for this reason , europe must promote domestic energy providers in order to reduce its dependence on gas imports .
and it 's also important for europe to improve upon its energy effiiciency . you have already mentioned nuclear energy .
should germany rethink its planned phasing out of nuclear power ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy expert claudia kemfert problems could naturally arise when nuclear plants need to be replaced by gas or conventional coal power plants .
with gas-fired plants there is the danger that we could become too heavily dependent on energy imports , for instance from russia.we know that coal plants generate excessive carbon dioxide emissions and greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change . besides , germany is a signatory to the kyoto protocol , so there is a real danger that we may not stick to the promised cuts in co2 emissions .
that 's why we are pushing to extend the life span of safe nuclear plants so that we have enough time to strengthen domestic energy providers .
the focus in the long term should however not be on nuclear energy , but on strenghtening renewable energy sources so that we have a good energy mix . germany has in the past relied hugely on gas deliveries , a fact that has influenced the german position within europe . would a diversification of energy sources change this situation ?
a bit .
as head of the eu presidency , germany will make it clear that it wants to pursue a policy change and diversify its energy . besides , it has to be made further clear that we are aware that there could be delivery problems and that germany would like to see more transparency in the russian energy market .
we have to make it clear to the russians where our interests lie .
but at the same time we should be prepared to accept the russian need to sell gas .
we all have legitimate economic interests , but when political interests begin to play a role , it must be made clear that western europe and germany do n't want to play along . if we seek other energy providers too in future , this could threaten the very good russian-german relations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 04.01.2007 60 birthday candles for germany 's premier newsmagazine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the magazine likes to occasionally have fun with its covers sixty years ago today , germany 's top newsmagazine der spiegel went on sale at newsstands around the country .
since then , the magazine has unearthed scandal after scandal , while also occasionally coming under fire itself . for decades , the weekly der spiegel has been the leader in investigative journalism in germany .
as one of germany 's most influential news sources - it held almost a monopoly on forming german public opinion in the postwar decades - the magazine has revealed numerous scandals and shaped politics like no other german media outlet . in the best of times , it has been called the " independent conscience of politicians " that has never let a scandal slip through its fingers . one of most dramatic events spiegel covered was the " flick affair , " a bribery scandal the magazine investigated which eventually forced otto graf lambsdorff , then minister for economic affairs , to resign in 1984 . relentless digging bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der spiegel 's first issue on jan .
4 , 1947 other scandals spiegel unearthed include that of politician uwe barschel in 1987 .
barschel , then the incumbent state premier , allegedly had his opponent spied upon during an election campaign in the hope of finding incriminating evidence to use . spiegel revealed this and other unsavory dealings involving an assistant of barschel 's .
while barschel denied any knowledge of the tactics , he ended up withdrawing from the election race . he was found dead a short time later in a bathtub in geneva , and while some thought it was a suicide , many others speculated he was murdered . the " barschel affair " was just one in a string of scandalous episodes that continued to send shockwaves through the german political and cultural landscape well into the 1990s . der spiegel was at the center of much of it , both as muckraker and maverick . spiegel history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : augstein -lrb- c -rrb- going into court in jan .
1963 der spiegel succeeded the magazine diese woche -lrb- this week -rrb- , which the british press officer john chaloner had founded in 1946 . chaloner , however , was forced to abandon the paper as its critical view of the occupying allied forces in germany did not find favor among them . rudolf augstein , a 23-year-old reporter known for his lively and impertinent writing style at a newspaper in hanover , took over the license for diese woche .
he turned it into der spiegel and became its publisher and editor-in-chief , but maintained diese woche 's style of critically reporting on political and cultural events . the " spiegel affair " spiegel was so good at uncovering scandals that it even got one named after itself : the " spiegel affair . " in 1962 , the magazine published an article about a nato maneuver called " fallex 62 " that also threw a negative light on the state of the bundeswehr , or german army .
the article exposed the lack of in preparedness against the communist threat from the east at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf augstein -lrb- l -rrb- in early 1963 , after being arrested for treason and then released the magazine was accused of treason , with then minister of defense franz josef strauss having augstein , the article 's author , and other editors-in-chief arrested . spiegel 's offices were closed down for weeks ; augstein stayed in jail for months .
the events triggered riots and protests throughout germany , with the public accusing the government of supporting censorship . the affair eventually led to a groundbreaking ruling by the constitutional court , which laid down the basic tenets for freedom of the press for decades to come . having become the voice of conscience , der spiegel 's sales skyrocketed , hitting half a million copies in the following years . then and now since stefan aust took over as editor-in-chief in 1994 , and tried to ensure the magazine kept up with the changing times .
in 1994 it was the first magazine in the world to go online . but he also came under criticism , especially for breaking one of the publications long-standing cardinal rules : never fraternize with the powerful .
besides the critique about pandering to politicians , there are also accusations about more sensationalism and increasing amounts of fluff . still , the magazine manages to both mesmerize and polarize german society .
smart marketing seduces readers into wanting " the whole truth " each monday when they can find the new issue on newsstands , even if it 's been years since der spiegel actually uncovered a big scandal . fabian gartmann -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press council celebrates 50 years monday is the 50th anniversary of the german press council , an independent and self-regulating organization which was based on the british press council model .

" the german role on all of these issues will be especially important in 2007 , " white house deputy press secretary scott stanzel said . germany plans to call a meeting " as soon as possible " to revitalize the so-called middle east quartet grouping the eu , the united states , russia and the united nations amid grumbling in europe that washington has allowed the peace process to languish as iraq has consumed its attention . " we would like to see the quartet take on a stronger role , " merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said wednesday . tough talks on energy merkel will also press bush on cutting greenhouse gases amid mounting european frustration at a us refusal to ratify the kyoto protocol , which runs out in 2012 , or on proposing a viable alternative . " of course we must and will talk with the americans about the fact that they too should commit to reducing carbon dioxide -lrb- emissions -rrb- , " merkel told the january issue of the political monthly cicero .
" it is a tough problem to tackle . " the eu wants to forge a common position for negotiations on the successor to the kyoto pact by march .
germany would like the bloc to commit to reducing harmful emissions by 30 percent by 2020 . merkel and bush are also likely to discuss g8 plans to rein in highly speculative hedge funds , which have wrought instability on international financial markets . in a meeting last month , merkel and us treasury secretary henry paulson agreed that action was needed to avert risks and protect investors and that more transparency must be fostered with the g8 which groups britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states and russia . germany , us back on friendly terms the one-day visit to washington will be merkel 's third since she took office almost 14 months ago . she has moved to recalibrate german foreign policy at the helm of a " grand coalition " government grouping her conservative christian union bloc and their chief political rivals , the social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped the good chemistry between merkel and bush will translate into shared political positions merkel has also actively sought to heal the rift with washington she inherited from her predecessor gerhard schröder , whose ties with bush turned frosty over his vocal opposition to the us-led iraq war . carsten voigt , the german government 's coordinator for transatlantic relations , said german-american relations are back on a friendly footing now that the bush administration is apparently seeking a rapprochement with its allies and international partners . " there is a clear tendency now in the united states at least rhetorically to move more in the direction of listening to allies and friends than in the direction to dominate them , and that they move more in the direction of international organizations like the united nations , " voigt told dw-radio .

" in the context of a mild winter and considering the current situation of storage and gas flows , the measures taken by -lrb- eu -rrb- member states were considered appropriate to ensure security of supply , " the eu 's gas coordination group said on thursday . belarus ambassador vladimir senko gave the group , which supervises the security of eu natural gas supplies , a " factual presentation " of the deal with russia , a european commission spokesman said after a brussels meeting . a spokesman for the european commission , ferran tarradellas espuny , told a news briefing thursday he did not think the decision by belarus to impose duty on russian oil imports in transit through the country would affect eu supply security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mild winter in parts of europe has even seen crocuses in bloom in december -lrb- here in dresden -rrb- " the general impression is that measures taken are adequate , but we have considered we have had a mild winter , " tarradellas espuny said . he added that it was the first time belarus had taken part in the gas group meeting in brussels , but russia did not take part even though it had been invited . under the terms of an accord struck late on december 31 with russian energy monopoly gazprom , belarus agreed to pay $ 100 per 1,000 cubic metres of gas from russia , more than double the previous price of $ 45 . minsk also agreed to sell 50 percent of state pipeline operator beltransgaz . russia had threatened to cut its supplies to belarus on jan .

russia supplied 24 percent of the eu 's total gas needs in 2005 , according to data from european gas federation eurogas , representing 40 percent of all gas imports to the bloc . of that , about 20 percent transits through belarus - mainly to germany , lithuania and poland - and some 80 percent through ukraine , meaning that about five percent of europe 's gas could have been hit . tarradellas espuny said the european commission did not expect the decision by belarus on wednesday to impose duty on russian oil exports to affect either supply or price . " we expect that the differences between the two parties are going to permit consumers to expect oil supplies at the prices that have been previously contracted , " he said . russia too said on thursday it did not expect the escalating trade row with belarus to disrupt supplies to europe .

" in the context of a mild winter and considering the current situation of storage and gas flows , the measures taken by -lrb- eu -rrb- member states were considered appropriate to ensure security of supply , " the eu 's gas coordination group said on thursday . belarus ambassador vladimir senko gave the group , which supervises the security of eu natural gas supplies , a " factual presentation " of the deal with russia , a european commission spokesman said after a brussels meeting . a spokesman for the european commission , ferran tarradellas espuny , told a news briefing thursday he did not think the decision by belarus to impose duty on russian oil imports in transit through the country would affect eu supply security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mild winter in parts of europe has even seen crocuses in bloom in december -lrb- here in dresden -rrb- " the general impression is that measures taken are adequate , but we have considered we have had a mild winter , " tarradellas espuny said . he added that it was the first time belarus had taken part in the gas group meeting in brussels , but russia did not take part even though it had been invited . under the terms of an accord struck late on december 31 with russian energy monopoly gazprom , belarus agreed to pay $ 100 per 1,000 cubic metres of gas from russia , more than double the previous price of $ 45 . minsk also agreed to sell 50 percent of state pipeline operator beltransgaz . russia had threatened to cut its supplies to belarus on jan .

russia supplied 24 percent of the eu 's total gas needs in 2005 , according to data from european gas federation eurogas , representing 40 percent of all gas imports to the bloc . of that , about 20 percent transits through belarus - mainly to germany , lithuania and poland - and some 80 percent through ukraine , meaning that about five percent of europe 's gas could have been hit . tarradellas espuny said the european commission did not expect the decision by belarus on wednesday to impose duty on russian oil exports to affect either supply or price . " we expect that the differences between the two parties are going to permit consumers to expect oil supplies at the prices that have been previously contracted , " he said . russia too said on thursday it did not expect the escalating trade row with belarus to disrupt supplies to europe .

since then , the magazine has unearthed scandal after scandal , while also occasionally coming under fire itself . for decades , the weekly der spiegel has been the leader in investigative journalism in germany .
as one of germany 's most influential news sources - it held almost a monopoly on forming german public opinion in the postwar decades - the magazine has revealed numerous scandals and shaped politics like no other german media outlet . in the best of times , it has been called the " independent conscience of politicians " that has never let a scandal slip through its fingers . one of most dramatic events spiegel covered was the " flick affair , " a bribery scandal the magazine investigated which eventually forced otto graf lambsdorff , then minister for economic affairs , to resign in 1984 . relentless digging bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der spiegel 's first issue on jan .

barschel , then the incumbent state premier , allegedly had his opponent spied upon during an election campaign in the hope of finding incriminating evidence to use . spiegel revealed this and other unsavory dealings involving an assistant of barschel 's .
while barschel denied any knowledge of the tactics , he ended up withdrawing from the election race . he was found dead a short time later in a bathtub in geneva , and while some thought it was a suicide , many others speculated he was murdered . the " barschel affair " was just one in a string of scandalous episodes that continued to send shockwaves through the german political and cultural landscape well into the 1990s . der spiegel was at the center of much of it , both as muckraker and maverick . spiegel history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : augstein -lrb- c -rrb- going into court in jan .
1963 der spiegel succeeded the magazine diese woche -lrb- this week -rrb- , which the british press officer john chaloner had founded in 1946 . chaloner , however , was forced to abandon the paper as its critical view of the occupying allied forces in germany did not find favor among them . rudolf augstein , a 23-year-old reporter known for his lively and impertinent writing style at a newspaper in hanover , took over the license for diese woche .
he turned it into der spiegel and became its publisher and editor-in-chief , but maintained diese woche 's style of critically reporting on political and cultural events . the " spiegel affair " spiegel was so good at uncovering scandals that it even got one named after itself : the " spiegel affair .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 04.01.2007 reducing europe 's reliance on russian gas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's gas rows with its neighbors have sparked concerns in europe russia 's energy spat with neighboring belarus has once again highlighed europe 's dependence on russian gas .
german energy expert claudia kemfert talked to dw-world.de about ways to get around the problem . dw-world.de : the gas dispute between russia and belarus shows that moscow has been using the energy issue as a political tool .
what are the consequences for european and german energy policy ? claudia kemfert : both germany and europe realize from this dispute that we are dependent on russian gas exports .
a recurrent theme of european energy policy is to reduce such dependence , which means relying more on our own resources , such as renewable energy , but also nuclear energy .
at the same time we should try and avoid an energy squeeze by looking at tapping energy from other gas-supplying nations . which alternative countries are you referring to ? at the moment , gas is already supplied by norway -lrb- which is not an eu member -rrb- , but there are limits to the supply .
then there are countries such as qatar , which are capable of delivering gas to europe .
pipelines are also being built precisely for this reason .
there is also the potential of liquified natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- .
germany missed the opportunity to construct tankers specially designed to store the gas .
one is being planned at the port of wilhelmshaven , but it wo n't be in service until 2010 .
and one tanker wo n't be enough .
it 's obvious that we have n't prepared well in order to diversify our energy sources . what needs to change at the political level so that we can tap energy from other sources ? in the past we were hugely dependent on one energy provider . russia has been a reliable supplier , no doubt about it , but the kremlin also has a political agenda and puts pressure on the transit countries delivering gas .
we could have a delivery problem when belarus for example , decides to block its pipelines or if russia once again has a gas row with ukraine .
one can not rule out the fact that europe too , for whatever reason , could have a dispute with russia .
that would then threaten energy supplies . for this reason , europe must promote domestic energy providers in order to reduce its dependence on gas imports .
and it 's also important for europe to improve upon its energy effiiciency . you have already mentioned nuclear energy .
should germany rethink its planned phasing out of nuclear power ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy expert claudia kemfert problems could naturally arise when nuclear plants need to be replaced by gas or conventional coal power plants .
with gas-fired plants there is the danger that we could become too heavily dependent on energy imports , for instance from russia.we know that coal plants generate excessive carbon dioxide emissions and greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change . besides , germany is a signatory to the kyoto protocol , so there is a real danger that we may not stick to the promised cuts in co2 emissions .
that 's why we are pushing to extend the life span of safe nuclear plants so that we have enough time to strengthen domestic energy providers .
the focus in the long term should however not be on nuclear energy , but on strenghtening renewable energy sources so that we have a good energy mix . germany has in the past relied hugely on gas deliveries , a fact that has influenced the german position within europe . would a diversification of energy sources change this situation ?
a bit .
as head of the eu presidency , germany will make it clear that it wants to pursue a policy change and diversify its energy . besides , it has to be made further clear that we are aware that there could be delivery problems and that germany would like to see more transparency in the russian energy market .
we have to make it clear to the russians where our interests lie .
but at the same time we should be prepared to accept the russian need to sell gas .
we all have legitimate economic interests , but when political interests begin to play a role , it must be made clear that western europe and germany do n't want to play along . if we seek other energy providers too in future , this could threaten the very good russian-german relations .
claudia kemfert is head of the division " energy , transport , environment " at the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw berlin -rrb- and is chair of environmental economics at berlin 's humboldt university . olga solonari interviewed claudia kemfert -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belarus official : deal reached in row with gazprom belarus said saturday it had reached an agreement with russian gas giant gazprom in their row over gas import prices , but gazprom said nothing had been signed yet .

german energy expert claudia kemfert talked to dw-world.de about ways to get around the problem . dw-world.de : the gas dispute between russia and belarus shows that moscow has been using the energy issue as a political tool .
what are the consequences for european and german energy policy ? claudia kemfert : both germany and europe realize from this dispute that we are dependent on russian gas exports .
a recurrent theme of european energy policy is to reduce such dependence , which means relying more on our own resources , such as renewable energy , but also nuclear energy .
at the same time we should try and avoid an energy squeeze by looking at tapping energy from other gas-supplying nations . which alternative countries are you referring to ? at the moment , gas is already supplied by norway -lrb- which is not an eu member -rrb- , but there are limits to the supply .
then there are countries such as qatar , which are capable of delivering gas to europe .
pipelines are also being built precisely for this reason .
there is also the potential of liquified natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- .
germany missed the opportunity to construct tankers specially designed to store the gas .
one is being planned at the port of wilhelmshaven , but it wo n't be in service until 2010 .
and one tanker wo n't be enough .
it 's obvious that we have n't prepared well in order to diversify our energy sources . what needs to change at the political level so that we can tap energy from other sources ? in the past we were hugely dependent on one energy provider . russia has been a reliable supplier , no doubt about it , but the kremlin also has a political agenda and puts pressure on the transit countries delivering gas .
we could have a delivery problem when belarus for example , decides to block its pipelines or if russia once again has a gas row with ukraine .
one can not rule out the fact that europe too , for whatever reason , could have a dispute with russia .
that would then threaten energy supplies . for this reason , europe must promote domestic energy providers in order to reduce its dependence on gas imports .
and it 's also important for europe to improve upon its energy effiiciency . you have already mentioned nuclear energy .
should germany rethink its planned phasing out of nuclear power ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy expert claudia kemfert problems could naturally arise when nuclear plants need to be replaced by gas or conventional coal power plants .
with gas-fired plants there is the danger that we could become too heavily dependent on energy imports , for instance from russia.we know that coal plants generate excessive carbon dioxide emissions and greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change . besides , germany is a signatory to the kyoto protocol , so there is a real danger that we may not stick to the promised cuts in co2 emissions .
that 's why we are pushing to extend the life span of safe nuclear plants so that we have enough time to strengthen domestic energy providers .
the focus in the long term should however not be on nuclear energy , but on strenghtening renewable energy sources so that we have a good energy mix . germany has in the past relied hugely on gas deliveries , a fact that has influenced the german position within europe . would a diversification of energy sources change this situation ?
a bit .
as head of the eu presidency , germany will make it clear that it wants to pursue a policy change and diversify its energy . besides , it has to be made further clear that we are aware that there could be delivery problems and that germany would like to see more transparency in the russian energy market .
we have to make it clear to the russians where our interests lie .
but at the same time we should be prepared to accept the russian need to sell gas .
we all have legitimate economic interests , but when political interests begin to play a role , it must be made clear that western europe and germany do n't want to play along . if we seek other energy providers too in future , this could threaten the very good russian-german relations .

one is being planned at the port of wilhelmshaven , but it wo n't be in service until 2010 .
and one tanker wo n't be enough .
it 's obvious that we have n't prepared well in order to diversify our energy sources . what needs to change at the political level so that we can tap energy from other sources ? in the past we were hugely dependent on one energy provider . russia has been a reliable supplier , no doubt about it , but the kremlin also has a political agenda and puts pressure on the transit countries delivering gas .
we could have a delivery problem when belarus for example , decides to block its pipelines or if russia once again has a gas row with ukraine .
one can not rule out the fact that europe too , for whatever reason , could have a dispute with russia .
that would then threaten energy supplies . for this reason , europe must promote domestic energy providers in order to reduce its dependence on gas imports .
and it 's also important for europe to improve upon its energy effiiciency . you have already mentioned nuclear energy .
should germany rethink its planned phasing out of nuclear power ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy expert claudia kemfert problems could naturally arise when nuclear plants need to be replaced by gas or conventional coal power plants .
with gas-fired plants there is the danger that we could become too heavily dependent on energy imports , for instance from russia.we know that coal plants generate excessive carbon dioxide emissions and greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change . besides , germany is a signatory to the kyoto protocol , so there is a real danger that we may not stick to the promised cuts in co2 emissions .
that 's why we are pushing to extend the life span of safe nuclear plants so that we have enough time to strengthen domestic energy providers .
the focus in the long term should however not be on nuclear energy , but on strenghtening renewable energy sources so that we have a good energy mix . germany has in the past relied hugely on gas deliveries , a fact that has influenced the german position within europe . would a diversification of energy sources change this situation ?
a bit .
as head of the eu presidency , germany will make it clear that it wants to pursue a policy change and diversify its energy . besides , it has to be made further clear that we are aware that there could be delivery problems and that germany would like to see more transparency in the russian energy market .
we have to make it clear to the russians where our interests lie .
but at the same time we should be prepared to accept the russian need to sell gas .
we all have legitimate economic interests , but when political interests begin to play a role , it must be made clear that western europe and germany do n't want to play along . if we seek other energy providers too in future , this could threaten the very good russian-german relations .
claudia kemfert is head of the division " energy , transport , environment " at the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw berlin -rrb- and is chair of environmental economics at berlin 's humboldt university . olga solonari interviewed claudia kemfert -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belarus official : deal reached in row with gazprom belarus said saturday it had reached an agreement with russian gas giant gazprom in their row over gas import prices , but gazprom said nothing had been signed yet .

-lrb- 01.01.2007 -rrb- russia belarus gas pricing row sparks jitters in europe russia and belarus are meeting to try and defuse a gas war that could threaten supplies to the eu .

it wants the european union to support its efforts . italy has asked the european union for support in its bid to impose a global moratorium on the death penalty in the wake of saddam hussein 's execution . " i believe this must constitute one of the top commitments of our international efforts because it is urgent to have an initiative to put an end to the barbarianism of the death penalty , " italian foreign minister massimo d 'alema told news agency ansa . in a statement released earlier this week , the italian foreign ministry said the 27-member bloc should discuss a common strategy designed to increase international support for the moratorium at an informal meeting of eu political directorates set for jan 11-12 in dresden , germany . " the recent cases of capital punishments and executions present us with the need to draw the attention of the international community to a renewed initiative designed to promote a moratorium on the death penalty , in view of its complete abolition , " the statement said . italy , a largely catholic country , was shocked by televised images of the former iraqi dictator hanging .
it is now leading diplomatic efforts to bring about a global ban on capital punishment . italy has just become a non-permanent member of the united nations security council .
its ambassador in new york , marcello spatafora , has asked officials to put the moratorium on the agenda of the un general assembly . italian politician on hunger strike is hospitalized meanwhile , the head of italy 's radical party , marco pannella , agreed to be hospitalized on thursday as he entered the second week of his hunger strike to push for a worldwide moratorium on capital punishment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 76-year-old pannella has carried out several hunger strikes in the past on wednesday , he had begun accepting water .

he has staged hunger strikes in support of a number of causes over his political career . pannella was a leading advocate of legalized abortion and divorce in the 1970s and 1980s . condemnation is not enough rome 's initiative will involve 85 un member states that signed a non-binding declaration in december against the death penalty , prime minister romano prodi said . " the government is not content with condemning the death penalty , it will act , " prodi said . capital punishment is outlawed in all european union countries , but it is widely practiced in two of the un security council 's five permanent members - china and the united states . iraq deflects italian criticism however , iraq has rebuffed italian criticism , noting that the italians themselves had executed former fascist leader benito mussolini during world war ii .
the dictator was executed by partisans and strung up in a square in milan in 1945 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 04.01.2007 dual seat of german government costs taxpayers dearly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellery has moved to berlin , but six ministries are still in bonn germany has over the past decade spent 196 million euros -lrb- $ 260 million -rrb- to maintain ministry offices in both berlin and bonn , according to a report .
and the waste is unlikely to end soon . german taxpayers have forked out the money to pay for the cost of government workers traveling between berlin and bonn and for special benefits these officials receive , according to a report on thursday in bild newspaper . no other country in the world seems to be willing to afford the doubtful luxury of a seat of government split between two cities .
germany 's unique situation arose from the so-called bonn-berlin law of 1994 which aimed to ensure that bonn would not suffer economically from large parts of the government moving to the new capital , berlin . even today , six ministries , including those for development , defence , environment and health have their headquarters in bonn and only smaller representations in berlin .
clearly , for the media the government and berlin form an inseparable unit .
but what is hardly known is that the majority of government officials still work in bonn - some 10 , 200 , while only a little over 8,000 work in berlin . commuting from one place to another has become a daily phenomenon for german government workers .
some officials say that even with the help of modern telecommunications technology , such as e-mail , video conferencing and instant messaging , traveling between berlin and bonn is an absolute necessity . " sheer madness " " i can use -lrb- those means -rrb- to have contacts with other people in the ministry in bonn , " said rolf eckermann , an official in the development ministry .
but that was not enough , he said .
" it is very difficult to work if the other people are 600 kilometers away .
you have modern technology , but you have to also have the personal contact . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's state wo n't feel the brunt of the ministries leaving bonn lower saxony 's conservative state premier , christian wulff , is one of the small number of chancellor angela merkel 's party colleagues who have come out in favor of moving all ministries to berlin . " i believe that where there 's a will , there 's a way , " wulff has said .
" the real question here is whether those affected on both sides are actually keen on a speedy solution . " opposition green party parliamentary spokesman jürgen trittin has been more direct .
he 's called the dual seat of government ' sheer madness . ' many officials working in bonn have no way of catching up with the speedy flow of information in berlin , the former federal environment minister has said .
trittin says the decision-making process was severely hampered by the dual offices .
at a time when ordinary germans are called upon to tighten their belts , wasting money on constant commuter flights between bonn and berlin is no longer acceptable , he has said . but opponents of a complete move to berlin find it relatively easy to ward off this financial argument .
they refer to a recent study compiled by an independent panel which said that the move would cost up to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- .
compared to that , the 196 million euros spent on commuting so far seem like peanuts . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the reichstag : from political to architectural symbol kaiser wilhelm i laid the first stone in 1882 .

and the waste is unlikely to end soon . german taxpayers have forked out the money to pay for the cost of government workers traveling between berlin and bonn and for special benefits these officials receive , according to a report on thursday in bild newspaper . no other country in the world seems to be willing to afford the doubtful luxury of a seat of government split between two cities .
germany 's unique situation arose from the so-called bonn-berlin law of 1994 which aimed to ensure that bonn would not suffer economically from large parts of the government moving to the new capital , berlin . even today , six ministries , including those for development , defence , environment and health have their headquarters in bonn and only smaller representations in berlin .
clearly , for the media the government and berlin form an inseparable unit .
but what is hardly known is that the majority of government officials still work in bonn - some 10 , 200 , while only a little over 8,000 work in berlin . commuting from one place to another has become a daily phenomenon for german government workers .
some officials say that even with the help of modern telecommunications technology , such as e-mail , video conferencing and instant messaging , traveling between berlin and bonn is an absolute necessity . " sheer madness " " i can use -lrb- those means -rrb- to have contacts with other people in the ministry in bonn , " said rolf eckermann , an official in the development ministry .
but that was not enough , he said .
" it is very difficult to work if the other people are 600 kilometers away .
you have modern technology , but you have to also have the personal contact . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's state wo n't feel the brunt of the ministries leaving bonn lower saxony 's conservative state premier , christian wulff , is one of the small number of chancellor angela merkel 's party colleagues who have come out in favor of moving all ministries to berlin . " i believe that where there 's a will , there 's a way , " wulff has said .
" the real question here is whether those affected on both sides are actually keen on a speedy solution . " opposition green party parliamentary spokesman jürgen trittin has been more direct .
he 's called the dual seat of government ' sheer madness . ' many officials working in bonn have no way of catching up with the speedy flow of information in berlin , the former federal environment minister has said .
trittin says the decision-making process was severely hampered by the dual offices .
at a time when ordinary germans are called upon to tighten their belts , wasting money on constant commuter flights between bonn and berlin is no longer acceptable , he has said . but opponents of a complete move to berlin find it relatively easy to ward off this financial argument .
they refer to a recent study compiled by an independent panel which said that the move would cost up to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- .
compared to that , the 196 million euros spent on commuting so far seem like peanuts . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the reichstag : from political to architectural symbol kaiser wilhelm i laid the first stone in 1882 .

germany 's unique situation arose from the so-called bonn-berlin law of 1994 which aimed to ensure that bonn would not suffer economically from large parts of the government moving to the new capital , berlin . even today , six ministries , including those for development , defence , environment and health have their headquarters in bonn and only smaller representations in berlin .
clearly , for the media the government and berlin form an inseparable unit .
but what is hardly known is that the majority of government officials still work in bonn - some 10 , 200 , while only a little over 8,000 work in berlin . commuting from one place to another has become a daily phenomenon for german government workers .
some officials say that even with the help of modern telecommunications technology , such as e-mail , video conferencing and instant messaging , traveling between berlin and bonn is an absolute necessity . " sheer madness " " i can use -lrb- those means -rrb- to have contacts with other people in the ministry in bonn , " said rolf eckermann , an official in the development ministry .

" our economic systems are based on the same values , " she said .
" we must watch out that we do not drift apart but instead come closer together , where there are clear advantages for both sides . " she said it was her ambition to create a single transatlantic market for investors , with common rules and standards on issues such as intellectual property and financial regulation . merkel wants us support for mideast as europe 's biggest economy and most populous country , germany faces high expectations for the dual presidencies which by coincidence fall together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel plans to push for a solution to the mideast conflict spokesmen for the two leaders said merkel and bush would take up international crises including the stalled middle east peace process , efforts to quell violence in afghanistan and iraq , iran 's disputed nuclear ambitions , instability in lebanon and efforts to decide the final status of kosovo . " the german role on all of these issues will be especially important in 2007 , " white house deputy press secretary scott stanzel said . germany plans to call a meeting " as soon as possible " to revitalize the so-called middle east quartet grouping the eu , the united states , russia and the united nations amid grumbling in europe that washington has allowed the peace process to languish as iraq has consumed its attention . " we would like to see the quartet take on a stronger role , " merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said wednesday . tough talks on energy merkel will also press bush on cutting greenhouse gases amid mounting european frustration at a us refusal to ratify the kyoto protocol , which runs out in 2012 , or on proposing a viable alternative . " of course we must and will talk with the americans about the fact that they too should commit to reducing carbon dioxide -lrb- emissions -rrb- , " merkel told the january issue of the political monthly cicero .
" it is a tough problem to tackle . " the eu wants to forge a common position for negotiations on the successor to the kyoto pact by march .
germany would like the bloc to commit to reducing harmful emissions by 30 percent by 2020 . merkel and bush are also likely to discuss g8 plans to rein in highly speculative hedge funds , which have wrought instability on international financial markets . in a meeting last month , merkel and us treasury secretary henry paulson agreed that action was needed to avert risks and protect investors and that more transparency must be fostered with the g8 which groups britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states and russia . germany , us back on friendly terms the one-day visit to washington will be merkel 's third since she took office almost 14 months ago . she has moved to recalibrate german foreign policy at the helm of a " grand coalition " government grouping her conservative christian union bloc and their chief political rivals , the social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped the good chemistry between merkel and bush will translate into shared political positions merkel has also actively sought to heal the rift with washington she inherited from her predecessor gerhard schröder , whose ties with bush turned frosty over his vocal opposition to the us-led iraq war . carsten voigt , the german government 's coordinator for transatlantic relations , said german-american relations are back on a friendly footing now that the bush administration is apparently seeking a rapprochement with its allies and international partners . " there is a clear tendency now in the united states at least rhetorically to move more in the direction of listening to allies and friends than in the direction to dominate them , and that they move more in the direction of international organizations like the united nations , " voigt told dw-radio . " everybody in europe is now looking whether these rhetorical changes in washington mean changes in substance , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel seeks closer us-eu economic cooperation in front of a trip to washington , german chancellor angela merkel said in an interview published on wednesday she wants to see " ever-closer economic cooperation " between the european union and the united states .

" our economic systems are based on the same values , " she said .
" we must watch out that we do not drift apart but instead come closer together , where there are clear advantages for both sides . " she said it was her ambition to create a single transatlantic market for investors , with common rules and standards on issues such as intellectual property and financial regulation . merkel wants us support for mideast as europe 's biggest economy and most populous country , germany faces high expectations for the dual presidencies which by coincidence fall together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel plans to push for a solution to the mideast conflict spokesmen for the two leaders said merkel and bush would take up international crises including the stalled middle east peace process , efforts to quell violence in afghanistan and iraq , iran 's disputed nuclear ambitions , instability in lebanon and efforts to decide the final status of kosovo . " the german role on all of these issues will be especially important in 2007 , " white house deputy press secretary scott stanzel said . germany plans to call a meeting " as soon as possible " to revitalize the so-called middle east quartet grouping the eu , the united states , russia and the united nations amid grumbling in europe that washington has allowed the peace process to languish as iraq has consumed its attention . " we would like to see the quartet take on a stronger role , " merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said wednesday . tough talks on energy merkel will also press bush on cutting greenhouse gases amid mounting european frustration at a us refusal to ratify the kyoto protocol , which runs out in 2012 , or on proposing a viable alternative . " of course we must and will talk with the americans about the fact that they too should commit to reducing carbon dioxide -lrb- emissions -rrb- , " merkel told the january issue of the political monthly cicero .
" it is a tough problem to tackle . " the eu wants to forge a common position for negotiations on the successor to the kyoto pact by march .
germany would like the bloc to commit to reducing harmful emissions by 30 percent by 2020 . merkel and bush are also likely to discuss g8 plans to rein in highly speculative hedge funds , which have wrought instability on international financial markets . in a meeting last month , merkel and us treasury secretary henry paulson agreed that action was needed to avert risks and protect investors and that more transparency must be fostered with the g8 which groups britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states and russia . germany , us back on friendly terms the one-day visit to washington will be merkel 's third since she took office almost 14 months ago . she has moved to recalibrate german foreign policy at the helm of a " grand coalition " government grouping her conservative christian union bloc and their chief political rivals , the social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped the good chemistry between merkel and bush will translate into shared political positions merkel has also actively sought to heal the rift with washington she inherited from her predecessor gerhard schröder , whose ties with bush turned frosty over his vocal opposition to the us-led iraq war . carsten voigt , the german government 's coordinator for transatlantic relations , said german-american relations are back on a friendly footing now that the bush administration is apparently seeking a rapprochement with its allies and international partners . " there is a clear tendency now in the united states at least rhetorically to move more in the direction of listening to allies and friends than in the direction to dominate them , and that they move more in the direction of international organizations like the united nations , " voigt told dw-radio .

hollywood legends richard burton and elizabeth taylor were among names captured by freelance photographer raymond daniel in a 40-year career .
images of prince charles and baroness thatcher also feature in his book camera 'r cymro -lrb- welshman 's camera -rrb- .
mr daniel , from llanddewi-brefi , saw his work published around the world .

" people asked me what it was like taking photos of people like richard burton and elizabeth taylor , but i was thinking about which of my lenses would give me the best shot .

mr daniel first photographed burton in 1971 while the welsh actor was filming dylan thomas ' under milk wood in fishguard , pembrokeshire .
he is photographed with comedian ryan davies .
author and freelance journalist lyn ebenezer , who was with mr daniel when many of the pictures were taken , recalls the " memorable day " .

when i came back later and the pub was packed .
" i still had my pint at the bar so i tapped this person on the shoulder to ask him to pass it to me and that person happened to be richard burton .
" he was a lovely man and cancelled the rest of the day 's filming and spent it with us talking . "
in 1975 , burton , his brothers verdun and dai , and taylor visited aberystwyth to see her son who had moved to live nearby , and mr daniel was on hand again to record the occasion .
" he -lrb- mr daniel -rrb- is the sort of bloke you do n't realise is there .
his pictures are very natural , " added mr ebenezer , who was working for the welsh-language newspaper y cymro at the time and writes the text in welsh to accompany the book of photographs .
" when prince charles studied at aberystwyth university for a term in 1969 , ray took a photo of him , " said mr ebenezer .
" some years later someone who knew ray had been to the prince 's home at highgrove and saw the photo framed and hanging in his house . "

music critics and broadcasters were asked to name their favourite new artists , with the results compiled into a top 10 .
the winner and full list will be revealed on friday .
there is no point analysing the origins of the twang , according to phil etheridge , the band 's 25-year-old songwriter and mouthy frontman .
being in a band just seemed an obvious way for five music-loving mates from a run-down part of birmingham to meet up and have a laugh .
" you just form a band .
you just do , do n't you ?
i do n't even know how it 's happened , " he says .
the twang stand out for being uncomplicated , unpretentious and endearingly honest .
the band are already getting a reputation for rowdiness they are also ambitious , fiercely committed and not short of charisma or talent - a combination that brings back memories of oasis and the happy mondays .
their songs caused a stir in the music press before a record deal was signed .
and as long as their tunes are good , the band see no point dissecting how they happen or where they come from .
" it sounds how it sounds , " the singer says .
" it 's just got to sound good .
it 's got to make your hair stand up , innit ?
" next is to make a good record , make an album that 's the best album of the last five years . "
etheridge and fellow frontman martin saunders deliver vocals that range from dreamy and wistful to loud and lairy , while stuart hartland 's guitar provides an expansive , anthemic backdrop .
all of which has led to comparisons with baggy-era manchester bands like the mondays and stone roses .
i ai n't going to sing about rivers , man , i do n't live by a river - i live by a canal and there 's bikes in it phil etheridge the twang frontman the band themselves say oasis and the streets are bigger heroes .
and the twang 's swagger is likely to be seized upon by those who think indie bands these days are too sensitive , styled or insincere .
or as etheridge puts it : " we 're normal lads instead of some little posh div .
" people like lads who talk about what they do with their mates , do n't they ?
" i ai n't going to sing about rivers , man .
i do n't live by a river .
i live by a canal and there 's bikes in it . "
and the twang are already getting a reputation for rowdiness - the story of bassist jon watkin 's arrest for wielding a samurai sword has spread almost as fast as their music .
' mischievous ' " years ago , when he was young and foolish , he got arrested with a samurai sword chasing some rockers , " says etheridge .
" he got chinned outside his house .
he went in to get an instrument and the closest thing at hand was a samurai sword on the wall .
we just have a laugh , and obviously sometimes that might be a little bit more rowdy than you and your friends having a dinner party phil etheridge " he went up the road to get ' em , but he got nicked with it because you ca n't walk down the street with a samurai sword in your hand . "
but the five friends are " just mischievous " , he insists .
" look at me - i 'm 10st 8lb -lrb- 67kg -rrb- , i do n't go out brawling , none of us do .
" we just have a laugh , and obviously sometimes that might be a little bit more rowdy than you and your friends having a dinner party , but it 's only done in jest . "
the fivesome are trying to do something with their lives , see the world and make some money , he says .
" it 's pretty obvious that we 're not insane .
" but there 's not that many lad bands around so i can see that the media are going to want to blow that up . "
more than 130 impartial uk-based music writers , editors and broadcasters took part in to the sound of 2007 poll by naming their three favourite new acts .

music critics and broadcasters were asked to name their favourite new artists , with the results compiled into a top 10 .
the winner and full list will be revealed on friday .
there is no point analysing the origins of the twang , according to phil etheridge , the band 's 25-year-old songwriter and mouthy frontman .
being in a band just seemed an obvious way for five music-loving mates from a run-down part of birmingham to meet up and have a laugh .
" you just form a band .
you just do , do n't you ?
i do n't even know how it 's happened , " he says .

from 1 february its customers will be charged the cash advance rate rather than the normal purchase rate .
that means they will immediately pay interest at between 21.9 % and 27.8 % instead of between 15.9 % and 22.9 % .
however , customers will not be charged a one-off fee , which is applied to other cash transactions such as buying foreign currency .
" this is one of a number of changes we have made to our credit card offering recently to bring us in line with the competition , " an hsbc spokeswoman said .
varying policies there is no uniform policy on charging for gambling across the uk credit card industry .
barclaycard and lloyds charge such spending at their lower purchase rates .
but mbna and rbs / natwest and egg charge at the cash advance rate .
in 2004 , the us bank citibank decided to stop processing any internet gambling payments at all by uk holders of its credit cards .
it said at the time this was partly an anti-fraud measure and warned that online gambling might lead to some customers running up unmanageable debts .
one potential loophole in hsbc 's strategy is that any payments channelled via the online payment service paypal will be charged as a retail purchase , attracting a lower rate of interest .
hsbc said neither it nor any other banks could tell what the ultimate destination of a paypal transaction money might be .
bad risk ?
in the past year all the main banks have complained loudly that they have been racking up more bad loans in their credit card businesses .
normally a decision by a bank to charge more would signify that it had seen an increased risk of losing money in that particular line of business .
but hsbc denied that customers who gamble using their credit cards are more likely to run up big debts and then default on them .
" we have not seen that as part of our customers ' behaviour , " said the hsbc spokeswoman .
hsbc 's decision will apply to both internet and telephone gambling and thus covers online poker , internet bookies and betting exchanges .
however , it is illegal to use a credit card in a casino , while the betting industry has a policy of not accepting them in high street bookies .
according to the association of payment clearing services -lrb- apacs -rrb- , people in the uk spent £ 1.51bn on gambling via their credit cards in the twelve months to june 2006 .
that was just 0.8 % of all credit card spending which amounted to £ 120.2bn.

all the resorts are getting the benefit with snow falling down to 800 metres -lrb- 2,600ft -rrb- .
this christmas was one of the worst on record with very poor snowfalls .
the economic consequences for some resorts were terrible as some people cancelled their holidays and stayed at home .
a handful of people have even called off their holidays later in the season on the strength of poor snow so far this winter .
many resorts could not open fully , while others relied on artificial snow .
i was in the swiss resort of verbier and , although it was open , the slopes were very crowded as it was one of the few areas with snow .
all that has now changed .
heavy snowfall " we 've had well over a quarter of a metre of snow in the past 24 hours and winter has now well and truly begun , " julian griffiths , the director of the verbier ski school , european snowsport told the bbc news website .
" it 's a shame it was not here for christmas but thankfully it is here now . "
in other parts of switzerland up to three-quarters of a metre -lrb- 2ft 5in -rrb- has fallen .
the resort of crans montana , which was unable to open large parts of its slopes over christmas , has received 30cm -lrb- 1ft -rrb- .
italy has also received significant snow , and sestriere , which hosted many of the winter olympic events last year , has seen almost 40cm -lrb- 1ft 3in -rrb- of snowfall .
" the conditions really are great ; there is blue sky across much of the alps today and the wind has also dropped , " says ali morgan from the ski club of great britain .
further snow is expected to fall before the weekend .
the snow however has brought its problems with power cuts and traffic disruption .
on monday a 27-year-old man died near gstaad in switzerland in an avalanche .
christmas threatened over the border in parts of austria the avalanche alert is at its second highest level due to the heavy snow in the tyrol and vorarlberg regions .
the lack of snowfall and changing weather patterns has got some people asking if the traditional christmas skiing holiday may eventually become a thing of the past with no snow in many resorts across the alps .
the organisation for economic co-operation and development reports that banks are refusing to lend money to some low resorts because of their bleak future .
resorts are starting to offer other activities like ice climbing " twenty years ago i thought global warming would affect my grand-children 's skiing , but now it is affecting me , " says peter hardy , the co-editor of the great skiing and snowboarding guide .
" i would never book a ski holiday in a resort below 1850 metres -lrb- 6,000ft -rrb- over christmas , the snowfall is simply not reliable enough and the situation looks like getting worse . "
ski resorts diversify ski resorts now realise that they have to adapt to the changing weather patterns and many are now offering alternative things to do in the mountains .
the adventurous can try ice climbing or paragliding , while the less adventurous might prefer snowshoe walking , ice skating or cross-country skiing .
health and fitness centres are also being heavily marketed .
the french resort of tignes , one of the highest in the alps at over 2000 metres -lrb- 6,500ft -rrb- with guaranteed snow , has spent millions of euros on a new fitness centre in the heart of the resort with pools , saunas and steam rooms .
" for the first time we have seen many more people doing these other activities and having a winter sports holiday , not just a skiing holiday , " says marion telsnig from crystal holidays .
in part this is due to the lack of snow , but i have done all the other winter sports this season and they are great fun , although ice climbing is not for the faint hearted .
if the current weather patterns continue then people who wish to go to ski resorts over christmas may have to change their expectations and look for other things to do in the mountains besides skiing .

the prediction of a shortfall of 14,000 nurses was included in the department of health paper , it was reported .
the strategy has been labelled a " yo-yo attitude " to planning .
the leak comes amid news of extensive job cuts as the nhs tries to save money .
but the government said it was a " prudent and sensible " analysis .
the document , part of the draft version of the nhs pay and workforce strategy for 2008 to 2011 in england , were reported in the health service journal .
it predicted there will be volatility in the immediate future with as much as a reduction of 2.7 % - nearly 37,000 jobs - in the workforce this year alone .
but it said by 2011 the health service will experience a shortage of 1,200 gps , 14,000 nurses and 1,100 junior and staff-grade doctors by 2011 . "
it demonstrates a yo-yo attitude to workforce planning and a complete absence of joined up thinking from the government " janet davies , royal college of nursing there will also be 3,200 extra consultants that the nhs can not afford to pay , as well as 16,000 other health professionals such as physios , health scientists and technicians .
the draft strategy , discussed by department of health officials in december , sets out a series of controversial measures to remedy the situation .
it said nurse pay could be dictated by local market rates , and that unemployment could be used to " create downward pressure on wages " .
temporary staff the document also suggested a new grade of sub-consultant be created to save money , although this would be " bitterly opposed " by unions .
it also suggested the increased use of temporary staff and short-term contracts .
the shortage of nurses has been put down to cuts made to training budgets as a result of the nhs 's financial problems .
meanwhile , excess consultant numbers can be explained by the movement of care away from hospitals and into the community . "
the effect on morale will be dire " andrew lansley , shadow health secretary dr jonathan fielden , chairman of the british medical association 's -lrb- bma -rrb- consultants ' committee , said cutting consultant posts was " absurd " .
" to describe this as a responsible piece of planning , i think is incorrect , because to be responsible they should be involving those who are directly involved in the service - i.e. consultants in particular - in planning the numbers they require . "
prediction difficulties janet davies , director at the royal college of nursing , said : " it demonstrates a yo-yo attitude to workforce planning and a complete absence of joined up thinking from the government .
" quite simply , if the reality of this document matches the leaks , then this is a bad news day for patients and for nurses . "
shadow health secretary andrew lansley said the 2.7 % cut this year equated to nearly 37,000 posts , adding : " the effect on morale will be dire . "
" the truth is that workforce planning within the healthcare system is a bit like landing a jumbo jet on a pin " niall dickson , king 's fund and liberal democrat health spokesman norman lamb added : " it is absurd that newly qualified doctors and nurses are faced with less new jobs due to deficits at the same time as the government is predicting a shortage of nurses and gps . "
but a department of health spokesman said it was about " stabilising " staff numbers .
he added : " it is therefore only prudent and sensible to analyse what the workforce make-up should be to meet those challenges .
" to portray a responsible piece of planning as another ' crisis for the nhs story ' is alarmist mischief-making on a grand scale . "
and niall dickson , chief executive of the king 's fund , said : " workforce planning within the healthcare system is a bit like landing a jumbo jet on a pin .

the prediction of a shortfall of 14,000 nurses was included in the department of health paper , it was reported .
the strategy has been labelled a " yo-yo attitude " to planning .
the leak comes amid news of extensive job cuts as the nhs tries to save money .
but the government said it was a " prudent and sensible " analysis .
the document , part of the draft version of the nhs pay and workforce strategy for 2008 to 2011 in england , were reported in the health service journal .
it predicted there will be volatility in the immediate future with as much as a reduction of 2.7 % - nearly 37,000 jobs - in the workforce this year alone .
but it said by 2011 the health service will experience a shortage of 1,200 gps , 14,000 nurses and 1,100 junior and staff-grade doctors by 2011 .
it demonstrates a yo-yo attitude to workforce planning and a complete absence of joined up thinking from the government janet davies , royal college of nursing there will also be 3,200 extra consultants that the nhs can not afford to pay , as well as 16,000 other health professionals such as physios , health scientists and technicians .
the draft strategy , discussed by department of health officials in december , sets out a series of controversial measures to remedy the situation .
it said nurse pay could be dictated by local market rates , and that unemployment could be used to " create downward pressure on wages " .
temporary staff the document also suggested a new grade of sub-consultant be created to save money , although this would be " bitterly opposed " by unions .
it also suggested the increased use of temporary staff and short-term contracts .
the shortage of nurses has been put down to cuts made to training budgets as a result of the nhs 's financial problems .
meanwhile , excess consultant numbers can be explained by the movement of care away from hospitals and into the community .
the effect on morale will be dire andrew lansley , shadow health secretary dr jonathan fielden , chairman of the british medical association 's -lrb- bma -rrb- consultants ' committee , said cutting consultant posts was " absurd " .

the adjutant-general , lt gen freddie viggers , told bbc news that defence chiefs must " fight our corner ... to get our families what they deserve " .
he spoke after bbc news received photos of barracks and shower blocks with cracked walls , mildew and broken pipes .
the government said it accepted accommodation was " not perfect , and that we need to improve it " .
conservative leader david cameron said the government should do more to improve living conditions for forces families .
last month , outgoing army head gen sir mike jackson said some forces accommodation was " frankly shaming " . "
it 's a key issue in what we call the military covenant - giving our soldiers and their families what they deserve in return for what they do for us " lt gen freddie viggers send us your experiences " the issue we have is that there is still too much accommodation which is of a poor standard , which is old , and which is not modern in the way it 's fitted for families , " gen viggers said .
" it 's a key issue in what we call the military covenant - giving our soldiers and their families what they deserve in return for what they do for us . "
people " must understand how poor some of this accommodation is " , he added .
" our duty now is to fight our corner , in defence , to get for our families what they deserve . "
bbc defence correspondent paul wood said gen viggers was the latest in a long line of senior officers to speak out publicly because they felt they were not winning the argument within whitehall .
' depressed and demoralised ' jennifer james , the mother of a young soldier who e-mailed pictures of his " shocking " barracks , said : " we treat prisoners better than our soldiers . "
her son said many soldiers were left " depressed and demoralised " because of the poor state of their housing , she added .
" he complains about the smell , the puddles and water on the floor from the leaking toilets .
" he just wishes he could get out of there . "
defence minister derek twigg said the government had " a sustained programme of investment in accommodation " .
" we 've spent £ 700m last year in improving service accommodation , " he added . "
they do so much for us and frankly we should do more for them " david cameron " we recognise there is a challenge , we recognise that the accommodation is not perfect and that we need to improve it . "
speaking on bbc radio 4 's today programme , mr cameron said : " they do so much for us and frankly we should do more for them . "
he said the tories planned to announce a " manifesto for forces families " addressing issues such as housing and education .
mr cameron also called for urgent action to improve accommodation for service people at brize norton , which is in his constituency .
douglas young , of the british armed forces federation , which represents forces staff , said there were big variations in standards of accommodation .
some very good work was being done to upgrade accommodation but all accommodation should be brought up to that standard , he said .
speaking last month , sir mike jackson hit out at a " kafka-esque situation whereby the mod congratulates itself on achieving an accommodation improvement plan defined by itself on what it calls affordability , but which is far from what is defined by the needs of soldiers and their families " .
