" in an interview with the newsmagazine stern , angela merkel rebuffed ongoing criticisms of her foreign policy .
opposition politicians have repeatedly critiqued merkel for her frequent trips abroad , as well as her decision to welcome the dalai lama in germany in september - an action which has threatened germany 's economic relationship with china .
the critics have also spoken out against merkel 's clear denunciations of human-rights infractions in china and russia .
foreign policy : a thin , blurred line ?
in her conversation with stern , merkel said it is " provincial to consider making foreign visits in order to lobby for our security , our environment and our well-being , less important " than domestic politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some argue that merkel 's focus on foreign policy is displaced " today there is no longer such a clear line between domestic and foreign policy , " merkel added .
merkel also said she would " continue to choose state visitors and foreign trips as i see fit and useful , when it comes to serving germany 's interests . "
" it is wrong and superfluous to play political values and economic success against each other , as if only one or the other is important , " merkel told stern .
" they belong together . "
criticism from steinmeier merkel said she thought her approach had made germany a more " respected partner in the world , even more so in the past two years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- right -rrb- , like his ex-boss schröder -lrb- left -rrb- has critiqued merkel 's policies the comment was seen as a clear jab at her social democratic predecessor gerhard schröder , whose government pursued a foreign policy that placated to china on human rights in favor of pursuing economic ties .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , also a social democrat , recently spoke out against merkel 's decisions on china policy .
during a visit to paris earlier in november , he told journalists he was " worried " about the escalating diplomatic tension between germany and china in the wake of the dalai lama 's visit .
" we have had better relations with china , that is unfortunately true , " steinmeier said .
" it is a development that we can not let remain as is . "
merkel : support on iran is key he added that it was in germany 's interest to reestablish good relations with china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some worry that merkel is risking economic ties with china since then , the issue has given rise to several political flare-ups .
but the chancellor defended her relationship with steinmeier , telling stern the two of them " work well together , in general . "
" if you look at other governments , we can be very content , " she said .
in her interview , merkel also pleaded with the international community to support germany in its attempt to find a diplomatic solution to the iran crisis . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he praises president bush 's clarity on establishing a palestinian state , but remains skeptical . peace is supposed to descend on the middle east .
it 's a goal to be achieved by the end of next year .
it 's a commendable goal that would prompt one to congratulate the parties involved .
if it were only that easy .
there have always been good intentions - mainly in the form of initiatives and declarations - in the past when it comes to the middle east , just as there have been dates and deadlines set .
the only problem is that they have expired without the desired result being achieved .
why should it be different this time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp in no way do i want to diminish the efforts made in trying to find a peaceful solution in the middle east .
it is just odd that , without even trying to get to the real core issues in the middle east conflict , peace is now supposed to be possible - more so than in the past .
and that uneasy feeling makes one believe that it 's only wishful thinking , particularly on the part of the us president .
after all , george w. bush wants to crown his presidency with at least one foreign policy success .
but he overlooks the fact that declarations of intention alone do not suffice to achieve that end .
otherwise , we would have had a pacified , free and democratic iraq as a role model for the rest of the arab world a long time ago .
control mechanisms stay on track still , president bush has promised that the united states will act as a kind of control mechanism for the implementation of a peaceful solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict and has said that enough pressure will be placed on both sides to keep them on track toward their own , self-defined goals .
this is a new move , considering that right at the beginning of his presidency , bush declared that the us would not play the mediator role in any middle east negotiations , thereby himself causing the now so regretted , years-long deadlock . that bush speaks so openly about establishing a palestinian state is also good , and right .
he is not the first us president to do so , but while it sounded like a vision for the future when bill clinton said it , with bush , it sounds like a target for the negotiations during the next 12 months .
west bank remains controversial this is definitely progress .
but , the president still does not seem to understand , for example , that not merely a few " illegal settlement posts " have to be dissolved to achieve that goal , but that the israeli settlements in the west bank will have to be completely vacated - one of the greatest impediments to peace .
like no other president before him , bush has stood behind israeli policies in the occupied territories throughout his term of office , so he will now have quite a bit of work to do to convince others that it will be different in the future . despite all the skepticism , a step in the right direction has been taken in annapolis .
but the stretch to the finish line has hardly been shortened as a result .
many steps must still be made to get closer to that goal and , experience with the players in the middle east as well as with this president , could teach us a lesson .
that is : one way or another , things will go wrong .

a last round of negotiations between serbia and kosovo by a un-sponsored troika of envoys regarding the future status of kosovo failed to reach an agreement . " the baden conference marks the end of face-to-face talks " between serbia and kosovo , wolfgang ischinger , the eu 's representative in the kosovo troika , said at a press conference in vienna on wednesday , nov .
28 .
" regrettably the parties were unable to reach agreement . " the us envoy to the talks , frank wisner , called on belgrade and pristina to uphold promises not to engage in violence , adding that peace in the balkans was " very much at stake . " the mediators , who said they probed every solution that was " humanly possible , " are scheduled to make final visits to serbia and kosovo next monday before submitting a report to the united nations , due by dec .

10 the failed talks set the stage for the province 's independence , as kosovo 's leaders , who enjoy the support of washington , said they wanted independence " very soon . "
the call for independence was one of the few issues that united ethnic albanians in kosovo during parliamentary elections earlier this month . " we regret that serbia did not find it possible to agree to the independent final state of kosovo , " the province 's likely new prime minister , hashim thaci , said at the conclusion of the three days of talks . belgrade 's leaders , however , have offered only a degree of autonomy to the province and repeatedly vowed not to accept kosovo 's secession from serbia . " we are going to cancel all these decisions by kosovo authorities leading to independence and use all legal instruments , " serbian president boris tadic warned .
" this is a very serious situation . " balkan domino effect feared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato troops have been stationed in kosovo for eight years some observers have said a unilateral declaration of independence on the part of kosovo could encourage the serb-populated northern part of the province to secede , and possibly even lead to similar moves by serbs in bosnia and albanians in macedonia , which could then cause unrest . pristina made it clear that it had never intended to budge from achieving full independence " we have not sought belgrade 's consent but partnership with serbia , " kosovo delegation member veton surroi told reporters . the serbian province , 90 percent of whose population is ethnic albanian , has been under un administration and nato protection since the military alliance ended violence there in 1999 . security council impasse expected serbia insisted talks had to be continued even after the dec .
10 deadline set by un secretary general ban ki-moon .
a stalemate in the security council is likely as russia is expected to block any decision that does not meet with belgrade 's approval . " we have to wait for a security council decision , " prime minister vojislav kostunica said .
unilateral action on the part of pristina would trigger similar responses , serbia 's leaders warned . kosovo 's president fatmir sejdiu made it clear after the meeting that pristina would not consent to new talks .

he praises president bush 's clarity on establishing a palestinian state , but remains skeptical . peace is supposed to descend on the middle east .
it 's a goal to be achieved by the end of next year .
it 's a commendable goal that would prompt one to congratulate the parties involved .
if it were only that easy .
there have always been good intentions - mainly in the form of initiatives and declarations - in the past when it comes to the middle east , just as there have been dates and deadlines set .
the only problem is that they have expired without the desired result being achieved .
why should it be different this time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp in no way do i want to diminish the efforts made in trying to find a peaceful solution in the middle east .
it is just odd that , without even trying to get to the real core issues in the middle east conflict , peace is now supposed to be possible - more so than in the past .
and that uneasy feeling makes one believe that it 's only wishful thinking , particularly on the part of the us president .
after all , george w. bush wants to crown his presidency with at least one foreign policy success .
but he overlooks the fact that declarations of intention alone do not suffice to achieve that end .
otherwise , we would have had a pacified , free and democratic iraq as a role model for the rest of the arab world a long time ago .
control mechanisms stay on track still , president bush has promised that the united states will act as a kind of control mechanism for the implementation of a peaceful solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict and has said that enough pressure will be placed on both sides to keep them on track toward their own , self-defined goals .
this is a new move , considering that right at the beginning of his presidency , bush declared that the us would not play the mediator role in any middle east negotiations , thereby himself causing the now so regretted , years-long deadlock . that bush speaks so openly about establishing a palestinian state is also good , and right .
he is not the first us president to do so , but while it sounded like a vision for the future when bill clinton said it , with bush , it sounds like a target for the negotiations during the next 12 months .

but while they may be the hottest new german art export , they are n't the only ones . moma – four magic letters that open the door to art-world success .
any artist , whose work has been shown at moma - the museum of modern art , in new york , can surely say they have " made it . "
gert and uwe tobias can now lay claim to that fame .
from wednesday , nov .
28 through feb .
25 , moma is showing 20 works by the 34-year-old twins from cologne , germany .
the show comprises drawings of typewriters and fantastic gouaches , as well as enormous , brightly colored woodcuts .
the tobias brothers were born in romania and came to germany in 1985 .
they studied art together in the northern german town of braunschweig .
today , they share a studio in cologne .
an affinity for german art bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brothers have been praised for their use of color " it is a great honor for us to be offered an exhibit at moma , " gert tobias said on the eve of the opening in new york .
but the twins are not the first german artists to get a show at moma .
in 2001 , düsseldorf photographer andreas gursky was given a show in the famed museum , and a year later , it was painter gerhard richter 's turn .
" moma has shown a great affinity for german art , " said stefan gronert , the curator of the kunst museum bonn , who has been following the twins ' career since 2004 .
but gert and uwe tobias do n't see their work in the category of " german art " - or romanian art , for that matter .
" we are just artists , who make our own art , " gert tobias said .
nonetheless , it would be fairly easy for the brothers to ride the tide of popularity in german art if they wanted to , gronert said .
" right now , german art is very popular in other countries .
especially in the usa , " he said .
popularity of the leipzig school he pointed out that germany is home to the leipzig school , whose modern , graphic painting style has excited interest in us collectors for years now .
today , leipzig is home to a lively artists ' quarter , where 11 galleries have opened up in a building that was once europe 's largest cotton factory .
and more than just paintings are being made .
numerous young artists of all stripes have jumped on the leipzig art scene bandwagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter has been very popular in the us the popularity of german art is closely linked to the growing interest in art world-wide .
the art market is hungrier than ever .
gronert claims that german art , like other german products , is known for its quality .
" the best explanation is that quality simply wins out , " he said .
this appears to be the case when it comes to the tobias brothers .
the pair has been called " revivers of the woodcut . "
moma has praised their " amazing color sensibility " and their " astounding graphical compositions . "
career boost is likely the moma exhibit will no doubt boost the careers of the tobias brothers , who appear to be taking it in stride .
" after new york , we need a few days to just process it all , " gert tobias said .
" we are n't sure what comes after that . "
gronert said he imagines a number of major museums will want to mount shows of the tobias brothers ' woodcuts - including his own .
in march , an exhibit of gert and uwe tobias woodcuts will be opening at the kunst museum bonn . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . we traveled to görlitz in may 2007 and found it charming , unspoiled , and beautiful .
we enjoyed a walking tour -lrb- only in german -rrb- , enjoyed the many old buildings and churches and walked across the bridge to have lunch on the polish side of the river .
while it 's not exactly on most tourist routes , it 's definitely worth the visit . - chris , us when you 're tired of sausages and all things german go to osteria no. 1 - it saved our lives in berlin !
we had a lovely , intimate , platter of mixed pasta at a very good budget in the way that only italians are good at . - c. sammut , malta while i appreciated very much your links on the dw-world.de site for options to consider when visiting various towns and cities in germany , i simply chose a different course for my stay .
first , i used the hotel reservation links given to me by my cousin from seeheim to make all of my hotel reservations via the internet and they all proved to be , well , just perfect .
we started in offenbach , then took a train trip to hildesheim and from there on to bocholt and lastly to freiburg im bresigau .
secondly , i ate locally from the metzgerei -lrb- butchers -rrb- to the konditerei -lrb- cake shop -rrb- and the open air markets , and as is the german custom , promptly took my afternoon kaffeepause -lrb- coffee break -rrb- everyday .
evenings usually found me sitting with the locals in the famous neighborhood bierstube , listening to the local radio stations still playing music from the 1950s and 1960s ... some things never seem to change .
tourists ?
i never really met any that i could tell , except during my last few days in freiburg .
next year i hope to go to germany for a two-month stay at a goethe institute german-language program . - philip ohmes , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reader enjoyed taking a german coffee break i 'd like to share my experience with you during my stay in the federal republic of germany from 1985-1988 .
first and foremost was the warm welcome and good treatment that i received from the german people in general .
from the first time that i met germans i had a warm reception and i was loved by the nationals everywhere i went . the next experience i had was learning the language .
from the very beginning , i faced some difficulties with the language and then later i became more at ease .
the different german accents made learning the language a little bit hard for me .
i went to the language school from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. for six months , which was good for me .
i am now so used to the german language that i could visit any city in germany without an interpreter .
once i visited cologne during the science fair , where there were so many different things i could n't see them all . - vasco s. kemokai compiled by dw staff -lrb- sjr -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but while they may be the hottest new german art export , they are n't the only ones . moma – four magic letters that open the door to art-world success .
any artist , whose work has been shown at moma - the museum of modern art , in new york , can surely say they have " made it . "
gert and uwe tobias can now lay claim to that fame .
from wednesday , nov .
28 through feb .
25 , moma is showing 20 works by the 34-year-old twins from cologne , germany .
the show comprises drawings of typewriters and fantastic gouaches , as well as enormous , brightly colored woodcuts .
the tobias brothers were born in romania and came to germany in 1985 .
they studied art together in the northern german town of braunschweig .
today , they share a studio in cologne .
an affinity for german art bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brothers have been praised for their use of color " it is a great honor for us to be offered an exhibit at moma , " gert tobias said on the eve of the opening in new york .
but the twins are not the first german artists to get a show at moma .
in 2001 , düsseldorf photographer andreas gursky was given a show in the famed museum , and a year later , it was painter gerhard richter 's turn .
" moma has shown a great affinity for german art , " said stefan gronert , the curator of the kunst museum bonn , who has been following the twins ' career since 2004 .
but gert and uwe tobias do n't see their work in the category of " german art " - or romanian art , for that matter .
" we are just artists , who make our own art , " gert tobias said .
nonetheless , it would be fairly easy for the brothers to ride the tide of popularity in german art if they wanted to , gronert said .
" right now , german art is very popular in other countries .
especially in the usa , " he said .
popularity of the leipzig school he pointed out that germany is home to the leipzig school , whose modern , graphic painting style has excited interest in us collectors for years now .
today , leipzig is home to a lively artists ' quarter , where 11 galleries have opened up in a building that was once europe 's largest cotton factory .
and more than just paintings are being made .
numerous young artists of all stripes have jumped on the leipzig art scene bandwagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter has been very popular in the us the popularity of german art is closely linked to the growing interest in art world-wide .
the art market is hungrier than ever .
gronert claims that german art , like other german products , is known for its quality .
" the best explanation is that quality simply wins out , " he said .
this appears to be the case when it comes to the tobias brothers .
the pair has been called " revivers of the woodcut . "
moma has praised their " amazing color sensibility " and their " astounding graphical compositions . "
career boost is likely the moma exhibit will no doubt boost the careers of the tobias brothers , who appear to be taking it in stride .
" after new york , we need a few days to just process it all , " gert tobias said .
" we are n't sure what comes after that . "
gronert said he imagines a number of major museums will want to mount shows of the tobias brothers ' woodcuts - including his own .
in march , an exhibit of gert and uwe tobias woodcuts will be opening at the kunst museum bonn . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sunday 's parliamentary elections in russia may well leave much to be desired in terms of democracy .
but experts on the country say there 's little need to fear the kremlin 's long-term plans . the poll on dec .
2 is being viewed as a referendum on president vladimir putin 's popularity .
with putin 's future plans unclear and the kremlin recently striking an aggressive international posture , particularly toward the united states , many pundits have speculated that russia might be bidding to re-establish itself as a global superpower . but russia 's military might today does n't remotely compare to the power wielded by the soviet union .
german experts on russia said there 's little reason to worry about a return to the cold-war-era stand-off between russia and the west . " superpower is the wrong word , " said hans-henning schröder , a professor of eastern european history and politics at the university of bremen .
" big power would be more accurate .
the us is in another dimension entirely , and that 's clear to the russian leadership under putin as well .
but russia would like to reach the level of influence of , say , germany or great britain . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adherents of the current president have been taking to the streets to show support christoph zürcher , professor of political science at the free university of berlin , agreed that it did not make sense to put russia and the us in the same league . " russia is trying to show presence on the international stage , but it 's hard to take the idea of bipolarity between russia and the us very seriously , " he said .
" it would be nice if there were a multi-polar counterweight to american influence in the world .
but that 's not what russia stands for right now .
they 're pursing national interests . " energy plays limited role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's gas reserves give it power - especially over its immediate neighbors russia 's vast natural resources , particularly natural gas and oil , will give the country increased leverage in coming years .
but the experts do n't think europe is necessarily overly dependent on russian energy . " the role of energy is foreign relations is over-dramatized , " said alexander rahr , the director of the russian-eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations .

" russia can assume it wo n't be suffering any financial crises in the next 10 years , especially as the energy needs of countries like china are also sure to rise , " rahr said .

" russia has become arrogant enough to flout international decorum , for instance , by refusing to allow international monitoring , " zürcher said .

he said that china would reform its currency policy in a " gradual , proactive and manageable manner . " but wen added that the exchange rate between the euro and the chinese yuan was determined by the euro 's rate against the dollar . " the plunge of the us dollar is the main cause of the appreciation of the euro , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants china to move away from using the dollar as its only currency standard the eu 's economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said china , as a world economic power , needed to consider more than only the dollar in its economic policy .

" the eu exports less to china than to switzerland , a country of 7 million people , " barroso told a business forum on the sidelines of the annual summit .
" our ultimate goal is to create a level playing field for both sides . " barroso also said eu businesses needed access " without artificial barriers , " pointing to problems such as copyright violations , lack of standardization and murky investment rules .

but while they may be the hottest new german art export , they are n't the only ones . moma – four magic letters that open the door to art-world success .
any artist , whose work has been shown at moma - the museum of modern art , in new york , can surely say they have " made it . "
gert and uwe tobias can now lay claim to that fame .
from wednesday , nov .
28 through feb .
25 , moma is showing 20 works by the 34-year-old twins from cologne , germany .
the show comprises drawings of typewriters and fantastic gouaches , as well as enormous , brightly colored woodcuts .
the tobias brothers were born in romania and came to germany in 1985 .
they studied art together in the northern german town of braunschweig .
today , they share a studio in cologne .
an affinity for german art bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brothers have been praised for their use of color " it is a great honor for us to be offered an exhibit at moma , " gert tobias said on the eve of the opening in new york .
but the twins are not the first german artists to get a show at moma .
in 2001 , düsseldorf photographer andreas gursky was given a show in the famed museum , and a year later , it was painter gerhard richter 's turn .
" moma has shown a great affinity for german art , " said stefan gronert , the curator of the kunst museum bonn , who has been following the twins ' career since 2004 .
but gert and uwe tobias do n't see their work in the category of " german art " - or romanian art , for that matter .
" we are just artists , who make our own art , " gert tobias said .
nonetheless , it would be fairly easy for the brothers to ride the tide of popularity in german art if they wanted to , gronert said .
" right now , german art is very popular in other countries .
especially in the usa , " he said .
popularity of the leipzig school he pointed out that germany is home to the leipzig school , whose modern , graphic painting style has excited interest in us collectors for years now .
today , leipzig is home to a lively artists ' quarter , where 11 galleries have opened up in a building that was once europe 's largest cotton factory .
and more than just paintings are being made .
numerous young artists of all stripes have jumped on the leipzig art scene bandwagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter has been very popular in the us the popularity of german art is closely linked to the growing interest in art world-wide .
the art market is hungrier than ever .
gronert claims that german art , like other german products , is known for its quality .
" the best explanation is that quality simply wins out , " he said .
this appears to be the case when it comes to the tobias brothers .
the pair has been called " revivers of the woodcut . "
moma has praised their " amazing color sensibility " and their " astounding graphical compositions . "
career boost is likely the moma exhibit will no doubt boost the careers of the tobias brothers , who appear to be taking it in stride .
" after new york , we need a few days to just process it all , " gert tobias said .
" we are n't sure what comes after that . "
gronert said he imagines a number of major museums will want to mount shows of the tobias brothers ' woodcuts - including his own .
in march , an exhibit of gert and uwe tobias woodcuts will be opening at the kunst museum bonn . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" regrettably the parties were unable to reach agreement . " the us envoy to the talks , frank wisner , called on belgrade and pristina to uphold promises not to engage in violence , adding that peace in the balkans was " very much at stake .

the call for independence was one of the few issues that united ethnic albanians in kosovo during parliamentary elections earlier this month . " we regret that serbia did not find it possible to agree to the independent final state of kosovo , " the province 's likely new prime minister , hashim thaci , said at the conclusion of the three days of talks . belgrade 's leaders , however , have offered only a degree of autonomy to the province and repeatedly vowed not to accept kosovo 's secession from serbia .

sunday 's parliamentary elections in russia may well leave much to be desired in terms of democracy .
but experts on the country say there 's little need to fear the kremlin 's long-term plans . the poll on dec .
2 is being viewed as a referendum on president vladimir putin 's popularity .
with putin 's future plans unclear and the kremlin recently striking an aggressive international posture , particularly toward the united states , many pundits have speculated that russia might be bidding to re-establish itself as a global superpower . but russia 's military might today does n't remotely compare to the power wielded by the soviet union .
german experts on russia said there 's little reason to worry about a return to the cold-war-era stand-off between russia and the west . " superpower is the wrong word , " said hans-henning schröder , a professor of eastern european history and politics at the university of bremen .
" big power would be more accurate .
the us is in another dimension entirely , and that 's clear to the russian leadership under putin as well .
but russia would like to reach the level of influence of , say , germany or great britain . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adherents of the current president have been taking to the streets to show support christoph zürcher , professor of political science at the free university of berlin , agreed that it did not make sense to put russia and the us in the same league . " russia is trying to show presence on the international stage , but it 's hard to take the idea of bipolarity between russia and the us very seriously , " he said .
" it would be nice if there were a multi-polar counterweight to american influence in the world .
but that 's not what russia stands for right now .
they 're pursing national interests . " energy plays limited role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's gas reserves give it power - especially over its immediate neighbors russia 's vast natural resources , particularly natural gas and oil , will give the country increased leverage in coming years .
but the experts do n't think europe is necessarily overly dependent on russian energy . " the role of energy is foreign relations is over-dramatized , " said alexander rahr , the director of the russian-eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations .
" germany only gets 30 percent of its natural gas from russia ; france only 10 percent .
the lone nations who are truly dependent are russia 's direct neighbors . " schröder agreed that countries such as georgia , the baltic republics and poland could feel pressure from russia , which in turn could create a problem for the eu . but " russia has roughly the same economic power as italy so it 's actually a fairly small country in this respect , and countries like germany do n't need to worry too much about possible developments , " he added . lack of middle class is biggest problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economy is driven by natural resources , while technology lags russia is getting richer and currently boasts annual growth rates of up to 7 percent .
but the experts disagreed as to how strong the russian economy really is - and how much it may need to diversify from energy production . " russia can assume it wo n't be suffering any financial crises in the next 10 years , especially as the energy needs of countries like china are also sure to rise , " rahr said .
" the biggest problem is the destruction of the middle-class - that was a mistake that needs correcting . " shakespearean drama ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian opposition parties say the election is a farce there is complete consensus that sunday 's election is about putin - and whether he can retain significant power despite constitutional restrictions . but the experts stressed that that issue - at least in the short term - has more to do with putin 's relationship with russia , and vice versa , and less with putin or russia 's plans vis-a-vis the world .

" sarkozy also met with dead teens ' families sarkozy also met on wednesday with the parents of the two teenagers whose deaths set off the riots . some 800 police officers had been sent to the suburb and neighboring communities after more than 130 riot police were injured sunday and monday in clashes with groups of youths .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : russian parliamentary elections putin 's party wins russia elections amid vote-rigging claims kremlin takes heat from the west following dubious election opinion : democracy biggest loser in russian elections germany 's merkel criticizes lack of observers in russian poll russia -pipe- 28.11.2007 russia 's power is greatly exaggerated , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has putin made his country look mightier than it is ?
sunday 's parliamentary elections in russia may well leave much to be desired in terms of democracy .
but experts on the country say there 's little need to fear the kremlin 's long-term plans . the poll on dec .
2 is being viewed as a referendum on president vladimir putin 's popularity .
with putin 's future plans unclear and the kremlin recently striking an aggressive international posture , particularly toward the united states , many pundits have speculated that russia might be bidding to re-establish itself as a global superpower . but russia 's military might today does n't remotely compare to the power wielded by the soviet union .
german experts on russia said there 's little reason to worry about a return to the cold-war-era stand-off between russia and the west . " superpower is the wrong word , " said hans-henning schröder , a professor of eastern european history and politics at the university of bremen .
" big power would be more accurate .
the us is in another dimension entirely , and that 's clear to the russian leadership under putin as well .
but russia would like to reach the level of influence of , say , germany or great britain . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adherents of the current president have been taking to the streets to show support christoph zürcher , professor of political science at the free university of berlin , agreed that it did not make sense to put russia and the us in the same league . " russia is trying to show presence on the international stage , but it 's hard to take the idea of bipolarity between russia and the us very seriously , " he said .
" it would be nice if there were a multi-polar counterweight to american influence in the world .
but that 's not what russia stands for right now .
they 're pursing national interests . " energy plays limited role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's gas reserves give it power - especially over its immediate neighbors russia 's vast natural resources , particularly natural gas and oil , will give the country increased leverage in coming years .
but the experts do n't think europe is necessarily overly dependent on russian energy . " the role of energy is foreign relations is over-dramatized , " said alexander rahr , the director of the russian-eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations .
" germany only gets 30 percent of its natural gas from russia ; france only 10 percent .
the lone nations who are truly dependent are russia 's direct neighbors . " schröder agreed that countries such as georgia , the baltic republics and poland could feel pressure from russia , which in turn could create a problem for the eu . but " russia has roughly the same economic power as italy so it 's actually a fairly small country in this respect , and countries like germany do n't need to worry too much about possible developments , " he added . lack of middle class is biggest problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economy is driven by natural resources , while technology lags russia is getting richer and currently boasts annual growth rates of up to 7 percent .
but the experts disagreed as to how strong the russian economy really is - and how much it may need to diversify from energy production . " russia can assume it wo n't be suffering any financial crises in the next 10 years , especially as the energy needs of countries like china are also sure to rise , " rahr said .
" the biggest problem is the destruction of the middle-class - that was a mistake that needs correcting . " shakespearean drama ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian opposition parties say the election is a farce there is complete consensus that sunday 's election is about putin - and whether he can retain significant power despite constitutional restrictions . but the experts stressed that that issue - at least in the short term - has more to do with putin 's relationship with russia , and vice versa , and less with putin or russia 's plans vis-a-vis the world . " russia has become arrogant enough to flout international decorum , for instance , by refusing to allow international monitoring , " zürcher said .
" that 's not so terrible for the rest of the world .
what 's terrible is that russia is on its way to becoming an unpleasant , semi-authoritarian system . " " the problem is that all the power is concentrated in the hands of the president , and when he gives up this power and passes it on to his successor , he 's in effect at his successor 's mercy , " schröder said .
" what putin is doing is trying to position himself so that he 's unassailable . " " it 's almost like a shakespearean drama , " rahr said .
" a historic figure who is still very popular has to go because of the constitution , but the system requires a strong leader at the top .
that 's also thrown the state into an internal dilemma . " jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . we traveled to görlitz in may 2007 and found it charming , unspoiled , and beautiful .
we enjoyed a walking tour -lrb- only in german -rrb- , enjoyed the many old buildings and churches and walked across the bridge to have lunch on the polish side of the river .
while it 's not exactly on most tourist routes , it 's definitely worth the visit . - chris , us when you 're tired of sausages and all things german go to osteria no. 1 - it saved our lives in berlin !
we had a lovely , intimate , platter of mixed pasta at a very good budget in the way that only italians are good at . - c. sammut , malta while i appreciated very much your links on the dw-world.de site for options to consider when visiting various towns and cities in germany , i simply chose a different course for my stay .
first , i used the hotel reservation links given to me by my cousin from seeheim to make all of my hotel reservations via the internet and they all proved to be , well , just perfect .
we started in offenbach , then took a train trip to hildesheim and from there on to bocholt and lastly to freiburg im bresigau .
secondly , i ate locally from the metzgerei -lrb- butchers -rrb- to the konditerei -lrb- cake shop -rrb- and the open air markets , and as is the german custom , promptly took my afternoon kaffeepause -lrb- coffee break -rrb- everyday .
evenings usually found me sitting with the locals in the famous neighborhood bierstube , listening to the local radio stations still playing music from the 1950s and 1960s ... some things never seem to change .
tourists ?
i never really met any that i could tell , except during my last few days in freiburg .
next year i hope to go to germany for a two-month stay at a goethe institute german-language program . - philip ohmes , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reader enjoyed taking a german coffee break i 'd like to share my experience with you during my stay in the federal republic of germany from 1985-1988 .
first and foremost was the warm welcome and good treatment that i received from the german people in general .
from the first time that i met germans i had a warm reception and i was loved by the nationals everywhere i went . the next experience i had was learning the language .
from the very beginning , i faced some difficulties with the language and then later i became more at ease .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . we traveled to görlitz in may 2007 and found it charming , unspoiled , and beautiful .
we enjoyed a walking tour -lrb- only in german -rrb- , enjoyed the many old buildings and churches and walked across the bridge to have lunch on the polish side of the river .
while it 's not exactly on most tourist routes , it 's definitely worth the visit . - chris , us when you 're tired of sausages and all things german go to osteria no. 1 - it saved our lives in berlin !
we had a lovely , intimate , platter of mixed pasta at a very good budget in the way that only italians are good at . - c. sammut , malta while i appreciated very much your links on the dw-world.de site for options to consider when visiting various towns and cities in germany , i simply chose a different course for my stay .
first , i used the hotel reservation links given to me by my cousin from seeheim to make all of my hotel reservations via the internet and they all proved to be , well , just perfect .
we started in offenbach , then took a train trip to hildesheim and from there on to bocholt and lastly to freiburg im bresigau .
secondly , i ate locally from the metzgerei -lrb- butchers -rrb- to the konditerei -lrb- cake shop -rrb- and the open air markets , and as is the german custom , promptly took my afternoon kaffeepause -lrb- coffee break -rrb- everyday .
evenings usually found me sitting with the locals in the famous neighborhood bierstube , listening to the local radio stations still playing music from the 1950s and 1960s ... some things never seem to change .
tourists ?
i never really met any that i could tell , except during my last few days in freiburg .
next year i hope to go to germany for a two-month stay at a goethe institute german-language program . - philip ohmes , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reader enjoyed taking a german coffee break i 'd like to share my experience with you during my stay in the federal republic of germany from 1985-1988 .
first and foremost was the warm welcome and good treatment that i received from the german people in general .
from the first time that i met germans i had a warm reception and i was loved by the nationals everywhere i went . the next experience i had was learning the language .
from the very beginning , i faced some difficulties with the language and then later i became more at ease .
the different german accents made learning the language a little bit hard for me .

" in an interview with the newsmagazine stern , angela merkel rebuffed ongoing criticisms of her foreign policy .
opposition politicians have repeatedly critiqued merkel for her frequent trips abroad , as well as her decision to welcome the dalai lama in germany in september - an action which has threatened germany 's economic relationship with china .
the critics have also spoken out against merkel 's clear denunciations of human-rights infractions in china and russia .

foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , also a social democrat , recently spoke out against merkel 's decisions on china policy .
during a visit to paris earlier in november , he told journalists he was " worried " about the escalating diplomatic tension between germany and china in the wake of the dalai lama 's visit .

but while they may be the hottest new german art export , they are n't the only ones . moma – four magic letters that open the door to art-world success .
any artist , whose work has been shown at moma - the museum of modern art , in new york , can surely say they have " made it . "
gert and uwe tobias can now lay claim to that fame .
from wednesday , nov .
28 through feb .
25 , moma is showing 20 works by the 34-year-old twins from cologne , germany .
the show comprises drawings of typewriters and fantastic gouaches , as well as enormous , brightly colored woodcuts .
the tobias brothers were born in romania and came to germany in 1985 .
they studied art together in the northern german town of braunschweig .
today , they share a studio in cologne .
an affinity for german art bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brothers have been praised for their use of color " it is a great honor for us to be offered an exhibit at moma , " gert tobias said on the eve of the opening in new york .
but the twins are not the first german artists to get a show at moma .
in 2001 , düsseldorf photographer andreas gursky was given a show in the famed museum , and a year later , it was painter gerhard richter 's turn .
" moma has shown a great affinity for german art , " said stefan gronert , the curator of the kunst museum bonn , who has been following the twins ' career since 2004 .
but gert and uwe tobias do n't see their work in the category of " german art " - or romanian art , for that matter .
" we are just artists , who make our own art , " gert tobias said .
nonetheless , it would be fairly easy for the brothers to ride the tide of popularity in german art if they wanted to , gronert said .
" right now , german art is very popular in other countries .
especially in the usa , " he said .
popularity of the leipzig school he pointed out that germany is home to the leipzig school , whose modern , graphic painting style has excited interest in us collectors for years now .
today , leipzig is home to a lively artists ' quarter , where 11 galleries have opened up in a building that was once europe 's largest cotton factory .
and more than just paintings are being made .
numerous young artists of all stripes have jumped on the leipzig art scene bandwagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter has been very popular in the us the popularity of german art is closely linked to the growing interest in art world-wide .
the art market is hungrier than ever .
gronert claims that german art , like other german products , is known for its quality .
" the best explanation is that quality simply wins out , " he said .
this appears to be the case when it comes to the tobias brothers .
the pair has been called " revivers of the woodcut . "
moma has praised their " amazing color sensibility " and their " astounding graphical compositions . "
career boost is likely the moma exhibit will no doubt boost the careers of the tobias brothers , who appear to be taking it in stride .
" after new york , we need a few days to just process it all , " gert tobias said .
" we are n't sure what comes after that . "
gronert said he imagines a number of major museums will want to mount shows of the tobias brothers ' woodcuts - including his own .
in march , an exhibit of gert and uwe tobias woodcuts will be opening at the kunst museum bonn . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he praises president bush 's clarity on establishing a palestinian state , but remains skeptical . peace is supposed to descend on the middle east .
it 's a goal to be achieved by the end of next year .
it 's a commendable goal that would prompt one to congratulate the parties involved .
if it were only that easy .
there have always been good intentions - mainly in the form of initiatives and declarations - in the past when it comes to the middle east , just as there have been dates and deadlines set .
the only problem is that they have expired without the desired result being achieved .
why should it be different this time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp in no way do i want to diminish the efforts made in trying to find a peaceful solution in the middle east .
it is just odd that , without even trying to get to the real core issues in the middle east conflict , peace is now supposed to be possible - more so than in the past .
and that uneasy feeling makes one believe that it 's only wishful thinking , particularly on the part of the us president .
after all , george w. bush wants to crown his presidency with at least one foreign policy success .
but he overlooks the fact that declarations of intention alone do not suffice to achieve that end .
otherwise , we would have had a pacified , free and democratic iraq as a role model for the rest of the arab world a long time ago .
control mechanisms stay on track still , president bush has promised that the united states will act as a kind of control mechanism for the implementation of a peaceful solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict and has said that enough pressure will be placed on both sides to keep them on track toward their own , self-defined goals .
this is a new move , considering that right at the beginning of his presidency , bush declared that the us would not play the mediator role in any middle east negotiations , thereby himself causing the now so regretted , years-long deadlock . that bush speaks so openly about establishing a palestinian state is also good , and right .
he is not the first us president to do so , but while it sounded like a vision for the future when bill clinton said it , with bush , it sounds like a target for the negotiations during the next 12 months .
west bank remains controversial this is definitely progress .
but , the president still does not seem to understand , for example , that not merely a few " illegal settlement posts " have to be dissolved to achieve that goal , but that the israeli settlements in the west bank will have to be completely vacated - one of the greatest impediments to peace .
like no other president before him , bush has stood behind israeli policies in the occupied territories throughout his term of office , so he will now have quite a bit of work to do to convince others that it will be different in the future . despite all the skepticism , a step in the right direction has been taken in annapolis .
but the stretch to the finish line has hardly been shortened as a result .
many steps must still be made to get closer to that goal and , experience with the players in the middle east as well as with this president , could teach us a lesson .
that is : one way or another , things will go wrong .

russia finished on top of the ranking . the german primary school system develops a high reading level in most children , according to a 2006 iglu survey of primary school reading skills , which was published in berlin on wednesday , nov .
28 . germany 's education minister annette schavan said the results showed that the country 's primary schools were " playing at the top international level . "
a total of 397 german schools and 7,900 students took part in the study . " german primary schools have done their homework , " said wilfried bos , the study 's director for germany .
" we have again clearly and substantially improved . " smaller gender differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls scored higher than boys in all the participating countries italy -lrb- 8th -rrb- , hungary -lrb- 9th -rrb- and sweden -lrb- 10th -rrb- , which finished first in the last iglu survey in 2001 , came in ahead of germany in reading skills , but not by statistically significant margins , according to the survey .
germany placed above the eu and oecd averages . russia , which excluded more students than any other participating country from the test , placed first , ahead of hong kong and canada .
bos said germany could have improved its position had it kept more than 0.7 percent of fourth graders from taking part . the number of students in germany with very low reading skills dropped while the number of strong readers increases in the five years between the two iglu studies .
differences in reading skills between girls and boys were smallest in germany with a smaller percentage of boys in the lowest reading groups compared to other participating countries . social class makes big difference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids with immigrant backgrounds are at a disadvantage in german schools the survey also pointed out areas german schools were failing their pupils . in comparison with other countries , the study showed a clearer link between social class and reading performance - even the earliest grades - among children in germany .
poor students and children of immigrants in germany also generally performed worse than their classmates more often than similar students in other countries . " primary schools have not succeeded in sufficiently compensating for social inequality , " the study said . the finding reflect stark criticism made by a special envoy from the united nations in march that germany 's three-tiered school system was discriminatory for shutting out children from immigrant and poorer backgrounds . while most other european countries have created more inclusive school systems , germany has , for the most part , stuck to a three-tier structure that places children into educational tracks before the age of 12 . more results coming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next set of test results is due next week the iglu study said german students from upper-class families were often put in the highest track despite only adequate grades while higher skills were demanded of children with poorer or immigrant backgrounds to receive the same recommendation . education in germany has been subject to censure after a string of studies results showed the country 's schools to be trailing internationally .
in a 2001 pisa study , germany ranked only 21st in reading skills and 20th in math and science among 31 countries assessed . schavan said wednesday 's ranking showed reform measures put in place after 2001 had been successful . results from the next pisa study , which tested natural science skills , are scheduled to be presented tuesday .

russia finished on top of the ranking . the german primary school system develops a high reading level in most children , according to a 2006 iglu survey of primary school reading skills , which was published in berlin on wednesday , nov .
28 . germany 's education minister annette schavan said the results showed that the country 's primary schools were " playing at the top international level . "
a total of 397 german schools and 7,900 students took part in the study . " german primary schools have done their homework , " said wilfried bos , the study 's director for germany .
" we have again clearly and substantially improved .

germany placed above the eu and oecd averages . russia , which excluded more students than any other participating country from the test , placed first , ahead of hong kong and canada .
bos said germany could have improved its position had it kept more than 0.7 percent of fourth graders from taking part . the number of students in germany with very low reading skills dropped while the number of strong readers increases in the five years between the two iglu studies .
differences in reading skills between girls and boys were smallest in germany with a smaller percentage of boys in the lowest reading groups compared to other participating countries . social class makes big difference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids with immigrant backgrounds are at a disadvantage in german schools the survey also pointed out areas german schools were failing their pupils . in comparison with other countries , the study showed a clearer link between social class and reading performance - even the earliest grades - among children in germany .
poor students and children of immigrants in germany also generally performed worse than their classmates more often than similar students in other countries . " primary schools have not succeeded in sufficiently compensating for social inequality , " the study said . the finding reflect stark criticism made by a special envoy from the united nations in march that germany 's three-tiered school system was discriminatory for shutting out children from immigrant and poorer backgrounds . while most other european countries have created more inclusive school systems , germany has , for the most part , stuck to a three-tier structure that places children into educational tracks before the age of 12 . more results coming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next set of test results is due next week the iglu study said german students from upper-class families were often put in the highest track despite only adequate grades while higher skills were demanded of children with poorer or immigrant backgrounds to receive the same recommendation . education in germany has been subject to censure after a string of studies results showed the country 's schools to be trailing internationally .
in a 2001 pisa study , germany ranked only 21st in reading skills and 20th in math and science among 31 countries assessed . schavan said wednesday 's ranking showed reform measures put in place after 2001 had been successful . results from the next pisa study , which tested natural science skills , are scheduled to be presented tuesday .

in 2001 , düsseldorf photographer andreas gursky was given a show in the famed museum , and a year later , it was painter gerhard richter 's turn .

10 the failed talks set the stage for the province 's independence , as kosovo 's leaders , who enjoy the support of washington , said they wanted independence " very soon . "
the call for independence was one of the few issues that united ethnic albanians in kosovo during parliamentary elections earlier this month . " we regret that serbia did not find it possible to agree to the independent final state of kosovo , " the province 's likely new prime minister , hashim thaci , said at the conclusion of the three days of talks . belgrade 's leaders , however , have offered only a degree of autonomy to the province and repeatedly vowed not to accept kosovo 's secession from serbia . " we are going to cancel all these decisions by kosovo authorities leading to independence and use all legal instruments , " serbian president boris tadic warned .

a stalemate in the security council is likely as russia is expected to block any decision that does not meet with belgrade 's approval . " we have to wait for a security council decision , " prime minister vojislav kostunica said .
unilateral action on the part of pristina would trigger similar responses , serbia 's leaders warned . kosovo 's president fatmir sejdiu made it clear after the meeting that pristina would not consent to new talks .

but while they may be the hottest new german art export , they are n't the only ones . moma – four magic letters that open the door to art-world success .
any artist , whose work has been shown at moma - the museum of modern art , in new york , can surely say they have " made it . "
gert and uwe tobias can now lay claim to that fame .
from wednesday , nov .
28 through feb .
25 , moma is showing 20 works by the 34-year-old twins from cologne , germany .
the show comprises drawings of typewriters and fantastic gouaches , as well as enormous , brightly colored woodcuts .
the tobias brothers were born in romania and came to germany in 1985 .
they studied art together in the northern german town of braunschweig .
today , they share a studio in cologne .
an affinity for german art bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brothers have been praised for their use of color " it is a great honor for us to be offered an exhibit at moma , " gert tobias said on the eve of the opening in new york .
but the twins are not the first german artists to get a show at moma .
in 2001 , düsseldorf photographer andreas gursky was given a show in the famed museum , and a year later , it was painter gerhard richter 's turn .
" moma has shown a great affinity for german art , " said stefan gronert , the curator of the kunst museum bonn , who has been following the twins ' career since 2004 .
but gert and uwe tobias do n't see their work in the category of " german art " - or romanian art , for that matter .
" we are just artists , who make our own art , " gert tobias said .
nonetheless , it would be fairly easy for the brothers to ride the tide of popularity in german art if they wanted to , gronert said .
" right now , german art is very popular in other countries .
especially in the usa , " he said .
popularity of the leipzig school he pointed out that germany is home to the leipzig school , whose modern , graphic painting style has excited interest in us collectors for years now .
today , leipzig is home to a lively artists ' quarter , where 11 galleries have opened up in a building that was once europe 's largest cotton factory .
and more than just paintings are being made .
numerous young artists of all stripes have jumped on the leipzig art scene bandwagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter has been very popular in the us the popularity of german art is closely linked to the growing interest in art world-wide .
the art market is hungrier than ever .
gronert claims that german art , like other german products , is known for its quality .
" the best explanation is that quality simply wins out , " he said .
this appears to be the case when it comes to the tobias brothers .
the pair has been called " revivers of the woodcut . "
moma has praised their " amazing color sensibility " and their " astounding graphical compositions . "
career boost is likely the moma exhibit will no doubt boost the careers of the tobias brothers , who appear to be taking it in stride .
" after new york , we need a few days to just process it all , " gert tobias said .
" we are n't sure what comes after that . "
gronert said he imagines a number of major museums will want to mount shows of the tobias brothers ' woodcuts - including his own .
in march , an exhibit of gert and uwe tobias woodcuts will be opening at the kunst museum bonn . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said that china would reform its currency policy in a " gradual , proactive and manageable manner .

" they have to consider that not all adjustments should be focusing on the relationship between the dollar and the yuan , " almunia told reporters in beijing .
" they must think about the evolution of the exchange rate toward the euro . " eu 's growing trade deficit addressing the europeans other main economic concern with the asian giant , chinese president hu jintao told european commission president jose manuel barroso that he " did not favor a sizeable trade surplus with the eu , " officials said .

" the eu exports less to china than to switzerland , a country of 7 million people , " barroso told a business forum on the sidelines of the annual summit .
" our ultimate goal is to create a level playing field for both sides . " barroso also said eu businesses needed access " without artificial barriers , " pointing to problems such as copyright violations , lack of standardization and murky investment rules .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson also called for more balanced trade with china . money to be made with climate technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate technology could get european business spinning in china wen promised to allow greater market access for eu firms " according to international rules , " arguing that the eu could shrink its deficit by exporting more environmental protection technology to china .

he praises president bush 's clarity on establishing a palestinian state , but remains skeptical . peace is supposed to descend on the middle east .
it 's a goal to be achieved by the end of next year .
it 's a commendable goal that would prompt one to congratulate the parties involved .
if it were only that easy .
there have always been good intentions - mainly in the form of initiatives and declarations - in the past when it comes to the middle east , just as there have been dates and deadlines set .
the only problem is that they have expired without the desired result being achieved .
why should it be different this time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp in no way do i want to diminish the efforts made in trying to find a peaceful solution in the middle east .
it is just odd that , without even trying to get to the real core issues in the middle east conflict , peace is now supposed to be possible - more so than in the past .
and that uneasy feeling makes one believe that it 's only wishful thinking , particularly on the part of the us president .
after all , george w. bush wants to crown his presidency with at least one foreign policy success .
but he overlooks the fact that declarations of intention alone do not suffice to achieve that end .
otherwise , we would have had a pacified , free and democratic iraq as a role model for the rest of the arab world a long time ago .
control mechanisms stay on track still , president bush has promised that the united states will act as a kind of control mechanism for the implementation of a peaceful solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict and has said that enough pressure will be placed on both sides to keep them on track toward their own , self-defined goals .
this is a new move , considering that right at the beginning of his presidency , bush declared that the us would not play the mediator role in any middle east negotiations , thereby himself causing the now so regretted , years-long deadlock . that bush speaks so openly about establishing a palestinian state is also good , and right .
he is not the first us president to do so , but while it sounded like a vision for the future when bill clinton said it , with bush , it sounds like a target for the negotiations during the next 12 months .
west bank remains controversial this is definitely progress .
but , the president still does not seem to understand , for example , that not merely a few " illegal settlement posts " have to be dissolved to achieve that goal , but that the israeli settlements in the west bank will have to be completely vacated - one of the greatest impediments to peace .
like no other president before him , bush has stood behind israeli policies in the occupied territories throughout his term of office , so he will now have quite a bit of work to do to convince others that it will be different in the future . despite all the skepticism , a step in the right direction has been taken in annapolis .
but the stretch to the finish line has hardly been shortened as a result .
many steps must still be made to get closer to that goal and , experience with the players in the middle east as well as with this president , could teach us a lesson .
that is : one way or another , things will go wrong .

" in an interview with the newsmagazine stern , angela merkel rebuffed ongoing criticisms of her foreign policy .
opposition politicians have repeatedly critiqued merkel for her frequent trips abroad , as well as her decision to welcome the dalai lama in germany in september - an action which has threatened germany 's economic relationship with china .
the critics have also spoken out against merkel 's clear denunciations of human-rights infractions in china and russia .
foreign policy : a thin , blurred line ?
in her conversation with stern , merkel said it is " provincial to consider making foreign visits in order to lobby for our security , our environment and our well-being , less important " than domestic politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some argue that merkel 's focus on foreign policy is displaced " today there is no longer such a clear line between domestic and foreign policy , " merkel added .
merkel also said she would " continue to choose state visitors and foreign trips as i see fit and useful , when it comes to serving germany 's interests . "
" it is wrong and superfluous to play political values and economic success against each other , as if only one or the other is important , " merkel told stern .
" they belong together . "
criticism from steinmeier merkel said she thought her approach had made germany a more " respected partner in the world , even more so in the past two years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- right -rrb- , like his ex-boss schröder -lrb- left -rrb- has critiqued merkel 's policies the comment was seen as a clear jab at her social democratic predecessor gerhard schröder , whose government pursued a foreign policy that placated to china on human rights in favor of pursuing economic ties .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , also a social democrat , recently spoke out against merkel 's decisions on china policy .
during a visit to paris earlier in november , he told journalists he was " worried " about the escalating diplomatic tension between germany and china in the wake of the dalai lama 's visit .
" we have had better relations with china , that is unfortunately true , " steinmeier said .
" it is a development that we can not let remain as is . "
merkel : support on iran is key he added that it was in germany 's interest to reestablish good relations with china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some worry that merkel is risking economic ties with china since then , the issue has given rise to several political flare-ups .
but the chancellor defended her relationship with steinmeier , telling stern the two of them " work well together , in general . "
" if you look at other governments , we can be very content , " she said .
in her interview , merkel also pleaded with the international community to support germany in its attempt to find a diplomatic solution to the iran crisis . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . we traveled to görlitz in may 2007 and found it charming , unspoiled , and beautiful .
we enjoyed a walking tour -lrb- only in german -rrb- , enjoyed the many old buildings and churches and walked across the bridge to have lunch on the polish side of the river .
while it 's not exactly on most tourist routes , it 's definitely worth the visit . - chris , us when you 're tired of sausages and all things german go to osteria no. 1 - it saved our lives in berlin !
we had a lovely , intimate , platter of mixed pasta at a very good budget in the way that only italians are good at . - c. sammut , malta while i appreciated very much your links on the dw-world.de site for options to consider when visiting various towns and cities in germany , i simply chose a different course for my stay .
first , i used the hotel reservation links given to me by my cousin from seeheim to make all of my hotel reservations via the internet and they all proved to be , well , just perfect .
we started in offenbach , then took a train trip to hildesheim and from there on to bocholt and lastly to freiburg im bresigau .
secondly , i ate locally from the metzgerei -lrb- butchers -rrb- to the konditerei -lrb- cake shop -rrb- and the open air markets , and as is the german custom , promptly took my afternoon kaffeepause -lrb- coffee break -rrb- everyday .
evenings usually found me sitting with the locals in the famous neighborhood bierstube , listening to the local radio stations still playing music from the 1950s and 1960s ... some things never seem to change .
tourists ?
i never really met any that i could tell , except during my last few days in freiburg .
next year i hope to go to germany for a two-month stay at a goethe institute german-language program . - philip ohmes , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reader enjoyed taking a german coffee break i 'd like to share my experience with you during my stay in the federal republic of germany from 1985-1988 .
first and foremost was the warm welcome and good treatment that i received from the german people in general .
from the first time that i met germans i had a warm reception and i was loved by the nationals everywhere i went . the next experience i had was learning the language .
from the very beginning , i faced some difficulties with the language and then later i became more at ease .
the different german accents made learning the language a little bit hard for me .
i went to the language school from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. for six months , which was good for me .
i am now so used to the german language that i could visit any city in germany without an interpreter .
once i visited cologne during the science fair , where there were so many different things i could n't see them all . - vasco s. kemokai compiled by dw staff -lrb- sjr -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sunday 's parliamentary elections in russia may well leave much to be desired in terms of democracy .
but experts on the country say there 's little need to fear the kremlin 's long-term plans . the poll on dec .
2 is being viewed as a referendum on president vladimir putin 's popularity .
with putin 's future plans unclear and the kremlin recently striking an aggressive international posture , particularly toward the united states , many pundits have speculated that russia might be bidding to re-establish itself as a global superpower . but russia 's military might today does n't remotely compare to the power wielded by the soviet union .
german experts on russia said there 's little reason to worry about a return to the cold-war-era stand-off between russia and the west . " superpower is the wrong word , " said hans-henning schröder , a professor of eastern european history and politics at the university of bremen .
" big power would be more accurate .
the us is in another dimension entirely , and that 's clear to the russian leadership under putin as well .
but russia would like to reach the level of influence of , say , germany or great britain . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adherents of the current president have been taking to the streets to show support christoph zürcher , professor of political science at the free university of berlin , agreed that it did not make sense to put russia and the us in the same league . " russia is trying to show presence on the international stage , but it 's hard to take the idea of bipolarity between russia and the us very seriously , " he said .
" it would be nice if there were a multi-polar counterweight to american influence in the world .
but that 's not what russia stands for right now .
they 're pursing national interests . " energy plays limited role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's gas reserves give it power - especially over its immediate neighbors russia 's vast natural resources , particularly natural gas and oil , will give the country increased leverage in coming years .

" in an interview with the newsmagazine stern , angela merkel rebuffed ongoing criticisms of her foreign policy .
opposition politicians have repeatedly critiqued merkel for her frequent trips abroad , as well as her decision to welcome the dalai lama in germany in september - an action which has threatened germany 's economic relationship with china .
the critics have also spoken out against merkel 's clear denunciations of human-rights infractions in china and russia .
foreign policy : a thin , blurred line ?
in her conversation with stern , merkel said it is " provincial to consider making foreign visits in order to lobby for our security , our environment and our well-being , less important " than domestic politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some argue that merkel 's focus on foreign policy is displaced " today there is no longer such a clear line between domestic and foreign policy , " merkel added .
merkel also said she would " continue to choose state visitors and foreign trips as i see fit and useful , when it comes to serving germany 's interests . "
" it is wrong and superfluous to play political values and economic success against each other , as if only one or the other is important , " merkel told stern .

foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , also a social democrat , recently spoke out against merkel 's decisions on china policy .
during a visit to paris earlier in november , he told journalists he was " worried " about the escalating diplomatic tension between germany and china in the wake of the dalai lama 's visit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 28.11.2007 opinion : why should the annapolis summit be any different ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following the middle east summit in annapolis , dw 's peter philipp says only baby steps have been taken to achieve peace .
he praises president bush 's clarity on establishing a palestinian state , but remains skeptical . peace is supposed to descend on the middle east .
it 's a goal to be achieved by the end of next year .
it 's a commendable goal that would prompt one to congratulate the parties involved .
if it were only that easy .
there have always been good intentions - mainly in the form of initiatives and declarations - in the past when it comes to the middle east , just as there have been dates and deadlines set .
the only problem is that they have expired without the desired result being achieved .
why should it be different this time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp in no way do i want to diminish the efforts made in trying to find a peaceful solution in the middle east .
it is just odd that , without even trying to get to the real core issues in the middle east conflict , peace is now supposed to be possible - more so than in the past .
and that uneasy feeling makes one believe that it 's only wishful thinking , particularly on the part of the us president .
after all , george w. bush wants to crown his presidency with at least one foreign policy success .
but he overlooks the fact that declarations of intention alone do not suffice to achieve that end .
otherwise , we would have had a pacified , free and democratic iraq as a role model for the rest of the arab world a long time ago .
control mechanisms stay on track still , president bush has promised that the united states will act as a kind of control mechanism for the implementation of a peaceful solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict and has said that enough pressure will be placed on both sides to keep them on track toward their own , self-defined goals .
this is a new move , considering that right at the beginning of his presidency , bush declared that the us would not play the mediator role in any middle east negotiations , thereby himself causing the now so regretted , years-long deadlock . that bush speaks so openly about establishing a palestinian state is also good , and right .
he is not the first us president to do so , but while it sounded like a vision for the future when bill clinton said it , with bush , it sounds like a target for the negotiations during the next 12 months .
west bank remains controversial this is definitely progress .
but , the president still does not seem to understand , for example , that not merely a few " illegal settlement posts " have to be dissolved to achieve that goal , but that the israeli settlements in the west bank will have to be completely vacated - one of the greatest impediments to peace .
like no other president before him , bush has stood behind israeli policies in the occupied territories throughout his term of office , so he will now have quite a bit of work to do to convince others that it will be different in the future . despite all the skepticism , a step in the right direction has been taken in annapolis .
but the stretch to the finish line has hardly been shortened as a result .
many steps must still be made to get closer to that goal and , experience with the players in the middle east as well as with this president , could teach us a lesson .
that is : one way or another , things will go wrong .

he praises president bush 's clarity on establishing a palestinian state , but remains skeptical . peace is supposed to descend on the middle east .
it 's a goal to be achieved by the end of next year .
it 's a commendable goal that would prompt one to congratulate the parties involved .
if it were only that easy .
there have always been good intentions - mainly in the form of initiatives and declarations - in the past when it comes to the middle east , just as there have been dates and deadlines set .
the only problem is that they have expired without the desired result being achieved .
why should it be different this time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp in no way do i want to diminish the efforts made in trying to find a peaceful solution in the middle east .
it is just odd that , without even trying to get to the real core issues in the middle east conflict , peace is now supposed to be possible - more so than in the past .
and that uneasy feeling makes one believe that it 's only wishful thinking , particularly on the part of the us president .
after all , george w. bush wants to crown his presidency with at least one foreign policy success .
but he overlooks the fact that declarations of intention alone do not suffice to achieve that end .
otherwise , we would have had a pacified , free and democratic iraq as a role model for the rest of the arab world a long time ago .
control mechanisms stay on track still , president bush has promised that the united states will act as a kind of control mechanism for the implementation of a peaceful solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict and has said that enough pressure will be placed on both sides to keep them on track toward their own , self-defined goals .
this is a new move , considering that right at the beginning of his presidency , bush declared that the us would not play the mediator role in any middle east negotiations , thereby himself causing the now so regretted , years-long deadlock . that bush speaks so openly about establishing a palestinian state is also good , and right .
he is not the first us president to do so , but while it sounded like a vision for the future when bill clinton said it , with bush , it sounds like a target for the negotiations during the next 12 months .
west bank remains controversial this is definitely progress .
but , the president still does not seem to understand , for example , that not merely a few " illegal settlement posts " have to be dissolved to achieve that goal , but that the israeli settlements in the west bank will have to be completely vacated - one of the greatest impediments to peace .
like no other president before him , bush has stood behind israeli policies in the occupied territories throughout his term of office , so he will now have quite a bit of work to do to convince others that it will be different in the future . despite all the skepticism , a step in the right direction has been taken in annapolis .
but the stretch to the finish line has hardly been shortened as a result .
many steps must still be made to get closer to that goal and , experience with the players in the middle east as well as with this president , could teach us a lesson .
that is : one way or another , things will go wrong .

in a 2001 pisa study , germany ranked only 21st in reading skills and 20th in math and science among 31 countries assessed . schavan said wednesday 's ranking showed reform measures put in place after 2001 had been successful . results from the next pisa study , which tested natural science skills , are scheduled to be presented tuesday .

differences in reading skills between girls and boys were smallest in germany with a smaller percentage of boys in the lowest reading groups compared to other participating countries . social class makes big difference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids with immigrant backgrounds are at a disadvantage in german schools the survey also pointed out areas german schools were failing their pupils . in comparison with other countries , the study showed a clearer link between social class and reading performance - even the earliest grades - among children in germany .
poor students and children of immigrants in germany also generally performed worse than their classmates more often than similar students in other countries . " primary schools have not succeeded in sufficiently compensating for social inequality , " the study said . the finding reflect stark criticism made by a special envoy from the united nations in march that germany 's three-tiered school system was discriminatory for shutting out children from immigrant and poorer backgrounds . while most other european countries have created more inclusive school systems , germany has , for the most part , stuck to a three-tier structure that places children into educational tracks before the age of 12 . more results coming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next set of test results is due next week the iglu study said german students from upper-class families were often put in the highest track despite only adequate grades while higher skills were demanded of children with poorer or immigrant backgrounds to receive the same recommendation . education in germany has been subject to censure after a string of studies results showed the country 's schools to be trailing internationally .
in a 2001 pisa study , germany ranked only 21st in reading skills and 20th in math and science among 31 countries assessed . schavan said wednesday 's ranking showed reform measures put in place after 2001 had been successful . results from the next pisa study , which tested natural science skills , are scheduled to be presented tuesday .
according to spanish teacher newspaper magisnet , german students rank 13th among 57 states in that study - an improvement of five ranks when compared to the 2003 survey .
the results can not be compared , however , as the tests have changed significantly . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de experts push for overhaul of german school system germany 's ailing schools came under renewed fire at an international teachers ' congress in berlin with critics urging a radical shake-up of the three-tiered system which some say is discriminatory and undemocratic .

first and foremost was the warm welcome and good treatment that i received from the german people in general .
from the first time that i met germans i had a warm reception and i was loved by the nationals everywhere i went . the next experience i had was learning the language .
from the very beginning , i faced some difficulties with the language and then later i became more at ease .
the different german accents made learning the language a little bit hard for me .
i went to the language school from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. for six months , which was good for me .
i am now so used to the german language that i could visit any city in germany without an interpreter .

" in an interview with the newsmagazine stern , angela merkel rebuffed ongoing criticisms of her foreign policy .
opposition politicians have repeatedly critiqued merkel for her frequent trips abroad , as well as her decision to welcome the dalai lama in germany in september - an action which has threatened germany 's economic relationship with china .
the critics have also spoken out against merkel 's clear denunciations of human-rights infractions in china and russia .
foreign policy : a thin , blurred line ?
in her conversation with stern , merkel said it is " provincial to consider making foreign visits in order to lobby for our security , our environment and our well-being , less important " than domestic politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some argue that merkel 's focus on foreign policy is displaced " today there is no longer such a clear line between domestic and foreign policy , " merkel added .
merkel also said she would " continue to choose state visitors and foreign trips as i see fit and useful , when it comes to serving germany 's interests . "
" it is wrong and superfluous to play political values and economic success against each other , as if only one or the other is important , " merkel told stern .
" they belong together . "
criticism from steinmeier merkel said she thought her approach had made germany a more " respected partner in the world , even more so in the past two years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- right -rrb- , like his ex-boss schröder -lrb- left -rrb- has critiqued merkel 's policies the comment was seen as a clear jab at her social democratic predecessor gerhard schröder , whose government pursued a foreign policy that placated to china on human rights in favor of pursuing economic ties .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , also a social democrat , recently spoke out against merkel 's decisions on china policy .
during a visit to paris earlier in november , he told journalists he was " worried " about the escalating diplomatic tension between germany and china in the wake of the dalai lama 's visit .
" we have had better relations with china , that is unfortunately true , " steinmeier said .
" it is a development that we can not let remain as is . "
merkel : support on iran is key he added that it was in germany 's interest to reestablish good relations with china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some worry that merkel is risking economic ties with china since then , the issue has given rise to several political flare-ups .
but the chancellor defended her relationship with steinmeier , telling stern the two of them " work well together , in general . "
" if you look at other governments , we can be very content , " she said .
in her interview , merkel also pleaded with the international community to support germany in its attempt to find a diplomatic solution to the iran crisis . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia finished on top of the ranking . the german primary school system develops a high reading level in most children , according to a 2006 iglu survey of primary school reading skills , which was published in berlin on wednesday , nov .
28 . germany 's education minister annette schavan said the results showed that the country 's primary schools were " playing at the top international level . "
a total of 397 german schools and 7,900 students took part in the study . " german primary schools have done their homework , " said wilfried bos , the study 's director for germany .
" we have again clearly and substantially improved . " smaller gender differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls scored higher than boys in all the participating countries italy -lrb- 8th -rrb- , hungary -lrb- 9th -rrb- and sweden -lrb- 10th -rrb- , which finished first in the last iglu survey in 2001 , came in ahead of germany in reading skills , but not by statistically significant margins , according to the survey .
germany placed above the eu and oecd averages . russia , which excluded more students than any other participating country from the test , placed first , ahead of hong kong and canada .
bos said germany could have improved its position had it kept more than 0.7 percent of fourth graders from taking part . the number of students in germany with very low reading skills dropped while the number of strong readers increases in the five years between the two iglu studies .
differences in reading skills between girls and boys were smallest in germany with a smaller percentage of boys in the lowest reading groups compared to other participating countries . social class makes big difference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids with immigrant backgrounds are at a disadvantage in german schools the survey also pointed out areas german schools were failing their pupils . in comparison with other countries , the study showed a clearer link between social class and reading performance - even the earliest grades - among children in germany .
poor students and children of immigrants in germany also generally performed worse than their classmates more often than similar students in other countries . " primary schools have not succeeded in sufficiently compensating for social inequality , " the study said . the finding reflect stark criticism made by a special envoy from the united nations in march that germany 's three-tiered school system was discriminatory for shutting out children from immigrant and poorer backgrounds . while most other european countries have created more inclusive school systems , germany has , for the most part , stuck to a three-tier structure that places children into educational tracks before the age of 12 . more results coming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next set of test results is due next week the iglu study said german students from upper-class families were often put in the highest track despite only adequate grades while higher skills were demanded of children with poorer or immigrant backgrounds to receive the same recommendation . education in germany has been subject to censure after a string of studies results showed the country 's schools to be trailing internationally .
in a 2001 pisa study , germany ranked only 21st in reading skills and 20th in math and science among 31 countries assessed . schavan said wednesday 's ranking showed reform measures put in place after 2001 had been successful . results from the next pisa study , which tested natural science skills , are scheduled to be presented tuesday .
according to spanish teacher newspaper magisnet , german students rank 13th among 57 states in that study - an improvement of five ranks when compared to the 2003 survey .
the results can not be compared , however , as the tests have changed significantly . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but while they may be the hottest new german art export , they are n't the only ones . moma – four magic letters that open the door to art-world success .
any artist , whose work has been shown at moma - the museum of modern art , in new york , can surely say they have " made it . "
gert and uwe tobias can now lay claim to that fame .
from wednesday , nov .
28 through feb .
25 , moma is showing 20 works by the 34-year-old twins from cologne , germany .
the show comprises drawings of typewriters and fantastic gouaches , as well as enormous , brightly colored woodcuts .
the tobias brothers were born in romania and came to germany in 1985 .
they studied art together in the northern german town of braunschweig .
today , they share a studio in cologne .
an affinity for german art bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brothers have been praised for their use of color " it is a great honor for us to be offered an exhibit at moma , " gert tobias said on the eve of the opening in new york .
but the twins are not the first german artists to get a show at moma .
in 2001 , düsseldorf photographer andreas gursky was given a show in the famed museum , and a year later , it was painter gerhard richter 's turn .
" moma has shown a great affinity for german art , " said stefan gronert , the curator of the kunst museum bonn , who has been following the twins ' career since 2004 .
but gert and uwe tobias do n't see their work in the category of " german art " - or romanian art , for that matter .
" we are just artists , who make our own art , " gert tobias said .
nonetheless , it would be fairly easy for the brothers to ride the tide of popularity in german art if they wanted to , gronert said .
" right now , german art is very popular in other countries .
especially in the usa , " he said .
popularity of the leipzig school he pointed out that germany is home to the leipzig school , whose modern , graphic painting style has excited interest in us collectors for years now .
today , leipzig is home to a lively artists ' quarter , where 11 galleries have opened up in a building that was once europe 's largest cotton factory .
and more than just paintings are being made .
numerous young artists of all stripes have jumped on the leipzig art scene bandwagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter has been very popular in the us the popularity of german art is closely linked to the growing interest in art world-wide .
the art market is hungrier than ever .
gronert claims that german art , like other german products , is known for its quality .
" the best explanation is that quality simply wins out , " he said .
this appears to be the case when it comes to the tobias brothers .
the pair has been called " revivers of the woodcut . "
moma has praised their " amazing color sensibility " and their " astounding graphical compositions . "
career boost is likely the moma exhibit will no doubt boost the careers of the tobias brothers , who appear to be taking it in stride .
" after new york , we need a few days to just process it all , " gert tobias said .
" we are n't sure what comes after that . "
gronert said he imagines a number of major museums will want to mount shows of the tobias brothers ' woodcuts - including his own .

but while they may be the hottest new german art export , they are n't the only ones . moma – four magic letters that open the door to art-world success .
any artist , whose work has been shown at moma - the museum of modern art , in new york , can surely say they have " made it . "
gert and uwe tobias can now lay claim to that fame .
from wednesday , nov .
28 through feb .
25 , moma is showing 20 works by the 34-year-old twins from cologne , germany .
the show comprises drawings of typewriters and fantastic gouaches , as well as enormous , brightly colored woodcuts .
the tobias brothers were born in romania and came to germany in 1985 .
they studied art together in the northern german town of braunschweig .
today , they share a studio in cologne .
an affinity for german art bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brothers have been praised for their use of color " it is a great honor for us to be offered an exhibit at moma , " gert tobias said on the eve of the opening in new york .
but the twins are not the first german artists to get a show at moma .
in 2001 , düsseldorf photographer andreas gursky was given a show in the famed museum , and a year later , it was painter gerhard richter 's turn .
" moma has shown a great affinity for german art , " said stefan gronert , the curator of the kunst museum bonn , who has been following the twins ' career since 2004 .
but gert and uwe tobias do n't see their work in the category of " german art " - or romanian art , for that matter .
" we are just artists , who make our own art , " gert tobias said .
nonetheless , it would be fairly easy for the brothers to ride the tide of popularity in german art if they wanted to , gronert said .
" right now , german art is very popular in other countries .
especially in the usa , " he said .
popularity of the leipzig school he pointed out that germany is home to the leipzig school , whose modern , graphic painting style has excited interest in us collectors for years now .
today , leipzig is home to a lively artists ' quarter , where 11 galleries have opened up in a building that was once europe 's largest cotton factory .
and more than just paintings are being made .
numerous young artists of all stripes have jumped on the leipzig art scene bandwagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter has been very popular in the us the popularity of german art is closely linked to the growing interest in art world-wide .
the art market is hungrier than ever .
gronert claims that german art , like other german products , is known for its quality .
" the best explanation is that quality simply wins out , " he said .
this appears to be the case when it comes to the tobias brothers .
the pair has been called " revivers of the woodcut . "
moma has praised their " amazing color sensibility " and their " astounding graphical compositions . "
career boost is likely the moma exhibit will no doubt boost the careers of the tobias brothers , who appear to be taking it in stride .
" after new york , we need a few days to just process it all , " gert tobias said .
" we are n't sure what comes after that . "
gronert said he imagines a number of major museums will want to mount shows of the tobias brothers ' woodcuts - including his own .

a last round of negotiations between serbia and kosovo by a un-sponsored troika of envoys regarding the future status of kosovo failed to reach an agreement . " the baden conference marks the end of face-to-face talks " between serbia and kosovo , wolfgang ischinger , the eu 's representative in the kosovo troika , said at a press conference in vienna on wednesday , nov .

" regrettably the parties were unable to reach agreement . " the us envoy to the talks , frank wisner , called on belgrade and pristina to uphold promises not to engage in violence , adding that peace in the balkans was " very much at stake .

10 the failed talks set the stage for the province 's independence , as kosovo 's leaders , who enjoy the support of washington , said they wanted independence " very soon . "
the call for independence was one of the few issues that united ethnic albanians in kosovo during parliamentary elections earlier this month . " we regret that serbia did not find it possible to agree to the independent final state of kosovo , " the province 's likely new prime minister , hashim thaci , said at the conclusion of the three days of talks . belgrade 's leaders , however , have offered only a degree of autonomy to the province and repeatedly vowed not to accept kosovo 's secession from serbia .

a stalemate in the security council is likely as russia is expected to block any decision that does not meet with belgrade 's approval . " we have to wait for a security council decision , " prime minister vojislav kostunica said .
unilateral action on the part of pristina would trigger similar responses , serbia 's leaders warned . kosovo 's president fatmir sejdiu made it clear after the meeting that pristina would not consent to new talks .

" in an interview with the newsmagazine stern , angela merkel rebuffed ongoing criticisms of her foreign policy .
opposition politicians have repeatedly critiqued merkel for her frequent trips abroad , as well as her decision to welcome the dalai lama in germany in september - an action which has threatened germany 's economic relationship with china .
the critics have also spoken out against merkel 's clear denunciations of human-rights infractions in china and russia .
foreign policy : a thin , blurred line ?
in her conversation with stern , merkel said it is " provincial to consider making foreign visits in order to lobby for our security , our environment and our well-being , less important " than domestic politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some argue that merkel 's focus on foreign policy is displaced " today there is no longer such a clear line between domestic and foreign policy , " merkel added .
merkel also said she would " continue to choose state visitors and foreign trips as i see fit and useful , when it comes to serving germany 's interests . "
" it is wrong and superfluous to play political values and economic success against each other , as if only one or the other is important , " merkel told stern .
" they belong together . "
criticism from steinmeier merkel said she thought her approach had made germany a more " respected partner in the world , even more so in the past two years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- right -rrb- , like his ex-boss schröder -lrb- left -rrb- has critiqued merkel 's policies the comment was seen as a clear jab at her social democratic predecessor gerhard schröder , whose government pursued a foreign policy that placated to china on human rights in favor of pursuing economic ties .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , also a social democrat , recently spoke out against merkel 's decisions on china policy .
during a visit to paris earlier in november , he told journalists he was " worried " about the escalating diplomatic tension between germany and china in the wake of the dalai lama 's visit .
" we have had better relations with china , that is unfortunately true , " steinmeier said .
" it is a development that we can not let remain as is . "
merkel : support on iran is key he added that it was in germany 's interest to reestablish good relations with china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some worry that merkel is risking economic ties with china since then , the issue has given rise to several political flare-ups .
but the chancellor defended her relationship with steinmeier , telling stern the two of them " work well together , in general . "
" if you look at other governments , we can be very content , " she said .
in her interview , merkel also pleaded with the international community to support germany in its attempt to find a diplomatic solution to the iran crisis . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 28.11.2007 opinion : why should the annapolis summit be any different ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following the middle east summit in annapolis , dw 's peter philipp says only baby steps have been taken to achieve peace .
he praises president bush 's clarity on establishing a palestinian state , but remains skeptical . peace is supposed to descend on the middle east .
it 's a goal to be achieved by the end of next year .
it 's a commendable goal that would prompt one to congratulate the parties involved .
if it were only that easy .
there have always been good intentions - mainly in the form of initiatives and declarations - in the past when it comes to the middle east , just as there have been dates and deadlines set .
the only problem is that they have expired without the desired result being achieved .
why should it be different this time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp in no way do i want to diminish the efforts made in trying to find a peaceful solution in the middle east .
it is just odd that , without even trying to get to the real core issues in the middle east conflict , peace is now supposed to be possible - more so than in the past .
and that uneasy feeling makes one believe that it 's only wishful thinking , particularly on the part of the us president .
after all , george w. bush wants to crown his presidency with at least one foreign policy success .
but he overlooks the fact that declarations of intention alone do not suffice to achieve that end .
otherwise , we would have had a pacified , free and democratic iraq as a role model for the rest of the arab world a long time ago .
control mechanisms stay on track still , president bush has promised that the united states will act as a kind of control mechanism for the implementation of a peaceful solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict and has said that enough pressure will be placed on both sides to keep them on track toward their own , self-defined goals .
this is a new move , considering that right at the beginning of his presidency , bush declared that the us would not play the mediator role in any middle east negotiations , thereby himself causing the now so regretted , years-long deadlock . that bush speaks so openly about establishing a palestinian state is also good , and right .
he is not the first us president to do so , but while it sounded like a vision for the future when bill clinton said it , with bush , it sounds like a target for the negotiations during the next 12 months .
west bank remains controversial this is definitely progress .
but , the president still does not seem to understand , for example , that not merely a few " illegal settlement posts " have to be dissolved to achieve that goal , but that the israeli settlements in the west bank will have to be completely vacated - one of the greatest impediments to peace .
like no other president before him , bush has stood behind israeli policies in the occupied territories throughout his term of office , so he will now have quite a bit of work to do to convince others that it will be different in the future . despite all the skepticism , a step in the right direction has been taken in annapolis .
but the stretch to the finish line has hardly been shortened as a result .
many steps must still be made to get closer to that goal and , experience with the players in the middle east as well as with this president , could teach us a lesson .
that is : one way or another , things will go wrong .

he praises president bush 's clarity on establishing a palestinian state , but remains skeptical . peace is supposed to descend on the middle east .
it 's a goal to be achieved by the end of next year .
it 's a commendable goal that would prompt one to congratulate the parties involved .
if it were only that easy .
there have always been good intentions - mainly in the form of initiatives and declarations - in the past when it comes to the middle east , just as there have been dates and deadlines set .
the only problem is that they have expired without the desired result being achieved .
why should it be different this time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp in no way do i want to diminish the efforts made in trying to find a peaceful solution in the middle east .
it is just odd that , without even trying to get to the real core issues in the middle east conflict , peace is now supposed to be possible - more so than in the past .
and that uneasy feeling makes one believe that it 's only wishful thinking , particularly on the part of the us president .
after all , george w. bush wants to crown his presidency with at least one foreign policy success .
but he overlooks the fact that declarations of intention alone do not suffice to achieve that end .
otherwise , we would have had a pacified , free and democratic iraq as a role model for the rest of the arab world a long time ago .
control mechanisms stay on track still , president bush has promised that the united states will act as a kind of control mechanism for the implementation of a peaceful solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict and has said that enough pressure will be placed on both sides to keep them on track toward their own , self-defined goals .
this is a new move , considering that right at the beginning of his presidency , bush declared that the us would not play the mediator role in any middle east negotiations , thereby himself causing the now so regretted , years-long deadlock . that bush speaks so openly about establishing a palestinian state is also good , and right .
he is not the first us president to do so , but while it sounded like a vision for the future when bill clinton said it , with bush , it sounds like a target for the negotiations during the next 12 months .
west bank remains controversial this is definitely progress .
but , the president still does not seem to understand , for example , that not merely a few " illegal settlement posts " have to be dissolved to achieve that goal , but that the israeli settlements in the west bank will have to be completely vacated - one of the greatest impediments to peace .
like no other president before him , bush has stood behind israeli policies in the occupied territories throughout his term of office , so he will now have quite a bit of work to do to convince others that it will be different in the future . despite all the skepticism , a step in the right direction has been taken in annapolis .
but the stretch to the finish line has hardly been shortened as a result .
many steps must still be made to get closer to that goal and , experience with the players in the middle east as well as with this president , could teach us a lesson .
that is : one way or another , things will go wrong .

but , the president still does not seem to understand , for example , that not merely a few " illegal settlement posts " have to be dissolved to achieve that goal , but that the israeli settlements in the west bank will have to be completely vacated - one of the greatest impediments to peace .
like no other president before him , bush has stood behind israeli policies in the occupied territories throughout his term of office , so he will now have quite a bit of work to do to convince others that it will be different in the future . despite all the skepticism , a step in the right direction has been taken in annapolis .
but the stretch to the finish line has hardly been shortened as a result .

he praises president bush 's clarity on establishing a palestinian state , but remains skeptical . peace is supposed to descend on the middle east .
it 's a goal to be achieved by the end of next year .
it 's a commendable goal that would prompt one to congratulate the parties involved .
if it were only that easy .
there have always been good intentions - mainly in the form of initiatives and declarations - in the past when it comes to the middle east , just as there have been dates and deadlines set .
the only problem is that they have expired without the desired result being achieved .
why should it be different this time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp in no way do i want to diminish the efforts made in trying to find a peaceful solution in the middle east .
it is just odd that , without even trying to get to the real core issues in the middle east conflict , peace is now supposed to be possible - more so than in the past .
and that uneasy feeling makes one believe that it 's only wishful thinking , particularly on the part of the us president .
after all , george w. bush wants to crown his presidency with at least one foreign policy success .
but he overlooks the fact that declarations of intention alone do not suffice to achieve that end .
otherwise , we would have had a pacified , free and democratic iraq as a role model for the rest of the arab world a long time ago .
control mechanisms stay on track still , president bush has promised that the united states will act as a kind of control mechanism for the implementation of a peaceful solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict and has said that enough pressure will be placed on both sides to keep them on track toward their own , self-defined goals .
this is a new move , considering that right at the beginning of his presidency , bush declared that the us would not play the mediator role in any middle east negotiations , thereby himself causing the now so regretted , years-long deadlock . that bush speaks so openly about establishing a palestinian state is also good , and right .
he is not the first us president to do so , but while it sounded like a vision for the future when bill clinton said it , with bush , it sounds like a target for the negotiations during the next 12 months .
west bank remains controversial this is definitely progress .
but , the president still does not seem to understand , for example , that not merely a few " illegal settlement posts " have to be dissolved to achieve that goal , but that the israeli settlements in the west bank will have to be completely vacated - one of the greatest impediments to peace .

a last round of negotiations between serbia and kosovo by a un-sponsored troika of envoys regarding the future status of kosovo failed to reach an agreement . " the baden conference marks the end of face-to-face talks " between serbia and kosovo , wolfgang ischinger , the eu 's representative in the kosovo troika , said at a press conference in vienna on wednesday , nov .
28 .
" regrettably the parties were unable to reach agreement . " the us envoy to the talks , frank wisner , called on belgrade and pristina to uphold promises not to engage in violence , adding that peace in the balkans was " very much at stake . " the mediators , who said they probed every solution that was " humanly possible , " are scheduled to make final visits to serbia and kosovo next monday before submitting a report to the united nations , due by dec .
10 . calls for independence " very soon " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thaci said independence - in coordination with the west - would come soon after dec .
10 the failed talks set the stage for the province 's independence , as kosovo 's leaders , who enjoy the support of washington , said they wanted independence " very soon . "
the call for independence was one of the few issues that united ethnic albanians in kosovo during parliamentary elections earlier this month . " we regret that serbia did not find it possible to agree to the independent final state of kosovo , " the province 's likely new prime minister , hashim thaci , said at the conclusion of the three days of talks . belgrade 's leaders , however , have offered only a degree of autonomy to the province and repeatedly vowed not to accept kosovo 's secession from serbia .

but while they may be the hottest new german art export , they are n't the only ones . moma – four magic letters that open the door to art-world success .
any artist , whose work has been shown at moma - the museum of modern art , in new york , can surely say they have " made it . "
gert and uwe tobias can now lay claim to that fame .
from wednesday , nov .
28 through feb .
25 , moma is showing 20 works by the 34-year-old twins from cologne , germany .
the show comprises drawings of typewriters and fantastic gouaches , as well as enormous , brightly colored woodcuts .
the tobias brothers were born in romania and came to germany in 1985 .
they studied art together in the northern german town of braunschweig .
today , they share a studio in cologne .
an affinity for german art bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brothers have been praised for their use of color " it is a great honor for us to be offered an exhibit at moma , " gert tobias said on the eve of the opening in new york .
but the twins are not the first german artists to get a show at moma .
in 2001 , düsseldorf photographer andreas gursky was given a show in the famed museum , and a year later , it was painter gerhard richter 's turn .
" moma has shown a great affinity for german art , " said stefan gronert , the curator of the kunst museum bonn , who has been following the twins ' career since 2004 .
but gert and uwe tobias do n't see their work in the category of " german art " - or romanian art , for that matter .
" we are just artists , who make our own art , " gert tobias said .
nonetheless , it would be fairly easy for the brothers to ride the tide of popularity in german art if they wanted to , gronert said .
" right now , german art is very popular in other countries .
especially in the usa , " he said .
popularity of the leipzig school he pointed out that germany is home to the leipzig school , whose modern , graphic painting style has excited interest in us collectors for years now .
today , leipzig is home to a lively artists ' quarter , where 11 galleries have opened up in a building that was once europe 's largest cotton factory .
and more than just paintings are being made .
numerous young artists of all stripes have jumped on the leipzig art scene bandwagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter has been very popular in the us the popularity of german art is closely linked to the growing interest in art world-wide .
the art market is hungrier than ever .
gronert claims that german art , like other german products , is known for its quality .
" the best explanation is that quality simply wins out , " he said .
this appears to be the case when it comes to the tobias brothers .
the pair has been called " revivers of the woodcut . "
moma has praised their " amazing color sensibility " and their " astounding graphical compositions . "
career boost is likely the moma exhibit will no doubt boost the careers of the tobias brothers , who appear to be taking it in stride .
" after new york , we need a few days to just process it all , " gert tobias said .
" we are n't sure what comes after that . "
gronert said he imagines a number of major museums will want to mount shows of the tobias brothers ' woodcuts - including his own .
in march , an exhibit of gert and uwe tobias woodcuts will be opening at the kunst museum bonn . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . we traveled to görlitz in may 2007 and found it charming , unspoiled , and beautiful .
we enjoyed a walking tour -lrb- only in german -rrb- , enjoyed the many old buildings and churches and walked across the bridge to have lunch on the polish side of the river .
while it 's not exactly on most tourist routes , it 's definitely worth the visit . - chris , us when you 're tired of sausages and all things german go to osteria no. 1 - it saved our lives in berlin !
we had a lovely , intimate , platter of mixed pasta at a very good budget in the way that only italians are good at . - c. sammut , malta while i appreciated very much your links on the dw-world.de site for options to consider when visiting various towns and cities in germany , i simply chose a different course for my stay .
first , i used the hotel reservation links given to me by my cousin from seeheim to make all of my hotel reservations via the internet and they all proved to be , well , just perfect .
we started in offenbach , then took a train trip to hildesheim and from there on to bocholt and lastly to freiburg im bresigau .
secondly , i ate locally from the metzgerei -lrb- butchers -rrb- to the konditerei -lrb- cake shop -rrb- and the open air markets , and as is the german custom , promptly took my afternoon kaffeepause -lrb- coffee break -rrb- everyday .
evenings usually found me sitting with the locals in the famous neighborhood bierstube , listening to the local radio stations still playing music from the 1950s and 1960s ... some things never seem to change .
tourists ?
i never really met any that i could tell , except during my last few days in freiburg .
next year i hope to go to germany for a two-month stay at a goethe institute german-language program . - philip ohmes , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reader enjoyed taking a german coffee break i 'd like to share my experience with you during my stay in the federal republic of germany from 1985-1988 .
first and foremost was the warm welcome and good treatment that i received from the german people in general .
from the first time that i met germans i had a warm reception and i was loved by the nationals everywhere i went . the next experience i had was learning the language .
from the very beginning , i faced some difficulties with the language and then later i became more at ease .
the different german accents made learning the language a little bit hard for me .
i went to the language school from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. for six months , which was good for me .
i am now so used to the german language that i could visit any city in germany without an interpreter .

a total of 397 german schools and 7,900 students took part in the study . " german primary schools have done their homework , " said wilfried bos , the study 's director for germany .
" we have again clearly and substantially improved . " smaller gender differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls scored higher than boys in all the participating countries italy -lrb- 8th -rrb- , hungary -lrb- 9th -rrb- and sweden -lrb- 10th -rrb- , which finished first in the last iglu survey in 2001 , came in ahead of germany in reading skills , but not by statistically significant margins , according to the survey .
germany placed above the eu and oecd averages . russia , which excluded more students than any other participating country from the test , placed first , ahead of hong kong and canada .
bos said germany could have improved its position had it kept more than 0.7 percent of fourth graders from taking part . the number of students in germany with very low reading skills dropped while the number of strong readers increases in the five years between the two iglu studies .
differences in reading skills between girls and boys were smallest in germany with a smaller percentage of boys in the lowest reading groups compared to other participating countries . social class makes big difference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids with immigrant backgrounds are at a disadvantage in german schools the survey also pointed out areas german schools were failing their pupils . in comparison with other countries , the study showed a clearer link between social class and reading performance - even the earliest grades - among children in germany .
poor students and children of immigrants in germany also generally performed worse than their classmates more often than similar students in other countries . " primary schools have not succeeded in sufficiently compensating for social inequality , " the study said . the finding reflect stark criticism made by a special envoy from the united nations in march that germany 's three-tiered school system was discriminatory for shutting out children from immigrant and poorer backgrounds . while most other european countries have created more inclusive school systems , germany has , for the most part , stuck to a three-tier structure that places children into educational tracks before the age of 12 . more results coming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next set of test results is due next week the iglu study said german students from upper-class families were often put in the highest track despite only adequate grades while higher skills were demanded of children with poorer or immigrant backgrounds to receive the same recommendation . education in germany has been subject to censure after a string of studies results showed the country 's schools to be trailing internationally .
in a 2001 pisa study , germany ranked only 21st in reading skills and 20th in math and science among 31 countries assessed . schavan said wednesday 's ranking showed reform measures put in place after 2001 had been successful . results from the next pisa study , which tested natural science skills , are scheduled to be presented tuesday .
according to spanish teacher newspaper magisnet , german students rank 13th among 57 states in that study - an improvement of five ranks when compared to the 2003 survey .
the results can not be compared , however , as the tests have changed significantly . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . we traveled to görlitz in may 2007 and found it charming , unspoiled , and beautiful .
we enjoyed a walking tour -lrb- only in german -rrb- , enjoyed the many old buildings and churches and walked across the bridge to have lunch on the polish side of the river .

first , i used the hotel reservation links given to me by my cousin from seeheim to make all of my hotel reservations via the internet and they all proved to be , well , just perfect .
we started in offenbach , then took a train trip to hildesheim and from there on to bocholt and lastly to freiburg im bresigau .
secondly , i ate locally from the metzgerei -lrb- butchers -rrb- to the konditerei -lrb- cake shop -rrb- and the open air markets , and as is the german custom , promptly took my afternoon kaffeepause -lrb- coffee break -rrb- everyday .
evenings usually found me sitting with the locals in the famous neighborhood bierstube , listening to the local radio stations still playing music from the 1950s and 1960s ... some things never seem to change .

first and foremost was the warm welcome and good treatment that i received from the german people in general .
from the first time that i met germans i had a warm reception and i was loved by the nationals everywhere i went . the next experience i had was learning the language .
from the very beginning , i faced some difficulties with the language and then later i became more at ease .
the different german accents made learning the language a little bit hard for me .
i went to the language school from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. for six months , which was good for me .
i am now so used to the german language that i could visit any city in germany without an interpreter .
once i visited cologne during the science fair , where there were so many different things i could n't see them all . - vasco s. kemokai compiled by dw staff -lrb- sjr -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

from wednesday , nov .

25 , moma is showing 20 works by the 34-year-old twins from cologne , germany .
the show comprises drawings of typewriters and fantastic gouaches , as well as enormous , brightly colored woodcuts .

they studied art together in the northern german town of braunschweig .
today , they share a studio in cologne .

but the twins are not the first german artists to get a show at moma .
in 2001 , düsseldorf photographer andreas gursky was given a show in the famed museum , and a year later , it was painter gerhard richter 's turn .
" moma has shown a great affinity for german art , " said stefan gronert , the curator of the kunst museum bonn , who has been following the twins ' career since 2004 .
but gert and uwe tobias do n't see their work in the category of " german art " - or romanian art , for that matter .
" we are just artists , who make our own art , " gert tobias said .

moma has praised their " amazing color sensibility " and their " astounding graphical compositions . "

a last round of negotiations between serbia and kosovo by a un-sponsored troika of envoys regarding the future status of kosovo failed to reach an agreement . " the baden conference marks the end of face-to-face talks " between serbia and kosovo , wolfgang ischinger , the eu 's representative in the kosovo troika , said at a press conference in vienna on wednesday , nov .

" regrettably the parties were unable to reach agreement . " the us envoy to the talks , frank wisner , called on belgrade and pristina to uphold promises not to engage in violence , adding that peace in the balkans was " very much at stake .

10 the failed talks set the stage for the province 's independence , as kosovo 's leaders , who enjoy the support of washington , said they wanted independence " very soon . "
the call for independence was one of the few issues that united ethnic albanians in kosovo during parliamentary elections earlier this month . " we regret that serbia did not find it possible to agree to the independent final state of kosovo , " the province 's likely new prime minister , hashim thaci , said at the conclusion of the three days of talks . belgrade 's leaders , however , have offered only a degree of autonomy to the province and repeatedly vowed not to accept kosovo 's secession from serbia .

10 deadline set by un secretary general ban ki-moon .
a stalemate in the security council is likely as russia is expected to block any decision that does not meet with belgrade 's approval . " we have to wait for a security council decision , " prime minister vojislav kostunica said .
unilateral action on the part of pristina would trigger similar responses , serbia 's leaders warned . kosovo 's president fatmir sejdiu made it clear after the meeting that pristina would not consent to new talks .

sunday 's parliamentary elections in russia may well leave much to be desired in terms of democracy .
but experts on the country say there 's little need to fear the kremlin 's long-term plans . the poll on dec .
2 is being viewed as a referendum on president vladimir putin 's popularity .
with putin 's future plans unclear and the kremlin recently striking an aggressive international posture , particularly toward the united states , many pundits have speculated that russia might be bidding to re-establish itself as a global superpower . but russia 's military might today does n't remotely compare to the power wielded by the soviet union .
german experts on russia said there 's little reason to worry about a return to the cold-war-era stand-off between russia and the west . " superpower is the wrong word , " said hans-henning schröder , a professor of eastern european history and politics at the university of bremen .
" big power would be more accurate .
the us is in another dimension entirely , and that 's clear to the russian leadership under putin as well .
but russia would like to reach the level of influence of , say , germany or great britain . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adherents of the current president have been taking to the streets to show support christoph zürcher , professor of political science at the free university of berlin , agreed that it did not make sense to put russia and the us in the same league . " russia is trying to show presence on the international stage , but it 's hard to take the idea of bipolarity between russia and the us very seriously , " he said .
" it would be nice if there were a multi-polar counterweight to american influence in the world .
but that 's not what russia stands for right now .
they 're pursing national interests . " energy plays limited role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's gas reserves give it power - especially over its immediate neighbors russia 's vast natural resources , particularly natural gas and oil , will give the country increased leverage in coming years .
but the experts do n't think europe is necessarily overly dependent on russian energy . " the role of energy is foreign relations is over-dramatized , " said alexander rahr , the director of the russian-eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations .
" germany only gets 30 percent of its natural gas from russia ; france only 10 percent .
the lone nations who are truly dependent are russia 's direct neighbors . " schröder agreed that countries such as georgia , the baltic republics and poland could feel pressure from russia , which in turn could create a problem for the eu . but " russia has roughly the same economic power as italy so it 's actually a fairly small country in this respect , and countries like germany do n't need to worry too much about possible developments , " he added . lack of middle class is biggest problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economy is driven by natural resources , while technology lags russia is getting richer and currently boasts annual growth rates of up to 7 percent .
but the experts disagreed as to how strong the russian economy really is - and how much it may need to diversify from energy production . " russia can assume it wo n't be suffering any financial crises in the next 10 years , especially as the energy needs of countries like china are also sure to rise , " rahr said .
" the biggest problem is the destruction of the middle-class - that was a mistake that needs correcting . " shakespearean drama ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian opposition parties say the election is a farce there is complete consensus that sunday 's election is about putin - and whether he can retain significant power despite constitutional restrictions . but the experts stressed that that issue - at least in the short term - has more to do with putin 's relationship with russia , and vice versa , and less with putin or russia 's plans vis-a-vis the world . " russia has become arrogant enough to flout international decorum , for instance , by refusing to allow international monitoring , " zürcher said .
" that 's not so terrible for the rest of the world .
what 's terrible is that russia is on its way to becoming an unpleasant , semi-authoritarian system . " " the problem is that all the power is concentrated in the hands of the president , and when he gives up this power and passes it on to his successor , he 's in effect at his successor 's mercy , " schröder said .
" what putin is doing is trying to position himself so that he 's unassailable . " " it 's almost like a shakespearean drama , " rahr said .
" a historic figure who is still very popular has to go because of the constitution , but the system requires a strong leader at the top .
that 's also thrown the state into an internal dilemma . " jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but while they may be the hottest new german art export , they are n't the only ones . moma – four magic letters that open the door to art-world success .
any artist , whose work has been shown at moma - the museum of modern art , in new york , can surely say they have " made it . "
gert and uwe tobias can now lay claim to that fame .
from wednesday , nov .
28 through feb .
25 , moma is showing 20 works by the 34-year-old twins from cologne , germany .
the show comprises drawings of typewriters and fantastic gouaches , as well as enormous , brightly colored woodcuts .
the tobias brothers were born in romania and came to germany in 1985 .
they studied art together in the northern german town of braunschweig .
today , they share a studio in cologne .
an affinity for german art bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brothers have been praised for their use of color " it is a great honor for us to be offered an exhibit at moma , " gert tobias said on the eve of the opening in new york .
but the twins are not the first german artists to get a show at moma .
in 2001 , düsseldorf photographer andreas gursky was given a show in the famed museum , and a year later , it was painter gerhard richter 's turn .
" moma has shown a great affinity for german art , " said stefan gronert , the curator of the kunst museum bonn , who has been following the twins ' career since 2004 .
but gert and uwe tobias do n't see their work in the category of " german art " - or romanian art , for that matter .
" we are just artists , who make our own art , " gert tobias said .
nonetheless , it would be fairly easy for the brothers to ride the tide of popularity in german art if they wanted to , gronert said .
" right now , german art is very popular in other countries .
especially in the usa , " he said .
popularity of the leipzig school he pointed out that germany is home to the leipzig school , whose modern , graphic painting style has excited interest in us collectors for years now .
today , leipzig is home to a lively artists ' quarter , where 11 galleries have opened up in a building that was once europe 's largest cotton factory .
and more than just paintings are being made .
numerous young artists of all stripes have jumped on the leipzig art scene bandwagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter has been very popular in the us the popularity of german art is closely linked to the growing interest in art world-wide .
the art market is hungrier than ever .
gronert claims that german art , like other german products , is known for its quality .
" the best explanation is that quality simply wins out , " he said .
this appears to be the case when it comes to the tobias brothers .
the pair has been called " revivers of the woodcut . "
moma has praised their " amazing color sensibility " and their " astounding graphical compositions . "
career boost is likely the moma exhibit will no doubt boost the careers of the tobias brothers , who appear to be taking it in stride .
" after new york , we need a few days to just process it all , " gert tobias said .
" we are n't sure what comes after that . "
gronert said he imagines a number of major museums will want to mount shows of the tobias brothers ' woodcuts - including his own .
in march , an exhibit of gert and uwe tobias woodcuts will be opening at the kunst museum bonn . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in an interview with the newsmagazine stern , angela merkel rebuffed ongoing criticisms of her foreign policy .
opposition politicians have repeatedly critiqued merkel for her frequent trips abroad , as well as her decision to welcome the dalai lama in germany in september - an action which has threatened germany 's economic relationship with china .
the critics have also spoken out against merkel 's clear denunciations of human-rights infractions in china and russia .
foreign policy : a thin , blurred line ?
in her conversation with stern , merkel said it is " provincial to consider making foreign visits in order to lobby for our security , our environment and our well-being , less important " than domestic politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some argue that merkel 's focus on foreign policy is displaced " today there is no longer such a clear line between domestic and foreign policy , " merkel added .
merkel also said she would " continue to choose state visitors and foreign trips as i see fit and useful , when it comes to serving germany 's interests . "
" it is wrong and superfluous to play political values and economic success against each other , as if only one or the other is important , " merkel told stern .
" they belong together . "
criticism from steinmeier merkel said she thought her approach had made germany a more " respected partner in the world , even more so in the past two years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- right -rrb- , like his ex-boss schröder -lrb- left -rrb- has critiqued merkel 's policies the comment was seen as a clear jab at her social democratic predecessor gerhard schröder , whose government pursued a foreign policy that placated to china on human rights in favor of pursuing economic ties .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , also a social democrat , recently spoke out against merkel 's decisions on china policy .
during a visit to paris earlier in november , he told journalists he was " worried " about the escalating diplomatic tension between germany and china in the wake of the dalai lama 's visit .
" we have had better relations with china , that is unfortunately true , " steinmeier said .
" it is a development that we can not let remain as is . "
merkel : support on iran is key he added that it was in germany 's interest to reestablish good relations with china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some worry that merkel is risking economic ties with china since then , the issue has given rise to several political flare-ups .
but the chancellor defended her relationship with steinmeier , telling stern the two of them " work well together , in general . "
" if you look at other governments , we can be very content , " she said .
in her interview , merkel also pleaded with the international community to support germany in its attempt to find a diplomatic solution to the iran crisis . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

first and foremost was the warm welcome and good treatment that i received from the german people in general .
from the first time that i met germans i had a warm reception and i was loved by the nationals everywhere i went . the next experience i had was learning the language .
from the very beginning , i faced some difficulties with the language and then later i became more at ease .
the different german accents made learning the language a little bit hard for me .
i went to the language school from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. for six months , which was good for me .
i am now so used to the german language that i could visit any city in germany without an interpreter .

but while they may be the hottest new german art export , they are n't the only ones . moma – four magic letters that open the door to art-world success .
any artist , whose work has been shown at moma - the museum of modern art , in new york , can surely say they have " made it . "
gert and uwe tobias can now lay claim to that fame .
from wednesday , nov .
28 through feb .
25 , moma is showing 20 works by the 34-year-old twins from cologne , germany .
the show comprises drawings of typewriters and fantastic gouaches , as well as enormous , brightly colored woodcuts .
the tobias brothers were born in romania and came to germany in 1985 .
they studied art together in the northern german town of braunschweig .
today , they share a studio in cologne .
an affinity for german art bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brothers have been praised for their use of color " it is a great honor for us to be offered an exhibit at moma , " gert tobias said on the eve of the opening in new york .
but the twins are not the first german artists to get a show at moma .
in 2001 , düsseldorf photographer andreas gursky was given a show in the famed museum , and a year later , it was painter gerhard richter 's turn .
" moma has shown a great affinity for german art , " said stefan gronert , the curator of the kunst museum bonn , who has been following the twins ' career since 2004 .
but gert and uwe tobias do n't see their work in the category of " german art " - or romanian art , for that matter .
" we are just artists , who make our own art , " gert tobias said .
nonetheless , it would be fairly easy for the brothers to ride the tide of popularity in german art if they wanted to , gronert said .
" right now , german art is very popular in other countries .
especially in the usa , " he said .
popularity of the leipzig school he pointed out that germany is home to the leipzig school , whose modern , graphic painting style has excited interest in us collectors for years now .
today , leipzig is home to a lively artists ' quarter , where 11 galleries have opened up in a building that was once europe 's largest cotton factory .
and more than just paintings are being made .
numerous young artists of all stripes have jumped on the leipzig art scene bandwagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter has been very popular in the us the popularity of german art is closely linked to the growing interest in art world-wide .
the art market is hungrier than ever .
gronert claims that german art , like other german products , is known for its quality .
" the best explanation is that quality simply wins out , " he said .
this appears to be the case when it comes to the tobias brothers .
the pair has been called " revivers of the woodcut . "
moma has praised their " amazing color sensibility " and their " astounding graphical compositions . "
career boost is likely the moma exhibit will no doubt boost the careers of the tobias brothers , who appear to be taking it in stride .
" after new york , we need a few days to just process it all , " gert tobias said .
" we are n't sure what comes after that . "
gronert said he imagines a number of major museums will want to mount shows of the tobias brothers ' woodcuts - including his own .
in march , an exhibit of gert and uwe tobias woodcuts will be opening at the kunst museum bonn . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , rejected calls by eu leaders for faster revaluation of china 's currency , saying its value was not a major factor in his country 's growing trade surplus with europe . wen did , however , strike a more conciliatory tone with eu finance experts during the 10th china-eu business summit this week .
he said that china would reform its currency policy in a " gradual , proactive and manageable manner . " but wen added that the exchange rate between the euro and the chinese yuan was determined by the euro 's rate against the dollar . " the plunge of the us dollar is the main cause of the appreciation of the euro , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants china to move away from using the dollar as its only currency standard the eu 's economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said china , as a world economic power , needed to consider more than only the dollar in its economic policy . " they have to consider that not all adjustments should be focusing on the relationship between the dollar and the yuan , " almunia told reporters in beijing .

" eu 's growing trade deficit addressing the europeans other main economic concern with the asian giant , chinese president hu jintao told european commission president jose manuel barroso that he " did not favor a sizeable trade surplus with the eu , " officials said .

" the eu exports less to china than to switzerland , a country of 7 million people , " barroso told a business forum on the sidelines of the annual summit .
" our ultimate goal is to create a level playing field for both sides . " barroso also said eu businesses needed access " without artificial barriers , " pointing to problems such as copyright violations , lack of standardization and murky investment rules .

a last round of negotiations between serbia and kosovo by a un-sponsored troika of envoys regarding the future status of kosovo failed to reach an agreement . " the baden conference marks the end of face-to-face talks " between serbia and kosovo , wolfgang ischinger , the eu 's representative in the kosovo troika , said at a press conference in vienna on wednesday , nov .
28 .
" regrettably the parties were unable to reach agreement . " the us envoy to the talks , frank wisner , called on belgrade and pristina to uphold promises not to engage in violence , adding that peace in the balkans was " very much at stake . " the mediators , who said they probed every solution that was " humanly possible , " are scheduled to make final visits to serbia and kosovo next monday before submitting a report to the united nations , due by dec .
10 . calls for independence " very soon " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thaci said independence - in coordination with the west - would come soon after dec .
10 the failed talks set the stage for the province 's independence , as kosovo 's leaders , who enjoy the support of washington , said they wanted independence " very soon . "
the call for independence was one of the few issues that united ethnic albanians in kosovo during parliamentary elections earlier this month . " we regret that serbia did not find it possible to agree to the independent final state of kosovo , " the province 's likely new prime minister , hashim thaci , said at the conclusion of the three days of talks . belgrade 's leaders , however , have offered only a degree of autonomy to the province and repeatedly vowed not to accept kosovo 's secession from serbia . " we are going to cancel all these decisions by kosovo authorities leading to independence and use all legal instruments , " serbian president boris tadic warned .
" this is a very serious situation . " balkan domino effect feared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato troops have been stationed in kosovo for eight years some observers have said a unilateral declaration of independence on the part of kosovo could encourage the serb-populated northern part of the province to secede , and possibly even lead to similar moves by serbs in bosnia and albanians in macedonia , which could then cause unrest . pristina made it clear that it had never intended to budge from achieving full independence " we have not sought belgrade 's consent but partnership with serbia , " kosovo delegation member veton surroi told reporters . the serbian province , 90 percent of whose population is ethnic albanian , has been under un administration and nato protection since the military alliance ended violence there in 1999 . security council impasse expected serbia insisted talks had to be continued even after the dec .
10 deadline set by un secretary general ban ki-moon .
a stalemate in the security council is likely as russia is expected to block any decision that does not meet with belgrade 's approval . " we have to wait for a security council decision , " prime minister vojislav kostunica said .
unilateral action on the part of pristina would trigger similar responses , serbia 's leaders warned . kosovo 's president fatmir sejdiu made it clear after the meeting that pristina would not consent to new talks .

he praises president bush 's clarity on establishing a palestinian state , but remains skeptical . peace is supposed to descend on the middle east .
it 's a goal to be achieved by the end of next year .
it 's a commendable goal that would prompt one to congratulate the parties involved .
if it were only that easy .
there have always been good intentions - mainly in the form of initiatives and declarations - in the past when it comes to the middle east , just as there have been dates and deadlines set .
the only problem is that they have expired without the desired result being achieved .
why should it be different this time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp in no way do i want to diminish the efforts made in trying to find a peaceful solution in the middle east .
it is just odd that , without even trying to get to the real core issues in the middle east conflict , peace is now supposed to be possible - more so than in the past .
and that uneasy feeling makes one believe that it 's only wishful thinking , particularly on the part of the us president .
after all , george w. bush wants to crown his presidency with at least one foreign policy success .
but he overlooks the fact that declarations of intention alone do not suffice to achieve that end .
otherwise , we would have had a pacified , free and democratic iraq as a role model for the rest of the arab world a long time ago .
control mechanisms stay on track still , president bush has promised that the united states will act as a kind of control mechanism for the implementation of a peaceful solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict and has said that enough pressure will be placed on both sides to keep them on track toward their own , self-defined goals .
this is a new move , considering that right at the beginning of his presidency , bush declared that the us would not play the mediator role in any middle east negotiations , thereby himself causing the now so regretted , years-long deadlock . that bush speaks so openly about establishing a palestinian state is also good , and right .
he is not the first us president to do so , but while it sounded like a vision for the future when bill clinton said it , with bush , it sounds like a target for the negotiations during the next 12 months .
west bank remains controversial this is definitely progress .
but , the president still does not seem to understand , for example , that not merely a few " illegal settlement posts " have to be dissolved to achieve that goal , but that the israeli settlements in the west bank will have to be completely vacated - one of the greatest impediments to peace .
like no other president before him , bush has stood behind israeli policies in the occupied territories throughout his term of office , so he will now have quite a bit of work to do to convince others that it will be different in the future . despite all the skepticism , a step in the right direction has been taken in annapolis .
but the stretch to the finish line has hardly been shortened as a result .
many steps must still be made to get closer to that goal and , experience with the players in the middle east as well as with this president , could teach us a lesson .
that is : one way or another , things will go wrong .

sunday 's parliamentary elections in russia may well leave much to be desired in terms of democracy .
but experts on the country say there 's little need to fear the kremlin 's long-term plans . the poll on dec .
2 is being viewed as a referendum on president vladimir putin 's popularity .
with putin 's future plans unclear and the kremlin recently striking an aggressive international posture , particularly toward the united states , many pundits have speculated that russia might be bidding to re-establish itself as a global superpower . but russia 's military might today does n't remotely compare to the power wielded by the soviet union .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . we traveled to görlitz in may 2007 and found it charming , unspoiled , and beautiful .
we enjoyed a walking tour -lrb- only in german -rrb- , enjoyed the many old buildings and churches and walked across the bridge to have lunch on the polish side of the river .
while it 's not exactly on most tourist routes , it 's definitely worth the visit . - chris , us when you 're tired of sausages and all things german go to osteria no. 1 - it saved our lives in berlin !
we had a lovely , intimate , platter of mixed pasta at a very good budget in the way that only italians are good at . - c. sammut , malta while i appreciated very much your links on the dw-world.de site for options to consider when visiting various towns and cities in germany , i simply chose a different course for my stay .
first , i used the hotel reservation links given to me by my cousin from seeheim to make all of my hotel reservations via the internet and they all proved to be , well , just perfect .
we started in offenbach , then took a train trip to hildesheim and from there on to bocholt and lastly to freiburg im bresigau .
secondly , i ate locally from the metzgerei -lrb- butchers -rrb- to the konditerei -lrb- cake shop -rrb- and the open air markets , and as is the german custom , promptly took my afternoon kaffeepause -lrb- coffee break -rrb- everyday .
evenings usually found me sitting with the locals in the famous neighborhood bierstube , listening to the local radio stations still playing music from the 1950s and 1960s ... some things never seem to change .
tourists ?
i never really met any that i could tell , except during my last few days in freiburg .
next year i hope to go to germany for a two-month stay at a goethe institute german-language program . - philip ohmes , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reader enjoyed taking a german coffee break i 'd like to share my experience with you during my stay in the federal republic of germany from 1985-1988 .
first and foremost was the warm welcome and good treatment that i received from the german people in general .
from the first time that i met germans i had a warm reception and i was loved by the nationals everywhere i went . the next experience i had was learning the language .
from the very beginning , i faced some difficulties with the language and then later i became more at ease .
the different german accents made learning the language a little bit hard for me .
i went to the language school from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. for six months , which was good for me .
i am now so used to the german language that i could visit any city in germany without an interpreter .
once i visited cologne during the science fair , where there were so many different things i could n't see them all . - vasco s. kemokai compiled by dw staff -lrb- sjr -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he praises president bush 's clarity on establishing a palestinian state , but remains skeptical . peace is supposed to descend on the middle east .
it 's a goal to be achieved by the end of next year .
it 's a commendable goal that would prompt one to congratulate the parties involved .
if it were only that easy .
there have always been good intentions - mainly in the form of initiatives and declarations - in the past when it comes to the middle east , just as there have been dates and deadlines set .
the only problem is that they have expired without the desired result being achieved .
why should it be different this time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp in no way do i want to diminish the efforts made in trying to find a peaceful solution in the middle east .
it is just odd that , without even trying to get to the real core issues in the middle east conflict , peace is now supposed to be possible - more so than in the past .
and that uneasy feeling makes one believe that it 's only wishful thinking , particularly on the part of the us president .
after all , george w. bush wants to crown his presidency with at least one foreign policy success .
but he overlooks the fact that declarations of intention alone do not suffice to achieve that end .
otherwise , we would have had a pacified , free and democratic iraq as a role model for the rest of the arab world a long time ago .
control mechanisms stay on track still , president bush has promised that the united states will act as a kind of control mechanism for the implementation of a peaceful solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict and has said that enough pressure will be placed on both sides to keep them on track toward their own , self-defined goals .
this is a new move , considering that right at the beginning of his presidency , bush declared that the us would not play the mediator role in any middle east negotiations , thereby himself causing the now so regretted , years-long deadlock . that bush speaks so openly about establishing a palestinian state is also good , and right .
he is not the first us president to do so , but while it sounded like a vision for the future when bill clinton said it , with bush , it sounds like a target for the negotiations during the next 12 months .
west bank remains controversial this is definitely progress .
but , the president still does not seem to understand , for example , that not merely a few " illegal settlement posts " have to be dissolved to achieve that goal , but that the israeli settlements in the west bank will have to be completely vacated - one of the greatest impediments to peace .
like no other president before him , bush has stood behind israeli policies in the occupied territories throughout his term of office , so he will now have quite a bit of work to do to convince others that it will be different in the future . despite all the skepticism , a step in the right direction has been taken in annapolis .
but the stretch to the finish line has hardly been shortened as a result .
many steps must still be made to get closer to that goal and , experience with the players in the middle east as well as with this president , could teach us a lesson .
that is : one way or another , things will go wrong .

and that uneasy feeling makes one believe that it 's only wishful thinking , particularly on the part of the us president .
after all , george w. bush wants to crown his presidency with at least one foreign policy success .
but he overlooks the fact that declarations of intention alone do not suffice to achieve that end .
otherwise , we would have had a pacified , free and democratic iraq as a role model for the rest of the arab world a long time ago .
control mechanisms stay on track still , president bush has promised that the united states will act as a kind of control mechanism for the implementation of a peaceful solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict and has said that enough pressure will be placed on both sides to keep them on track toward their own , self-defined goals .
this is a new move , considering that right at the beginning of his presidency , bush declared that the us would not play the mediator role in any middle east negotiations , thereby himself causing the now so regretted , years-long deadlock . that bush speaks so openly about establishing a palestinian state is also good , and right .
he is not the first us president to do so , but while it sounded like a vision for the future when bill clinton said it , with bush , it sounds like a target for the negotiations during the next 12 months .
west bank remains controversial this is definitely progress .
but , the president still does not seem to understand , for example , that not merely a few " illegal settlement posts " have to be dissolved to achieve that goal , but that the israeli settlements in the west bank will have to be completely vacated - one of the greatest impediments to peace .
like no other president before him , bush has stood behind israeli policies in the occupied territories throughout his term of office , so he will now have quite a bit of work to do to convince others that it will be different in the future . despite all the skepticism , a step in the right direction has been taken in annapolis .
but the stretch to the finish line has hardly been shortened as a result .
many steps must still be made to get closer to that goal and , experience with the players in the middle east as well as with this president , could teach us a lesson .
that is : one way or another , things will go wrong .

" in an interview with the newsmagazine stern , angela merkel rebuffed ongoing criticisms of her foreign policy .
opposition politicians have repeatedly critiqued merkel for her frequent trips abroad , as well as her decision to welcome the dalai lama in germany in september - an action which has threatened germany 's economic relationship with china .
the critics have also spoken out against merkel 's clear denunciations of human-rights infractions in china and russia .
foreign policy : a thin , blurred line ?
in her conversation with stern , merkel said it is " provincial to consider making foreign visits in order to lobby for our security , our environment and our well-being , less important " than domestic politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some argue that merkel 's focus on foreign policy is displaced " today there is no longer such a clear line between domestic and foreign policy , " merkel added .
merkel also said she would " continue to choose state visitors and foreign trips as i see fit and useful , when it comes to serving germany 's interests . "
" it is wrong and superfluous to play political values and economic success against each other , as if only one or the other is important , " merkel told stern .
" they belong together . "
criticism from steinmeier merkel said she thought her approach had made germany a more " respected partner in the world , even more so in the past two years . "

any artist , whose work has been shown at moma - the museum of modern art , in new york , can surely say they have " made it . "
gert and uwe tobias can now lay claim to that fame .
from wednesday , nov .
28 through feb .
25 , moma is showing 20 works by the 34-year-old twins from cologne , germany .
the show comprises drawings of typewriters and fantastic gouaches , as well as enormous , brightly colored woodcuts .
the tobias brothers were born in romania and came to germany in 1985 .
they studied art together in the northern german town of braunschweig .
today , they share a studio in cologne .
an affinity for german art bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brothers have been praised for their use of color " it is a great honor for us to be offered an exhibit at moma , " gert tobias said on the eve of the opening in new york .
but the twins are not the first german artists to get a show at moma .
in 2001 , düsseldorf photographer andreas gursky was given a show in the famed museum , and a year later , it was painter gerhard richter 's turn .
" moma has shown a great affinity for german art , " said stefan gronert , the curator of the kunst museum bonn , who has been following the twins ' career since 2004 .
but gert and uwe tobias do n't see their work in the category of " german art " - or romanian art , for that matter .
" we are just artists , who make our own art , " gert tobias said .
nonetheless , it would be fairly easy for the brothers to ride the tide of popularity in german art if they wanted to , gronert said .
" right now , german art is very popular in other countries .
especially in the usa , " he said .

today , leipzig is home to a lively artists ' quarter , where 11 galleries have opened up in a building that was once europe 's largest cotton factory .
and more than just paintings are being made .
numerous young artists of all stripes have jumped on the leipzig art scene bandwagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter has been very popular in the us the popularity of german art is closely linked to the growing interest in art world-wide .
the art market is hungrier than ever .
gronert claims that german art , like other german products , is known for its quality .
" the best explanation is that quality simply wins out , " he said .
this appears to be the case when it comes to the tobias brothers .
the pair has been called " revivers of the woodcut . "
moma has praised their " amazing color sensibility " and their " astounding graphical compositions . "
career boost is likely the moma exhibit will no doubt boost the careers of the tobias brothers , who appear to be taking it in stride .
" after new york , we need a few days to just process it all , " gert tobias said .
" we are n't sure what comes after that . "
gronert said he imagines a number of major museums will want to mount shows of the tobias brothers ' woodcuts - including his own .

but while they may be the hottest new german art export , they are n't the only ones . moma – four magic letters that open the door to art-world success .
any artist , whose work has been shown at moma - the museum of modern art , in new york , can surely say they have " made it . "
gert and uwe tobias can now lay claim to that fame .
from wednesday , nov .
28 through feb .
25 , moma is showing 20 works by the 34-year-old twins from cologne , germany .
the show comprises drawings of typewriters and fantastic gouaches , as well as enormous , brightly colored woodcuts .
the tobias brothers were born in romania and came to germany in 1985 .
they studied art together in the northern german town of braunschweig .
today , they share a studio in cologne .
an affinity for german art bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brothers have been praised for their use of color " it is a great honor for us to be offered an exhibit at moma , " gert tobias said on the eve of the opening in new york .
but the twins are not the first german artists to get a show at moma .
in 2001 , düsseldorf photographer andreas gursky was given a show in the famed museum , and a year later , it was painter gerhard richter 's turn .
" moma has shown a great affinity for german art , " said stefan gronert , the curator of the kunst museum bonn , who has been following the twins ' career since 2004 .
but gert and uwe tobias do n't see their work in the category of " german art " - or romanian art , for that matter .
" we are just artists , who make our own art , " gert tobias said .
nonetheless , it would be fairly easy for the brothers to ride the tide of popularity in german art if they wanted to , gronert said .
" right now , german art is very popular in other countries .
especially in the usa , " he said .
popularity of the leipzig school he pointed out that germany is home to the leipzig school , whose modern , graphic painting style has excited interest in us collectors for years now .
today , leipzig is home to a lively artists ' quarter , where 11 galleries have opened up in a building that was once europe 's largest cotton factory .
and more than just paintings are being made .
numerous young artists of all stripes have jumped on the leipzig art scene bandwagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter has been very popular in the us the popularity of german art is closely linked to the growing interest in art world-wide .
the art market is hungrier than ever .
gronert claims that german art , like other german products , is known for its quality .
" the best explanation is that quality simply wins out , " he said .
this appears to be the case when it comes to the tobias brothers .
the pair has been called " revivers of the woodcut . "
moma has praised their " amazing color sensibility " and their " astounding graphical compositions . "
career boost is likely the moma exhibit will no doubt boost the careers of the tobias brothers , who appear to be taking it in stride .
" after new york , we need a few days to just process it all , " gert tobias said .
" we are n't sure what comes after that . "
gronert said he imagines a number of major museums will want to mount shows of the tobias brothers ' woodcuts - including his own .

here 's where other dw-world.de readers said are their favorite places to visit . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . we traveled to görlitz in may 2007 and found it charming , unspoiled , and beautiful .
we enjoyed a walking tour -lrb- only in german -rrb- , enjoyed the many old buildings and churches and walked across the bridge to have lunch on the polish side of the river .
while it 's not exactly on most tourist routes , it 's definitely worth the visit . - chris , us when you 're tired of sausages and all things german go to osteria no. 1 - it saved our lives in berlin !
we had a lovely , intimate , platter of mixed pasta at a very good budget in the way that only italians are good at . - c. sammut , malta while i appreciated very much your links on the dw-world.de site for options to consider when visiting various towns and cities in germany , i simply chose a different course for my stay .
first , i used the hotel reservation links given to me by my cousin from seeheim to make all of my hotel reservations via the internet and they all proved to be , well , just perfect .
we started in offenbach , then took a train trip to hildesheim and from there on to bocholt and lastly to freiburg im bresigau .
secondly , i ate locally from the metzgerei -lrb- butchers -rrb- to the konditerei -lrb- cake shop -rrb- and the open air markets , and as is the german custom , promptly took my afternoon kaffeepause -lrb- coffee break -rrb- everyday .
evenings usually found me sitting with the locals in the famous neighborhood bierstube , listening to the local radio stations still playing music from the 1950s and 1960s ... some things never seem to change .
tourists ?
i never really met any that i could tell , except during my last few days in freiburg .
next year i hope to go to germany for a two-month stay at a goethe institute german-language program . - philip ohmes , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reader enjoyed taking a german coffee break i 'd like to share my experience with you during my stay in the federal republic of germany from 1985-1988 .
first and foremost was the warm welcome and good treatment that i received from the german people in general .
from the first time that i met germans i had a warm reception and i was loved by the nationals everywhere i went . the next experience i had was learning the language .
from the very beginning , i faced some difficulties with the language and then later i became more at ease .
the different german accents made learning the language a little bit hard for me .
i went to the language school from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. for six months , which was good for me .
i am now so used to the german language that i could visit any city in germany without an interpreter .
once i visited cologne during the science fair , where there were so many different things i could n't see them all . - vasco s. kemokai compiled by dw staff -lrb- sjr -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

here 's where other dw-world.de readers said are their favorite places to visit . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . we traveled to görlitz in may 2007 and found it charming , unspoiled , and beautiful .
we enjoyed a walking tour -lrb- only in german -rrb- , enjoyed the many old buildings and churches and walked across the bridge to have lunch on the polish side of the river .
while it 's not exactly on most tourist routes , it 's definitely worth the visit . - chris , us when you 're tired of sausages and all things german go to osteria no. 1 - it saved our lives in berlin !
we had a lovely , intimate , platter of mixed pasta at a very good budget in the way that only italians are good at . - c. sammut , malta while i appreciated very much your links on the dw-world.de site for options to consider when visiting various towns and cities in germany , i simply chose a different course for my stay .
first , i used the hotel reservation links given to me by my cousin from seeheim to make all of my hotel reservations via the internet and they all proved to be , well , just perfect .
we started in offenbach , then took a train trip to hildesheim and from there on to bocholt and lastly to freiburg im bresigau .
secondly , i ate locally from the metzgerei -lrb- butchers -rrb- to the konditerei -lrb- cake shop -rrb- and the open air markets , and as is the german custom , promptly took my afternoon kaffeepause -lrb- coffee break -rrb- everyday .
evenings usually found me sitting with the locals in the famous neighborhood bierstube , listening to the local radio stations still playing music from the 1950s and 1960s ... some things never seem to change .
tourists ?
i never really met any that i could tell , except during my last few days in freiburg .
next year i hope to go to germany for a two-month stay at a goethe institute german-language program . - philip ohmes , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reader enjoyed taking a german coffee break i 'd like to share my experience with you during my stay in the federal republic of germany from 1985-1988 .
first and foremost was the warm welcome and good treatment that i received from the german people in general .
from the first time that i met germans i had a warm reception and i was loved by the nationals everywhere i went . the next experience i had was learning the language .
from the very beginning , i faced some difficulties with the language and then later i became more at ease .
the different german accents made learning the language a little bit hard for me .
i went to the language school from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. for six months , which was good for me .
i am now so used to the german language that i could visit any city in germany without an interpreter .
once i visited cologne during the science fair , where there were so many different things i could n't see them all . - vasco s. kemokai compiled by dw staff -lrb- sjr -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he praises president bush 's clarity on establishing a palestinian state , but remains skeptical . peace is supposed to descend on the middle east .
it 's a goal to be achieved by the end of next year .
it 's a commendable goal that would prompt one to congratulate the parties involved .
if it were only that easy .
there have always been good intentions - mainly in the form of initiatives and declarations - in the past when it comes to the middle east , just as there have been dates and deadlines set .
the only problem is that they have expired without the desired result being achieved .
why should it be different this time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp in no way do i want to diminish the efforts made in trying to find a peaceful solution in the middle east .
it is just odd that , without even trying to get to the real core issues in the middle east conflict , peace is now supposed to be possible - more so than in the past .
and that uneasy feeling makes one believe that it 's only wishful thinking , particularly on the part of the us president .
after all , george w. bush wants to crown his presidency with at least one foreign policy success .
but he overlooks the fact that declarations of intention alone do not suffice to achieve that end .
otherwise , we would have had a pacified , free and democratic iraq as a role model for the rest of the arab world a long time ago .
control mechanisms stay on track still , president bush has promised that the united states will act as a kind of control mechanism for the implementation of a peaceful solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict and has said that enough pressure will be placed on both sides to keep them on track toward their own , self-defined goals .
this is a new move , considering that right at the beginning of his presidency , bush declared that the us would not play the mediator role in any middle east negotiations , thereby himself causing the now so regretted , years-long deadlock . that bush speaks so openly about establishing a palestinian state is also good , and right .
he is not the first us president to do so , but while it sounded like a vision for the future when bill clinton said it , with bush , it sounds like a target for the negotiations during the next 12 months .
west bank remains controversial this is definitely progress .
but , the president still does not seem to understand , for example , that not merely a few " illegal settlement posts " have to be dissolved to achieve that goal , but that the israeli settlements in the west bank will have to be completely vacated - one of the greatest impediments to peace .
like no other president before him , bush has stood behind israeli policies in the occupied territories throughout his term of office , so he will now have quite a bit of work to do to convince others that it will be different in the future . despite all the skepticism , a step in the right direction has been taken in annapolis .
but the stretch to the finish line has hardly been shortened as a result .
many steps must still be made to get closer to that goal and , experience with the players in the middle east as well as with this president , could teach us a lesson .
that is : one way or another , things will go wrong .

he praises president bush 's clarity on establishing a palestinian state , but remains skeptical . peace is supposed to descend on the middle east .
it 's a goal to be achieved by the end of next year .
it 's a commendable goal that would prompt one to congratulate the parties involved .
if it were only that easy .
there have always been good intentions - mainly in the form of initiatives and declarations - in the past when it comes to the middle east , just as there have been dates and deadlines set .
the only problem is that they have expired without the desired result being achieved .
why should it be different this time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp in no way do i want to diminish the efforts made in trying to find a peaceful solution in the middle east .
it is just odd that , without even trying to get to the real core issues in the middle east conflict , peace is now supposed to be possible - more so than in the past .
and that uneasy feeling makes one believe that it 's only wishful thinking , particularly on the part of the us president .
after all , george w. bush wants to crown his presidency with at least one foreign policy success .
but he overlooks the fact that declarations of intention alone do not suffice to achieve that end .
otherwise , we would have had a pacified , free and democratic iraq as a role model for the rest of the arab world a long time ago .
control mechanisms stay on track still , president bush has promised that the united states will act as a kind of control mechanism for the implementation of a peaceful solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict and has said that enough pressure will be placed on both sides to keep them on track toward their own , self-defined goals .
this is a new move , considering that right at the beginning of his presidency , bush declared that the us would not play the mediator role in any middle east negotiations , thereby himself causing the now so regretted , years-long deadlock . that bush speaks so openly about establishing a palestinian state is also good , and right .
he is not the first us president to do so , but while it sounded like a vision for the future when bill clinton said it , with bush , it sounds like a target for the negotiations during the next 12 months .
west bank remains controversial this is definitely progress .
but , the president still does not seem to understand , for example , that not merely a few " illegal settlement posts " have to be dissolved to achieve that goal , but that the israeli settlements in the west bank will have to be completely vacated - one of the greatest impediments to peace .
like no other president before him , bush has stood behind israeli policies in the occupied territories throughout his term of office , so he will now have quite a bit of work to do to convince others that it will be different in the future . despite all the skepticism , a step in the right direction has been taken in annapolis .
but the stretch to the finish line has hardly been shortened as a result .
many steps must still be made to get closer to that goal and , experience with the players in the middle east as well as with this president , could teach us a lesson .
that is : one way or another , things will go wrong .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 28.11.2007 german primary schools rank among world 's best großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : none of the european union 's other fourth graders did significantly better than germany 's the reading level of fourth graders in germany has improved , putting the country in 11th place , according to an education survey conducted in 35 countries and 10 regions .
russia finished on top of the ranking . the german primary school system develops a high reading level in most children , according to a 2006 iglu survey of primary school reading skills , which was published in berlin on wednesday , nov .
28 . germany 's education minister annette schavan said the results showed that the country 's primary schools were " playing at the top international level . "
a total of 397 german schools and 7,900 students took part in the study . " german primary schools have done their homework , " said wilfried bos , the study 's director for germany .
" we have again clearly and substantially improved . " smaller gender differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls scored higher than boys in all the participating countries italy -lrb- 8th -rrb- , hungary -lrb- 9th -rrb- and sweden -lrb- 10th -rrb- , which finished first in the last iglu survey in 2001 , came in ahead of germany in reading skills , but not by statistically significant margins , according to the survey .
germany placed above the eu and oecd averages . russia , which excluded more students than any other participating country from the test , placed first , ahead of hong kong and canada .
bos said germany could have improved its position had it kept more than 0.7 percent of fourth graders from taking part . the number of students in germany with very low reading skills dropped while the number of strong readers increases in the five years between the two iglu studies .
differences in reading skills between girls and boys were smallest in germany with a smaller percentage of boys in the lowest reading groups compared to other participating countries . social class makes big difference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids with immigrant backgrounds are at a disadvantage in german schools the survey also pointed out areas german schools were failing their pupils . in comparison with other countries , the study showed a clearer link between social class and reading performance - even the earliest grades - among children in germany .
poor students and children of immigrants in germany also generally performed worse than their classmates more often than similar students in other countries . " primary schools have not succeeded in sufficiently compensating for social inequality , " the study said . the finding reflect stark criticism made by a special envoy from the united nations in march that germany 's three-tiered school system was discriminatory for shutting out children from immigrant and poorer backgrounds . while most other european countries have created more inclusive school systems , germany has , for the most part , stuck to a three-tier structure that places children into educational tracks before the age of 12 . more results coming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next set of test results is due next week the iglu study said german students from upper-class families were often put in the highest track despite only adequate grades while higher skills were demanded of children with poorer or immigrant backgrounds to receive the same recommendation . education in germany has been subject to censure after a string of studies results showed the country 's schools to be trailing internationally .
in a 2001 pisa study , germany ranked only 21st in reading skills and 20th in math and science among 31 countries assessed . schavan said wednesday 's ranking showed reform measures put in place after 2001 had been successful . results from the next pisa study , which tested natural science skills , are scheduled to be presented tuesday .
according to spanish teacher newspaper magisnet , german students rank 13th among 57 states in that study - an improvement of five ranks when compared to the 2003 survey .
the results can not be compared , however , as the tests have changed significantly . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de experts push for overhaul of german school system germany 's ailing schools came under renewed fire at an international teachers ' congress in berlin with critics urging a radical shake-up of the three-tiered system which some say is discriminatory and undemocratic .
-lrb- 26.07.2007 -rrb- school in the afternoon is new to germany , but catching on while parents in many countries of the world are used to dropping kids off at school in the morning and not seeing them until dinnertime , all-day schooling is just beginning to make in-roads in germany .

germany placed above the eu and oecd averages . russia , which excluded more students than any other participating country from the test , placed first , ahead of hong kong and canada .
bos said germany could have improved its position had it kept more than 0.7 percent of fourth graders from taking part . the number of students in germany with very low reading skills dropped while the number of strong readers increases in the five years between the two iglu studies .
differences in reading skills between girls and boys were smallest in germany with a smaller percentage of boys in the lowest reading groups compared to other participating countries . social class makes big difference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids with immigrant backgrounds are at a disadvantage in german schools the survey also pointed out areas german schools were failing their pupils . in comparison with other countries , the study showed a clearer link between social class and reading performance - even the earliest grades - among children in germany .

in a 2001 pisa study , germany ranked only 21st in reading skills and 20th in math and science among 31 countries assessed . schavan said wednesday 's ranking showed reform measures put in place after 2001 had been successful . results from the next pisa study , which tested natural science skills , are scheduled to be presented tuesday .

russia finished on top of the ranking . the german primary school system develops a high reading level in most children , according to a 2006 iglu survey of primary school reading skills , which was published in berlin on wednesday , nov .
28 . germany 's education minister annette schavan said the results showed that the country 's primary schools were " playing at the top international level . "
a total of 397 german schools and 7,900 students took part in the study . " german primary schools have done their homework , " said wilfried bos , the study 's director for germany .

germany placed above the eu and oecd averages . russia , which excluded more students than any other participating country from the test , placed first , ahead of hong kong and canada .
bos said germany could have improved its position had it kept more than 0.7 percent of fourth graders from taking part . the number of students in germany with very low reading skills dropped while the number of strong readers increases in the five years between the two iglu studies .

" in an interview with the newsmagazine stern , angela merkel rebuffed ongoing criticisms of her foreign policy .
opposition politicians have repeatedly critiqued merkel for her frequent trips abroad , as well as her decision to welcome the dalai lama in germany in september - an action which has threatened germany 's economic relationship with china .
the critics have also spoken out against merkel 's clear denunciations of human-rights infractions in china and russia .
foreign policy : a thin , blurred line ?
in her conversation with stern , merkel said it is " provincial to consider making foreign visits in order to lobby for our security , our environment and our well-being , less important " than domestic politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some argue that merkel 's focus on foreign policy is displaced " today there is no longer such a clear line between domestic and foreign policy , " merkel added .
merkel also said she would " continue to choose state visitors and foreign trips as i see fit and useful , when it comes to serving germany 's interests . "
" it is wrong and superfluous to play political values and economic success against each other , as if only one or the other is important , " merkel told stern .
" they belong together . "
criticism from steinmeier merkel said she thought her approach had made germany a more " respected partner in the world , even more so in the past two years . "

foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , also a social democrat , recently spoke out against merkel 's decisions on china policy .
during a visit to paris earlier in november , he told journalists he was " worried " about the escalating diplomatic tension between germany and china in the wake of the dalai lama 's visit .
" we have had better relations with china , that is unfortunately true , " steinmeier said .
" it is a development that we can not let remain as is . "
merkel : support on iran is key he added that it was in germany 's interest to reestablish good relations with china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some worry that merkel is risking economic ties with china since then , the issue has given rise to several political flare-ups .
but the chancellor defended her relationship with steinmeier , telling stern the two of them " work well together , in general . "
" if you look at other governments , we can be very content , " she said .
in her interview , merkel also pleaded with the international community to support germany in its attempt to find a diplomatic solution to the iran crisis . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

any artist , whose work has been shown at moma - the museum of modern art , in new york , can surely say they have " made it . "
gert and uwe tobias can now lay claim to that fame .
from wednesday , nov .
28 through feb .
25 , moma is showing 20 works by the 34-year-old twins from cologne , germany .
the show comprises drawings of typewriters and fantastic gouaches , as well as enormous , brightly colored woodcuts .
the tobias brothers were born in romania and came to germany in 1985 .
they studied art together in the northern german town of braunschweig .
today , they share a studio in cologne .
an affinity for german art bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brothers have been praised for their use of color " it is a great honor for us to be offered an exhibit at moma , " gert tobias said on the eve of the opening in new york .
but the twins are not the first german artists to get a show at moma .
in 2001 , düsseldorf photographer andreas gursky was given a show in the famed museum , and a year later , it was painter gerhard richter 's turn .
" moma has shown a great affinity for german art , " said stefan gronert , the curator of the kunst museum bonn , who has been following the twins ' career since 2004 .
but gert and uwe tobias do n't see their work in the category of " german art " - or romanian art , for that matter .
" we are just artists , who make our own art , " gert tobias said .
nonetheless , it would be fairly easy for the brothers to ride the tide of popularity in german art if they wanted to , gronert said .
" right now , german art is very popular in other countries .
especially in the usa , " he said .
popularity of the leipzig school he pointed out that germany is home to the leipzig school , whose modern , graphic painting style has excited interest in us collectors for years now .
today , leipzig is home to a lively artists ' quarter , where 11 galleries have opened up in a building that was once europe 's largest cotton factory .
and more than just paintings are being made .
numerous young artists of all stripes have jumped on the leipzig art scene bandwagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter has been very popular in the us the popularity of german art is closely linked to the growing interest in art world-wide .
the art market is hungrier than ever .
gronert claims that german art , like other german products , is known for its quality .
" the best explanation is that quality simply wins out , " he said .
this appears to be the case when it comes to the tobias brothers .
the pair has been called " revivers of the woodcut . "
moma has praised their " amazing color sensibility " and their " astounding graphical compositions . "
career boost is likely the moma exhibit will no doubt boost the careers of the tobias brothers , who appear to be taking it in stride .
" after new york , we need a few days to just process it all , " gert tobias said .
" we are n't sure what comes after that . "
gronert said he imagines a number of major museums will want to mount shows of the tobias brothers ' woodcuts - including his own .

but while they may be the hottest new german art export , they are n't the only ones . moma – four magic letters that open the door to art-world success .
any artist , whose work has been shown at moma - the museum of modern art , in new york , can surely say they have " made it . "
gert and uwe tobias can now lay claim to that fame .
from wednesday , nov .
28 through feb .
25 , moma is showing 20 works by the 34-year-old twins from cologne , germany .
the show comprises drawings of typewriters and fantastic gouaches , as well as enormous , brightly colored woodcuts .
the tobias brothers were born in romania and came to germany in 1985 .
they studied art together in the northern german town of braunschweig .
today , they share a studio in cologne .
an affinity for german art bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brothers have been praised for their use of color " it is a great honor for us to be offered an exhibit at moma , " gert tobias said on the eve of the opening in new york .
but the twins are not the first german artists to get a show at moma .
in 2001 , düsseldorf photographer andreas gursky was given a show in the famed museum , and a year later , it was painter gerhard richter 's turn .
" moma has shown a great affinity for german art , " said stefan gronert , the curator of the kunst museum bonn , who has been following the twins ' career since 2004 .
but gert and uwe tobias do n't see their work in the category of " german art " - or romanian art , for that matter .
" we are just artists , who make our own art , " gert tobias said .
nonetheless , it would be fairly easy for the brothers to ride the tide of popularity in german art if they wanted to , gronert said .
" right now , german art is very popular in other countries .
especially in the usa , " he said .
popularity of the leipzig school he pointed out that germany is home to the leipzig school , whose modern , graphic painting style has excited interest in us collectors for years now .
today , leipzig is home to a lively artists ' quarter , where 11 galleries have opened up in a building that was once europe 's largest cotton factory .
and more than just paintings are being made .
numerous young artists of all stripes have jumped on the leipzig art scene bandwagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter has been very popular in the us the popularity of german art is closely linked to the growing interest in art world-wide .
the art market is hungrier than ever .
gronert claims that german art , like other german products , is known for its quality .
" the best explanation is that quality simply wins out , " he said .
this appears to be the case when it comes to the tobias brothers .
the pair has been called " revivers of the woodcut . "
moma has praised their " amazing color sensibility " and their " astounding graphical compositions . "
career boost is likely the moma exhibit will no doubt boost the careers of the tobias brothers , who appear to be taking it in stride .
" after new york , we need a few days to just process it all , " gert tobias said .
" we are n't sure what comes after that . "
gronert said he imagines a number of major museums will want to mount shows of the tobias brothers ' woodcuts - including his own .
in march , an exhibit of gert and uwe tobias woodcuts will be opening at the kunst museum bonn . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in an interview with the newsmagazine stern , angela merkel rebuffed ongoing criticisms of her foreign policy .
opposition politicians have repeatedly critiqued merkel for her frequent trips abroad , as well as her decision to welcome the dalai lama in germany in september - an action which has threatened germany 's economic relationship with china .
the critics have also spoken out against merkel 's clear denunciations of human-rights infractions in china and russia .
foreign policy : a thin , blurred line ?
in her conversation with stern , merkel said it is " provincial to consider making foreign visits in order to lobby for our security , our environment and our well-being , less important " than domestic politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some argue that merkel 's focus on foreign policy is displaced " today there is no longer such a clear line between domestic and foreign policy , " merkel added .
merkel also said she would " continue to choose state visitors and foreign trips as i see fit and useful , when it comes to serving germany 's interests . "
" it is wrong and superfluous to play political values and economic success against each other , as if only one or the other is important , " merkel told stern .
" they belong together . "
criticism from steinmeier merkel said she thought her approach had made germany a more " respected partner in the world , even more so in the past two years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- right -rrb- , like his ex-boss schröder -lrb- left -rrb- has critiqued merkel 's policies the comment was seen as a clear jab at her social democratic predecessor gerhard schröder , whose government pursued a foreign policy that placated to china on human rights in favor of pursuing economic ties .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , also a social democrat , recently spoke out against merkel 's decisions on china policy .
during a visit to paris earlier in november , he told journalists he was " worried " about the escalating diplomatic tension between germany and china in the wake of the dalai lama 's visit .
" we have had better relations with china , that is unfortunately true , " steinmeier said .
" it is a development that we can not let remain as is . "
merkel : support on iran is key he added that it was in germany 's interest to reestablish good relations with china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some worry that merkel is risking economic ties with china since then , the issue has given rise to several political flare-ups .
but the chancellor defended her relationship with steinmeier , telling stern the two of them " work well together , in general . "
" if you look at other governments , we can be very content , " she said .
in her interview , merkel also pleaded with the international community to support germany in its attempt to find a diplomatic solution to the iran crisis . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but while they may be the hottest new german art export , they are n't the only ones . moma – four magic letters that open the door to art-world success .
any artist , whose work has been shown at moma - the museum of modern art , in new york , can surely say they have " made it . "
gert and uwe tobias can now lay claim to that fame .
from wednesday , nov .
28 through feb .
25 , moma is showing 20 works by the 34-year-old twins from cologne , germany .
the show comprises drawings of typewriters and fantastic gouaches , as well as enormous , brightly colored woodcuts .
the tobias brothers were born in romania and came to germany in 1985 .
they studied art together in the northern german town of braunschweig .
today , they share a studio in cologne .
an affinity for german art bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brothers have been praised for their use of color " it is a great honor for us to be offered an exhibit at moma , " gert tobias said on the eve of the opening in new york .
but the twins are not the first german artists to get a show at moma .
in 2001 , düsseldorf photographer andreas gursky was given a show in the famed museum , and a year later , it was painter gerhard richter 's turn .
" moma has shown a great affinity for german art , " said stefan gronert , the curator of the kunst museum bonn , who has been following the twins ' career since 2004 .
but gert and uwe tobias do n't see their work in the category of " german art " - or romanian art , for that matter .
" we are just artists , who make our own art , " gert tobias said .
nonetheless , it would be fairly easy for the brothers to ride the tide of popularity in german art if they wanted to , gronert said .
" right now , german art is very popular in other countries .
especially in the usa , " he said .
popularity of the leipzig school he pointed out that germany is home to the leipzig school , whose modern , graphic painting style has excited interest in us collectors for years now .
today , leipzig is home to a lively artists ' quarter , where 11 galleries have opened up in a building that was once europe 's largest cotton factory .
and more than just paintings are being made .
numerous young artists of all stripes have jumped on the leipzig art scene bandwagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter has been very popular in the us the popularity of german art is closely linked to the growing interest in art world-wide .
the art market is hungrier than ever .
gronert claims that german art , like other german products , is known for its quality .
" the best explanation is that quality simply wins out , " he said .
this appears to be the case when it comes to the tobias brothers .
the pair has been called " revivers of the woodcut . "
moma has praised their " amazing color sensibility " and their " astounding graphical compositions . "
career boost is likely the moma exhibit will no doubt boost the careers of the tobias brothers , who appear to be taking it in stride .
" after new york , we need a few days to just process it all , " gert tobias said .
" we are n't sure what comes after that . "
gronert said he imagines a number of major museums will want to mount shows of the tobias brothers ' woodcuts - including his own .
in march , an exhibit of gert and uwe tobias woodcuts will be opening at the kunst museum bonn . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a last round of negotiations between serbia and kosovo by a un-sponsored troika of envoys regarding the future status of kosovo failed to reach an agreement . " the baden conference marks the end of face-to-face talks " between serbia and kosovo , wolfgang ischinger , the eu 's representative in the kosovo troika , said at a press conference in vienna on wednesday , nov .
28 .
" regrettably the parties were unable to reach agreement . " the us envoy to the talks , frank wisner , called on belgrade and pristina to uphold promises not to engage in violence , adding that peace in the balkans was " very much at stake . " the mediators , who said they probed every solution that was " humanly possible , " are scheduled to make final visits to serbia and kosovo next monday before submitting a report to the united nations , due by dec .

10 the failed talks set the stage for the province 's independence , as kosovo 's leaders , who enjoy the support of washington , said they wanted independence " very soon . "
the call for independence was one of the few issues that united ethnic albanians in kosovo during parliamentary elections earlier this month . " we regret that serbia did not find it possible to agree to the independent final state of kosovo , " the province 's likely new prime minister , hashim thaci , said at the conclusion of the three days of talks . belgrade 's leaders , however , have offered only a degree of autonomy to the province and repeatedly vowed not to accept kosovo 's secession from serbia . " we are going to cancel all these decisions by kosovo authorities leading to independence and use all legal instruments , " serbian president boris tadic warned .
" this is a very serious situation . " balkan domino effect feared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato troops have been stationed in kosovo for eight years some observers have said a unilateral declaration of independence on the part of kosovo could encourage the serb-populated northern part of the province to secede , and possibly even lead to similar moves by serbs in bosnia and albanians in macedonia , which could then cause unrest . pristina made it clear that it had never intended to budge from achieving full independence " we have not sought belgrade 's consent but partnership with serbia , " kosovo delegation member veton surroi told reporters . the serbian province , 90 percent of whose population is ethnic albanian , has been under un administration and nato protection since the military alliance ended violence there in 1999 . security council impasse expected serbia insisted talks had to be continued even after the dec .
10 deadline set by un secretary general ban ki-moon .
a stalemate in the security council is likely as russia is expected to block any decision that does not meet with belgrade 's approval . " we have to wait for a security council decision , " prime minister vojislav kostunica said .
unilateral action on the part of pristina would trigger similar responses , serbia 's leaders warned . kosovo 's president fatmir sejdiu made it clear after the meeting that pristina would not consent to new talks .

but while they may be the hottest new german art export , they are n't the only ones . moma – four magic letters that open the door to art-world success .
any artist , whose work has been shown at moma - the museum of modern art , in new york , can surely say they have " made it . "
gert and uwe tobias can now lay claim to that fame .
from wednesday , nov .
28 through feb .
25 , moma is showing 20 works by the 34-year-old twins from cologne , germany .
the show comprises drawings of typewriters and fantastic gouaches , as well as enormous , brightly colored woodcuts .
the tobias brothers were born in romania and came to germany in 1985 .
they studied art together in the northern german town of braunschweig .
today , they share a studio in cologne .
an affinity for german art bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brothers have been praised for their use of color " it is a great honor for us to be offered an exhibit at moma , " gert tobias said on the eve of the opening in new york .
but the twins are not the first german artists to get a show at moma .
in 2001 , düsseldorf photographer andreas gursky was given a show in the famed museum , and a year later , it was painter gerhard richter 's turn .
" moma has shown a great affinity for german art , " said stefan gronert , the curator of the kunst museum bonn , who has been following the twins ' career since 2004 .
but gert and uwe tobias do n't see their work in the category of " german art " - or romanian art , for that matter .
" we are just artists , who make our own art , " gert tobias said .
nonetheless , it would be fairly easy for the brothers to ride the tide of popularity in german art if they wanted to , gronert said .
" right now , german art is very popular in other countries .
especially in the usa , " he said .
popularity of the leipzig school he pointed out that germany is home to the leipzig school , whose modern , graphic painting style has excited interest in us collectors for years now .
today , leipzig is home to a lively artists ' quarter , where 11 galleries have opened up in a building that was once europe 's largest cotton factory .
and more than just paintings are being made .
numerous young artists of all stripes have jumped on the leipzig art scene bandwagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter has been very popular in the us the popularity of german art is closely linked to the growing interest in art world-wide .
the art market is hungrier than ever .
gronert claims that german art , like other german products , is known for its quality .
" the best explanation is that quality simply wins out , " he said .
this appears to be the case when it comes to the tobias brothers .
the pair has been called " revivers of the woodcut . "
moma has praised their " amazing color sensibility " and their " astounding graphical compositions . "
career boost is likely the moma exhibit will no doubt boost the careers of the tobias brothers , who appear to be taking it in stride .
" after new york , we need a few days to just process it all , " gert tobias said .
" we are n't sure what comes after that . "
gronert said he imagines a number of major museums will want to mount shows of the tobias brothers ' woodcuts - including his own .

but while they may be the hottest new german art export , they are n't the only ones . moma – four magic letters that open the door to art-world success .
any artist , whose work has been shown at moma - the museum of modern art , in new york , can surely say they have " made it . "
gert and uwe tobias can now lay claim to that fame .
from wednesday , nov .
28 through feb .
25 , moma is showing 20 works by the 34-year-old twins from cologne , germany .
the show comprises drawings of typewriters and fantastic gouaches , as well as enormous , brightly colored woodcuts .
the tobias brothers were born in romania and came to germany in 1985 .
they studied art together in the northern german town of braunschweig .
today , they share a studio in cologne .
an affinity for german art bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brothers have been praised for their use of color " it is a great honor for us to be offered an exhibit at moma , " gert tobias said on the eve of the opening in new york .
but the twins are not the first german artists to get a show at moma .
in 2001 , düsseldorf photographer andreas gursky was given a show in the famed museum , and a year later , it was painter gerhard richter 's turn .
" moma has shown a great affinity for german art , " said stefan gronert , the curator of the kunst museum bonn , who has been following the twins ' career since 2004 .
but gert and uwe tobias do n't see their work in the category of " german art " - or romanian art , for that matter .
" we are just artists , who make our own art , " gert tobias said .
nonetheless , it would be fairly easy for the brothers to ride the tide of popularity in german art if they wanted to , gronert said .
" right now , german art is very popular in other countries .
especially in the usa , " he said .
popularity of the leipzig school he pointed out that germany is home to the leipzig school , whose modern , graphic painting style has excited interest in us collectors for years now .
today , leipzig is home to a lively artists ' quarter , where 11 galleries have opened up in a building that was once europe 's largest cotton factory .
and more than just paintings are being made .
numerous young artists of all stripes have jumped on the leipzig art scene bandwagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter has been very popular in the us the popularity of german art is closely linked to the growing interest in art world-wide .
the art market is hungrier than ever .
gronert claims that german art , like other german products , is known for its quality .
" the best explanation is that quality simply wins out , " he said .
this appears to be the case when it comes to the tobias brothers .
the pair has been called " revivers of the woodcut . "
moma has praised their " amazing color sensibility " and their " astounding graphical compositions . "
career boost is likely the moma exhibit will no doubt boost the careers of the tobias brothers , who appear to be taking it in stride .
" after new york , we need a few days to just process it all , " gert tobias said .
" we are n't sure what comes after that . "
gronert said he imagines a number of major museums will want to mount shows of the tobias brothers ' woodcuts - including his own .
in march , an exhibit of gert and uwe tobias woodcuts will be opening at the kunst museum bonn . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in an interview with the newsmagazine stern , angela merkel rebuffed ongoing criticisms of her foreign policy .
opposition politicians have repeatedly critiqued merkel for her frequent trips abroad , as well as her decision to welcome the dalai lama in germany in september - an action which has threatened germany 's economic relationship with china .
the critics have also spoken out against merkel 's clear denunciations of human-rights infractions in china and russia .
foreign policy : a thin , blurred line ?
in her conversation with stern , merkel said it is " provincial to consider making foreign visits in order to lobby for our security , our environment and our well-being , less important " than domestic politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some argue that merkel 's focus on foreign policy is displaced " today there is no longer such a clear line between domestic and foreign policy , " merkel added .
merkel also said she would " continue to choose state visitors and foreign trips as i see fit and useful , when it comes to serving germany 's interests . "
" it is wrong and superfluous to play political values and economic success against each other , as if only one or the other is important , " merkel told stern .
" they belong together . "
criticism from steinmeier merkel said she thought her approach had made germany a more " respected partner in the world , even more so in the past two years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- right -rrb- , like his ex-boss schröder -lrb- left -rrb- has critiqued merkel 's policies the comment was seen as a clear jab at her social democratic predecessor gerhard schröder , whose government pursued a foreign policy that placated to china on human rights in favor of pursuing economic ties .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , also a social democrat , recently spoke out against merkel 's decisions on china policy .
during a visit to paris earlier in november , he told journalists he was " worried " about the escalating diplomatic tension between germany and china in the wake of the dalai lama 's visit .
" we have had better relations with china , that is unfortunately true , " steinmeier said .
" it is a development that we can not let remain as is . "

but while they may be the hottest new german art export , they are n't the only ones . moma – four magic letters that open the door to art-world success .
any artist , whose work has been shown at moma - the museum of modern art , in new york , can surely say they have " made it . "
gert and uwe tobias can now lay claim to that fame .
from wednesday , nov .
28 through feb .
25 , moma is showing 20 works by the 34-year-old twins from cologne , germany .
the show comprises drawings of typewriters and fantastic gouaches , as well as enormous , brightly colored woodcuts .
the tobias brothers were born in romania and came to germany in 1985 .
they studied art together in the northern german town of braunschweig .
today , they share a studio in cologne .
an affinity for german art bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brothers have been praised for their use of color " it is a great honor for us to be offered an exhibit at moma , " gert tobias said on the eve of the opening in new york .
but the twins are not the first german artists to get a show at moma .
in 2001 , düsseldorf photographer andreas gursky was given a show in the famed museum , and a year later , it was painter gerhard richter 's turn .
" moma has shown a great affinity for german art , " said stefan gronert , the curator of the kunst museum bonn , who has been following the twins ' career since 2004 .
but gert and uwe tobias do n't see their work in the category of " german art " - or romanian art , for that matter .
" we are just artists , who make our own art , " gert tobias said .
nonetheless , it would be fairly easy for the brothers to ride the tide of popularity in german art if they wanted to , gronert said .
" right now , german art is very popular in other countries .
especially in the usa , " he said .
popularity of the leipzig school he pointed out that germany is home to the leipzig school , whose modern , graphic painting style has excited interest in us collectors for years now .
today , leipzig is home to a lively artists ' quarter , where 11 galleries have opened up in a building that was once europe 's largest cotton factory .
and more than just paintings are being made .
numerous young artists of all stripes have jumped on the leipzig art scene bandwagon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist gerhard richter has been very popular in the us the popularity of german art is closely linked to the growing interest in art world-wide .
the art market is hungrier than ever .
gronert claims that german art , like other german products , is known for its quality .
" the best explanation is that quality simply wins out , " he said .
this appears to be the case when it comes to the tobias brothers .
the pair has been called " revivers of the woodcut . "
moma has praised their " amazing color sensibility " and their " astounding graphical compositions . "
career boost is likely the moma exhibit will no doubt boost the careers of the tobias brothers , who appear to be taking it in stride .
" after new york , we need a few days to just process it all , " gert tobias said .
" we are n't sure what comes after that . "
gronert said he imagines a number of major museums will want to mount shows of the tobias brothers ' woodcuts - including his own .
in march , an exhibit of gert and uwe tobias woodcuts will be opening at the kunst museum bonn . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sunday 's parliamentary elections in russia may well leave much to be desired in terms of democracy .
but experts on the country say there 's little need to fear the kremlin 's long-term plans . the poll on dec .
2 is being viewed as a referendum on president vladimir putin 's popularity .
with putin 's future plans unclear and the kremlin recently striking an aggressive international posture , particularly toward the united states , many pundits have speculated that russia might be bidding to re-establish itself as a global superpower . but russia 's military might today does n't remotely compare to the power wielded by the soviet union .
german experts on russia said there 's little reason to worry about a return to the cold-war-era stand-off between russia and the west . " superpower is the wrong word , " said hans-henning schröder , a professor of eastern european history and politics at the university of bremen .
" big power would be more accurate .
the us is in another dimension entirely , and that 's clear to the russian leadership under putin as well .
but russia would like to reach the level of influence of , say , germany or great britain . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adherents of the current president have been taking to the streets to show support christoph zürcher , professor of political science at the free university of berlin , agreed that it did not make sense to put russia and the us in the same league . " russia is trying to show presence on the international stage , but it 's hard to take the idea of bipolarity between russia and the us very seriously , " he said .
" it would be nice if there were a multi-polar counterweight to american influence in the world .
but that 's not what russia stands for right now .
they 're pursing national interests . " energy plays limited role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's gas reserves give it power - especially over its immediate neighbors russia 's vast natural resources , particularly natural gas and oil , will give the country increased leverage in coming years .
but the experts do n't think europe is necessarily overly dependent on russian energy . " the role of energy is foreign relations is over-dramatized , " said alexander rahr , the director of the russian-eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations .
" germany only gets 30 percent of its natural gas from russia ; france only 10 percent .
the lone nations who are truly dependent are russia 's direct neighbors . " schröder agreed that countries such as georgia , the baltic republics and poland could feel pressure from russia , which in turn could create a problem for the eu . but " russia has roughly the same economic power as italy so it 's actually a fairly small country in this respect , and countries like germany do n't need to worry too much about possible developments , " he added . lack of middle class is biggest problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economy is driven by natural resources , while technology lags russia is getting richer and currently boasts annual growth rates of up to 7 percent .
but the experts disagreed as to how strong the russian economy really is - and how much it may need to diversify from energy production . " russia can assume it wo n't be suffering any financial crises in the next 10 years , especially as the energy needs of countries like china are also sure to rise , " rahr said .
" the biggest problem is the destruction of the middle-class - that was a mistake that needs correcting . " shakespearean drama ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian opposition parties say the election is a farce there is complete consensus that sunday 's election is about putin - and whether he can retain significant power despite constitutional restrictions . but the experts stressed that that issue - at least in the short term - has more to do with putin 's relationship with russia , and vice versa , and less with putin or russia 's plans vis-a-vis the world . " russia has become arrogant enough to flout international decorum , for instance , by refusing to allow international monitoring , " zürcher said .
" that 's not so terrible for the rest of the world .
what 's terrible is that russia is on its way to becoming an unpleasant , semi-authoritarian system . " " the problem is that all the power is concentrated in the hands of the president , and when he gives up this power and passes it on to his successor , he 's in effect at his successor 's mercy , " schröder said .
" what putin is doing is trying to position himself so that he 's unassailable . " " it 's almost like a shakespearean drama , " rahr said .
" a historic figure who is still very popular has to go because of the constitution , but the system requires a strong leader at the top .
that 's also thrown the state into an internal dilemma . " jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sunday 's parliamentary elections in russia may well leave much to be desired in terms of democracy .
but experts on the country say there 's little need to fear the kremlin 's long-term plans . the poll on dec .
2 is being viewed as a referendum on president vladimir putin 's popularity .
with putin 's future plans unclear and the kremlin recently striking an aggressive international posture , particularly toward the united states , many pundits have speculated that russia might be bidding to re-establish itself as a global superpower . but russia 's military might today does n't remotely compare to the power wielded by the soviet union .
german experts on russia said there 's little reason to worry about a return to the cold-war-era stand-off between russia and the west . " superpower is the wrong word , " said hans-henning schröder , a professor of eastern european history and politics at the university of bremen .
" big power would be more accurate .
the us is in another dimension entirely , and that 's clear to the russian leadership under putin as well .
but russia would like to reach the level of influence of , say , germany or great britain . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adherents of the current president have been taking to the streets to show support christoph zürcher , professor of political science at the free university of berlin , agreed that it did not make sense to put russia and the us in the same league . " russia is trying to show presence on the international stage , but it 's hard to take the idea of bipolarity between russia and the us very seriously , " he said .
" it would be nice if there were a multi-polar counterweight to american influence in the world .
but that 's not what russia stands for right now .
they 're pursing national interests . " energy plays limited role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's gas reserves give it power - especially over its immediate neighbors russia 's vast natural resources , particularly natural gas and oil , will give the country increased leverage in coming years .
but the experts do n't think europe is necessarily overly dependent on russian energy . " the role of energy is foreign relations is over-dramatized , " said alexander rahr , the director of the russian-eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations .
" germany only gets 30 percent of its natural gas from russia ; france only 10 percent .
the lone nations who are truly dependent are russia 's direct neighbors . " schröder agreed that countries such as georgia , the baltic republics and poland could feel pressure from russia , which in turn could create a problem for the eu . but " russia has roughly the same economic power as italy so it 's actually a fairly small country in this respect , and countries like germany do n't need to worry too much about possible developments , " he added . lack of middle class is biggest problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economy is driven by natural resources , while technology lags russia is getting richer and currently boasts annual growth rates of up to 7 percent .
but the experts disagreed as to how strong the russian economy really is - and how much it may need to diversify from energy production . " russia can assume it wo n't be suffering any financial crises in the next 10 years , especially as the energy needs of countries like china are also sure to rise , " rahr said .
" the biggest problem is the destruction of the middle-class - that was a mistake that needs correcting . " shakespearean drama ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian opposition parties say the election is a farce there is complete consensus that sunday 's election is about putin - and whether he can retain significant power despite constitutional restrictions . but the experts stressed that that issue - at least in the short term - has more to do with putin 's relationship with russia , and vice versa , and less with putin or russia 's plans vis-a-vis the world . " russia has become arrogant enough to flout international decorum , for instance , by refusing to allow international monitoring , " zürcher said .
" that 's not so terrible for the rest of the world .
what 's terrible is that russia is on its way to becoming an unpleasant , semi-authoritarian system . " " the problem is that all the power is concentrated in the hands of the president , and when he gives up this power and passes it on to his successor , he 's in effect at his successor 's mercy , " schröder said .
" what putin is doing is trying to position himself so that he 's unassailable . " " it 's almost like a shakespearean drama , " rahr said .
" a historic figure who is still very popular has to go because of the constitution , but the system requires a strong leader at the top .
that 's also thrown the state into an internal dilemma . " jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gillian gibbons , 54 , from liverpool , was arrested on sunday in khartoum , and could face charges of insulting islam 's prophet after her class named the toy .
but one boy said : " the teacher asked me what i wanted to call the teddy .
i said muhammad .
i named it after my name . "
the sudanese embassy in london said the situation was a " storm in a teacup " .
it has indicated that she could be released soon , as the incident was based on a cultural misunderstanding .
three british embassy staff and one of her colleagues have now been allowed to visit mrs gibbons at sudan 's criminal exploration bureau .
so far she has spent three nights in custody .
the toy was named in september after children were asked to vote on a name for a teddy bear as part of the class 's study of animals and their habitats . "
i am pretty certain that this minute incident will be clarified very quickly " dr khalid al mubarak sudan embassy spokesman rules on naming readers ' views the boy 's family said he was not thinking of the prophet when he chose the name .
speaking to reporters , they said ms gibbons was a " very nice " teacher who did not mention religion in class .
a spokesman for the sudanese embassy in london , khalid al-mubarak , told the bbc that it was a " minute " matter .
" what is happening now is standard procedure because one of the parents has complained and the police is bound to investigate just as is the case in any country in which there is rule of law .
" i am pretty certain that this minute incident will be clarified very quickly and that this venerable teacher who has been helping us teach our children will be safe and will be cleared " .
it is seen as an insult to islam to attempt to make an image of the prophet muhammad .
foreign office officials have visited ms gibbons in custody , and prime minister gordon brown said he felt " very sorry " about what was happening to her .
school closed he said officials would continue to try to " clarify the position so that she can be released " .
she was arrested after several parents of children at the unity high school , in khartoum , made complaints .
ms gibbons has been suspended from her teaching post , and the school has closed until january .
inayat bunglawala , assistant secretary general of the muslim council of britain , also said it appeared to have been a " quite horrible misunderstanding " and ms gibbons should never have been arrested .
there was no apparent intention to offend islamic sensibilities or defame the honour and name of the prophet muhammad , he said .

both sides said they had resolved the disagreement over west 's use of the name " evel kanyevel " in a music video .
the 69-year-old daredevil had claimed his image was tarnished by the clip 's " vulgar , sexual nature " , but said the settlement satisfied both parties .
a spokesman for west confirmed that the two sides had reached an agreement .
the video , for the 2006 single touch the sky , showed the rap star cavorting with pamela anderson and trying to jump a rocket-powered motorcycle over a canyon .
it appeared to be a parody of knievel 's attempt to jump snake river canyon in idaho in 1974 - which failed after a parachute on his rocket-powered " skycycle " opened too early .
' filth ' the stuntman sued west and his record label last december , claiming the rapper had damaged his reputation by using the knievel image to " promote his filth to the world . "
but knievel , whose real name is robert craig knievel jr , changed his mind about west after meeting him in person .
" i thought he was a wonderful guy and quite a gentleman , " he said .
" we settled the lawsuit amicably .
i was very satisfied and so was he . "
the pair agreed not to discuss the terms of the settlement in public , he added .
knievel also expressed concern for west , who is grieving the sudden death of his mother on 10 november .
" i know he 's had some tough times the past few weeks , and i hope things work out , " he said .

the government-run school , flanked by a red dust road on the outskirts of abuja , nigeria , taught about 300 pupils who congregated from the surrounding rural area .
but in march this year , the scruffy primary became part of a remarkable experiment .
it was the first in africa to get its hands on the so-called $ 100 laptop , a rugged device aimed at helping children in the developing world get the most from their education .
the tough machines , conceived by the us-based one laptop per child -lrb- olpc -rrb- group , were designed to replace dog-eared text books and traditional teaching .
the school was given around 300 of the low-cost laptops along with a satellite internet link known as vsat , a power generator and solar panels .
the idea was to see if the machines would survive the ultimate test : children .
" we wanted to bring the laptops to an environment where the kids would drop it , put it in water and do everything you would n't want to do to a normal laptop , " explained ayo kusamotu , a lawyer and volunteer with olpc nigeria , an independent group set-up to support olpc in nigeria .
the hardware trial ran for five months .
" we 've actually learned a lot from that trial - really simple things that are almost mundane but important , " explained walter bender of olpc .
" for example , some of the desks in galadima are at an angle and we learned that you 've got to put rubber feet on the laptop otherwise it will slide off .
so now production laptops have rubber feet . "
although , the trial has now ended olpc nigeria has continued to fund and support the school 's use of the computers .
it remains one of just a handful of places in the world where the olpc vision can be seen " in the wild " and visiting it is an uplifting experience .
village pride the children - most of whom had never seen a computer before march - have clearly embraced the green and white machines . "
it is one of the happiest things that has happened to the school " miss manzo even before entering the school grounds , visitors are accosted by hordes of animated children waving their laptops , eager to show what they can do with them .
children stream from doorways and alleys wanting to take a " snap " with the laptop 's onboard camera whilst others shoot video files and then excitedly show each other the results .
the more studious show off the graphs and pictures they have drawn and the notes they have typed in class .
there is a clear sense of enjoyment and pride in both ownership and use of the machines .
one girl was even wearing the power cord as a necklace .
and that pride continues through to the packed classrooms - where up to 90 or 100 pupils are squeezed into one room - and is evident in both children and teacher .
" it is one of the happiest things that has happened to the school , " miss manzo , one of the teachers at the school confided .
" before , we felt that we were not very important but now we have the laptop we feel that we have moved ahead . "
not only has it raised the status of the school , she said , but it has also improved learning at school and the surrounding community .
" the laptop has brought a great impact to our children , " she said .
" it is easier to give notes and assignments and they -lsb- the children -rsb- learn faster . "
she added : " but it is not only in the school they make use of the laptop .
they use it at home and even help to teach their parents . "
miss manzo said that both the children and the teachers had easily learnt how to use the xo laptops , as they are known .
at the moment the laptops are used to augment the text books and black boards rather than replace them .
" one of the biggest uses of the laptop is for note-taking in class , " said mr kusamotu .
a look inside the school in addition , he said , teachers use the preloaded encyclopaedia to teach classes .
during our visit we saw a lesson on the mammalian eye based on the preloaded content along with maths lessons that used the calculator .
although there are no numbers that show what effect , if any , the laptops have had , the teachers remain convinced of their worth .
" i pray that the government will try and help every child in nigeria get access to this , " said the headmistress of galadima , mrs juliana okowkno .
digital distraction however , aspects of digital life at galadima are not perfect .
what are small problems at one school could become serious issues if , and when , millions of the laptops are rolled out across the country .
for example , more than 40 of the prototype machines have either been lost , stolen or broken since march .
this has knock-on consequences , meaning that that not every child has a laptop on which to follow lessons .
in addition , the laptops can be a distraction - often pupils play games on their computer rather than follow the class .
it is also apparent from visiting galadima the level of support a large-scale roll out of the programme would require .
teachers would need to be trained , technicians would need to be on hand to troubleshoot problems and the laptops and its peripherals would also need maintenance .
some of the children have learnt how to fix broken keyboards and remove the screens and batteries .
they act as engineers for the whole of the school - fixing friends laptops as and when needs arise .
but software and infrastructure problems may be more tricky .
for example , the solar chargers strapped to the roof of galadima school had been not set up correctly - we were told they were " misaligned " - and are useless .
net worth however , perhaps the greatest difficulty that will face schools that follow galadima is the internet .
earlier this year , some of the pupils were found to be accessing pornography through the laptops .
although filters can be added relatively easily , there is a bigger problem and one that is typical of many developing economies : cost .
" vsat is still very expensive , " said mr olanrewaju oke of internet service provider accelon .
" for a 1.2m dish and a one watt radio it comes in at about $ 2,500 . "
in addition , a 128kbps connection - around a quarter of the speed of a typical broadband connection - is around $ 350 per month , or $ 4,200 per year .
that is on top of the cost of the laptops - currently $ 188 apiece .
during the trial , accelon provided the connection for free but now the school is on its own and as a result , the link has been cut - although olpc nigeria had asked for the internet to be restored during our visit .
mr oke believes that cost will come down in the same way as it did in the mobile phone sector .
he has put forward a long term plan in the event the nigeria government buys into olpc that would see schools sharing a connection .
" we 're looking for a situation where we can provide good clean access to these schools for anything from $ 100 to $ 150 a month , " he said .
" it 's a starting point and eventually we would like to get close to where europe is at 50 , 60 or 70 dollars a month . "
without government intervention it is difficult to see how many schools in nigeria - and elsewhere - could afford to get online .
but mr kusamotu does not believe it is a problem .
" it is not a stumbling block , " he said .
" having the xo , even without the internet , is an extension of the classroom . "

" for example , some of the desks in galadima are at an angle and we learned that you 've got to put rubber feet on the laptop otherwise it will slide off .
so now production laptops have rubber feet . "
although , the trial has now ended olpc nigeria has continued to fund and support the school 's use of the computers .
it remains one of just a handful of places in the world where the olpc vision can be seen " in the wild " and visiting it is an uplifting experience .
village pride the children - most of whom had never seen a computer before march - have clearly embraced the green and white machines .
it is one of the happiest things that has happened to the school miss manzo even before entering the school grounds , visitors are accosted by hordes of animated children waving their laptops , eager to show what they can do with them .
children stream from doorways and alleys wanting to take a " snap " with the laptop 's onboard camera whilst others shoot video files and then excitedly show each other the results .
the more studious show off the graphs and pictures they have drawn and the notes they have typed in class .
there is a clear sense of enjoyment and pride in both ownership and use of the machines .
one girl was even wearing the power cord as a necklace .
and that pride continues through to the packed classrooms - where up to 90 or 100 pupils are squeezed into one room - and is evident in both children and teacher .
" it is one of the happiest things that has happened to the school , " miss manzo , one of the teachers at the school confided .
' yo-yo ' power chord " before , we felt that we were not very important but now we have the laptop we feel that we have moved ahead . "
not only has it raised the status of the school , she said , but it has also improved learning at school and the surrounding community .
" the laptop has brought a great impact to our children , " she said .
" it is easier to give notes and assignments and they -lsb- the children -rsb- learn faster . "
she added : " but it is not only in the school they make use of the laptop .
they use it at home and even help to teach their parents . "
miss manzo said that both the children and the teachers had easily learnt how to use the xo laptops , as they are known .
at the moment the laptops are used to augment the text books and black boards rather than replace them .
" one of the biggest uses of the laptop is for note-taking in class , " said mr kusamotu .
a look inside the school in addition , he said , teachers use the preloaded encyclopaedia to teach classes .
during our visit we saw a lesson on the mammalian eye based on the preloaded content along with maths lessons that used the calculator .
although there are no numbers that show what effect , if any , the laptops have had , the teachers remain convinced of their worth .
" i pray that the government will try and help every child in nigeria get access to this , " said the headmistress of galadima , mrs juliana okowkno .
digital distraction however , aspects of digital life at galadima are not perfect .
what are small problems at one school could become serious issues if , and when , millions of the laptops are rolled out across the country .
the children are allowed to take the laptops home with them for example , more than 40 of the prototype machines have either been lost , stolen or broken since march .
this has knock-on consequences , meaning that that not every child has a laptop on which to follow lessons .
in addition , the laptops can be a distraction - often pupils play games on their computer rather than follow the class .
it is also apparent from visiting galadima the level of support a large-scale roll out of the programme would require .
teachers would need to be trained , technicians would need to be on hand to troubleshoot problems and the laptops and its peripherals would also need maintenance .
some of the children have learnt how to fix broken keyboards and remove the screens and batteries .
they act as engineers for the whole of the school - fixing friends laptops as and when needs arise .
but software and infrastructure problems may be more tricky .
for example , the solar chargers strapped to the roof of galadima school had been not set up correctly - we were told they were " misaligned " - and are useless .
net worth however , perhaps the greatest difficulty that will face schools that follow galadima is the internet .
earlier this year , some of the pupils were found to be accessing pornography through the laptops .
the internet connection is powered by a diesel generator although filters can be added relatively easily , there is a bigger problem and one that is typical of many developing economies : cost .
" vsat is still very expensive , " said mr olanrewaju oke of internet service provider accelon .
" for a 1.2m dish and a one watt radio it comes in at about $ 2,500 . "
in addition , a 128kbps connection - around a quarter of the speed of a typical broadband connection - is around $ 350 per month , or $ 4,200 per year .
that is on top of the cost of the laptops - currently $ 188 apiece .
during the trial , accelon provided the connection for free but now the school is on its own and as a result , the link has been cut - although olpc nigeria had asked for the internet to be restored during our visit .
mr oke believes that cost will come down in the same way as it did in the mobile phone sector .
he has put forward a long term plan in the event the nigeria government buys into olpc that would see schools sharing a connection .
" we 're looking for a situation where we can provide good clean access to these schools for anything from $ 100 to $ 150 a month , " he said .
" it 's a starting point and eventually we would like to get close to where europe is at 50 , 60 or 70 dollars a month . "
without government intervention it is difficult to see how many schools in nigeria - and elsewhere - could afford to get online .
but mr kusamotu does not believe it is a problem .
" it is not a stumbling block , " he said .
" having the xo , even without the internet , is an extension of the classroom . "

the government-run school , flanked by a red dust road on the outskirts of abuja , nigeria , taught about 300 pupils who congregated from the surrounding rural area .
but in march this year , the scruffy primary became part of a remarkable experiment .
it was the first in africa to get its hands on the so-called $ 100 laptop , a rugged device aimed at helping children in the developing world get the most from their education .
the tough machines , conceived by the us-based one laptop per child -lrb- olpc -rrb- group , were designed to replace dog-eared text books and traditional teaching .
the school was given around 300 of the low-cost laptops along with a satellite internet link known as vsat , a power generator and solar panels .
the idea was to see if the machines would survive the ultimate test : children .
laptop pupils give their views in detail " we wanted to bring the laptops to an environment where the kids would drop it , put it in water and do everything you would n't want to do to a normal laptop , " explained ayo kusamotu , a lawyer and volunteer with olpc nigeria , an independent group set-up to support olpc in nigeria .

but software and infrastructure problems may be more tricky .
for example , the solar chargers strapped to the roof of galadima school had been not set up correctly - we were told they were " misaligned " - and are useless .
net worth however , perhaps the greatest difficulty that will face schools that follow galadima is the internet .
earlier this year , some of the pupils were found to be accessing pornography through the laptops .
the internet connection is powered by a diesel generator although filters can be added relatively easily , there is a bigger problem and one that is typical of many developing economies : cost .
" vsat is still very expensive , " said mr olanrewaju oke of internet service provider accelon .
" for a 1.2m dish and a one watt radio it comes in at about $ 2,500 . "
in addition , a 128kbps connection - around a quarter of the speed of a typical broadband connection - is around $ 350 per month , or $ 4,200 per year .
that is on top of the cost of the laptops - currently $ 188 apiece .
during the trial , accelon provided the connection for free but now the school is on its own and as a result , the link has been cut - although olpc nigeria had asked for the internet to be restored during our visit .
mr oke believes that cost will come down in the same way as it did in the mobile phone sector .
he has put forward a long term plan in the event the nigeria government buys into olpc that would see schools sharing a connection .
" we 're looking for a situation where we can provide good clean access to these schools for anything from $ 100 to $ 150 a month , " he said .
" it 's a starting point and eventually we would like to get close to where europe is at 50 , 60 or 70 dollars a month . "
without government intervention it is difficult to see how many schools in nigeria - and elsewhere - could afford to get online .
but mr kusamotu does not believe it is a problem .
" it is not a stumbling block , " he said .
" having the xo , even without the internet , is an extension of the classroom . "

the government-run school , flanked by a red dust road on the outskirts of abuja , nigeria , taught about 300 pupils who congregated from the surrounding rural area .
but in march this year , the scruffy primary became part of a remarkable experiment .
it was the first in africa to get its hands on the so-called $ 100 laptop , a rugged device aimed at helping children in the developing world get the most from their education .
the tough machines , conceived by the us-based one laptop per child -lrb- olpc -rrb- group , were designed to replace dog-eared text books and traditional teaching .
the school was given around 300 of the low-cost laptops along with a satellite internet link known as vsat , a power generator and solar panels .
the idea was to see if the machines would survive the ultimate test : children .
laptop pupils give their views in detail " we wanted to bring the laptops to an environment where the kids would drop it , put it in water and do everything you would n't want to do to a normal laptop , " explained ayo kusamotu , a lawyer and volunteer with olpc nigeria , an independent group set-up to support olpc in nigeria .
the hardware trial ran for five months .
" we 've actually learned a lot from that trial - really simple things that are almost mundane but important , " explained walter bender of olpc .
" for example , some of the desks in galadima are at an angle and we learned that you 've got to put rubber feet on the laptop otherwise it will slide off .
so now production laptops have rubber feet . "
although , the trial has now ended olpc nigeria has continued to fund and support the school 's use of the computers .
it remains one of just a handful of places in the world where the olpc vision can be seen " in the wild " and visiting it is an uplifting experience .
village pride the children - most of whom had never seen a computer before march - have clearly embraced the green and white machines .
it is one of the happiest things that has happened to the school miss manzo even before entering the school grounds , visitors are accosted by hordes of animated children waving their laptops , eager to show what they can do with them .
children stream from doorways and alleys wanting to take a " snap " with the laptop 's onboard camera whilst others shoot video files and then excitedly show each other the results .
the more studious show off the graphs and pictures they have drawn and the notes they have typed in class .
there is a clear sense of enjoyment and pride in both ownership and use of the machines .
one girl was even wearing the power cord as a necklace .
and that pride continues through to the packed classrooms - where up to 90 or 100 pupils are squeezed into one room - and is evident in both children and teacher .
" it is one of the happiest things that has happened to the school , " miss manzo , one of the teachers at the school confided .
' yo-yo ' power chord " before , we felt that we were not very important but now we have the laptop we feel that we have moved ahead . "
not only has it raised the status of the school , she said , but it has also improved learning at school and the surrounding community .
" the laptop has brought a great impact to our children , " she said .
" it is easier to give notes and assignments and they -lsb- the children -rsb- learn faster . "
she added : " but it is not only in the school they make use of the laptop .
they use it at home and even help to teach their parents . "
miss manzo said that both the children and the teachers had easily learnt how to use the xo laptops , as they are known .
at the moment the laptops are used to augment the text books and black boards rather than replace them .
" one of the biggest uses of the laptop is for note-taking in class , " said mr kusamotu .
a look inside the school in addition , he said , teachers use the preloaded encyclopaedia to teach classes .
during our visit we saw a lesson on the mammalian eye based on the preloaded content along with maths lessons that used the calculator .
although there are no numbers that show what effect , if any , the laptops have had , the teachers remain convinced of their worth .
" i pray that the government will try and help every child in nigeria get access to this , " said the headmistress of galadima , mrs juliana okowkno .
digital distraction however , aspects of digital life at galadima are not perfect .
what are small problems at one school could become serious issues if , and when , millions of the laptops are rolled out across the country .
the children are allowed to take the laptops home with them for example , more than 40 of the prototype machines have either been lost , stolen or broken since march .
this has knock-on consequences , meaning that that not every child has a laptop on which to follow lessons .
in addition , the laptops can be a distraction - often pupils play games on their computer rather than follow the class .
it is also apparent from visiting galadima the level of support a large-scale roll out of the programme would require .
teachers would need to be trained , technicians would need to be on hand to troubleshoot problems and the laptops and its peripherals would also need maintenance .

the government-run school , flanked by a red dust road on the outskirts of abuja , nigeria , taught about 300 pupils who congregated from the surrounding rural area .
but in march this year , the scruffy primary became part of a remarkable experiment .
it was the first in africa to get its hands on the so-called $ 100 laptop , a rugged device aimed at helping children in the developing world get the most from their education .
the tough machines , conceived by the us-based one laptop per child -lrb- olpc -rrb- group , were designed to replace dog-eared text books and traditional teaching .
the school was given around 300 of the low-cost laptops along with a satellite internet link known as vsat , a power generator and solar panels .
the idea was to see if the machines would survive the ultimate test : children .
laptop pupils give their views in detail " we wanted to bring the laptops to an environment where the kids would drop it , put it in water and do everything you would n't want to do to a normal laptop , " explained ayo kusamotu , a lawyer and volunteer with olpc nigeria , an independent group set-up to support olpc in nigeria .
the hardware trial ran for five months .
" we 've actually learned a lot from that trial - really simple things that are almost mundane but important , " explained walter bender of olpc .
" for example , some of the desks in galadima are at an angle and we learned that you 've got to put rubber feet on the laptop otherwise it will slide off .
so now production laptops have rubber feet . "
although , the trial has now ended olpc nigeria has continued to fund and support the school 's use of the computers .
it remains one of just a handful of places in the world where the olpc vision can be seen " in the wild " and visiting it is an uplifting experience .
village pride the children - most of whom had never seen a computer before march - have clearly embraced the green and white machines .
it is one of the happiest things that has happened to the school miss manzo even before entering the school grounds , visitors are accosted by hordes of animated children waving their laptops , eager to show what they can do with them .
children stream from doorways and alleys wanting to take a " snap " with the laptop 's onboard camera whilst others shoot video files and then excitedly show each other the results .
the more studious show off the graphs and pictures they have drawn and the notes they have typed in class .
there is a clear sense of enjoyment and pride in both ownership and use of the machines .
one girl was even wearing the power cord as a necklace .
and that pride continues through to the packed classrooms - where up to 90 or 100 pupils are squeezed into one room - and is evident in both children and teacher .
" it is one of the happiest things that has happened to the school , " miss manzo , one of the teachers at the school confided .
' yo-yo ' power chord " before , we felt that we were not very important but now we have the laptop we feel that we have moved ahead . "
not only has it raised the status of the school , she said , but it has also improved learning at school and the surrounding community .
" the laptop has brought a great impact to our children , " she said .
" it is easier to give notes and assignments and they -lsb- the children -rsb- learn faster . "
she added : " but it is not only in the school they make use of the laptop .
they use it at home and even help to teach their parents . "
miss manzo said that both the children and the teachers had easily learnt how to use the xo laptops , as they are known .
at the moment the laptops are used to augment the text books and black boards rather than replace them .
" one of the biggest uses of the laptop is for note-taking in class , " said mr kusamotu .
a look inside the school in addition , he said , teachers use the preloaded encyclopaedia to teach classes .
during our visit we saw a lesson on the mammalian eye based on the preloaded content along with maths lessons that used the calculator .
although there are no numbers that show what effect , if any , the laptops have had , the teachers remain convinced of their worth .
" i pray that the government will try and help every child in nigeria get access to this , " said the headmistress of galadima , mrs juliana okowkno .
digital distraction however , aspects of digital life at galadima are not perfect .
what are small problems at one school could become serious issues if , and when , millions of the laptops are rolled out across the country .
the children are allowed to take the laptops home with them for example , more than 40 of the prototype machines have either been lost , stolen or broken since march .
this has knock-on consequences , meaning that that not every child has a laptop on which to follow lessons .
in addition , the laptops can be a distraction - often pupils play games on their computer rather than follow the class .
it is also apparent from visiting galadima the level of support a large-scale roll out of the programme would require .
teachers would need to be trained , technicians would need to be on hand to troubleshoot problems and the laptops and its peripherals would also need maintenance .
some of the children have learnt how to fix broken keyboards and remove the screens and batteries .
they act as engineers for the whole of the school - fixing friends laptops as and when needs arise .
but software and infrastructure problems may be more tricky .
for example , the solar chargers strapped to the roof of galadima school had been not set up correctly - we were told they were " misaligned " - and are useless .
net worth however , perhaps the greatest difficulty that will face schools that follow galadima is the internet .
earlier this year , some of the pupils were found to be accessing pornography through the laptops .
the internet connection is powered by a diesel generator although filters can be added relatively easily , there is a bigger problem and one that is typical of many developing economies : cost .
" vsat is still very expensive , " said mr olanrewaju oke of internet service provider accelon .
" for a 1.2m dish and a one watt radio it comes in at about $ 2,500 . "
in addition , a 128kbps connection - around a quarter of the speed of a typical broadband connection - is around $ 350 per month , or $ 4,200 per year .
that is on top of the cost of the laptops - currently $ 188 apiece .
during the trial , accelon provided the connection for free but now the school is on its own and as a result , the link has been cut - although olpc nigeria had asked for the internet to be restored during our visit .
mr oke believes that cost will come down in the same way as it did in the mobile phone sector .
he has put forward a long term plan in the event the nigeria government buys into olpc that would see schools sharing a connection .
" we 're looking for a situation where we can provide good clean access to these schools for anything from $ 100 to $ 150 a month , " he said .
" it 's a starting point and eventually we would like to get close to where europe is at 50 , 60 or 70 dollars a month . "
without government intervention it is difficult to see how many schools in nigeria - and elsewhere - could afford to get online .
but mr kusamotu does not believe it is a problem .
" it is not a stumbling block , " he said .
" having the xo , even without the internet , is an extension of the classroom . "

laptop pupils give their views in detail " we wanted to bring the laptops to an environment where the kids would drop it , put it in water and do everything you would n't want to do to a normal laptop , " explained ayo kusamotu , a lawyer and volunteer with olpc nigeria , an independent group set-up to support olpc in nigeria .
the hardware trial ran for five months .
" we 've actually learned a lot from that trial - really simple things that are almost mundane but important , " explained walter bender of olpc .
" for example , some of the desks in galadima are at an angle and we learned that you 've got to put rubber feet on the laptop otherwise it will slide off .
so now production laptops have rubber feet . "
although , the trial has now ended olpc nigeria has continued to fund and support the school 's use of the computers .
it remains one of just a handful of places in the world where the olpc vision can be seen " in the wild " and visiting it is an uplifting experience .
village pride the children - most of whom had never seen a computer before march - have clearly embraced the green and white machines .
it is one of the happiest things that has happened to the school miss manzo even before entering the school grounds , visitors are accosted by hordes of animated children waving their laptops , eager to show what they can do with them .
children stream from doorways and alleys wanting to take a " snap " with the laptop 's onboard camera whilst others shoot video files and then excitedly show each other the results .
the more studious show off the graphs and pictures they have drawn and the notes they have typed in class .
there is a clear sense of enjoyment and pride in both ownership and use of the machines .
one girl was even wearing the power cord as a necklace .
and that pride continues through to the packed classrooms - where up to 90 or 100 pupils are squeezed into one room - and is evident in both children and teacher .
" it is one of the happiest things that has happened to the school , " miss manzo , one of the teachers at the school confided .
' yo-yo ' power chord " before , we felt that we were not very important but now we have the laptop we feel that we have moved ahead . "
not only has it raised the status of the school , she said , but it has also improved learning at school and the surrounding community .
" the laptop has brought a great impact to our children , " she said .
" it is easier to give notes and assignments and they -lsb- the children -rsb- learn faster . "
she added : " but it is not only in the school they make use of the laptop .
they use it at home and even help to teach their parents . "
miss manzo said that both the children and the teachers had easily learnt how to use the xo laptops , as they are known .
at the moment the laptops are used to augment the text books and black boards rather than replace them .
" one of the biggest uses of the laptop is for note-taking in class , " said mr kusamotu .
a look inside the school in addition , he said , teachers use the preloaded encyclopaedia to teach classes .
during our visit we saw a lesson on the mammalian eye based on the preloaded content along with maths lessons that used the calculator .
although there are no numbers that show what effect , if any , the laptops have had , the teachers remain convinced of their worth .
" i pray that the government will try and help every child in nigeria get access to this , " said the headmistress of galadima , mrs juliana okowkno .
digital distraction however , aspects of digital life at galadima are not perfect .
what are small problems at one school could become serious issues if , and when , millions of the laptops are rolled out across the country .
the children are allowed to take the laptops home with them for example , more than 40 of the prototype machines have either been lost , stolen or broken since march .
this has knock-on consequences , meaning that that not every child has a laptop on which to follow lessons .
in addition , the laptops can be a distraction - often pupils play games on their computer rather than follow the class .
it is also apparent from visiting galadima the level of support a large-scale roll out of the programme would require .
teachers would need to be trained , technicians would need to be on hand to troubleshoot problems and the laptops and its peripherals would also need maintenance .
some of the children have learnt how to fix broken keyboards and remove the screens and batteries .
they act as engineers for the whole of the school - fixing friends laptops as and when needs arise .
but software and infrastructure problems may be more tricky .
for example , the solar chargers strapped to the roof of galadima school had been not set up correctly - we were told they were " misaligned " - and are useless .
net worth however , perhaps the greatest difficulty that will face schools that follow galadima is the internet .
earlier this year , some of the pupils were found to be accessing pornography through the laptops .
the internet connection is powered by a diesel generator although filters can be added relatively easily , there is a bigger problem and one that is typical of many developing economies : cost .
" vsat is still very expensive , " said mr olanrewaju oke of internet service provider accelon .
" for a 1.2m dish and a one watt radio it comes in at about $ 2,500 . "
in addition , a 128kbps connection - around a quarter of the speed of a typical broadband connection - is around $ 350 per month , or $ 4,200 per year .
that is on top of the cost of the laptops - currently $ 188 apiece .
during the trial , accelon provided the connection for free but now the school is on its own and as a result , the link has been cut - although olpc nigeria had asked for the internet to be restored during our visit .
mr oke believes that cost will come down in the same way as it did in the mobile phone sector .
he has put forward a long term plan in the event the nigeria government buys into olpc that would see schools sharing a connection .
" we 're looking for a situation where we can provide good clean access to these schools for anything from $ 100 to $ 150 a month , " he said .
" it 's a starting point and eventually we would like to get close to where europe is at 50 , 60 or 70 dollars a month . "
without government intervention it is difficult to see how many schools in nigeria - and elsewhere - could afford to get online .
but mr kusamotu does not believe it is a problem .
" it is not a stumbling block , " he said .
" having the xo , even without the internet , is an extension of the classroom . "

nicholas negroponte is an influential figure in global technology " he was talking about the switch from wired to wireless and that was back before there was much in the way of cell phones or anything else , " mr rossetto recalled .
in the early 1980s professor negroponte began working on projects to help educate the developing world 's children with computers .
together with seymour papert , an mit computer scientist and educator , he distributed apple ii microcomputers to school children in senegal .
in april 2002 he kept his vision alive by providing children in a remote cambodian village with connected laptops , inadvertently teaching them " google " as their first english word .
the trials convinced him that the laptop could play a fundamental role in educational programmes for children in remote , rural , and poor regions of the world .
professor negroponte 's self-confessed " preoccupation " with bringing computing , communication , and the internet to countries which are less economically fortunate has culminated in the olpc initiative .
mr rossetto said : " it 's not about building fancy gadgets for rich people as much as bringing knowledge and power to even the poorest .
i think that it 's always been about democratising technology in a very concrete way . "
but professor negroponte 's venture to produce a low-cost laptop for education purposes has not come without opposition .
questioned need microsoft 's chairman , bill gates , has questioned the need for the linux-based laptop and doubted the suitability of negroponte 's olpc concept for the developing world .
the linux operating system is an example of free , open source software that enables users to create their own software content .
when you have both intel and microsoft on your case , you know you 're doing something right nicholas negroponte and chip-maker intel has developed a rival low-cost laptop aimed at schools with an education program designed for teachers rather than children .
intel had reportedly released marketing literature to governments which overtly criticised the olpc approach .
in may this year professor negroponte lambasted intel , saying it " should be ashamed of itself " for trying to undermine his efforts .
the $ 100 laptop is currently being developed with a processor made by amd , intel 's main competitor .
' yo-yo ' power chord nigerian school " if you can actually get a linux-based computer into every kid 's hands in the world it obviously undermines microsoft .
and obviously with an amd chip inside that computer it undermines intel , " explained mr rossetto .

professor negroponte welcomed intel 's decision to join forces , saying : " collaboration with intel means that the maximum number of laptops will reach children . "
' richest person ' " maybe it 's testimony to him , but it 's just amazing in the face of opposition from the richest person in the world with the most powerful software company and the most powerful and richest chip company , he is still able to prevail , " mr rossetto continued .
speaking at linuxworld boston last year , professor negroponte said : " when you have both intel and microsoft on your case , you know you 're doing something right . "
the laptop is being trialled in schools around the world and he has made it clear that his vision is not about the laptop itself .
" it 's as if people spent all their attention focusing on columbus 's boat and not on where he was going , " professor negroponte told the new york times .
" you have to remember that what this is about is education . "
mr rossetto commented : " i do n't think you can say definitively , butwhen intel caves in and ends up supporting nicholas , it 's pretty much clear that this is going to be the winning proposal . "
receiving praise from the ex-secretary general of the united nations , kofi annan , professor negroponte 's $ 100 laptop has attracted collaboration from some of the computer industry 's biggest players including amd , google and red hat .
the latest laptop model , the xo , is now in production , and with interest from several developing nations , including nigeria , uruguay , and libya , negroponte 's vision is slowly becoming realised .

as the founder and chairman of the one laptop per child -lrb- olpc -rrb- non-profit organisation , professor negroponte has worked to use computing as a means to bring education to the poorest regions of the world .
since 2005 the focus of professor negroponte 's project has been to develop an innovative laptop that will be distributed to children across the developing world and cost about $ 100 .
but founding pioneering initiatives is nothing new to the american computing guru .
he obtained two professional architecture degrees from the massachusetts institute of technology in the 1960s and then set up mit 's architecture machine group in 1968 .
in the 1980s he co-founded and directed the mit media laboratory , where much of the technology that enabled the " digital revolution " was developed , including wireless communication , and progressive approaches to how children learn .
professor ken morse , an mit colleague , has called him : " an indefatigable leader . "
" he was making grand predictions that seemed completely out in left field but as time has proven were absolutely accurate . "
louis rossetto , wired co-founder " he has done an amazing job of recruiting incredibly busy people , including me , to help him with his crusade to bridge the digital divide , " professor morse told the bbc news website .
aside from these achievements , professor negroponte has shown enthusiasm for investing in embryonic companies that have gone on to become household names .
communicate ideas these have included skype , and wired magazine , for which he wrote his own column - a platform to communicate his ideas on the evolution of technology .
his wired articles formed the basis of his 1995 best-seller being digital .
co-founder of wired , louis rossetto , told the bbc news website : " when we were together at wired it was remarkable because the man was always in motion .
he was dedicated , and driven , and i guess obsessed . "
" he was making grand predictions that seemed completely out in left field but as time has proven were absolutely accurate .
" he was talking about the switch from wired to wireless and that was back before there was much in the way of cell phones or anything else , " mr rossetto recalled .

jean-marie guehenno told the united nations security council that excessive demands from khartoum " would make it impossible for the mission to operate " .
among other demands , sudan wants advance notice of troop movements and to be able to shut down communications .
mr guehenno said the un would have to consider whether a deployment would be worthwhile under such conditions .
the 26,000-strong united nations and african union peacekeeping force , unamid , is due to take over protecting the people of darfur in a month 's time .
but sudanese objections and delays , mr guehenno said , threaten the success of the mission .
as examples of the khartoum government 's reluctance to facilitate the practical preparations for unamid , he said they were still awaiting : authorisation for non-african troops land for unamid bases authorisation for night flights .
' hard choices ' mr guehenno said it would be impossible to operate in darfur under such conditions .
the unamid force is due to start its mission in a month " should the anticipated discussions fail to clear the path to the deployment of an effective force , the international community will be confronted with hard choices , " mr guehenno said .
" do we move ahead with the deployment of a force that will not make a difference , that will not have the capability to defend itself , and that carries the risk of humiliation of the security council and the united nations , and tragic failure for the people of darfur ? "
mr guehenno added that sudan 's demands " create serious uncertainty with regard to the government 's commitment to the deployment of unamid . "
the sudanese ambassador responded by saying that the issues were only " administrative problems " which should not be exaggerated .
" the notion that sudan is impeding is absolutely not correct , " abdalmahmood abdalhaleem mohamad told the bbc .
" the way they are reacting to these small administrative and legal issues under discussion really gives us the impression that they are not sincere , " the ambassador said .
the unamid mission is aiming to bring security to the darfur region after more than four years of conflict .
but it has been plagued by problems , including a shortfall in resources and a lack of co-operation from both western and african states .

" the way they are reacting to these small administrative and legal issues under discussion really gives us the impression that they are not sincere , " the ambassador said .
the unamid mission is aiming to bring security to the darfur region after more than four years of conflict .
but it has been plagued by problems , including a shortfall in resources and a lack of co-operation from both western and african states .
