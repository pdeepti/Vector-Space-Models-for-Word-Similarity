but is it real ?
european catholics arrive in aachen this week to see a 2,000-year-old dress reputedly worn by mary when she gave birth to jesus .
christian relics continue to draw crowds , but for most people seeing is n't believing . the bones and belongings of holy people remain a big tourist draw in europe .
for most modern day pilgrims , whether the ancient christian relics are real or not is beside the point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's cathedral is a unesco world heritage site aachen expects 100,000 pilgrims and tourists during its 2007 pilgrimage , which started friday and goes until june 10 . among the visitors will be plenty of skeptics .
that 's okay , aachen 's roman catholic bishop heinrich mussinghoff said at the friday service to open the shrine containing the relics .
one does n't need to do pilgrimages or venerate relics to be a good catholic , he said . most modern day catholics emphasize relics ' importance as symbols rather than their belief in supernatural powers . mussinghoff likened relics to a family heirloom which is treasured for providing a link to the past .
relics " speak of the difference these people made , of what they accomplished for the future , of their thoughts , actions and beliefs which are still so valuable and precious today , " he said . avoiding su per stition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relics draw crowds but christian weisner , a spokesman for we are church , a group advocating for reform of the roman catholic church , said he sees relics as a form of superstition .

" we have to be careful not to become superstitious . " weisner does applaud some of the modern day activities that often go along with relics such as making pilgrimages , praying and meeting other believers , he said .
all those are important parts of the catholic faith , weisner said . " belief needs emotional things , " he said .

for many pilgrims , coming face to face with relics was the most terrifying and awesome experience of their lives . pilgrims to aachen faced some of the most important characters in christianity : jesus , his mother mary and john the baptist . as the center of charlemagne 's empire , aachen was europe 's most important pilgrimage destination during the middle ages after rome and santiago de compostela in spain .
charlemagne 's role in acquiring the relics in 799 is " only a legend , " said relic expert christof diedrichs , a researcher at the humboldt university in berlin . besides mary 's dress , aachen has three other major relics : jesus ' swaddling clothes , a cloth used during john the baptist 's beheading , and the waistcloth jesus wore during his crucifixion .
aachen has brought the relics out for a public viewing once every seven years since 1394 . what has been scientifically proven is that the textiles which make up the four aachen relics has been shown to date back to the first or second century after christ , diedrichs said . seeing is believing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this package contains cloth believed to be jesus ' swaddling clothes even during the middle ages , pilgrims mixed holiness with tourism .
today , people travel to see relics out of piety , curiosity , skepticism , or an interest in history . " all these different people come for all these different reasons , " said us sociologist william swatos , who published a book last year about pilgrimages and tourism .
" it 's a multilayered phenomenon . "
the supernatural has also regained popularity , swatos said . modern day pilgrims are willing to believe the bones of a saint really could be magical . " it 's all right once again to have feelings and to imagine the unimaginable , " said swatos , who is also the executive officer for the association for the sociology of religion .

but is it real ?
european catholics arrive in aachen this week to see a 2,000-year-old dress reputedly worn by mary when she gave birth to jesus .
christian relics continue to draw crowds , but for most people seeing is n't believing . the bones and belongings of holy people remain a big tourist draw in europe .
for most modern day pilgrims , whether the ancient christian relics are real or not is beside the point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's cathedral is a unesco world heritage site aachen expects 100,000 pilgrims and tourists during its 2007 pilgrimage , which started friday and goes until june 10 . among the visitors will be plenty of skeptics .
that 's okay , aachen 's roman catholic bishop heinrich mussinghoff said at the friday service to open the shrine containing the relics .
one does n't need to do pilgrimages or venerate relics to be a good catholic , he said . most modern day catholics emphasize relics ' importance as symbols rather than their belief in supernatural powers . mussinghoff likened relics to a family heirloom which is treasured for providing a link to the past .
relics " speak of the difference these people made , of what they accomplished for the future , of their thoughts , actions and beliefs which are still so valuable and precious today , " he said . avoiding su per stition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relics draw crowds but christian weisner , a spokesman for we are church , a group advocating for reform of the roman catholic church , said he sees relics as a form of superstition . " i have some reluctance about praying to relics or expecting healing from relics , " he said .
" we have to be careful not to become superstitious . " weisner does applaud some of the modern day activities that often go along with relics such as making pilgrimages , praying and meeting other believers , he said .
all those are important parts of the catholic faith , weisner said . " belief needs emotional things , " he said .
" at the same time we have to use our brain , we need reason . " a matter of faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen expects 100,000 pilgrims the popularity of relics surged during the middle ages and ended with the protestant reformation . during the middle ages , relics were thought to provide a direct link to the saint . going on pilgrimage provided a way to have sins forgiven and shorten the time in purgatory .
for many pilgrims , coming face to face with relics was the most terrifying and awesome experience of their lives . pilgrims to aachen faced some of the most important characters in christianity : jesus , his mother mary and john the baptist . as the center of charlemagne 's empire , aachen was europe 's most important pilgrimage destination during the middle ages after rome and santiago de compostela in spain .
charlemagne 's role in acquiring the relics in 799 is " only a legend , " said relic expert christof diedrichs , a researcher at the humboldt university in berlin . besides mary 's dress , aachen has three other major relics : jesus ' swaddling clothes , a cloth used during john the baptist 's beheading , and the waistcloth jesus wore during his crucifixion .
aachen has brought the relics out for a public viewing once every seven years since 1394 . what has been scientifically proven is that the textiles which make up the four aachen relics has been shown to date back to the first or second century after christ , diedrichs said . seeing is believing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this package contains cloth believed to be jesus ' swaddling clothes even during the middle ages , pilgrims mixed holiness with tourism .
today , people travel to see relics out of piety , curiosity , skepticism , or an interest in history . " all these different people come for all these different reasons , " said us sociologist william swatos , who published a book last year about pilgrimages and tourism .
" it 's a multilayered phenomenon . "
the supernatural has also regained popularity , swatos said . modern day pilgrims are willing to believe the bones of a saint really could be magical . " it 's all right once again to have feelings and to imagine the unimaginable , " said swatos , who is also the executive officer for the association for the sociology of religion .
" you can transcend the rationality of modernity .
the old can also become new and true again . "
going on pilgrimage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous germans , such as entertainer hape kerkeling , have gone on pilgrimage religious pilgrimages and tourism have increasingly become intertwined .
going on pilgrimage has become fashionable not only for the devout but for hikers and mystics . american actress shirley maclaine 's interest in new age spirituality led her to walk -lrb- and write a book about -rrb- the way of st. james -lrb- camino de santiago -rrb- in spain .
last year , hape kerkeling , a well-known german comedian and television personality , published a bestselling book about his 650-kilometer -lrb- 400-mile -rrb- spanish pilgrimage . according to media reports , kerkeling is digging out his hiking boots again this week .
he 'll walk with 3,550 school children to visit the relics in aachen . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aachen : history meets high-tech at the cradle of europe once the heart of charlemagne 's kingdom , aachen is now a center of technology and learning .

resistance german authorities are now questioning the safety of the transport arrangements and whether it is necessary . the 60,000 barrels of hexachlorobenzene will have to travel 16,000 kilometers -lrb- 9,940 miles -rrb- by train and ship before they go up in smoke in german incinerators . hexachlorobenzene or hcb is highly toxic , collecting up in fatty tissues and causing serious diseases .
even after it 's been incinerated , there are poisonous solid residues which still have to be dumped somewhere safe . markus friese , spokesman for the environment ministry in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where most of the waste will end up , said the australians should deal with their own rubbish . " australia is an industrial nation , " he said .
" it was able to produce this stuff , so we believe that australia should also be able to get rid of it . " but heinz struszczynski , spokesman for rzr herten , one of the plants which will be dealing with the hcb , said that is n't the case . " this waste is very special , " he said .
" it 's one of the so-called dirty dozen identified by the stockholm convention . " struszczynski added that this kind of waste can only be processed in special plants of high quality , and these plants can only be found in europe , and particularly in germany .
other waste , even toxic waste , can be dealt with in australian plants . making money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to make certain australia can not dispose of the waste itself according to the basle convention , toxic waste must be dealt with in the country of origin if it has the capacity to do so or if it is reasonable to expect that capacity to be provided .
if this is not the case , it can be exported .
officials plan a thorough check to see if there really are no suitable plants in australia , or if they ca n't be built . but dirk jansen of german friends of the earth said he feels the problem is ultimately a german one . " the main reason why north rhine-westphalia is an el dorado for toxic waste disposal in germany , with 600,000 tons a year imported , is that it 's an easy way of making money , " he said .
" in the eighties , the operators built up over-capacities which now have to be filled . " i ca n't believe it will remain a one-off , " he added .

but is it real ?
european catholics arrive in aachen this week to see a 2,000-year-old dress reputedly worn by mary when she gave birth to jesus .
christian relics continue to draw crowds , but for most people seeing is n't believing . the bones and belongings of holy people remain a big tourist draw in europe .
for most modern day pilgrims , whether the ancient christian relics are real or not is beside the point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's cathedral is a unesco world heritage site aachen expects 100,000 pilgrims and tourists during its 2007 pilgrimage , which started friday and goes until june 10 . among the visitors will be plenty of skeptics .
that 's okay , aachen 's roman catholic bishop heinrich mussinghoff said at the friday service to open the shrine containing the relics .
one does n't need to do pilgrimages or venerate relics to be a good catholic , he said . most modern day catholics emphasize relics ' importance as symbols rather than their belief in supernatural powers . mussinghoff likened relics to a family heirloom which is treasured for providing a link to the past .
relics " speak of the difference these people made , of what they accomplished for the future , of their thoughts , actions and beliefs which are still so valuable and precious today , " he said . avoiding su per stition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relics draw crowds but christian weisner , a spokesman for we are church , a group advocating for reform of the roman catholic church , said he sees relics as a form of superstition . " i have some reluctance about praying to relics or expecting healing from relics , " he said .
" we have to be careful not to become superstitious . " weisner does applaud some of the modern day activities that often go along with relics such as making pilgrimages , praying and meeting other believers , he said .
all those are important parts of the catholic faith , weisner said . " belief needs emotional things , " he said .
" at the same time we have to use our brain , we need reason . " a matter of faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen expects 100,000 pilgrims the popularity of relics surged during the middle ages and ended with the protestant reformation . during the middle ages , relics were thought to provide a direct link to the saint . going on pilgrimage provided a way to have sins forgiven and shorten the time in purgatory .
for many pilgrims , coming face to face with relics was the most terrifying and awesome experience of their lives . pilgrims to aachen faced some of the most important characters in christianity : jesus , his mother mary and john the baptist . as the center of charlemagne 's empire , aachen was europe 's most important pilgrimage destination during the middle ages after rome and santiago de compostela in spain .
charlemagne 's role in acquiring the relics in 799 is " only a legend , " said relic expert christof diedrichs , a researcher at the humboldt university in berlin . besides mary 's dress , aachen has three other major relics : jesus ' swaddling clothes , a cloth used during john the baptist 's beheading , and the waistcloth jesus wore during his crucifixion .
aachen has brought the relics out for a public viewing once every seven years since 1394 . what has been scientifically proven is that the textiles which make up the four aachen relics has been shown to date back to the first or second century after christ , diedrichs said . seeing is believing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this package contains cloth believed to be jesus ' swaddling clothes even during the middle ages , pilgrims mixed holiness with tourism .
today , people travel to see relics out of piety , curiosity , skepticism , or an interest in history . " all these different people come for all these different reasons , " said us sociologist william swatos , who published a book last year about pilgrimages and tourism .
" it 's a multilayered phenomenon . "
the supernatural has also regained popularity , swatos said . modern day pilgrims are willing to believe the bones of a saint really could be magical .

the piece , which was never intended for performance , is a combination of folk music , operas , operettas and classical tunes and tillion 's original texts and choreography .
staunchly against making any contribution to the nazi war effort , tillion was hidden by her fellow prisoners and wrote a large portion of the operetta 's 104-page manuscript from her hideout in a box .
" le verfügbar aux enfers " deals with the humiliation of daily life in a concentration camp , where tillion was brought in 1943 .
its title , which incorporates the german word " verfügbar " into the french , refers to the group of prisoners tillion was placed in by the nazis .
she and her fellow prisoners were n't given set jobs , rather they were dubbed " available " and assigned to any task their captives needed .
tillion celebrates 100 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tillion in june 2004 tillion , who turned 100 this week , had made a name for herself as an ethnologist and was conducting research in algeria when the war began .
she returned to occupied france in 1940 and joined the resistance movement shortly thereafter .
she was arrested by the nazis in 1942 and sent to ravensbrück the following year along with her mother , who later lost her life in a gas chamber .
after the war , tillion published numerous books and essays on the ravensbrück concentration camp and the resistance movement .
she has received multiple awards for her involvement in the resistance , including the federal cross of merit in both france and germany . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's best attended music festival plagued by cuts the most prestigious festival in communist east germany is still making do , despite severe budget cuts .

but is it real ?
european catholics arrive in aachen this week to see a 2,000-year-old dress reputedly worn by mary when she gave birth to jesus .
christian relics continue to draw crowds , but for most people seeing is n't believing . the bones and belongings of holy people remain a big tourist draw in europe .
for most modern day pilgrims , whether the ancient christian relics are real or not is beside the point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's cathedral is a unesco world heritage site aachen expects 100,000 pilgrims and tourists during its 2007 pilgrimage , which started friday and goes until june 10 . among the visitors will be plenty of skeptics .
that 's okay , aachen 's roman catholic bishop heinrich mussinghoff said at the friday service to open the shrine containing the relics .
one does n't need to do pilgrimages or venerate relics to be a good catholic , he said . most modern day catholics emphasize relics ' importance as symbols rather than their belief in supernatural powers . mussinghoff likened relics to a family heirloom which is treasured for providing a link to the past .
relics " speak of the difference these people made , of what they accomplished for the future , of their thoughts , actions and beliefs which are still so valuable and precious today , " he said . avoiding su per stition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relics draw crowds but christian weisner , a spokesman for we are church , a group advocating for reform of the roman catholic church , said he sees relics as a form of superstition . " i have some reluctance about praying to relics or expecting healing from relics , " he said .
" we have to be careful not to become superstitious . " weisner does applaud some of the modern day activities that often go along with relics such as making pilgrimages , praying and meeting other believers , he said .
all those are important parts of the catholic faith , weisner said . " belief needs emotional things , " he said .
" at the same time we have to use our brain , we need reason . " a matter of faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen expects 100,000 pilgrims the popularity of relics surged during the middle ages and ended with the protestant reformation . during the middle ages , relics were thought to provide a direct link to the saint . going on pilgrimage provided a way to have sins forgiven and shorten the time in purgatory .
for many pilgrims , coming face to face with relics was the most terrifying and awesome experience of their lives . pilgrims to aachen faced some of the most important characters in christianity : jesus , his mother mary and john the baptist . as the center of charlemagne 's empire , aachen was europe 's most important pilgrimage destination during the middle ages after rome and santiago de compostela in spain .
charlemagne 's role in acquiring the relics in 799 is " only a legend , " said relic expert christof diedrichs , a researcher at the humboldt university in berlin . besides mary 's dress , aachen has three other major relics : jesus ' swaddling clothes , a cloth used during john the baptist 's beheading , and the waistcloth jesus wore during his crucifixion .
aachen has brought the relics out for a public viewing once every seven years since 1394 . what has been scientifically proven is that the textiles which make up the four aachen relics has been shown to date back to the first or second century after christ , diedrichs said . seeing is believing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this package contains cloth believed to be jesus ' swaddling clothes even during the middle ages , pilgrims mixed holiness with tourism .
today , people travel to see relics out of piety , curiosity , skepticism , or an interest in history . " all these different people come for all these different reasons , " said us sociologist william swatos , who published a book last year about pilgrimages and tourism .
" it 's a multilayered phenomenon . "
the supernatural has also regained popularity , swatos said . modern day pilgrims are willing to believe the bones of a saint really could be magical . " it 's all right once again to have feelings and to imagine the unimaginable , " said swatos , who is also the executive officer for the association for the sociology of religion .
" you can transcend the rationality of modernity .
the old can also become new and true again . "
going on pilgrimage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous germans , such as entertainer hape kerkeling , have gone on pilgrimage religious pilgrimages and tourism have increasingly become intertwined .
going on pilgrimage has become fashionable not only for the devout but for hikers and mystics . american actress shirley maclaine 's interest in new age spirituality led her to walk -lrb- and write a book about -rrb- the way of st. james -lrb- camino de santiago -rrb- in spain .
last year , hape kerkeling , a well-known german comedian and television personality , published a bestselling book about his 650-kilometer -lrb- 400-mile -rrb- spanish pilgrimage . according to media reports , kerkeling is digging out his hiking boots again this week .

but is it real ?
european catholics arrive in aachen this week to see a 2,000-year-old dress reputedly worn by mary when she gave birth to jesus .
christian relics continue to draw crowds , but for most people seeing is n't believing . the bones and belongings of holy people remain a big tourist draw in europe .
for most modern day pilgrims , whether the ancient christian relics are real or not is beside the point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's cathedral is a unesco world heritage site aachen expects 100,000 pilgrims and tourists during its 2007 pilgrimage , which started friday and goes until june 10 . among the visitors will be plenty of skeptics .
that 's okay , aachen 's roman catholic bishop heinrich mussinghoff said at the friday service to open the shrine containing the relics .
one does n't need to do pilgrimages or venerate relics to be a good catholic , he said . most modern day catholics emphasize relics ' importance as symbols rather than their belief in supernatural powers . mussinghoff likened relics to a family heirloom which is treasured for providing a link to the past .
relics " speak of the difference these people made , of what they accomplished for the future , of their thoughts , actions and beliefs which are still so valuable and precious today , " he said . avoiding su per stition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relics draw crowds but christian weisner , a spokesman for we are church , a group advocating for reform of the roman catholic church , said he sees relics as a form of superstition . " i have some reluctance about praying to relics or expecting healing from relics , " he said .
" we have to be careful not to become superstitious . " weisner does applaud some of the modern day activities that often go along with relics such as making pilgrimages , praying and meeting other believers , he said .
all those are important parts of the catholic faith , weisner said . " belief needs emotional things , " he said .
" at the same time we have to use our brain , we need reason . " a matter of faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen expects 100,000 pilgrims the popularity of relics surged during the middle ages and ended with the protestant reformation . during the middle ages , relics were thought to provide a direct link to the saint . going on pilgrimage provided a way to have sins forgiven and shorten the time in purgatory .
for many pilgrims , coming face to face with relics was the most terrifying and awesome experience of their lives . pilgrims to aachen faced some of the most important characters in christianity : jesus , his mother mary and john the baptist . as the center of charlemagne 's empire , aachen was europe 's most important pilgrimage destination during the middle ages after rome and santiago de compostela in spain .
charlemagne 's role in acquiring the relics in 799 is " only a legend , " said relic expert christof diedrichs , a researcher at the humboldt university in berlin . besides mary 's dress , aachen has three other major relics : jesus ' swaddling clothes , a cloth used during john the baptist 's beheading , and the waistcloth jesus wore during his crucifixion .
aachen has brought the relics out for a public viewing once every seven years since 1394 . what has been scientifically proven is that the textiles which make up the four aachen relics has been shown to date back to the first or second century after christ , diedrichs said . seeing is believing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this package contains cloth believed to be jesus ' swaddling clothes even during the middle ages , pilgrims mixed holiness with tourism .
today , people travel to see relics out of piety , curiosity , skepticism , or an interest in history . " all these different people come for all these different reasons , " said us sociologist william swatos , who published a book last year about pilgrimages and tourism .
" it 's a multilayered phenomenon . "
the supernatural has also regained popularity , swatos said . modern day pilgrims are willing to believe the bones of a saint really could be magical . " it 's all right once again to have feelings and to imagine the unimaginable , " said swatos , who is also the executive officer for the association for the sociology of religion .
" you can transcend the rationality of modernity .
the old can also become new and true again . "
going on pilgrimage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous germans , such as entertainer hape kerkeling , have gone on pilgrimage religious pilgrimages and tourism have increasingly become intertwined .
going on pilgrimage has become fashionable not only for the devout but for hikers and mystics . american actress shirley maclaine 's interest in new age spirituality led her to walk -lrb- and write a book about -rrb- the way of st. james -lrb- camino de santiago -rrb- in spain .
last year , hape kerkeling , a well-known german comedian and television personality , published a bestselling book about his 650-kilometer -lrb- 400-mile -rrb- spanish pilgrimage . according to media reports , kerkeling is digging out his hiking boots again this week .

the piece , which was never intended for performance , is a combination of folk music , operas , operettas and classical tunes and tillion 's original texts and choreography .
staunchly against making any contribution to the nazi war effort , tillion was hidden by her fellow prisoners and wrote a large portion of the operetta 's 104-page manuscript from her hideout in a box .
" le verfügbar aux enfers " deals with the humiliation of daily life in a concentration camp , where tillion was brought in 1943 .
its title , which incorporates the german word " verfügbar " into the french , refers to the group of prisoners tillion was placed in by the nazis .
she and her fellow prisoners were n't given set jobs , rather they were dubbed " available " and assigned to any task their captives needed .

but is it real ?
european catholics arrive in aachen this week to see a 2,000-year-old dress reputedly worn by mary when she gave birth to jesus .
christian relics continue to draw crowds , but for most people seeing is n't believing . the bones and belongings of holy people remain a big tourist draw in europe .
for most modern day pilgrims , whether the ancient christian relics are real or not is beside the point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's cathedral is a unesco world heritage site aachen expects 100,000 pilgrims and tourists during its 2007 pilgrimage , which started friday and goes until june 10 . among the visitors will be plenty of skeptics .
that 's okay , aachen 's roman catholic bishop heinrich mussinghoff said at the friday service to open the shrine containing the relics .
one does n't need to do pilgrimages or venerate relics to be a good catholic , he said . most modern day catholics emphasize relics ' importance as symbols rather than their belief in supernatural powers . mussinghoff likened relics to a family heirloom which is treasured for providing a link to the past .
relics " speak of the difference these people made , of what they accomplished for the future , of their thoughts , actions and beliefs which are still so valuable and precious today , " he said . avoiding su per stition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relics draw crowds but christian weisner , a spokesman for we are church , a group advocating for reform of the roman catholic church , said he sees relics as a form of superstition . " i have some reluctance about praying to relics or expecting healing from relics , " he said .
" we have to be careful not to become superstitious . " weisner does applaud some of the modern day activities that often go along with relics such as making pilgrimages , praying and meeting other believers , he said .
all those are important parts of the catholic faith , weisner said . " belief needs emotional things , " he said .
" at the same time we have to use our brain , we need reason . " a matter of faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen expects 100,000 pilgrims the popularity of relics surged during the middle ages and ended with the protestant reformation . during the middle ages , relics were thought to provide a direct link to the saint . going on pilgrimage provided a way to have sins forgiven and shorten the time in purgatory .
for many pilgrims , coming face to face with relics was the most terrifying and awesome experience of their lives . pilgrims to aachen faced some of the most important characters in christianity : jesus , his mother mary and john the baptist . as the center of charlemagne 's empire , aachen was europe 's most important pilgrimage destination during the middle ages after rome and santiago de compostela in spain .
charlemagne 's role in acquiring the relics in 799 is " only a legend , " said relic expert christof diedrichs , a researcher at the humboldt university in berlin . besides mary 's dress , aachen has three other major relics : jesus ' swaddling clothes , a cloth used during john the baptist 's beheading , and the waistcloth jesus wore during his crucifixion .
aachen has brought the relics out for a public viewing once every seven years since 1394 . what has been scientifically proven is that the textiles which make up the four aachen relics has been shown to date back to the first or second century after christ , diedrichs said . seeing is believing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this package contains cloth believed to be jesus ' swaddling clothes even during the middle ages , pilgrims mixed holiness with tourism .
today , people travel to see relics out of piety , curiosity , skepticism , or an interest in history . " all these different people come for all these different reasons , " said us sociologist william swatos , who published a book last year about pilgrimages and tourism .
" it 's a multilayered phenomenon . "
the supernatural has also regained popularity , swatos said . modern day pilgrims are willing to believe the bones of a saint really could be magical . " it 's all right once again to have feelings and to imagine the unimaginable , " said swatos , who is also the executive officer for the association for the sociology of religion .
" you can transcend the rationality of modernity .
the old can also become new and true again . "
going on pilgrimage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous germans , such as entertainer hape kerkeling , have gone on pilgrimage religious pilgrimages and tourism have increasingly become intertwined .
going on pilgrimage has become fashionable not only for the devout but for hikers and mystics . american actress shirley maclaine 's interest in new age spirituality led her to walk -lrb- and write a book about -rrb- the way of st. james -lrb- camino de santiago -rrb- in spain .
last year , hape kerkeling , a well-known german comedian and television personality , published a bestselling book about his 650-kilometer -lrb- 400-mile -rrb- spanish pilgrimage . according to media reports , kerkeling is digging out his hiking boots again this week .

the piece , which was never intended for performance , is a combination of folk music , operas , operettas and classical tunes and tillion 's original texts and choreography .
staunchly against making any contribution to the nazi war effort , tillion was hidden by her fellow prisoners and wrote a large portion of the operetta 's 104-page manuscript from her hideout in a box .
" le verfügbar aux enfers " deals with the humiliation of daily life in a concentration camp , where tillion was brought in 1943 .
its title , which incorporates the german word " verfügbar " into the french , refers to the group of prisoners tillion was placed in by the nazis .
she and her fellow prisoners were n't given set jobs , rather they were dubbed " available " and assigned to any task their captives needed .
tillion celebrates 100 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tillion in june 2004 tillion , who turned 100 this week , had made a name for herself as an ethnologist and was conducting research in algeria when the war began .
she returned to occupied france in 1940 and joined the resistance movement shortly thereafter .
she was arrested by the nazis in 1942 and sent to ravensbrück the following year along with her mother , who later lost her life in a gas chamber .
after the war , tillion published numerous books and essays on the ravensbrück concentration camp and the resistance movement .
she has received multiple awards for her involvement in the resistance , including the federal cross of merit in both france and germany . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's best attended music festival plagued by cuts the most prestigious festival in communist east germany is still making do , despite severe budget cuts .

concretely this means reducing emissions by 20 to 30 percent of the 1990 levels by the year 2020 and then a further reduction in co2 emissions of 60 to 80 percent by 2050 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european environmentalists think bush is a problem why has the bush administration been so reluctant to reach binding climate agreements ?
is it just to protect the interests of american petroleum companies ? the policy of bush 's government has n't changed since he took office .
in 2000 , the bush administration took a reluctant position toward the kyoto protocol and especially toward the idea of accepting concrete targets for reducing admissions .
there are various reasons for this .
you mentioned one of them , but it 's difficult to get an overview , and i 'm not in a position to say .
but in general , the us is very skittish when it comes to accepting international legal obligations .
that 's true not only concerning kyoto , but also of the american stance toward human rights or the issue of iraq in the un security council .
there 's a general reluctance in the bush administration to let the government 's action be constrained by international law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with pelosi in the run-up to the summit ahead of the summit , german chancellor angela merkel and german enviromental minister sigmar gabriel have also been talking with other us politicians , chiefly the speaker of the house of representatives , nancy pelosi .
is that a realistic option ? i think it 's a very important strategy , if you look forward to what could happen in the us in 2009 after the presidential election .
if you believe the public-opinion polls the republicans are in a slump , and there 's a desire in the us for a change of government .
so it 's very important to meet with representatives of the people who have a very good chance of being elected in 2008 .
until the election , nothing much will change on the national level in the us .
but on the individual state level a lot is changing at the moment .
that 's important because american environmental policy is n't just made on the national level .
it also happens at the state , regional and local levels .
so it 's important to have a many-pronged strategy . is it possible to negotiate an agreement in advance with politicians who may assume control after 2008 ? in terms of international law , that would be impossible .
the national government is responsible for negotiating agreements , which then have to be approved by congress .
you might be able to get a majority in congress , but even there i 'm sceptical .
but the actual negotiations have to be done by the bush administration , and i do n't expect any great changes between now and the end of next year .
maybe we can take some small steps , but the question remains what bush wants to achieve with his second term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecologic is a policy institute that advises the eu on environmental issues what do you expect per sonally form the g8 summit ?
will there just be more talk , or will something substantial emerge ? i 'm not directly involved in the negotiations so i do n't know .
most of the deals will be reached in advance , and what 's coming out in the german media makes me skeptical .
i do n't think we will see concrete reduction goals or a binding statement coming out of heiligendamm - at least not in the form of a declaration signed by all eight countries .
but what could happen is that we got a positive input in line with previous agreements like kyoto .
for instance , we need a mandate to negotiate a second phase of kyoto , and there could be positive language for that coming out of heiligendamm . jefferson chase interviewed nils meyer-ohlendorf send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu chief slams bush 's climate plans , predicts failure at g8 european commission president jose manuel barroso has sharply criticized plans outlined by us president george w bush to cut greenhouse gas emissions , saying the united states needs to set more ambitious goals .

nils meyer-ohlendorf , a senior fellow at an environmental policy think tank in berlin , talked to dw-world.de about the prospects . dw-world.de : what concretely is germany looking for from the us at the g8 summit ? nils meyer-ohlendorf : germany is n't looking for anything on its own , but rather as the chair of eu council and president of the eu .
germany wants the environmental goals that the eu has set itself implemented internationally .
concretely this means reducing emissions by 20 to 30 percent of the 1990 levels by the year 2020 and then a further reduction in co2 emissions of 60 to 80 percent by 2050 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european environmentalists think bush is a problem why has the bush administration been so reluctant to reach binding climate agreements ?
is it just to protect the interests of american petroleum companies ? the policy of bush 's government has n't changed since he took office .
in 2000 , the bush administration took a reluctant position toward the kyoto protocol and especially toward the idea of accepting concrete targets for reducing admissions .
there are various reasons for this .
you mentioned one of them , but it 's difficult to get an overview , and i 'm not in a position to say .
but in general , the us is very skittish when it comes to accepting international legal obligations .
that 's true not only concerning kyoto , but also of the american stance toward human rights or the issue of iraq in the un security council .
there 's a general reluctance in the bush administration to let the government 's action be constrained by international law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with pelosi in the run-up to the summit ahead of the summit , german chancellor angela merkel and german enviromental minister sigmar gabriel have also been talking with other us politicians , chiefly the speaker of the house of representatives , nancy pelosi .
is that a realistic option ? i think it 's a very important strategy , if you look forward to what could happen in the us in 2009 after the presidential election .
if you believe the public-opinion polls the republicans are in a slump , and there 's a desire in the us for a change of government .
so it 's very important to meet with representatives of the people who have a very good chance of being elected in 2008 .
until the election , nothing much will change on the national level in the us .
but on the individual state level a lot is changing at the moment .
that 's important because american environmental policy is n't just made on the national level .
it also happens at the state , regional and local levels .
so it 's important to have a many-pronged strategy . is it possible to negotiate an agreement in advance with politicians who may assume control after 2008 ? in terms of international law , that would be impossible .
the national government is responsible for negotiating agreements , which then have to be approved by congress .
you might be able to get a majority in congress , but even there i 'm sceptical .
but the actual negotiations have to be done by the bush administration , and i do n't expect any great changes between now and the end of next year .
maybe we can take some small steps , but the question remains what bush wants to achieve with his second term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecologic is a policy institute that advises the eu on environmental issues what do you expect per sonally form the g8 summit ?

european catholics arrive in aachen this week to see a 2,000-year-old dress reputedly worn by mary when she gave birth to jesus .
christian relics continue to draw crowds , but for most people seeing is n't believing . the bones and belongings of holy people remain a big tourist draw in europe .

one does n't need to do pilgrimages or venerate relics to be a good catholic , he said . most modern day catholics emphasize relics ' importance as symbols rather than their belief in supernatural powers . mussinghoff likened relics to a family heirloom which is treasured for providing a link to the past .

the piece , which was never intended for performance , is a combination of folk music , operas , operettas and classical tunes and tillion 's original texts and choreography .
staunchly against making any contribution to the nazi war effort , tillion was hidden by her fellow prisoners and wrote a large portion of the operetta 's 104-page manuscript from her hideout in a box .
" le verfügbar aux enfers " deals with the humiliation of daily life in a concentration camp , where tillion was brought in 1943 .
its title , which incorporates the german word " verfügbar " into the french , refers to the group of prisoners tillion was placed in by the nazis .
she and her fellow prisoners were n't given set jobs , rather they were dubbed " available " and assigned to any task their captives needed .
tillion celebrates 100 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tillion in june 2004 tillion , who turned 100 this week , had made a name for herself as an ethnologist and was conducting research in algeria when the war began .
she returned to occupied france in 1940 and joined the resistance movement shortly thereafter .
she was arrested by the nazis in 1942 and sent to ravensbrück the following year along with her mother , who later lost her life in a gas chamber .
after the war , tillion published numerous books and essays on the ravensbrück concentration camp and the resistance movement .

but is it real ?
european catholics arrive in aachen this week to see a 2,000-year-old dress reputedly worn by mary when she gave birth to jesus .
christian relics continue to draw crowds , but for most people seeing is n't believing . the bones and belongings of holy people remain a big tourist draw in europe .
for most modern day pilgrims , whether the ancient christian relics are real or not is beside the point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's cathedral is a unesco world heritage site aachen expects 100,000 pilgrims and tourists during its 2007 pilgrimage , which started friday and goes until june 10 . among the visitors will be plenty of skeptics .
that 's okay , aachen 's roman catholic bishop heinrich mussinghoff said at the friday service to open the shrine containing the relics .
one does n't need to do pilgrimages or venerate relics to be a good catholic , he said . most modern day catholics emphasize relics ' importance as symbols rather than their belief in supernatural powers . mussinghoff likened relics to a family heirloom which is treasured for providing a link to the past .
relics " speak of the difference these people made , of what they accomplished for the future , of their thoughts , actions and beliefs which are still so valuable and precious today , " he said . avoiding su per stition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relics draw crowds but christian weisner , a spokesman for we are church , a group advocating for reform of the roman catholic church , said he sees relics as a form of superstition . " i have some reluctance about praying to relics or expecting healing from relics , " he said .
" we have to be careful not to become superstitious . " weisner does applaud some of the modern day activities that often go along with relics such as making pilgrimages , praying and meeting other believers , he said .
all those are important parts of the catholic faith , weisner said . " belief needs emotional things , " he said .
" at the same time we have to use our brain , we need reason . " a matter of faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen expects 100,000 pilgrims the popularity of relics surged during the middle ages and ended with the protestant reformation . during the middle ages , relics were thought to provide a direct link to the saint . going on pilgrimage provided a way to have sins forgiven and shorten the time in purgatory .
for many pilgrims , coming face to face with relics was the most terrifying and awesome experience of their lives . pilgrims to aachen faced some of the most important characters in christianity : jesus , his mother mary and john the baptist . as the center of charlemagne 's empire , aachen was europe 's most important pilgrimage destination during the middle ages after rome and santiago de compostela in spain .
charlemagne 's role in acquiring the relics in 799 is " only a legend , " said relic expert christof diedrichs , a researcher at the humboldt university in berlin . besides mary 's dress , aachen has three other major relics : jesus ' swaddling clothes , a cloth used during john the baptist 's beheading , and the waistcloth jesus wore during his crucifixion .
aachen has brought the relics out for a public viewing once every seven years since 1394 . what has been scientifically proven is that the textiles which make up the four aachen relics has been shown to date back to the first or second century after christ , diedrichs said . seeing is believing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this package contains cloth believed to be jesus ' swaddling clothes even during the middle ages , pilgrims mixed holiness with tourism .
today , people travel to see relics out of piety , curiosity , skepticism , or an interest in history . " all these different people come for all these different reasons , " said us sociologist william swatos , who published a book last year about pilgrimages and tourism .
" it 's a multilayered phenomenon . "
the supernatural has also regained popularity , swatos said . modern day pilgrims are willing to believe the bones of a saint really could be magical . " it 's all right once again to have feelings and to imagine the unimaginable , " said swatos , who is also the executive officer for the association for the sociology of religion .
" you can transcend the rationality of modernity .
the old can also become new and true again . "
going on pilgrimage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous germans , such as entertainer hape kerkeling , have gone on pilgrimage religious pilgrimages and tourism have increasingly become intertwined .
going on pilgrimage has become fashionable not only for the devout but for hikers and mystics . american actress shirley maclaine 's interest in new age spirituality led her to walk -lrb- and write a book about -rrb- the way of st. james -lrb- camino de santiago -rrb- in spain .
last year , hape kerkeling , a well-known german comedian and television personality , published a bestselling book about his 650-kilometer -lrb- 400-mile -rrb- spanish pilgrimage . according to media reports , kerkeling is digging out his hiking boots again this week .

the piece , which was never intended for performance , is a combination of folk music , operas , operettas and classical tunes and tillion 's original texts and choreography .
staunchly against making any contribution to the nazi war effort , tillion was hidden by her fellow prisoners and wrote a large portion of the operetta 's 104-page manuscript from her hideout in a box .
" le verfügbar aux enfers " deals with the humiliation of daily life in a concentration camp , where tillion was brought in 1943 .
its title , which incorporates the german word " verfügbar " into the french , refers to the group of prisoners tillion was placed in by the nazis .
she and her fellow prisoners were n't given set jobs , rather they were dubbed " available " and assigned to any task their captives needed .
tillion celebrates 100 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tillion in june 2004 tillion , who turned 100 this week , had made a name for herself as an ethnologist and was conducting research in algeria when the war began .
she returned to occupied france in 1940 and joined the resistance movement shortly thereafter .
she was arrested by the nazis in 1942 and sent to ravensbrück the following year along with her mother , who later lost her life in a gas chamber .
after the war , tillion published numerous books and essays on the ravensbrück concentration camp and the resistance movement .
she has received multiple awards for her involvement in the resistance , including the federal cross of merit in both france and germany . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's best attended music festival plagued by cuts the most prestigious festival in communist east germany is still making do , despite severe budget cuts .

european catholics arrive in aachen this week to see a 2,000-year-old dress reputedly worn by mary when she gave birth to jesus .

nils meyer-ohlendorf , a senior fellow at an environmental policy think tank in berlin , talked to dw-world.de about the prospects . dw-world.de : what concretely is germany looking for from the us at the g8 summit ? nils meyer-ohlendorf : germany is n't looking for anything on its own , but rather as the chair of eu council and president of the eu .
germany wants the environmental goals that the eu has set itself implemented internationally .
concretely this means reducing emissions by 20 to 30 percent of the 1990 levels by the year 2020 and then a further reduction in co2 emissions of 60 to 80 percent by 2050 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european environmentalists think bush is a problem why has the bush administration been so reluctant to reach binding climate agreements ?
is it just to protect the interests of american petroleum companies ? the policy of bush 's government has n't changed since he took office .
in 2000 , the bush administration took a reluctant position toward the kyoto protocol and especially toward the idea of accepting concrete targets for reducing admissions .
there are various reasons for this .
you mentioned one of them , but it 's difficult to get an overview , and i 'm not in a position to say .
but in general , the us is very skittish when it comes to accepting international legal obligations .
that 's true not only concerning kyoto , but also of the american stance toward human rights or the issue of iraq in the un security council .
there 's a general reluctance in the bush administration to let the government 's action be constrained by international law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with pelosi in the run-up to the summit ahead of the summit , german chancellor angela merkel and german enviromental minister sigmar gabriel have also been talking with other us politicians , chiefly the speaker of the house of representatives , nancy pelosi .
is that a realistic option ? i think it 's a very important strategy , if you look forward to what could happen in the us in 2009 after the presidential election .
if you believe the public-opinion polls the republicans are in a slump , and there 's a desire in the us for a change of government .
so it 's very important to meet with representatives of the people who have a very good chance of being elected in 2008 .
until the election , nothing much will change on the national level in the us .
but on the individual state level a lot is changing at the moment .
that 's important because american environmental policy is n't just made on the national level .
it also happens at the state , regional and local levels .
so it 's important to have a many-pronged strategy . is it possible to negotiate an agreement in advance with politicians who may assume control after 2008 ? in terms of international law , that would be impossible .
the national government is responsible for negotiating agreements , which then have to be approved by congress .
you might be able to get a majority in congress , but even there i 'm sceptical .
but the actual negotiations have to be done by the bush administration , and i do n't expect any great changes between now and the end of next year .
maybe we can take some small steps , but the question remains what bush wants to achieve with his second term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecologic is a policy institute that advises the eu on environmental issues what do you expect per sonally form the g8 summit ?
will there just be more talk , or will something substantial emerge ? i 'm not directly involved in the negotiations so i do n't know .
most of the deals will be reached in advance , and what 's coming out in the german media makes me skeptical .
i do n't think we will see concrete reduction goals or a binding statement coming out of heiligendamm - at least not in the form of a declaration signed by all eight countries .
but what could happen is that we got a positive input in line with previous agreements like kyoto .
for instance , we need a mandate to negotiate a second phase of kyoto , and there could be positive language for that coming out of heiligendamm . jefferson chase interviewed nils meyer-ohlendorf send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu chief slams bush 's climate plans , predicts failure at g8 european commission president jose manuel barroso has sharply criticized plans outlined by us president george w bush to cut greenhouse gas emissions , saying the united states needs to set more ambitious goals .

the piece , which was never intended for performance , is a combination of folk music , operas , operettas and classical tunes and tillion 's original texts and choreography .
staunchly against making any contribution to the nazi war effort , tillion was hidden by her fellow prisoners and wrote a large portion of the operetta 's 104-page manuscript from her hideout in a box .
" le verfügbar aux enfers " deals with the humiliation of daily life in a concentration camp , where tillion was brought in 1943 .
its title , which incorporates the german word " verfügbar " into the french , refers to the group of prisoners tillion was placed in by the nazis .

the piece , which was never intended for performance , is a combination of folk music , operas , operettas and classical tunes and tillion 's original texts and choreography .
staunchly against making any contribution to the nazi war effort , tillion was hidden by her fellow prisoners and wrote a large portion of the operetta 's 104-page manuscript from her hideout in a box .
" le verfügbar aux enfers " deals with the humiliation of daily life in a concentration camp , where tillion was brought in 1943 .
its title , which incorporates the german word " verfügbar " into the french , refers to the group of prisoners tillion was placed in by the nazis .
she and her fellow prisoners were n't given set jobs , rather they were dubbed " available " and assigned to any task their captives needed .
tillion celebrates 100 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tillion in june 2004 tillion , who turned 100 this week , had made a name for herself as an ethnologist and was conducting research in algeria when the war began .
she returned to occupied france in 1940 and joined the resistance movement shortly thereafter .
she was arrested by the nazis in 1942 and sent to ravensbrück the following year along with her mother , who later lost her life in a gas chamber .
after the war , tillion published numerous books and essays on the ravensbrück concentration camp and the resistance movement .
she has received multiple awards for her involvement in the resistance , including the federal cross of merit in both france and germany . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's best attended music festival plagued by cuts the most prestigious festival in communist east germany is still making do , despite severe budget cuts .

but is it real ?
european catholics arrive in aachen this week to see a 2,000-year-old dress reputedly worn by mary when she gave birth to jesus .
christian relics continue to draw crowds , but for most people seeing is n't believing . the bones and belongings of holy people remain a big tourist draw in europe .
for most modern day pilgrims , whether the ancient christian relics are real or not is beside the point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's cathedral is a unesco world heritage site aachen expects 100,000 pilgrims and tourists during its 2007 pilgrimage , which started friday and goes until june 10 . among the visitors will be plenty of skeptics .
that 's okay , aachen 's roman catholic bishop heinrich mussinghoff said at the friday service to open the shrine containing the relics .
one does n't need to do pilgrimages or venerate relics to be a good catholic , he said . most modern day catholics emphasize relics ' importance as symbols rather than their belief in supernatural powers . mussinghoff likened relics to a family heirloom which is treasured for providing a link to the past .
relics " speak of the difference these people made , of what they accomplished for the future , of their thoughts , actions and beliefs which are still so valuable and precious today , " he said . avoiding su per stition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relics draw crowds but christian weisner , a spokesman for we are church , a group advocating for reform of the roman catholic church , said he sees relics as a form of superstition . " i have some reluctance about praying to relics or expecting healing from relics , " he said .
" we have to be careful not to become superstitious . " weisner does applaud some of the modern day activities that often go along with relics such as making pilgrimages , praying and meeting other believers , he said .
all those are important parts of the catholic faith , weisner said . " belief needs emotional things , " he said .
" at the same time we have to use our brain , we need reason . " a matter of faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen expects 100,000 pilgrims the popularity of relics surged during the middle ages and ended with the protestant reformation . during the middle ages , relics were thought to provide a direct link to the saint . going on pilgrimage provided a way to have sins forgiven and shorten the time in purgatory .
for many pilgrims , coming face to face with relics was the most terrifying and awesome experience of their lives . pilgrims to aachen faced some of the most important characters in christianity : jesus , his mother mary and john the baptist . as the center of charlemagne 's empire , aachen was europe 's most important pilgrimage destination during the middle ages after rome and santiago de compostela in spain .
charlemagne 's role in acquiring the relics in 799 is " only a legend , " said relic expert christof diedrichs , a researcher at the humboldt university in berlin . besides mary 's dress , aachen has three other major relics : jesus ' swaddling clothes , a cloth used during john the baptist 's beheading , and the waistcloth jesus wore during his crucifixion .
aachen has brought the relics out for a public viewing once every seven years since 1394 . what has been scientifically proven is that the textiles which make up the four aachen relics has been shown to date back to the first or second century after christ , diedrichs said . seeing is believing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this package contains cloth believed to be jesus ' swaddling clothes even during the middle ages , pilgrims mixed holiness with tourism .
today , people travel to see relics out of piety , curiosity , skepticism , or an interest in history . " all these different people come for all these different reasons , " said us sociologist william swatos , who published a book last year about pilgrimages and tourism .
" it 's a multilayered phenomenon . "
the supernatural has also regained popularity , swatos said . modern day pilgrims are willing to believe the bones of a saint really could be magical . " it 's all right once again to have feelings and to imagine the unimaginable , " said swatos , who is also the executive officer for the association for the sociology of religion .
" you can transcend the rationality of modernity .
the old can also become new and true again . "
going on pilgrimage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous germans , such as entertainer hape kerkeling , have gone on pilgrimage religious pilgrimages and tourism have increasingly become intertwined .
going on pilgrimage has become fashionable not only for the devout but for hikers and mystics . american actress shirley maclaine 's interest in new age spirituality led her to walk -lrb- and write a book about -rrb- the way of st. james -lrb- camino de santiago -rrb- in spain .
last year , hape kerkeling , a well-known german comedian and television personality , published a bestselling book about his 650-kilometer -lrb- 400-mile -rrb- spanish pilgrimage . according to media reports , kerkeling is digging out his hiking boots again this week .

nils meyer-ohlendorf , a senior fellow at an environmental policy think tank in berlin , talked to dw-world.de about the prospects . dw-world.de : what concretely is germany looking for from the us at the g8 summit ? nils meyer-ohlendorf : germany is n't looking for anything on its own , but rather as the chair of eu council and president of the eu .
germany wants the environmental goals that the eu has set itself implemented internationally .
concretely this means reducing emissions by 20 to 30 percent of the 1990 levels by the year 2020 and then a further reduction in co2 emissions of 60 to 80 percent by 2050 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european environmentalists think bush is a problem why has the bush administration been so reluctant to reach binding climate agreements ?
is it just to protect the interests of american petroleum companies ? the policy of bush 's government has n't changed since he took office .
in 2000 , the bush administration took a reluctant position toward the kyoto protocol and especially toward the idea of accepting concrete targets for reducing admissions .
there are various reasons for this .
you mentioned one of them , but it 's difficult to get an overview , and i 'm not in a position to say .
but in general , the us is very skittish when it comes to accepting international legal obligations .
that 's true not only concerning kyoto , but also of the american stance toward human rights or the issue of iraq in the un security council .
there 's a general reluctance in the bush administration to let the government 's action be constrained by international law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with pelosi in the run-up to the summit ahead of the summit , german chancellor angela merkel and german enviromental minister sigmar gabriel have also been talking with other us politicians , chiefly the speaker of the house of representatives , nancy pelosi .
is that a realistic option ? i think it 's a very important strategy , if you look forward to what could happen in the us in 2009 after the presidential election .
if you believe the public-opinion polls the republicans are in a slump , and there 's a desire in the us for a change of government .
so it 's very important to meet with representatives of the people who have a very good chance of being elected in 2008 .
until the election , nothing much will change on the national level in the us .
but on the individual state level a lot is changing at the moment .
that 's important because american environmental policy is n't just made on the national level .
it also happens at the state , regional and local levels .
so it 's important to have a many-pronged strategy . is it possible to negotiate an agreement in advance with politicians who may assume control after 2008 ? in terms of international law , that would be impossible .
the national government is responsible for negotiating agreements , which then have to be approved by congress .
you might be able to get a majority in congress , but even there i 'm sceptical .
but the actual negotiations have to be done by the bush administration , and i do n't expect any great changes between now and the end of next year .
maybe we can take some small steps , but the question remains what bush wants to achieve with his second term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecologic is a policy institute that advises the eu on environmental issues what do you expect per sonally form the g8 summit ?
will there just be more talk , or will something substantial emerge ? i 'm not directly involved in the negotiations so i do n't know .
most of the deals will be reached in advance , and what 's coming out in the german media makes me skeptical .
i do n't think we will see concrete reduction goals or a binding statement coming out of heiligendamm - at least not in the form of a declaration signed by all eight countries .
but what could happen is that we got a positive input in line with previous agreements like kyoto .
for instance , we need a mandate to negotiate a second phase of kyoto , and there could be positive language for that coming out of heiligendamm . jefferson chase interviewed nils meyer-ohlendorf send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu chief slams bush 's climate plans , predicts failure at g8 european commission president jose manuel barroso has sharply criticized plans outlined by us president george w bush to cut greenhouse gas emissions , saying the united states needs to set more ambitious goals .

charlemagne 's role in acquiring the relics in 799 is " only a legend , " said relic expert christof diedrichs , a researcher at the humboldt university in berlin . besides mary 's dress , aachen has three other major relics : jesus ' swaddling clothes , a cloth used during john the baptist 's beheading , and the waistcloth jesus wore during his crucifixion .
aachen has brought the relics out for a public viewing once every seven years since 1394 . what has been scientifically proven is that the textiles which make up the four aachen relics has been shown to date back to the first or second century after christ , diedrichs said . seeing is believing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this package contains cloth believed to be jesus ' swaddling clothes even during the middle ages , pilgrims mixed holiness with tourism .
today , people travel to see relics out of piety , curiosity , skepticism , or an interest in history . " all these different people come for all these different reasons , " said us sociologist william swatos , who published a book last year about pilgrimages and tourism .
" it 's a multilayered phenomenon . "
the supernatural has also regained popularity , swatos said . modern day pilgrims are willing to believe the bones of a saint really could be magical . " it 's all right once again to have feelings and to imagine the unimaginable , " said swatos , who is also the executive officer for the association for the sociology of religion .
" you can transcend the rationality of modernity .
the old can also become new and true again . "
going on pilgrimage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous germans , such as entertainer hape kerkeling , have gone on pilgrimage religious pilgrimages and tourism have increasingly become intertwined .
going on pilgrimage has become fashionable not only for the devout but for hikers and mystics . american actress shirley maclaine 's interest in new age spirituality led her to walk -lrb- and write a book about -rrb- the way of st. james -lrb- camino de santiago -rrb- in spain .

nils meyer-ohlendorf , a senior fellow at an environmental policy think tank in berlin , talked to dw-world.de about the prospects . dw-world.de : what concretely is germany looking for from the us at the g8 summit ? nils meyer-ohlendorf : germany is n't looking for anything on its own , but rather as the chair of eu council and president of the eu .
germany wants the environmental goals that the eu has set itself implemented internationally .
concretely this means reducing emissions by 20 to 30 percent of the 1990 levels by the year 2020 and then a further reduction in co2 emissions of 60 to 80 percent by 2050 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european environmentalists think bush is a problem why has the bush administration been so reluctant to reach binding climate agreements ?
is it just to protect the interests of american petroleum companies ? the policy of bush 's government has n't changed since he took office .
in 2000 , the bush administration took a reluctant position toward the kyoto protocol and especially toward the idea of accepting concrete targets for reducing admissions .
there are various reasons for this .
you mentioned one of them , but it 's difficult to get an overview , and i 'm not in a position to say .
but in general , the us is very skittish when it comes to accepting international legal obligations .
that 's true not only concerning kyoto , but also of the american stance toward human rights or the issue of iraq in the un security council .
there 's a general reluctance in the bush administration to let the government 's action be constrained by international law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with pelosi in the run-up to the summit ahead of the summit , german chancellor angela merkel and german enviromental minister sigmar gabriel have also been talking with other us politicians , chiefly the speaker of the house of representatives , nancy pelosi .
is that a realistic option ? i think it 's a very important strategy , if you look forward to what could happen in the us in 2009 after the presidential election .
if you believe the public-opinion polls the republicans are in a slump , and there 's a desire in the us for a change of government .
so it 's very important to meet with representatives of the people who have a very good chance of being elected in 2008 .
until the election , nothing much will change on the national level in the us .
but on the individual state level a lot is changing at the moment .
that 's important because american environmental policy is n't just made on the national level .
it also happens at the state , regional and local levels .
so it 's important to have a many-pronged strategy . is it possible to negotiate an agreement in advance with politicians who may assume control after 2008 ? in terms of international law , that would be impossible .
the national government is responsible for negotiating agreements , which then have to be approved by congress .
you might be able to get a majority in congress , but even there i 'm sceptical .
but the actual negotiations have to be done by the bush administration , and i do n't expect any great changes between now and the end of next year .
maybe we can take some small steps , but the question remains what bush wants to achieve with his second term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecologic is a policy institute that advises the eu on environmental issues what do you expect per sonally form the g8 summit ?
will there just be more talk , or will something substantial emerge ? i 'm not directly involved in the negotiations so i do n't know .
most of the deals will be reached in advance , and what 's coming out in the german media makes me skeptical .
i do n't think we will see concrete reduction goals or a binding statement coming out of heiligendamm - at least not in the form of a declaration signed by all eight countries .
but what could happen is that we got a positive input in line with previous agreements like kyoto .
for instance , we need a mandate to negotiate a second phase of kyoto , and there could be positive language for that coming out of heiligendamm . jefferson chase interviewed nils meyer-ohlendorf send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu chief slams bush 's climate plans , predicts failure at g8 european commission president jose manuel barroso has sharply criticized plans outlined by us president george w bush to cut greenhouse gas emissions , saying the united states needs to set more ambitious goals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 02.06.2007 " the us is skittish about accepting international obligations " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has resisted mandatory emissions reductions germany wants the us to agree to environmental targets at the g8 summit in heiligendamm .
nils meyer-ohlendorf , a senior fellow at an environmental policy think tank in berlin , talked to dw-world.de about the prospects . dw-world.de : what concretely is germany looking for from the us at the g8 summit ? nils meyer-ohlendorf : germany is n't looking for anything on its own , but rather as the chair of eu council and president of the eu .
germany wants the environmental goals that the eu has set itself implemented internationally .
concretely this means reducing emissions by 20 to 30 percent of the 1990 levels by the year 2020 and then a further reduction in co2 emissions of 60 to 80 percent by 2050 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european environmentalists think bush is a problem why has the bush administration been so reluctant to reach binding climate agreements ?
is it just to protect the interests of american petroleum companies ? the policy of bush 's government has n't changed since he took office .
in 2000 , the bush administration took a reluctant position toward the kyoto protocol and especially toward the idea of accepting concrete targets for reducing admissions .
there are various reasons for this .
you mentioned one of them , but it 's difficult to get an overview , and i 'm not in a position to say .
but in general , the us is very skittish when it comes to accepting international legal obligations .
that 's true not only concerning kyoto , but also of the american stance toward human rights or the issue of iraq in the un security council .
there 's a general reluctance in the bush administration to let the government 's action be constrained by international law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with pelosi in the run-up to the summit ahead of the summit , german chancellor angela merkel and german enviromental minister sigmar gabriel have also been talking with other us politicians , chiefly the speaker of the house of representatives , nancy pelosi .
is that a realistic option ? i think it 's a very important strategy , if you look forward to what could happen in the us in 2009 after the presidential election .
if you believe the public-opinion polls the republicans are in a slump , and there 's a desire in the us for a change of government .
so it 's very important to meet with representatives of the people who have a very good chance of being elected in 2008 .
until the election , nothing much will change on the national level in the us .
but on the individual state level a lot is changing at the moment .
that 's important because american environmental policy is n't just made on the national level .
it also happens at the state , regional and local levels .
so it 's important to have a many-pronged strategy . is it possible to negotiate an agreement in advance with politicians who may assume control after 2008 ? in terms of international law , that would be impossible .
the national government is responsible for negotiating agreements , which then have to be approved by congress .
you might be able to get a majority in congress , but even there i 'm sceptical .
but the actual negotiations have to be done by the bush administration , and i do n't expect any great changes between now and the end of next year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 02.06.2007 " the us is skittish about accepting international obligations " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has resisted mandatory emissions reductions germany wants the us to agree to environmental targets at the g8 summit in heiligendamm .
nils meyer-ohlendorf , a senior fellow at an environmental policy think tank in berlin , talked to dw-world.de about the prospects . dw-world.de : what concretely is germany looking for from the us at the g8 summit ? nils meyer-ohlendorf : germany is n't looking for anything on its own , but rather as the chair of eu council and president of the eu .
germany wants the environmental goals that the eu has set itself implemented internationally .
concretely this means reducing emissions by 20 to 30 percent of the 1990 levels by the year 2020 and then a further reduction in co2 emissions of 60 to 80 percent by 2050 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european environmentalists think bush is a problem why has the bush administration been so reluctant to reach binding climate agreements ?
is it just to protect the interests of american petroleum companies ? the policy of bush 's government has n't changed since he took office .
in 2000 , the bush administration took a reluctant position toward the kyoto protocol and especially toward the idea of accepting concrete targets for reducing admissions .
there are various reasons for this .
you mentioned one of them , but it 's difficult to get an overview , and i 'm not in a position to say .
but in general , the us is very skittish when it comes to accepting international legal obligations .
that 's true not only concerning kyoto , but also of the american stance toward human rights or the issue of iraq in the un security council .
there 's a general reluctance in the bush administration to let the government 's action be constrained by international law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with pelosi in the run-up to the summit ahead of the summit , german chancellor angela merkel and german enviromental minister sigmar gabriel have also been talking with other us politicians , chiefly the speaker of the house of representatives , nancy pelosi .
is that a realistic option ? i think it 's a very important strategy , if you look forward to what could happen in the us in 2009 after the presidential election .
if you believe the public-opinion polls the republicans are in a slump , and there 's a desire in the us for a change of government .
so it 's very important to meet with representatives of the people who have a very good chance of being elected in 2008 .
until the election , nothing much will change on the national level in the us .
but on the individual state level a lot is changing at the moment .
that 's important because american environmental policy is n't just made on the national level .
it also happens at the state , regional and local levels .
so it 's important to have a many-pronged strategy . is it possible to negotiate an agreement in advance with politicians who may assume control after 2008 ? in terms of international law , that would be impossible .
the national government is responsible for negotiating agreements , which then have to be approved by congress .
you might be able to get a majority in congress , but even there i 'm sceptical .
but the actual negotiations have to be done by the bush administration , and i do n't expect any great changes between now and the end of next year .
maybe we can take some small steps , but the question remains what bush wants to achieve with his second term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecologic is a policy institute that advises the eu on environmental issues what do you expect per sonally form the g8 summit ?

so it 's very important to meet with representatives of the people who have a very good chance of being elected in 2008 .
until the election , nothing much will change on the national level in the us .
but on the individual state level a lot is changing at the moment .
that 's important because american environmental policy is n't just made on the national level .
it also happens at the state , regional and local levels .
so it 's important to have a many-pronged strategy . is it possible to negotiate an agreement in advance with politicians who may assume control after 2008 ? in terms of international law , that would be impossible .
the national government is responsible for negotiating agreements , which then have to be approved by congress .
you might be able to get a majority in congress , but even there i 'm sceptical .
but the actual negotiations have to be done by the bush administration , and i do n't expect any great changes between now and the end of next year .
maybe we can take some small steps , but the question remains what bush wants to achieve with his second term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecologic is a policy institute that advises the eu on environmental issues what do you expect per sonally form the g8 summit ?
will there just be more talk , or will something substantial emerge ? i 'm not directly involved in the negotiations so i do n't know .
most of the deals will be reached in advance , and what 's coming out in the german media makes me skeptical .
i do n't think we will see concrete reduction goals or a binding statement coming out of heiligendamm - at least not in the form of a declaration signed by all eight countries .
but what could happen is that we got a positive input in line with previous agreements like kyoto .
for instance , we need a mandate to negotiate a second phase of kyoto , and there could be positive language for that coming out of heiligendamm . jefferson chase interviewed nils meyer-ohlendorf send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu chief slams bush 's climate plans , predicts failure at g8 european commission president jose manuel barroso has sharply criticized plans outlined by us president george w bush to cut greenhouse gas emissions , saying the united states needs to set more ambitious goals .

the piece , which was never intended for performance , is a combination of folk music , operas , operettas and classical tunes and tillion 's original texts and choreography .
staunchly against making any contribution to the nazi war effort , tillion was hidden by her fellow prisoners and wrote a large portion of the operetta 's 104-page manuscript from her hideout in a box .
" le verfügbar aux enfers " deals with the humiliation of daily life in a concentration camp , where tillion was brought in 1943 .
its title , which incorporates the german word " verfügbar " into the french , refers to the group of prisoners tillion was placed in by the nazis .
she and her fellow prisoners were n't given set jobs , rather they were dubbed " available " and assigned to any task their captives needed .
tillion celebrates 100 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tillion in june 2004 tillion , who turned 100 this week , had made a name for herself as an ethnologist and was conducting research in algeria when the war began .
she returned to occupied france in 1940 and joined the resistance movement shortly thereafter .
she was arrested by the nazis in 1942 and sent to ravensbrück the following year along with her mother , who later lost her life in a gas chamber .
after the war , tillion published numerous books and essays on the ravensbrück concentration camp and the resistance movement .
she has received multiple awards for her involvement in the resistance , including the federal cross of merit in both france and germany . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's best attended music festival plagued by cuts the most prestigious festival in communist east germany is still making do , despite severe budget cuts .

but is it real ?
european catholics arrive in aachen this week to see a 2,000-year-old dress reputedly worn by mary when she gave birth to jesus .
christian relics continue to draw crowds , but for most people seeing is n't believing . the bones and belongings of holy people remain a big tourist draw in europe .
for most modern day pilgrims , whether the ancient christian relics are real or not is beside the point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's cathedral is a unesco world heritage site aachen expects 100,000 pilgrims and tourists during its 2007 pilgrimage , which started friday and goes until june 10 . among the visitors will be plenty of skeptics .
that 's okay , aachen 's roman catholic bishop heinrich mussinghoff said at the friday service to open the shrine containing the relics .
one does n't need to do pilgrimages or venerate relics to be a good catholic , he said . most modern day catholics emphasize relics ' importance as symbols rather than their belief in supernatural powers . mussinghoff likened relics to a family heirloom which is treasured for providing a link to the past .
relics " speak of the difference these people made , of what they accomplished for the future , of their thoughts , actions and beliefs which are still so valuable and precious today , " he said . avoiding su per stition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relics draw crowds but christian weisner , a spokesman for we are church , a group advocating for reform of the roman catholic church , said he sees relics as a form of superstition . " i have some reluctance about praying to relics or expecting healing from relics , " he said .
" we have to be careful not to become superstitious . " weisner does applaud some of the modern day activities that often go along with relics such as making pilgrimages , praying and meeting other believers , he said .
all those are important parts of the catholic faith , weisner said . " belief needs emotional things , " he said .
" at the same time we have to use our brain , we need reason . " a matter of faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen expects 100,000 pilgrims the popularity of relics surged during the middle ages and ended with the protestant reformation . during the middle ages , relics were thought to provide a direct link to the saint . going on pilgrimage provided a way to have sins forgiven and shorten the time in purgatory .
for many pilgrims , coming face to face with relics was the most terrifying and awesome experience of their lives . pilgrims to aachen faced some of the most important characters in christianity : jesus , his mother mary and john the baptist . as the center of charlemagne 's empire , aachen was europe 's most important pilgrimage destination during the middle ages after rome and santiago de compostela in spain .
charlemagne 's role in acquiring the relics in 799 is " only a legend , " said relic expert christof diedrichs , a researcher at the humboldt university in berlin . besides mary 's dress , aachen has three other major relics : jesus ' swaddling clothes , a cloth used during john the baptist 's beheading , and the waistcloth jesus wore during his crucifixion .
aachen has brought the relics out for a public viewing once every seven years since 1394 . what has been scientifically proven is that the textiles which make up the four aachen relics has been shown to date back to the first or second century after christ , diedrichs said . seeing is believing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this package contains cloth believed to be jesus ' swaddling clothes even during the middle ages , pilgrims mixed holiness with tourism .
today , people travel to see relics out of piety , curiosity , skepticism , or an interest in history . " all these different people come for all these different reasons , " said us sociologist william swatos , who published a book last year about pilgrimages and tourism .
" it 's a multilayered phenomenon . "
the supernatural has also regained popularity , swatos said . modern day pilgrims are willing to believe the bones of a saint really could be magical . " it 's all right once again to have feelings and to imagine the unimaginable , " said swatos , who is also the executive officer for the association for the sociology of religion .
" you can transcend the rationality of modernity .
the old can also become new and true again . "

resistance german authorities are now questioning the safety of the transport arrangements and whether it is necessary . the 60,000 barrels of hexachlorobenzene will have to travel 16,000 kilometers -lrb- 9,940 miles -rrb- by train and ship before they go up in smoke in german incinerators . hexachlorobenzene or hcb is highly toxic , collecting up in fatty tissues and causing serious diseases .
even after it 's been incinerated , there are poisonous solid residues which still have to be dumped somewhere safe . markus friese , spokesman for the environment ministry in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where most of the waste will end up , said the australians should deal with their own rubbish . " australia is an industrial nation , " he said .
" it was able to produce this stuff , so we believe that australia should also be able to get rid of it . " but heinz struszczynski , spokesman for rzr herten , one of the plants which will be dealing with the hcb , said that is n't the case . " this waste is very special , " he said .
" it 's one of the so-called dirty dozen identified by the stockholm convention . " struszczynski added that this kind of waste can only be processed in special plants of high quality , and these plants can only be found in europe , and particularly in germany .
other waste , even toxic waste , can be dealt with in australian plants . making money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to make certain australia can not dispose of the waste itself according to the basle convention , toxic waste must be dealt with in the country of origin if it has the capacity to do so or if it is reasonable to expect that capacity to be provided .
if this is not the case , it can be exported .
officials plan a thorough check to see if there really are no suitable plants in australia , or if they ca n't be built . but dirk jansen of german friends of the earth said he feels the problem is ultimately a german one . " the main reason why north rhine-westphalia is an el dorado for toxic waste disposal in germany , with 600,000 tons a year imported , is that it 's an easy way of making money , " he said .
" in the eighties , the operators built up over-capacities which now have to be filled . " i ca n't believe it will remain a one-off , " he added .

but is it real ?
european catholics arrive in aachen this week to see a 2,000-year-old dress reputedly worn by mary when she gave birth to jesus .
christian relics continue to draw crowds , but for most people seeing is n't believing . the bones and belongings of holy people remain a big tourist draw in europe .
for most modern day pilgrims , whether the ancient christian relics are real or not is beside the point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's cathedral is a unesco world heritage site aachen expects 100,000 pilgrims and tourists during its 2007 pilgrimage , which started friday and goes until june 10 . among the visitors will be plenty of skeptics .
that 's okay , aachen 's roman catholic bishop heinrich mussinghoff said at the friday service to open the shrine containing the relics .
one does n't need to do pilgrimages or venerate relics to be a good catholic , he said . most modern day catholics emphasize relics ' importance as symbols rather than their belief in supernatural powers . mussinghoff likened relics to a family heirloom which is treasured for providing a link to the past .
relics " speak of the difference these people made , of what they accomplished for the future , of their thoughts , actions and beliefs which are still so valuable and precious today , " he said . avoiding su per stition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relics draw crowds but christian weisner , a spokesman for we are church , a group advocating for reform of the roman catholic church , said he sees relics as a form of superstition .

for many pilgrims , coming face to face with relics was the most terrifying and awesome experience of their lives . pilgrims to aachen faced some of the most important characters in christianity : jesus , his mother mary and john the baptist . as the center of charlemagne 's empire , aachen was europe 's most important pilgrimage destination during the middle ages after rome and santiago de compostela in spain .
charlemagne 's role in acquiring the relics in 799 is " only a legend , " said relic expert christof diedrichs , a researcher at the humboldt university in berlin . besides mary 's dress , aachen has three other major relics : jesus ' swaddling clothes , a cloth used during john the baptist 's beheading , and the waistcloth jesus wore during his crucifixion .
aachen has brought the relics out for a public viewing once every seven years since 1394 . what has been scientifically proven is that the textiles which make up the four aachen relics has been shown to date back to the first or second century after christ , diedrichs said . seeing is believing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this package contains cloth believed to be jesus ' swaddling clothes even during the middle ages , pilgrims mixed holiness with tourism .
today , people travel to see relics out of piety , curiosity , skepticism , or an interest in history . " all these different people come for all these different reasons , " said us sociologist william swatos , who published a book last year about pilgrimages and tourism .
" it 's a multilayered phenomenon . "
the supernatural has also regained popularity , swatos said . modern day pilgrims are willing to believe the bones of a saint really could be magical . " it 's all right once again to have feelings and to imagine the unimaginable , " said swatos , who is also the executive officer for the association for the sociology of religion .

but is it real ?
european catholics arrive in aachen this week to see a 2,000-year-old dress reputedly worn by mary when she gave birth to jesus .
christian relics continue to draw crowds , but for most people seeing is n't believing . the bones and belongings of holy people remain a big tourist draw in europe .
for most modern day pilgrims , whether the ancient christian relics are real or not is beside the point . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen 's cathedral is a unesco world heritage site aachen expects 100,000 pilgrims and tourists during its 2007 pilgrimage , which started friday and goes until june 10 . among the visitors will be plenty of skeptics .
that 's okay , aachen 's roman catholic bishop heinrich mussinghoff said at the friday service to open the shrine containing the relics .
one does n't need to do pilgrimages or venerate relics to be a good catholic , he said . most modern day catholics emphasize relics ' importance as symbols rather than their belief in supernatural powers . mussinghoff likened relics to a family heirloom which is treasured for providing a link to the past .
relics " speak of the difference these people made , of what they accomplished for the future , of their thoughts , actions and beliefs which are still so valuable and precious today , " he said . avoiding su per stition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relics draw crowds but christian weisner , a spokesman for we are church , a group advocating for reform of the roman catholic church , said he sees relics as a form of superstition . " i have some reluctance about praying to relics or expecting healing from relics , " he said .
" we have to be careful not to become superstitious . " weisner does applaud some of the modern day activities that often go along with relics such as making pilgrimages , praying and meeting other believers , he said .
all those are important parts of the catholic faith , weisner said . " belief needs emotional things , " he said .
" at the same time we have to use our brain , we need reason .

resistance german authorities are now questioning the safety of the transport arrangements and whether it is necessary . the 60,000 barrels of hexachlorobenzene will have to travel 16,000 kilometers -lrb- 9,940 miles -rrb- by train and ship before they go up in smoke in german incinerators . hexachlorobenzene or hcb is highly toxic , collecting up in fatty tissues and causing serious diseases .
even after it 's been incinerated , there are poisonous solid residues which still have to be dumped somewhere safe . markus friese , spokesman for the environment ministry in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where most of the waste will end up , said the australians should deal with their own rubbish . " australia is an industrial nation , " he said .
" it was able to produce this stuff , so we believe that australia should also be able to get rid of it . " but heinz struszczynski , spokesman for rzr herten , one of the plants which will be dealing with the hcb , said that is n't the case . " this waste is very special , " he said .
" it 's one of the so-called dirty dozen identified by the stockholm convention . " struszczynski added that this kind of waste can only be processed in special plants of high quality , and these plants can only be found in europe , and particularly in germany .
other waste , even toxic waste , can be dealt with in australian plants . making money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to make certain australia can not dispose of the waste itself according to the basle convention , toxic waste must be dealt with in the country of origin if it has the capacity to do so or if it is reasonable to expect that capacity to be provided .
if this is not the case , it can be exported .
officials plan a thorough check to see if there really are no suitable plants in australia , or if they ca n't be built . but dirk jansen of german friends of the earth said he feels the problem is ultimately a german one . " the main reason why north rhine-westphalia is an el dorado for toxic waste disposal in germany , with 600,000 tons a year imported , is that it 's an easy way of making money , " he said .
" in the eighties , the operators built up over-capacities which now have to be filled . " i ca n't believe it will remain a one-off , " he added .

nils meyer-ohlendorf , a senior fellow at an environmental policy think tank in berlin , talked to dw-world.de about the prospects . dw-world.de : what concretely is germany looking for from the us at the g8 summit ? nils meyer-ohlendorf : germany is n't looking for anything on its own , but rather as the chair of eu council and president of the eu .
germany wants the environmental goals that the eu has set itself implemented internationally .
concretely this means reducing emissions by 20 to 30 percent of the 1990 levels by the year 2020 and then a further reduction in co2 emissions of 60 to 80 percent by 2050 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european environmentalists think bush is a problem why has the bush administration been so reluctant to reach binding climate agreements ?
is it just to protect the interests of american petroleum companies ? the policy of bush 's government has n't changed since he took office .
in 2000 , the bush administration took a reluctant position toward the kyoto protocol and especially toward the idea of accepting concrete targets for reducing admissions .
there are various reasons for this .
you mentioned one of them , but it 's difficult to get an overview , and i 'm not in a position to say .
but in general , the us is very skittish when it comes to accepting international legal obligations .
that 's true not only concerning kyoto , but also of the american stance toward human rights or the issue of iraq in the un security council .
there 's a general reluctance in the bush administration to let the government 's action be constrained by international law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with pelosi in the run-up to the summit ahead of the summit , german chancellor angela merkel and german enviromental minister sigmar gabriel have also been talking with other us politicians , chiefly the speaker of the house of representatives , nancy pelosi .
is that a realistic option ? i think it 's a very important strategy , if you look forward to what could happen in the us in 2009 after the presidential election .
if you believe the public-opinion polls the republicans are in a slump , and there 's a desire in the us for a change of government .
so it 's very important to meet with representatives of the people who have a very good chance of being elected in 2008 .
until the election , nothing much will change on the national level in the us .
but on the individual state level a lot is changing at the moment .
that 's important because american environmental policy is n't just made on the national level .
it also happens at the state , regional and local levels .
so it 's important to have a many-pronged strategy . is it possible to negotiate an agreement in advance with politicians who may assume control after 2008 ? in terms of international law , that would be impossible .
the national government is responsible for negotiating agreements , which then have to be approved by congress .
you might be able to get a majority in congress , but even there i 'm sceptical .
but the actual negotiations have to be done by the bush administration , and i do n't expect any great changes between now and the end of next year .
maybe we can take some small steps , but the question remains what bush wants to achieve with his second term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecologic is a policy institute that advises the eu on environmental issues what do you expect per sonally form the g8 summit ?
will there just be more talk , or will something substantial emerge ? i 'm not directly involved in the negotiations so i do n't know .
most of the deals will be reached in advance , and what 's coming out in the german media makes me skeptical .
i do n't think we will see concrete reduction goals or a binding statement coming out of heiligendamm - at least not in the form of a declaration signed by all eight countries .
but what could happen is that we got a positive input in line with previous agreements like kyoto .
for instance , we need a mandate to negotiate a second phase of kyoto , and there could be positive language for that coming out of heiligendamm . jefferson chase interviewed nils meyer-ohlendorf send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu chief slams bush 's climate plans , predicts failure at g8 european commission president jose manuel barroso has sharply criticized plans outlined by us president george w bush to cut greenhouse gas emissions , saying the united states needs to set more ambitious goals .

the piece , which was never intended for performance , is a combination of folk music , operas , operettas and classical tunes and tillion 's original texts and choreography .
staunchly against making any contribution to the nazi war effort , tillion was hidden by her fellow prisoners and wrote a large portion of the operetta 's 104-page manuscript from her hideout in a box .
" le verfügbar aux enfers " deals with the humiliation of daily life in a concentration camp , where tillion was brought in 1943 .
its title , which incorporates the german word " verfügbar " into the french , refers to the group of prisoners tillion was placed in by the nazis .
she and her fellow prisoners were n't given set jobs , rather they were dubbed " available " and assigned to any task their captives needed .
tillion celebrates 100 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tillion in june 2004 tillion , who turned 100 this week , had made a name for herself as an ethnologist and was conducting research in algeria when the war began .
she returned to occupied france in 1940 and joined the resistance movement shortly thereafter .
she was arrested by the nazis in 1942 and sent to ravensbrück the following year along with her mother , who later lost her life in a gas chamber .
after the war , tillion published numerous books and essays on the ravensbrück concentration camp and the resistance movement .
she has received multiple awards for her involvement in the resistance , including the federal cross of merit in both france and germany . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's best attended music festival plagued by cuts the most prestigious festival in communist east germany is still making do , despite severe budget cuts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 02.06.2007 " the us is skittish about accepting international obligations " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has resisted mandatory emissions reductions germany wants the us to agree to environmental targets at the g8 summit in heiligendamm .
nils meyer-ohlendorf , a senior fellow at an environmental policy think tank in berlin , talked to dw-world.de about the prospects . dw-world.de : what concretely is germany looking for from the us at the g8 summit ? nils meyer-ohlendorf : germany is n't looking for anything on its own , but rather as the chair of eu council and president of the eu .
germany wants the environmental goals that the eu has set itself implemented internationally .
concretely this means reducing emissions by 20 to 30 percent of the 1990 levels by the year 2020 and then a further reduction in co2 emissions of 60 to 80 percent by 2050 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european environmentalists think bush is a problem why has the bush administration been so reluctant to reach binding climate agreements ?
is it just to protect the interests of american petroleum companies ? the policy of bush 's government has n't changed since he took office .
in 2000 , the bush administration took a reluctant position toward the kyoto protocol and especially toward the idea of accepting concrete targets for reducing admissions .
there are various reasons for this .
you mentioned one of them , but it 's difficult to get an overview , and i 'm not in a position to say .
but in general , the us is very skittish when it comes to accepting international legal obligations .
that 's true not only concerning kyoto , but also of the american stance toward human rights or the issue of iraq in the un security council .
there 's a general reluctance in the bush administration to let the government 's action be constrained by international law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with pelosi in the run-up to the summit ahead of the summit , german chancellor angela merkel and german enviromental minister sigmar gabriel have also been talking with other us politicians , chiefly the speaker of the house of representatives , nancy pelosi .
is that a realistic option ? i think it 's a very important strategy , if you look forward to what could happen in the us in 2009 after the presidential election .
if you believe the public-opinion polls the republicans are in a slump , and there 's a desire in the us for a change of government .
so it 's very important to meet with representatives of the people who have a very good chance of being elected in 2008 .
until the election , nothing much will change on the national level in the us .
but on the individual state level a lot is changing at the moment .
that 's important because american environmental policy is n't just made on the national level .
it also happens at the state , regional and local levels .
so it 's important to have a many-pronged strategy . is it possible to negotiate an agreement in advance with politicians who may assume control after 2008 ? in terms of international law , that would be impossible .
the national government is responsible for negotiating agreements , which then have to be approved by congress .
you might be able to get a majority in congress , but even there i 'm sceptical .
but the actual negotiations have to be done by the bush administration , and i do n't expect any great changes between now and the end of next year .
maybe we can take some small steps , but the question remains what bush wants to achieve with his second term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecologic is a policy institute that advises the eu on environmental issues what do you expect per sonally form the g8 summit ?
will there just be more talk , or will something substantial emerge ? i 'm not directly involved in the negotiations so i do n't know .
most of the deals will be reached in advance , and what 's coming out in the german media makes me skeptical .
i do n't think we will see concrete reduction goals or a binding statement coming out of heiligendamm - at least not in the form of a declaration signed by all eight countries .
but what could happen is that we got a positive input in line with previous agreements like kyoto .
for instance , we need a mandate to negotiate a second phase of kyoto , and there could be positive language for that coming out of heiligendamm . jefferson chase interviewed nils meyer-ohlendorf send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu chief slams bush 's climate plans , predicts failure at g8 european commission president jose manuel barroso has sharply criticized plans outlined by us president george w bush to cut greenhouse gas emissions , saying the united states needs to set more ambitious goals .
-lrb- 01.06.2007 -rrb- merkel and us house speaker pelosi debate climate change chancellor angela merkel said tuesday after meeting with us house of representives speaker nancy pelosi that she would continue to press for binding targets to combat global warming ahead of the g8 summit in germany .

the piece , which was never intended for performance , is a combination of folk music , operas , operettas and classical tunes and tillion 's original texts and choreography .
staunchly against making any contribution to the nazi war effort , tillion was hidden by her fellow prisoners and wrote a large portion of the operetta 's 104-page manuscript from her hideout in a box .
" le verfügbar aux enfers " deals with the humiliation of daily life in a concentration camp , where tillion was brought in 1943 .
its title , which incorporates the german word " verfügbar " into the french , refers to the group of prisoners tillion was placed in by the nazis .
she and her fellow prisoners were n't given set jobs , rather they were dubbed " available " and assigned to any task their captives needed .
tillion celebrates 100 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tillion in june 2004 tillion , who turned 100 this week , had made a name for herself as an ethnologist and was conducting research in algeria when the war began .

she was arrested by the nazis in 1942 and sent to ravensbrück the following year along with her mother , who later lost her life in a gas chamber .
after the war , tillion published numerous books and essays on the ravensbrück concentration camp and the resistance movement .

nils meyer-ohlendorf , a senior fellow at an environmental policy think tank in berlin , talked to dw-world.de about the prospects . dw-world.de : what concretely is germany looking for from the us at the g8 summit ? nils meyer-ohlendorf : germany is n't looking for anything on its own , but rather as the chair of eu council and president of the eu .
germany wants the environmental goals that the eu has set itself implemented internationally .
concretely this means reducing emissions by 20 to 30 percent of the 1990 levels by the year 2020 and then a further reduction in co2 emissions of 60 to 80 percent by 2050 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european environmentalists think bush is a problem why has the bush administration been so reluctant to reach binding climate agreements ?
is it just to protect the interests of american petroleum companies ? the policy of bush 's government has n't changed since he took office .
in 2000 , the bush administration took a reluctant position toward the kyoto protocol and especially toward the idea of accepting concrete targets for reducing admissions .
there are various reasons for this .
you mentioned one of them , but it 's difficult to get an overview , and i 'm not in a position to say .
but in general , the us is very skittish when it comes to accepting international legal obligations .
that 's true not only concerning kyoto , but also of the american stance toward human rights or the issue of iraq in the un security council .
there 's a general reluctance in the bush administration to let the government 's action be constrained by international law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with pelosi in the run-up to the summit ahead of the summit , german chancellor angela merkel and german enviromental minister sigmar gabriel have also been talking with other us politicians , chiefly the speaker of the house of representatives , nancy pelosi .
is that a realistic option ? i think it 's a very important strategy , if you look forward to what could happen in the us in 2009 after the presidential election .
if you believe the public-opinion polls the republicans are in a slump , and there 's a desire in the us for a change of government .
so it 's very important to meet with representatives of the people who have a very good chance of being elected in 2008 .
until the election , nothing much will change on the national level in the us .
but on the individual state level a lot is changing at the moment .
that 's important because american environmental policy is n't just made on the national level .
it also happens at the state , regional and local levels .
so it 's important to have a many-pronged strategy . is it possible to negotiate an agreement in advance with politicians who may assume control after 2008 ? in terms of international law , that would be impossible .
the national government is responsible for negotiating agreements , which then have to be approved by congress .
you might be able to get a majority in congress , but even there i 'm sceptical .
but the actual negotiations have to be done by the bush administration , and i do n't expect any great changes between now and the end of next year .
maybe we can take some small steps , but the question remains what bush wants to achieve with his second term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecologic is a policy institute that advises the eu on environmental issues what do you expect per sonally form the g8 summit ?
will there just be more talk , or will something substantial emerge ? i 'm not directly involved in the negotiations so i do n't know .
most of the deals will be reached in advance , and what 's coming out in the german media makes me skeptical .
i do n't think we will see concrete reduction goals or a binding statement coming out of heiligendamm - at least not in the form of a declaration signed by all eight countries .
but what could happen is that we got a positive input in line with previous agreements like kyoto .
for instance , we need a mandate to negotiate a second phase of kyoto , and there could be positive language for that coming out of heiligendamm . jefferson chase interviewed nils meyer-ohlendorf send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu chief slams bush 's climate plans , predicts failure at g8 european commission president jose manuel barroso has sharply criticized plans outlined by us president george w bush to cut greenhouse gas emissions , saying the united states needs to set more ambitious goals .

the piece , which was never intended for performance , is a combination of folk music , operas , operettas and classical tunes and tillion 's original texts and choreography .
staunchly against making any contribution to the nazi war effort , tillion was hidden by her fellow prisoners and wrote a large portion of the operetta 's 104-page manuscript from her hideout in a box .
" le verfügbar aux enfers " deals with the humiliation of daily life in a concentration camp , where tillion was brought in 1943 .
its title , which incorporates the german word " verfügbar " into the french , refers to the group of prisoners tillion was placed in by the nazis .
she and her fellow prisoners were n't given set jobs , rather they were dubbed " available " and assigned to any task their captives needed .
tillion celebrates 100 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tillion in june 2004 tillion , who turned 100 this week , had made a name for herself as an ethnologist and was conducting research in algeria when the war began .
she returned to occupied france in 1940 and joined the resistance movement shortly thereafter .
she was arrested by the nazis in 1942 and sent to ravensbrück the following year along with her mother , who later lost her life in a gas chamber .
after the war , tillion published numerous books and essays on the ravensbrück concentration camp and the resistance movement .
she has received multiple awards for her involvement in the resistance , including the federal cross of merit in both france and germany . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's best attended music festival plagued by cuts the most prestigious festival in communist east germany is still making do , despite severe budget cuts .

nils meyer-ohlendorf , a senior fellow at an environmental policy think tank in berlin , talked to dw-world.de about the prospects . dw-world.de : what concretely is germany looking for from the us at the g8 summit ? nils meyer-ohlendorf : germany is n't looking for anything on its own , but rather as the chair of eu council and president of the eu .
germany wants the environmental goals that the eu has set itself implemented internationally .
concretely this means reducing emissions by 20 to 30 percent of the 1990 levels by the year 2020 and then a further reduction in co2 emissions of 60 to 80 percent by 2050 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european environmentalists think bush is a problem why has the bush administration been so reluctant to reach binding climate agreements ?
is it just to protect the interests of american petroleum companies ? the policy of bush 's government has n't changed since he took office .
in 2000 , the bush administration took a reluctant position toward the kyoto protocol and especially toward the idea of accepting concrete targets for reducing admissions .
there are various reasons for this .
you mentioned one of them , but it 's difficult to get an overview , and i 'm not in a position to say .
but in general , the us is very skittish when it comes to accepting international legal obligations .
that 's true not only concerning kyoto , but also of the american stance toward human rights or the issue of iraq in the un security council .
there 's a general reluctance in the bush administration to let the government 's action be constrained by international law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with pelosi in the run-up to the summit ahead of the summit , german chancellor angela merkel and german enviromental minister sigmar gabriel have also been talking with other us politicians , chiefly the speaker of the house of representatives , nancy pelosi .
is that a realistic option ? i think it 's a very important strategy , if you look forward to what could happen in the us in 2009 after the presidential election .
if you believe the public-opinion polls the republicans are in a slump , and there 's a desire in the us for a change of government .
so it 's very important to meet with representatives of the people who have a very good chance of being elected in 2008 .
until the election , nothing much will change on the national level in the us .
but on the individual state level a lot is changing at the moment .
that 's important because american environmental policy is n't just made on the national level .
it also happens at the state , regional and local levels .
so it 's important to have a many-pronged strategy . is it possible to negotiate an agreement in advance with politicians who may assume control after 2008 ? in terms of international law , that would be impossible .
the national government is responsible for negotiating agreements , which then have to be approved by congress .
you might be able to get a majority in congress , but even there i 'm sceptical .
but the actual negotiations have to be done by the bush administration , and i do n't expect any great changes between now and the end of next year .
maybe we can take some small steps , but the question remains what bush wants to achieve with his second term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecologic is a policy institute that advises the eu on environmental issues what do you expect per sonally form the g8 summit ?
will there just be more talk , or will something substantial emerge ? i 'm not directly involved in the negotiations so i do n't know .
most of the deals will be reached in advance , and what 's coming out in the german media makes me skeptical .
i do n't think we will see concrete reduction goals or a binding statement coming out of heiligendamm - at least not in the form of a declaration signed by all eight countries .
but what could happen is that we got a positive input in line with previous agreements like kyoto .
for instance , we need a mandate to negotiate a second phase of kyoto , and there could be positive language for that coming out of heiligendamm . jefferson chase interviewed nils meyer-ohlendorf send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu chief slams bush 's climate plans , predicts failure at g8 european commission president jose manuel barroso has sharply criticized plans outlined by us president george w bush to cut greenhouse gas emissions , saying the united states needs to set more ambitious goals .

the piece , which was never intended for performance , is a combination of folk music , operas , operettas and classical tunes and tillion 's original texts and choreography .
staunchly against making any contribution to the nazi war effort , tillion was hidden by her fellow prisoners and wrote a large portion of the operetta 's 104-page manuscript from her hideout in a box .
" le verfügbar aux enfers " deals with the humiliation of daily life in a concentration camp , where tillion was brought in 1943 .
its title , which incorporates the german word " verfügbar " into the french , refers to the group of prisoners tillion was placed in by the nazis .
she and her fellow prisoners were n't given set jobs , rather they were dubbed " available " and assigned to any task their captives needed .
tillion celebrates 100 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tillion in june 2004 tillion , who turned 100 this week , had made a name for herself as an ethnologist and was conducting research in algeria when the war began .
she returned to occupied france in 1940 and joined the resistance movement shortly thereafter .
she was arrested by the nazis in 1942 and sent to ravensbrück the following year along with her mother , who later lost her life in a gas chamber .
after the war , tillion published numerous books and essays on the ravensbrück concentration camp and the resistance movement .
she has received multiple awards for her involvement in the resistance , including the federal cross of merit in both france and germany . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's best attended music festival plagued by cuts the most prestigious festival in communist east germany is still making do , despite severe budget cuts .

nils meyer-ohlendorf , a senior fellow at an environmental policy think tank in berlin , talked to dw-world.de about the prospects . dw-world.de : what concretely is germany looking for from the us at the g8 summit ? nils meyer-ohlendorf : germany is n't looking for anything on its own , but rather as the chair of eu council and president of the eu .
germany wants the environmental goals that the eu has set itself implemented internationally .
concretely this means reducing emissions by 20 to 30 percent of the 1990 levels by the year 2020 and then a further reduction in co2 emissions of 60 to 80 percent by 2050 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european environmentalists think bush is a problem why has the bush administration been so reluctant to reach binding climate agreements ?
is it just to protect the interests of american petroleum companies ? the policy of bush 's government has n't changed since he took office .
in 2000 , the bush administration took a reluctant position toward the kyoto protocol and especially toward the idea of accepting concrete targets for reducing admissions .
there are various reasons for this .
you mentioned one of them , but it 's difficult to get an overview , and i 'm not in a position to say .
but in general , the us is very skittish when it comes to accepting international legal obligations .
that 's true not only concerning kyoto , but also of the american stance toward human rights or the issue of iraq in the un security council .
there 's a general reluctance in the bush administration to let the government 's action be constrained by international law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with pelosi in the run-up to the summit ahead of the summit , german chancellor angela merkel and german enviromental minister sigmar gabriel have also been talking with other us politicians , chiefly the speaker of the house of representatives , nancy pelosi .
is that a realistic option ? i think it 's a very important strategy , if you look forward to what could happen in the us in 2009 after the presidential election .
if you believe the public-opinion polls the republicans are in a slump , and there 's a desire in the us for a change of government .
so it 's very important to meet with representatives of the people who have a very good chance of being elected in 2008 .
until the election , nothing much will change on the national level in the us .
but on the individual state level a lot is changing at the moment .
that 's important because american environmental policy is n't just made on the national level .
it also happens at the state , regional and local levels .
so it 's important to have a many-pronged strategy . is it possible to negotiate an agreement in advance with politicians who may assume control after 2008 ? in terms of international law , that would be impossible .
the national government is responsible for negotiating agreements , which then have to be approved by congress .
you might be able to get a majority in congress , but even there i 'm sceptical .
but the actual negotiations have to be done by the bush administration , and i do n't expect any great changes between now and the end of next year .
maybe we can take some small steps , but the question remains what bush wants to achieve with his second term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecologic is a policy institute that advises the eu on environmental issues what do you expect per sonally form the g8 summit ?
will there just be more talk , or will something substantial emerge ? i 'm not directly involved in the negotiations so i do n't know .
most of the deals will be reached in advance , and what 's coming out in the german media makes me skeptical .
i do n't think we will see concrete reduction goals or a binding statement coming out of heiligendamm - at least not in the form of a declaration signed by all eight countries .

you mentioned one of them , but it 's difficult to get an overview , and i 'm not in a position to say .
but in general , the us is very skittish when it comes to accepting international legal obligations .
that 's true not only concerning kyoto , but also of the american stance toward human rights or the issue of iraq in the un security council .
there 's a general reluctance in the bush administration to let the government 's action be constrained by international law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with pelosi in the run-up to the summit ahead of the summit , german chancellor angela merkel and german enviromental minister sigmar gabriel have also been talking with other us politicians , chiefly the speaker of the house of representatives , nancy pelosi .
is that a realistic option ? i think it 's a very important strategy , if you look forward to what could happen in the us in 2009 after the presidential election .
if you believe the public-opinion polls the republicans are in a slump , and there 's a desire in the us for a change of government .
so it 's very important to meet with representatives of the people who have a very good chance of being elected in 2008 .
until the election , nothing much will change on the national level in the us .
but on the individual state level a lot is changing at the moment .
that 's important because american environmental policy is n't just made on the national level .
it also happens at the state , regional and local levels .
so it 's important to have a many-pronged strategy . is it possible to negotiate an agreement in advance with politicians who may assume control after 2008 ? in terms of international law , that would be impossible .
the national government is responsible for negotiating agreements , which then have to be approved by congress .
you might be able to get a majority in congress , but even there i 'm sceptical .
but the actual negotiations have to be done by the bush administration , and i do n't expect any great changes between now and the end of next year .
maybe we can take some small steps , but the question remains what bush wants to achieve with his second term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecologic is a policy institute that advises the eu on environmental issues what do you expect per sonally form the g8 summit ?
will there just be more talk , or will something substantial emerge ? i 'm not directly involved in the negotiations so i do n't know .
most of the deals will be reached in advance , and what 's coming out in the german media makes me skeptical .
i do n't think we will see concrete reduction goals or a binding statement coming out of heiligendamm - at least not in the form of a declaration signed by all eight countries .
but what could happen is that we got a positive input in line with previous agreements like kyoto .
for instance , we need a mandate to negotiate a second phase of kyoto , and there could be positive language for that coming out of heiligendamm . jefferson chase interviewed nils meyer-ohlendorf send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu chief slams bush 's climate plans , predicts failure at g8 european commission president jose manuel barroso has sharply criticized plans outlined by us president george w bush to cut greenhouse gas emissions , saying the united states needs to set more ambitious goals .

nils meyer-ohlendorf , a senior fellow at an environmental policy think tank in berlin , talked to dw-world.de about the prospects . dw-world.de : what concretely is germany looking for from the us at the g8 summit ? nils meyer-ohlendorf : germany is n't looking for anything on its own , but rather as the chair of eu council and president of the eu .
germany wants the environmental goals that the eu has set itself implemented internationally .
concretely this means reducing emissions by 20 to 30 percent of the 1990 levels by the year 2020 and then a further reduction in co2 emissions of 60 to 80 percent by 2050 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european environmentalists think bush is a problem why has the bush administration been so reluctant to reach binding climate agreements ?
is it just to protect the interests of american petroleum companies ? the policy of bush 's government has n't changed since he took office .
in 2000 , the bush administration took a reluctant position toward the kyoto protocol and especially toward the idea of accepting concrete targets for reducing admissions .
there are various reasons for this .
you mentioned one of them , but it 's difficult to get an overview , and i 'm not in a position to say .
but in general , the us is very skittish when it comes to accepting international legal obligations .
that 's true not only concerning kyoto , but also of the american stance toward human rights or the issue of iraq in the un security council .
there 's a general reluctance in the bush administration to let the government 's action be constrained by international law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with pelosi in the run-up to the summit ahead of the summit , german chancellor angela merkel and german enviromental minister sigmar gabriel have also been talking with other us politicians , chiefly the speaker of the house of representatives , nancy pelosi .
is that a realistic option ? i think it 's a very important strategy , if you look forward to what could happen in the us in 2009 after the presidential election .
if you believe the public-opinion polls the republicans are in a slump , and there 's a desire in the us for a change of government .
so it 's very important to meet with representatives of the people who have a very good chance of being elected in 2008 .
until the election , nothing much will change on the national level in the us .
but on the individual state level a lot is changing at the moment .
that 's important because american environmental policy is n't just made on the national level .
it also happens at the state , regional and local levels .
so it 's important to have a many-pronged strategy . is it possible to negotiate an agreement in advance with politicians who may assume control after 2008 ? in terms of international law , that would be impossible .
the national government is responsible for negotiating agreements , which then have to be approved by congress .
you might be able to get a majority in congress , but even there i 'm sceptical .
but the actual negotiations have to be done by the bush administration , and i do n't expect any great changes between now and the end of next year .
maybe we can take some small steps , but the question remains what bush wants to achieve with his second term in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecologic is a policy institute that advises the eu on environmental issues what do you expect per sonally form the g8 summit ?
will there just be more talk , or will something substantial emerge ? i 'm not directly involved in the negotiations so i do n't know .
most of the deals will be reached in advance , and what 's coming out in the german media makes me skeptical .
i do n't think we will see concrete reduction goals or a binding statement coming out of heiligendamm - at least not in the form of a declaration signed by all eight countries .
but what could happen is that we got a positive input in line with previous agreements like kyoto .
for instance , we need a mandate to negotiate a second phase of kyoto , and there could be positive language for that coming out of heiligendamm . jefferson chase interviewed nils meyer-ohlendorf send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : eu chief slams bush 's climate plans , predicts failure at g8 european commission president jose manuel barroso has sharply criticized plans outlined by us president george w bush to cut greenhouse gas emissions , saying the united states needs to set more ambitious goals .

resistance german authorities are now questioning the safety of the transport arrangements and whether it is necessary . the 60,000 barrels of hexachlorobenzene will have to travel 16,000 kilometers -lrb- 9,940 miles -rrb- by train and ship before they go up in smoke in german incinerators . hexachlorobenzene or hcb is highly toxic , collecting up in fatty tissues and causing serious diseases .
even after it 's been incinerated , there are poisonous solid residues which still have to be dumped somewhere safe . markus friese , spokesman for the environment ministry in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where most of the waste will end up , said the australians should deal with their own rubbish . " australia is an industrial nation , " he said .
" it was able to produce this stuff , so we believe that australia should also be able to get rid of it . " but heinz struszczynski , spokesman for rzr herten , one of the plants which will be dealing with the hcb , said that is n't the case . " this waste is very special , " he said .
" it 's one of the so-called dirty dozen identified by the stockholm convention . " struszczynski added that this kind of waste can only be processed in special plants of high quality , and these plants can only be found in europe , and particularly in germany .
other waste , even toxic waste , can be dealt with in australian plants . making money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to make certain australia can not dispose of the waste itself according to the basle convention , toxic waste must be dealt with in the country of origin if it has the capacity to do so or if it is reasonable to expect that capacity to be provided .
if this is not the case , it can be exported .

the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency -lrb- mhra -rrb- said : " we take this very seriously and a criminal investigation is being carried out . "
patients whose medicine carries the batch number 65520 have been urged to contact their pharmacist .
' great concern ' the mhra , which oversees the regulation of medicines , said it had been contacted by a wholesaler who had been offered a suspicious batch of the medicine .
tests showed the batch medicine contained only 75 % of the amount of the active ingredient bicalutamide shown on the label .
" at present there is no evidence of patients having any adverse reactions specifically related to the counterfeits , " the mhra said in a statement .
casodex is produced by the pharmaceutical company astrazeneca .

aldrin quibuyen , 36 , who has lived in ammanford for four years , has been told he must leave the uk but is appealing .
he says the decision was taken because he was late filling in a form .
he has the backing of his local church , other filipinos in wales and mp adam price .
the home office said there was a right to appeal against a leave notice .
mr quibuyen was recruited in the philippines to come to work wales in 2003 and most recently was employed at a nursing home in llanelli .
his wife rhoda and six-year-old son buzz followed a year later , while his daughter phebe , two , was born in wales . "
my son was in tears when we told him " aldrin quibuyen but mr quibuyen has now been told he must leave .
he said it was because his paperwork had lapsed and he was late in submitting a form due to a misunderstanding .
" we have settled down very well - i have bought a house here , my daughter was born here and my son goes to school here .
' injustice ' " we mingle with the local community and have many friends .
we do n't have anything in the philippines - a house or land - for me this is my home .
" it would be very hard to go back - my son was in tears when we told him .
" i am hopeful we can stay because of the support we are getting . "
a petition has been organised by members of the town 's salvation army .
simon sheppard , of the salvation army , said : " those supporting al feel he has been dealt a great slice of injustice - he has given so much to the country as a nurse and has never claimed any special treatment or benefit . "
and mp adam price said he would be raising the issue in parliament .
" hundreds of local letters have been sent backing aldrin , " he said .
" i believe he is a deeply honest , law abiding and hard working individual for whom the well being of his family is the sole focus of everything he does . "
a home office spokeswoman said they could not comment on specific cases but they said that everyone had the right to appeal against a leave notice and each was throroughly assessed on a case-by-case basis .
it was on the onus of each individual to ensure that their work permits were up to date .

cyffro caernarfon director bob anderson said " extensive " talks had been held between the company and market traders , who were unhappy with the wheel being at caernarfon last year .
there would be changes made this year as a result of these talks , such as moving the entrance to the big wheel to make room for more traders beside it , he said .
" we did an evaluation report on the event and interviewed 50 business in the town who all said it had brought more people in .
" the bottom line is that we have to hold events in the town centre to survive , " he added .
