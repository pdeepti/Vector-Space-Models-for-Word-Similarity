program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 26.12.2007 german politics marked by heated security debates in 2007 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security is one of berlin 's major priorities the fight against terrorism and a slew of new security measures sparked frenzied debate in germany this year , after the foiling of a major terrorist attack .
but it was n't all about islamist terrorism . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble consistently grabbed headlines this year as he rolled out new counter-terrorism proposals nearly every other week . from the use of spying software on computers , deadly force in the skies to increased surveillance in the cities and the collection of citizens ' biometric data , schäuble polarized and provoked with his bulging catalogue of security measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble routinely hogged headlines in 2007 " the threat posed by terrorism exists here too .
whether we like it or not : we 're not some blissful island , " schäuble said at the beginning of the year . a setback and a triumph in february , germany 's highest court , dealt a blow to schäuble 's plan for online searches , saying there was no legal basis for the measure and it thus violated the constitution . the plan includes sending e-mails attached with trojan horse software to suspected terrorists .
once opened , the software would secretly install itself onto a computer and send data to police computers as soon as the user went online .
the program would also be able to monitor keystrokes , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers without the suspect realizing the search had taken place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online searches using spy software stirred controversy the court 's decision was welcomed by germany 's social democrats , the junior coalition partner to the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- of which schäuble is a member .
it also relieved many proponents of civil liberties who worried the measure would severely infringe privacy and personal freedom . but a month later , the minister pushed through another controversial measure : a single computer database that allows both police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership in terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany in light of abuses under the nazis and by communist east germany . jörg ziercke , head of germany 's federal criminal office , insisted that the new tool was indispensable in fighting modern terrorism . " the police must use this technological progress to keep up with perpetrators and should not allow them to claim cyberspace as a protective space for themselves , " ziercke said at the time .
" we need this instrument particularly to uncover criminal networks in terrorism , organized crime , child pornography , economic crime , human trafficking and the arms trade . " controversial use of force in early september , the arrest of three suspected terrorists who allegedly planned attacks on the frankfurt airport and an american military base bolstered schäuble 's demands for further far-reaching measures to boost security .
they included proposals to deploy germany 's army , the bundeswehr , within the country in the case of an emergency and to shoot down hijacked planes with terrorists on board if the aircraft were to be used as a weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung sparked an uproar with proposals to shoot down hijacked planes defense minister franz josef jung , a fellow cdu member , said he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 . the proposal unleashed a storm of opposition in germany among left-wing parties . " prevention and criminal prosecution is the job of the police and it should remain that way , " said claudia roth , head of the opposition green party .
" this distinction has to be upheld and defended otherwise the rule of law will be buried . " one measure that passed , albeit in the face of tough opposition , was the decision to add fingerprints to germany 's biometric passports from nov .
1 .
the radio-frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- chip in the german biometric passport , which came into use in 2005 , already includes facial recognition data . far-right crimes remain a worry while fierce debate is expected to continue next year on schäuble 's security measures , islamist terrorism was n't the only topic that occupied the attention of german policymakers in 2007 . in may , germany 's office for the protection of the constitution said it had registered 1,115 far-right crimes in 2006 - an increase of nearly 10 percent against the previous year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the victims of the racially-motivated attack on indians in august a few high-profile racially-motivated crimes , including an attack on a group of indians and an assault on a theater group by right-wing thugs in eastern germany , made headlines . the social democrats demanded a renewed ban on the far-right npd party in the face of warnings that the constitutional court would throw out the case as it had four years previously . holger hövelmann , interior minister of the eastern state of saxony-anhalt , where most of the crimes were committed , warned that right-wing extremism posed a serious threat . " right-wing extremism in our country is no longer a marginal phenomenon in our society , rather it presents with us with a central challenge , " hövelmann said .
" largely unnoticed by the public , structures have emerged that question our free democratic principles .
right-wing extremism has gradually begun to seep into daily life . " a threat from the far left debates on domestic security were also dominated by the danger posed by radical left-wing groups .

but it was n't all about islamist terrorism . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble consistently grabbed headlines this year as he rolled out new counter-terrorism proposals nearly every other week . from the use of spying software on computers , deadly force in the skies to increased surveillance in the cities and the collection of citizens ' biometric data , schäuble polarized and provoked with his bulging catalogue of security measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble routinely hogged headlines in 2007 " the threat posed by terrorism exists here too .
whether we like it or not : we 're not some blissful island , " schäuble said at the beginning of the year . a setback and a triumph in february , germany 's highest court , dealt a blow to schäuble 's plan for online searches , saying there was no legal basis for the measure and it thus violated the constitution . the plan includes sending e-mails attached with trojan horse software to suspected terrorists .
once opened , the software would secretly install itself onto a computer and send data to police computers as soon as the user went online .
the program would also be able to monitor keystrokes , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers without the suspect realizing the search had taken place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online searches using spy software stirred controversy the court 's decision was welcomed by germany 's social democrats , the junior coalition partner to the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- of which schäuble is a member .
it also relieved many proponents of civil liberties who worried the measure would severely infringe privacy and personal freedom . but a month later , the minister pushed through another controversial measure : a single computer database that allows both police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership in terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany in light of abuses under the nazis and by communist east germany . jörg ziercke , head of germany 's federal criminal office , insisted that the new tool was indispensable in fighting modern terrorism . " the police must use this technological progress to keep up with perpetrators and should not allow them to claim cyberspace as a protective space for themselves , " ziercke said at the time .
" we need this instrument particularly to uncover criminal networks in terrorism , organized crime , child pornography , economic crime , human trafficking and the arms trade . " controversial use of force in early september , the arrest of three suspected terrorists who allegedly planned attacks on the frankfurt airport and an american military base bolstered schäuble 's demands for further far-reaching measures to boost security .
they included proposals to deploy germany 's army , the bundeswehr , within the country in the case of an emergency and to shoot down hijacked planes with terrorists on board if the aircraft were to be used as a weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung sparked an uproar with proposals to shoot down hijacked planes defense minister franz josef jung , a fellow cdu member , said he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 . the proposal unleashed a storm of opposition in germany among left-wing parties . " prevention and criminal prosecution is the job of the police and it should remain that way , " said claudia roth , head of the opposition green party .
" this distinction has to be upheld and defended otherwise the rule of law will be buried . " one measure that passed , albeit in the face of tough opposition , was the decision to add fingerprints to germany 's biometric passports from nov .
1 .
the radio-frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- chip in the german biometric passport , which came into use in 2005 , already includes facial recognition data . far-right crimes remain a worry while fierce debate is expected to continue next year on schäuble 's security measures , islamist terrorism was n't the only topic that occupied the attention of german policymakers in 2007 . in may , germany 's office for the protection of the constitution said it had registered 1,115 far-right crimes in 2006 - an increase of nearly 10 percent against the previous year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the victims of the racially-motivated attack on indians in august a few high-profile racially-motivated crimes , including an attack on a group of indians and an assault on a theater group by right-wing thugs in eastern germany , made headlines . the social democrats demanded a renewed ban on the far-right npd party in the face of warnings that the constitutional court would throw out the case as it had four years previously . holger hövelmann , interior minister of the eastern state of saxony-anhalt , where most of the crimes were committed , warned that right-wing extremism posed a serious threat . " right-wing extremism in our country is no longer a marginal phenomenon in our society , rather it presents with us with a central challenge , " hövelmann said .
" largely unnoticed by the public , structures have emerged that question our free democratic principles .
right-wing extremism has gradually begun to seep into daily life . " a threat from the far left debates on domestic security were also dominated by the danger posed by radical left-wing groups .
the discussion was fuelled by strong protests and demonstrations by anti-globalization groups in the run-up to the g8 summit in germany in june . the history of left-wing terrorism in germany also played a big role as this year marked 30 years since the so-called " german autumn , " when the left-wing terrorist group raf unleashed a wave of violence and fear with high-profile kidnappings and murders of influential figures in the german establishment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanns martin schleyer was kidnapped and murdered by the raf numerous retrospectives and massive media coverage kept alive the memory of the murder of hanns martin schleyer , the president of the federation of german industries , and federal prosecutor siegfried buback . even as new court proceedings were opened against some left-wing terrorists , brigitte mohnhaupt , a former raf terrorist , was released prematurely from prison after serving time for 24 years . a new debate erupted over whether german president horst köhler should pardon former raf terrorist , christian klar .

but it was n't all about islamist terrorism . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble consistently grabbed headlines this year as he rolled out new counter-terrorism proposals nearly every other week . from the use of spying software on computers , deadly force in the skies to increased surveillance in the cities and the collection of citizens ' biometric data , schäuble polarized and provoked with his bulging catalogue of security measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble routinely hogged headlines in 2007 " the threat posed by terrorism exists here too .
whether we like it or not : we 're not some blissful island , " schäuble said at the beginning of the year . a setback and a triumph in february , germany 's highest court , dealt a blow to schäuble 's plan for online searches , saying there was no legal basis for the measure and it thus violated the constitution . the plan includes sending e-mails attached with trojan horse software to suspected terrorists .
once opened , the software would secretly install itself onto a computer and send data to police computers as soon as the user went online .
the program would also be able to monitor keystrokes , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers without the suspect realizing the search had taken place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online searches using spy software stirred controversy the court 's decision was welcomed by germany 's social democrats , the junior coalition partner to the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- of which schäuble is a member .
it also relieved many proponents of civil liberties who worried the measure would severely infringe privacy and personal freedom . but a month later , the minister pushed through another controversial measure : a single computer database that allows both police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership in terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany in light of abuses under the nazis and by communist east germany . jörg ziercke , head of germany 's federal criminal office , insisted that the new tool was indispensable in fighting modern terrorism . " the police must use this technological progress to keep up with perpetrators and should not allow them to claim cyberspace as a protective space for themselves , " ziercke said at the time .
" we need this instrument particularly to uncover criminal networks in terrorism , organized crime , child pornography , economic crime , human trafficking and the arms trade . " controversial use of force in early september , the arrest of three suspected terrorists who allegedly planned attacks on the frankfurt airport and an american military base bolstered schäuble 's demands for further far-reaching measures to boost security .
they included proposals to deploy germany 's army , the bundeswehr , within the country in the case of an emergency and to shoot down hijacked planes with terrorists on board if the aircraft were to be used as a weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung sparked an uproar with proposals to shoot down hijacked planes defense minister franz josef jung , a fellow cdu member , said he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 . the proposal unleashed a storm of opposition in germany among left-wing parties . " prevention and criminal prosecution is the job of the police and it should remain that way , " said claudia roth , head of the opposition green party .
" this distinction has to be upheld and defended otherwise the rule of law will be buried . " one measure that passed , albeit in the face of tough opposition , was the decision to add fingerprints to germany 's biometric passports from nov .
1 .
the radio-frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- chip in the german biometric passport , which came into use in 2005 , already includes facial recognition data . far-right crimes remain a worry while fierce debate is expected to continue next year on schäuble 's security measures , islamist terrorism was n't the only topic that occupied the attention of german policymakers in 2007 . in may , germany 's office for the protection of the constitution said it had registered 1,115 far-right crimes in 2006 - an increase of nearly 10 percent against the previous year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the victims of the racially-motivated attack on indians in august a few high-profile racially-motivated crimes , including an attack on a group of indians and an assault on a theater group by right-wing thugs in eastern germany , made headlines . the social democrats demanded a renewed ban on the far-right npd party in the face of warnings that the constitutional court would throw out the case as it had four years previously . holger hövelmann , interior minister of the eastern state of saxony-anhalt , where most of the crimes were committed , warned that right-wing extremism posed a serious threat . " right-wing extremism in our country is no longer a marginal phenomenon in our society , rather it presents with us with a central challenge , " hövelmann said .
" largely unnoticed by the public , structures have emerged that question our free democratic principles .
right-wing extremism has gradually begun to seep into daily life . " a threat from the far left debates on domestic security were also dominated by the danger posed by radical left-wing groups .
the discussion was fuelled by strong protests and demonstrations by anti-globalization groups in the run-up to the g8 summit in germany in june . the history of left-wing terrorism in germany also played a big role as this year marked 30 years since the so-called " german autumn , " when the left-wing terrorist group raf unleashed a wave of violence and fear with high-profile kidnappings and murders of influential figures in the german establishment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanns martin schleyer was kidnapped and murdered by the raf numerous retrospectives and massive media coverage kept alive the memory of the murder of hanns martin schleyer , the president of the federation of german industries , and federal prosecutor siegfried buback . even as new court proceedings were opened against some left-wing terrorists , brigitte mohnhaupt , a former raf terrorist , was released prematurely from prison after serving time for 24 years . a new debate erupted over whether german president horst köhler should pardon former raf terrorist , christian klar .
after a long , public and controversial discussion , köhler decided no to do so .
terrorism , both from the past as well as future threats , is bound to grab a prominent place on germany 's political agenda in 2008 as well . daphne antachopoulos -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it was n't all about islamist terrorism . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble consistently grabbed headlines this year as he rolled out new counter-terrorism proposals nearly every other week . from the use of spying software on computers , deadly force in the skies to increased surveillance in the cities and the collection of citizens ' biometric data , schäuble polarized and provoked with his bulging catalogue of security measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble routinely hogged headlines in 2007 " the threat posed by terrorism exists here too .
whether we like it or not : we 're not some blissful island , " schäuble said at the beginning of the year . a setback and a triumph in february , germany 's highest court , dealt a blow to schäuble 's plan for online searches , saying there was no legal basis for the measure and it thus violated the constitution . the plan includes sending e-mails attached with trojan horse software to suspected terrorists .
once opened , the software would secretly install itself onto a computer and send data to police computers as soon as the user went online .
the program would also be able to monitor keystrokes , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers without the suspect realizing the search had taken place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online searches using spy software stirred controversy the court 's decision was welcomed by germany 's social democrats , the junior coalition partner to the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- of which schäuble is a member .
it also relieved many proponents of civil liberties who worried the measure would severely infringe privacy and personal freedom . but a month later , the minister pushed through another controversial measure : a single computer database that allows both police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership in terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany in light of abuses under the nazis and by communist east germany . jörg ziercke , head of germany 's federal criminal office , insisted that the new tool was indispensable in fighting modern terrorism . " the police must use this technological progress to keep up with perpetrators and should not allow them to claim cyberspace as a protective space for themselves , " ziercke said at the time .
" we need this instrument particularly to uncover criminal networks in terrorism , organized crime , child pornography , economic crime , human trafficking and the arms trade . " controversial use of force in early september , the arrest of three suspected terrorists who allegedly planned attacks on the frankfurt airport and an american military base bolstered schäuble 's demands for further far-reaching measures to boost security .
they included proposals to deploy germany 's army , the bundeswehr , within the country in the case of an emergency and to shoot down hijacked planes with terrorists on board if the aircraft were to be used as a weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung sparked an uproar with proposals to shoot down hijacked planes defense minister franz josef jung , a fellow cdu member , said he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 . the proposal unleashed a storm of opposition in germany among left-wing parties . " prevention and criminal prosecution is the job of the police and it should remain that way , " said claudia roth , head of the opposition green party .
" this distinction has to be upheld and defended otherwise the rule of law will be buried . " one measure that passed , albeit in the face of tough opposition , was the decision to add fingerprints to germany 's biometric passports from nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 26.12.2007 german politics marked by heated security debates in 2007 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security is one of berlin 's major priorities the fight against terrorism and a slew of new security measures sparked frenzied debate in germany this year , after the foiling of a major terrorist attack .
but it was n't all about islamist terrorism . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble consistently grabbed headlines this year as he rolled out new counter-terrorism proposals nearly every other week . from the use of spying software on computers , deadly force in the skies to increased surveillance in the cities and the collection of citizens ' biometric data , schäuble polarized and provoked with his bulging catalogue of security measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble routinely hogged headlines in 2007 " the threat posed by terrorism exists here too .
whether we like it or not : we 're not some blissful island , " schäuble said at the beginning of the year . a setback and a triumph in february , germany 's highest court , dealt a blow to schäuble 's plan for online searches , saying there was no legal basis for the measure and it thus violated the constitution . the plan includes sending e-mails attached with trojan horse software to suspected terrorists .
once opened , the software would secretly install itself onto a computer and send data to police computers as soon as the user went online .
the program would also be able to monitor keystrokes , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers without the suspect realizing the search had taken place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online searches using spy software stirred controversy the court 's decision was welcomed by germany 's social democrats , the junior coalition partner to the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- of which schäuble is a member .
it also relieved many proponents of civil liberties who worried the measure would severely infringe privacy and personal freedom . but a month later , the minister pushed through another controversial measure : a single computer database that allows both police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership in terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany in light of abuses under the nazis and by communist east germany . jörg ziercke , head of germany 's federal criminal office , insisted that the new tool was indispensable in fighting modern terrorism . " the police must use this technological progress to keep up with perpetrators and should not allow them to claim cyberspace as a protective space for themselves , " ziercke said at the time .
" we need this instrument particularly to uncover criminal networks in terrorism , organized crime , child pornography , economic crime , human trafficking and the arms trade . " controversial use of force in early september , the arrest of three suspected terrorists who allegedly planned attacks on the frankfurt airport and an american military base bolstered schäuble 's demands for further far-reaching measures to boost security .
they included proposals to deploy germany 's army , the bundeswehr , within the country in the case of an emergency and to shoot down hijacked planes with terrorists on board if the aircraft were to be used as a weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung sparked an uproar with proposals to shoot down hijacked planes defense minister franz josef jung , a fellow cdu member , said he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 . the proposal unleashed a storm of opposition in germany among left-wing parties . " prevention and criminal prosecution is the job of the police and it should remain that way , " said claudia roth , head of the opposition green party .
" this distinction has to be upheld and defended otherwise the rule of law will be buried . " one measure that passed , albeit in the face of tough opposition , was the decision to add fingerprints to germany 's biometric passports from nov .

the radio-frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- chip in the german biometric passport , which came into use in 2005 , already includes facial recognition data . far-right crimes remain a worry while fierce debate is expected to continue next year on schäuble 's security measures , islamist terrorism was n't the only topic that occupied the attention of german policymakers in 2007 . in may , germany 's office for the protection of the constitution said it had registered 1,115 far-right crimes in 2006 - an increase of nearly 10 percent against the previous year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the victims of the racially-motivated attack on indians in august a few high-profile racially-motivated crimes , including an attack on a group of indians and an assault on a theater group by right-wing thugs in eastern germany , made headlines . the social democrats demanded a renewed ban on the far-right npd party in the face of warnings that the constitutional court would throw out the case as it had four years previously . holger hövelmann , interior minister of the eastern state of saxony-anhalt , where most of the crimes were committed , warned that right-wing extremism posed a serious threat . " right-wing extremism in our country is no longer a marginal phenomenon in our society , rather it presents with us with a central challenge , " hövelmann said .
" largely unnoticed by the public , structures have emerged that question our free democratic principles .
right-wing extremism has gradually begun to seep into daily life . " a threat from the far left debates on domestic security were also dominated by the danger posed by radical left-wing groups .
the discussion was fuelled by strong protests and demonstrations by anti-globalization groups in the run-up to the g8 summit in germany in june . the history of left-wing terrorism in germany also played a big role as this year marked 30 years since the so-called " german autumn , " when the left-wing terrorist group raf unleashed a wave of violence and fear with high-profile kidnappings and murders of influential figures in the german establishment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanns martin schleyer was kidnapped and murdered by the raf numerous retrospectives and massive media coverage kept alive the memory of the murder of hanns martin schleyer , the president of the federation of german industries , and federal prosecutor siegfried buback . even as new court proceedings were opened against some left-wing terrorists , brigitte mohnhaupt , a former raf terrorist , was released prematurely from prison after serving time for 24 years . a new debate erupted over whether german president horst köhler should pardon former raf terrorist , christian klar .
after a long , public and controversial discussion , köhler decided no to do so .
terrorism , both from the past as well as future threats , is bound to grab a prominent place on germany 's political agenda in 2008 as well . daphne antachopoulos -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 26.12.2007 german politics marked by heated security debates in 2007 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security is one of berlin 's major priorities the fight against terrorism and a slew of new security measures sparked frenzied debate in germany this year , after the foiling of a major terrorist attack .
but it was n't all about islamist terrorism . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble consistently grabbed headlines this year as he rolled out new counter-terrorism proposals nearly every other week . from the use of spying software on computers , deadly force in the skies to increased surveillance in the cities and the collection of citizens ' biometric data , schäuble polarized and provoked with his bulging catalogue of security measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble routinely hogged headlines in 2007 " the threat posed by terrorism exists here too .
whether we like it or not : we 're not some blissful island , " schäuble said at the beginning of the year . a setback and a triumph in february , germany 's highest court , dealt a blow to schäuble 's plan for online searches , saying there was no legal basis for the measure and it thus violated the constitution . the plan includes sending e-mails attached with trojan horse software to suspected terrorists .
once opened , the software would secretly install itself onto a computer and send data to police computers as soon as the user went online .
the program would also be able to monitor keystrokes , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers without the suspect realizing the search had taken place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online searches using spy software stirred controversy the court 's decision was welcomed by germany 's social democrats , the junior coalition partner to the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- of which schäuble is a member .
it also relieved many proponents of civil liberties who worried the measure would severely infringe privacy and personal freedom . but a month later , the minister pushed through another controversial measure : a single computer database that allows both police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership in terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany in light of abuses under the nazis and by communist east germany . jörg ziercke , head of germany 's federal criminal office , insisted that the new tool was indispensable in fighting modern terrorism . " the police must use this technological progress to keep up with perpetrators and should not allow them to claim cyberspace as a protective space for themselves , " ziercke said at the time .
" we need this instrument particularly to uncover criminal networks in terrorism , organized crime , child pornography , economic crime , human trafficking and the arms trade . " controversial use of force in early september , the arrest of three suspected terrorists who allegedly planned attacks on the frankfurt airport and an american military base bolstered schäuble 's demands for further far-reaching measures to boost security .
they included proposals to deploy germany 's army , the bundeswehr , within the country in the case of an emergency and to shoot down hijacked planes with terrorists on board if the aircraft were to be used as a weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung sparked an uproar with proposals to shoot down hijacked planes defense minister franz josef jung , a fellow cdu member , said he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 . the proposal unleashed a storm of opposition in germany among left-wing parties . " prevention and criminal prosecution is the job of the police and it should remain that way , " said claudia roth , head of the opposition green party .
" this distinction has to be upheld and defended otherwise the rule of law will be buried . " one measure that passed , albeit in the face of tough opposition , was the decision to add fingerprints to germany 's biometric passports from nov .
1 .
the radio-frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- chip in the german biometric passport , which came into use in 2005 , already includes facial recognition data . far-right crimes remain a worry while fierce debate is expected to continue next year on schäuble 's security measures , islamist terrorism was n't the only topic that occupied the attention of german policymakers in 2007 . in may , germany 's office for the protection of the constitution said it had registered 1,115 far-right crimes in 2006 - an increase of nearly 10 percent against the previous year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the victims of the racially-motivated attack on indians in august a few high-profile racially-motivated crimes , including an attack on a group of indians and an assault on a theater group by right-wing thugs in eastern germany , made headlines . the social democrats demanded a renewed ban on the far-right npd party in the face of warnings that the constitutional court would throw out the case as it had four years previously . holger hövelmann , interior minister of the eastern state of saxony-anhalt , where most of the crimes were committed , warned that right-wing extremism posed a serious threat . " right-wing extremism in our country is no longer a marginal phenomenon in our society , rather it presents with us with a central challenge , " hövelmann said .
" largely unnoticed by the public , structures have emerged that question our free democratic principles .
right-wing extremism has gradually begun to seep into daily life . " a threat from the far left debates on domestic security were also dominated by the danger posed by radical left-wing groups .
the discussion was fuelled by strong protests and demonstrations by anti-globalization groups in the run-up to the g8 summit in germany in june . the history of left-wing terrorism in germany also played a big role as this year marked 30 years since the so-called " german autumn , " when the left-wing terrorist group raf unleashed a wave of violence and fear with high-profile kidnappings and murders of influential figures in the german establishment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanns martin schleyer was kidnapped and murdered by the raf numerous retrospectives and massive media coverage kept alive the memory of the murder of hanns martin schleyer , the president of the federation of german industries , and federal prosecutor siegfried buback . even as new court proceedings were opened against some left-wing terrorists , brigitte mohnhaupt , a former raf terrorist , was released prematurely from prison after serving time for 24 years . a new debate erupted over whether german president horst köhler should pardon former raf terrorist , christian klar .
after a long , public and controversial discussion , köhler decided no to do so .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 26.12.2007 german politics marked by heated security debates in 2007 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security is one of berlin 's major priorities the fight against terrorism and a slew of new security measures sparked frenzied debate in germany this year , after the foiling of a major terrorist attack .
but it was n't all about islamist terrorism . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble consistently grabbed headlines this year as he rolled out new counter-terrorism proposals nearly every other week . from the use of spying software on computers , deadly force in the skies to increased surveillance in the cities and the collection of citizens ' biometric data , schäuble polarized and provoked with his bulging catalogue of security measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble routinely hogged headlines in 2007 " the threat posed by terrorism exists here too .
whether we like it or not : we 're not some blissful island , " schäuble said at the beginning of the year . a setback and a triumph in february , germany 's highest court , dealt a blow to schäuble 's plan for online searches , saying there was no legal basis for the measure and it thus violated the constitution . the plan includes sending e-mails attached with trojan horse software to suspected terrorists .
once opened , the software would secretly install itself onto a computer and send data to police computers as soon as the user went online .
the program would also be able to monitor keystrokes , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers without the suspect realizing the search had taken place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online searches using spy software stirred controversy the court 's decision was welcomed by germany 's social democrats , the junior coalition partner to the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- of which schäuble is a member .
it also relieved many proponents of civil liberties who worried the measure would severely infringe privacy and personal freedom . but a month later , the minister pushed through another controversial measure : a single computer database that allows both police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership in terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany in light of abuses under the nazis and by communist east germany . jörg ziercke , head of germany 's federal criminal office , insisted that the new tool was indispensable in fighting modern terrorism . " the police must use this technological progress to keep up with perpetrators and should not allow them to claim cyberspace as a protective space for themselves , " ziercke said at the time .
" we need this instrument particularly to uncover criminal networks in terrorism , organized crime , child pornography , economic crime , human trafficking and the arms trade . " controversial use of force in early september , the arrest of three suspected terrorists who allegedly planned attacks on the frankfurt airport and an american military base bolstered schäuble 's demands for further far-reaching measures to boost security .
they included proposals to deploy germany 's army , the bundeswehr , within the country in the case of an emergency and to shoot down hijacked planes with terrorists on board if the aircraft were to be used as a weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung sparked an uproar with proposals to shoot down hijacked planes defense minister franz josef jung , a fellow cdu member , said he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 . the proposal unleashed a storm of opposition in germany among left-wing parties . " prevention and criminal prosecution is the job of the police and it should remain that way , " said claudia roth , head of the opposition green party .
" this distinction has to be upheld and defended otherwise the rule of law will be buried . " one measure that passed , albeit in the face of tough opposition , was the decision to add fingerprints to germany 's biometric passports from nov .
1 .
the radio-frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- chip in the german biometric passport , which came into use in 2005 , already includes facial recognition data . far-right crimes remain a worry while fierce debate is expected to continue next year on schäuble 's security measures , islamist terrorism was n't the only topic that occupied the attention of german policymakers in 2007 . in may , germany 's office for the protection of the constitution said it had registered 1,115 far-right crimes in 2006 - an increase of nearly 10 percent against the previous year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the victims of the racially-motivated attack on indians in august a few high-profile racially-motivated crimes , including an attack on a group of indians and an assault on a theater group by right-wing thugs in eastern germany , made headlines . the social democrats demanded a renewed ban on the far-right npd party in the face of warnings that the constitutional court would throw out the case as it had four years previously . holger hövelmann , interior minister of the eastern state of saxony-anhalt , where most of the crimes were committed , warned that right-wing extremism posed a serious threat . " right-wing extremism in our country is no longer a marginal phenomenon in our society , rather it presents with us with a central challenge , " hövelmann said .
" largely unnoticed by the public , structures have emerged that question our free democratic principles .
right-wing extremism has gradually begun to seep into daily life . " a threat from the far left debates on domestic security were also dominated by the danger posed by radical left-wing groups .
the discussion was fuelled by strong protests and demonstrations by anti-globalization groups in the run-up to the g8 summit in germany in june . the history of left-wing terrorism in germany also played a big role as this year marked 30 years since the so-called " german autumn , " when the left-wing terrorist group raf unleashed a wave of violence and fear with high-profile kidnappings and murders of influential figures in the german establishment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanns martin schleyer was kidnapped and murdered by the raf numerous retrospectives and massive media coverage kept alive the memory of the murder of hanns martin schleyer , the president of the federation of german industries , and federal prosecutor siegfried buback . even as new court proceedings were opened against some left-wing terrorists , brigitte mohnhaupt , a former raf terrorist , was released prematurely from prison after serving time for 24 years . a new debate erupted over whether german president horst köhler should pardon former raf terrorist , christian klar .
after a long , public and controversial discussion , köhler decided no to do so .
terrorism , both from the past as well as future threats , is bound to grab a prominent place on germany 's political agenda in 2008 as well . daphne antachopoulos -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it was n't all about islamist terrorism . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble consistently grabbed headlines this year as he rolled out new counter-terrorism proposals nearly every other week . from the use of spying software on computers , deadly force in the skies to increased surveillance in the cities and the collection of citizens ' biometric data , schäuble polarized and provoked with his bulging catalogue of security measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble routinely hogged headlines in 2007 " the threat posed by terrorism exists here too .
whether we like it or not : we 're not some blissful island , " schäuble said at the beginning of the year . a setback and a triumph in february , germany 's highest court , dealt a blow to schäuble 's plan for online searches , saying there was no legal basis for the measure and it thus violated the constitution . the plan includes sending e-mails attached with trojan horse software to suspected terrorists .
once opened , the software would secretly install itself onto a computer and send data to police computers as soon as the user went online .
the program would also be able to monitor keystrokes , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers without the suspect realizing the search had taken place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online searches using spy software stirred controversy the court 's decision was welcomed by germany 's social democrats , the junior coalition partner to the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- of which schäuble is a member .
it also relieved many proponents of civil liberties who worried the measure would severely infringe privacy and personal freedom . but a month later , the minister pushed through another controversial measure : a single computer database that allows both police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership in terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany in light of abuses under the nazis and by communist east germany . jörg ziercke , head of germany 's federal criminal office , insisted that the new tool was indispensable in fighting modern terrorism . " the police must use this technological progress to keep up with perpetrators and should not allow them to claim cyberspace as a protective space for themselves , " ziercke said at the time .
" we need this instrument particularly to uncover criminal networks in terrorism , organized crime , child pornography , economic crime , human trafficking and the arms trade . " controversial use of force in early september , the arrest of three suspected terrorists who allegedly planned attacks on the frankfurt airport and an american military base bolstered schäuble 's demands for further far-reaching measures to boost security .
they included proposals to deploy germany 's army , the bundeswehr , within the country in the case of an emergency and to shoot down hijacked planes with terrorists on board if the aircraft were to be used as a weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung sparked an uproar with proposals to shoot down hijacked planes defense minister franz josef jung , a fellow cdu member , said he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 . the proposal unleashed a storm of opposition in germany among left-wing parties . " prevention and criminal prosecution is the job of the police and it should remain that way , " said claudia roth , head of the opposition green party .
" this distinction has to be upheld and defended otherwise the rule of law will be buried . " one measure that passed , albeit in the face of tough opposition , was the decision to add fingerprints to germany 's biometric passports from nov .

the radio-frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- chip in the german biometric passport , which came into use in 2005 , already includes facial recognition data . far-right crimes remain a worry while fierce debate is expected to continue next year on schäuble 's security measures , islamist terrorism was n't the only topic that occupied the attention of german policymakers in 2007 . in may , germany 's office for the protection of the constitution said it had registered 1,115 far-right crimes in 2006 - an increase of nearly 10 percent against the previous year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the victims of the racially-motivated attack on indians in august a few high-profile racially-motivated crimes , including an attack on a group of indians and an assault on a theater group by right-wing thugs in eastern germany , made headlines . the social democrats demanded a renewed ban on the far-right npd party in the face of warnings that the constitutional court would throw out the case as it had four years previously . holger hövelmann , interior minister of the eastern state of saxony-anhalt , where most of the crimes were committed , warned that right-wing extremism posed a serious threat . " right-wing extremism in our country is no longer a marginal phenomenon in our society , rather it presents with us with a central challenge , " hövelmann said .
" largely unnoticed by the public , structures have emerged that question our free democratic principles .
right-wing extremism has gradually begun to seep into daily life . " a threat from the far left debates on domestic security were also dominated by the danger posed by radical left-wing groups .
the discussion was fuelled by strong protests and demonstrations by anti-globalization groups in the run-up to the g8 summit in germany in june . the history of left-wing terrorism in germany also played a big role as this year marked 30 years since the so-called " german autumn , " when the left-wing terrorist group raf unleashed a wave of violence and fear with high-profile kidnappings and murders of influential figures in the german establishment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanns martin schleyer was kidnapped and murdered by the raf numerous retrospectives and massive media coverage kept alive the memory of the murder of hanns martin schleyer , the president of the federation of german industries , and federal prosecutor siegfried buback . even as new court proceedings were opened against some left-wing terrorists , brigitte mohnhaupt , a former raf terrorist , was released prematurely from prison after serving time for 24 years . a new debate erupted over whether german president horst köhler should pardon former raf terrorist , christian klar .
after a long , public and controversial discussion , köhler decided no to do so .

but it was n't all about islamist terrorism . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble consistently grabbed headlines this year as he rolled out new counter-terrorism proposals nearly every other week . from the use of spying software on computers , deadly force in the skies to increased surveillance in the cities and the collection of citizens ' biometric data , schäuble polarized and provoked with his bulging catalogue of security measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble routinely hogged headlines in 2007 " the threat posed by terrorism exists here too .
whether we like it or not : we 're not some blissful island , " schäuble said at the beginning of the year . a setback and a triumph in february , germany 's highest court , dealt a blow to schäuble 's plan for online searches , saying there was no legal basis for the measure and it thus violated the constitution . the plan includes sending e-mails attached with trojan horse software to suspected terrorists .
once opened , the software would secretly install itself onto a computer and send data to police computers as soon as the user went online .
the program would also be able to monitor keystrokes , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers without the suspect realizing the search had taken place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online searches using spy software stirred controversy the court 's decision was welcomed by germany 's social democrats , the junior coalition partner to the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- of which schäuble is a member .
it also relieved many proponents of civil liberties who worried the measure would severely infringe privacy and personal freedom . but a month later , the minister pushed through another controversial measure : a single computer database that allows both police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership in terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany in light of abuses under the nazis and by communist east germany . jörg ziercke , head of germany 's federal criminal office , insisted that the new tool was indispensable in fighting modern terrorism . " the police must use this technological progress to keep up with perpetrators and should not allow them to claim cyberspace as a protective space for themselves , " ziercke said at the time .
" we need this instrument particularly to uncover criminal networks in terrorism , organized crime , child pornography , economic crime , human trafficking and the arms trade . " controversial use of force in early september , the arrest of three suspected terrorists who allegedly planned attacks on the frankfurt airport and an american military base bolstered schäuble 's demands for further far-reaching measures to boost security .
they included proposals to deploy germany 's army , the bundeswehr , within the country in the case of an emergency and to shoot down hijacked planes with terrorists on board if the aircraft were to be used as a weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung sparked an uproar with proposals to shoot down hijacked planes defense minister franz josef jung , a fellow cdu member , said he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 . the proposal unleashed a storm of opposition in germany among left-wing parties . " prevention and criminal prosecution is the job of the police and it should remain that way , " said claudia roth , head of the opposition green party .
" this distinction has to be upheld and defended otherwise the rule of law will be buried . " one measure that passed , albeit in the face of tough opposition , was the decision to add fingerprints to germany 's biometric passports from nov .
1 .
the radio-frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- chip in the german biometric passport , which came into use in 2005 , already includes facial recognition data . far-right crimes remain a worry while fierce debate is expected to continue next year on schäuble 's security measures , islamist terrorism was n't the only topic that occupied the attention of german policymakers in 2007 . in may , germany 's office for the protection of the constitution said it had registered 1,115 far-right crimes in 2006 - an increase of nearly 10 percent against the previous year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the victims of the racially-motivated attack on indians in august a few high-profile racially-motivated crimes , including an attack on a group of indians and an assault on a theater group by right-wing thugs in eastern germany , made headlines . the social democrats demanded a renewed ban on the far-right npd party in the face of warnings that the constitutional court would throw out the case as it had four years previously . holger hövelmann , interior minister of the eastern state of saxony-anhalt , where most of the crimes were committed , warned that right-wing extremism posed a serious threat . " right-wing extremism in our country is no longer a marginal phenomenon in our society , rather it presents with us with a central challenge , " hövelmann said .
" largely unnoticed by the public , structures have emerged that question our free democratic principles .
right-wing extremism has gradually begun to seep into daily life . " a threat from the far left debates on domestic security were also dominated by the danger posed by radical left-wing groups .
the discussion was fuelled by strong protests and demonstrations by anti-globalization groups in the run-up to the g8 summit in germany in june . the history of left-wing terrorism in germany also played a big role as this year marked 30 years since the so-called " german autumn , " when the left-wing terrorist group raf unleashed a wave of violence and fear with high-profile kidnappings and murders of influential figures in the german establishment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanns martin schleyer was kidnapped and murdered by the raf numerous retrospectives and massive media coverage kept alive the memory of the murder of hanns martin schleyer , the president of the federation of german industries , and federal prosecutor siegfried buback . even as new court proceedings were opened against some left-wing terrorists , brigitte mohnhaupt , a former raf terrorist , was released prematurely from prison after serving time for 24 years . a new debate erupted over whether german president horst köhler should pardon former raf terrorist , christian klar .
after a long , public and controversial discussion , köhler decided no to do so .
terrorism , both from the past as well as future threats , is bound to grab a prominent place on germany 's political agenda in 2008 as well . daphne antachopoulos -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

brewery association managing director peter hahn told die welt newspaper on monday , dec .

statisticians reckon that by 2050 the group of people past the age of 60 in germany will be twice as high as those under 20 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soccer world cup last year did wonders for beer sales in germany only once in the last nine years did beer consumption in germany rise - in 2006 when it hosted the soccer world cup .
breweries could be hurt according to figures compiled by the japanese brewing company kirin , germany is third on the list of per capita beer consumption , behind the czech republic and ireland .
hahn predicted the decline would begin to hurt the 1,284 breweries in germany - more than in any other country .
while no closures were likely in the immediate future , there would probably be mergers and acquisitions , he said .
" we are going to see an increased concentration in favor of the larger brewing companies , " hahn said .
he also predicted little or no improvement in the year ahead .
" we will have to get used to long-term declines in consumption figures , " hahn told the paper . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it was n't all about islamist terrorism . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble consistently grabbed headlines this year as he rolled out new counter-terrorism proposals nearly every other week . from the use of spying software on computers , deadly force in the skies to increased surveillance in the cities and the collection of citizens ' biometric data , schäuble polarized and provoked with his bulging catalogue of security measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble routinely hogged headlines in 2007 " the threat posed by terrorism exists here too .
whether we like it or not : we 're not some blissful island , " schäuble said at the beginning of the year . a setback and a triumph in february , germany 's highest court , dealt a blow to schäuble 's plan for online searches , saying there was no legal basis for the measure and it thus violated the constitution . the plan includes sending e-mails attached with trojan horse software to suspected terrorists .
once opened , the software would secretly install itself onto a computer and send data to police computers as soon as the user went online .
the program would also be able to monitor keystrokes , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers without the suspect realizing the search had taken place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online searches using spy software stirred controversy the court 's decision was welcomed by germany 's social democrats , the junior coalition partner to the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- of which schäuble is a member .
it also relieved many proponents of civil liberties who worried the measure would severely infringe privacy and personal freedom . but a month later , the minister pushed through another controversial measure : a single computer database that allows both police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership in terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany in light of abuses under the nazis and by communist east germany . jörg ziercke , head of germany 's federal criminal office , insisted that the new tool was indispensable in fighting modern terrorism . " the police must use this technological progress to keep up with perpetrators and should not allow them to claim cyberspace as a protective space for themselves , " ziercke said at the time .
" we need this instrument particularly to uncover criminal networks in terrorism , organized crime , child pornography , economic crime , human trafficking and the arms trade . " controversial use of force in early september , the arrest of three suspected terrorists who allegedly planned attacks on the frankfurt airport and an american military base bolstered schäuble 's demands for further far-reaching measures to boost security .
they included proposals to deploy germany 's army , the bundeswehr , within the country in the case of an emergency and to shoot down hijacked planes with terrorists on board if the aircraft were to be used as a weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung sparked an uproar with proposals to shoot down hijacked planes defense minister franz josef jung , a fellow cdu member , said he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 . the proposal unleashed a storm of opposition in germany among left-wing parties . " prevention and criminal prosecution is the job of the police and it should remain that way , " said claudia roth , head of the opposition green party .
" this distinction has to be upheld and defended otherwise the rule of law will be buried . " one measure that passed , albeit in the face of tough opposition , was the decision to add fingerprints to germany 's biometric passports from nov .
1 .
the radio-frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- chip in the german biometric passport , which came into use in 2005 , already includes facial recognition data . far-right crimes remain a worry while fierce debate is expected to continue next year on schäuble 's security measures , islamist terrorism was n't the only topic that occupied the attention of german policymakers in 2007 . in may , germany 's office for the protection of the constitution said it had registered 1,115 far-right crimes in 2006 - an increase of nearly 10 percent against the previous year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the victims of the racially-motivated attack on indians in august a few high-profile racially-motivated crimes , including an attack on a group of indians and an assault on a theater group by right-wing thugs in eastern germany , made headlines . the social democrats demanded a renewed ban on the far-right npd party in the face of warnings that the constitutional court would throw out the case as it had four years previously . holger hövelmann , interior minister of the eastern state of saxony-anhalt , where most of the crimes were committed , warned that right-wing extremism posed a serious threat . " right-wing extremism in our country is no longer a marginal phenomenon in our society , rather it presents with us with a central challenge , " hövelmann said .
" largely unnoticed by the public , structures have emerged that question our free democratic principles .
right-wing extremism has gradually begun to seep into daily life . " a threat from the far left debates on domestic security were also dominated by the danger posed by radical left-wing groups .
the discussion was fuelled by strong protests and demonstrations by anti-globalization groups in the run-up to the g8 summit in germany in june . the history of left-wing terrorism in germany also played a big role as this year marked 30 years since the so-called " german autumn , " when the left-wing terrorist group raf unleashed a wave of violence and fear with high-profile kidnappings and murders of influential figures in the german establishment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanns martin schleyer was kidnapped and murdered by the raf numerous retrospectives and massive media coverage kept alive the memory of the murder of hanns martin schleyer , the president of the federation of german industries , and federal prosecutor siegfried buback . even as new court proceedings were opened against some left-wing terrorists , brigitte mohnhaupt , a former raf terrorist , was released prematurely from prison after serving time for 24 years . a new debate erupted over whether german president horst köhler should pardon former raf terrorist , christian klar .
after a long , public and controversial discussion , köhler decided no to do so .
terrorism , both from the past as well as future threats , is bound to grab a prominent place on germany 's political agenda in 2008 as well . daphne antachopoulos -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 26.12.2007 german politics marked by heated security debates in 2007 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security is one of berlin 's major priorities the fight against terrorism and a slew of new security measures sparked frenzied debate in germany this year , after the foiling of a major terrorist attack .
but it was n't all about islamist terrorism . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble consistently grabbed headlines this year as he rolled out new counter-terrorism proposals nearly every other week . from the use of spying software on computers , deadly force in the skies to increased surveillance in the cities and the collection of citizens ' biometric data , schäuble polarized and provoked with his bulging catalogue of security measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble routinely hogged headlines in 2007 " the threat posed by terrorism exists here too .
whether we like it or not : we 're not some blissful island , " schäuble said at the beginning of the year . a setback and a triumph in february , germany 's highest court , dealt a blow to schäuble 's plan for online searches , saying there was no legal basis for the measure and it thus violated the constitution . the plan includes sending e-mails attached with trojan horse software to suspected terrorists .
once opened , the software would secretly install itself onto a computer and send data to police computers as soon as the user went online .
the program would also be able to monitor keystrokes , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers without the suspect realizing the search had taken place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online searches using spy software stirred controversy the court 's decision was welcomed by germany 's social democrats , the junior coalition partner to the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- of which schäuble is a member .
it also relieved many proponents of civil liberties who worried the measure would severely infringe privacy and personal freedom . but a month later , the minister pushed through another controversial measure : a single computer database that allows both police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership in terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany in light of abuses under the nazis and by communist east germany . jörg ziercke , head of germany 's federal criminal office , insisted that the new tool was indispensable in fighting modern terrorism . " the police must use this technological progress to keep up with perpetrators and should not allow them to claim cyberspace as a protective space for themselves , " ziercke said at the time .
" we need this instrument particularly to uncover criminal networks in terrorism , organized crime , child pornography , economic crime , human trafficking and the arms trade . " controversial use of force in early september , the arrest of three suspected terrorists who allegedly planned attacks on the frankfurt airport and an american military base bolstered schäuble 's demands for further far-reaching measures to boost security .
they included proposals to deploy germany 's army , the bundeswehr , within the country in the case of an emergency and to shoot down hijacked planes with terrorists on board if the aircraft were to be used as a weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung sparked an uproar with proposals to shoot down hijacked planes defense minister franz josef jung , a fellow cdu member , said he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 . the proposal unleashed a storm of opposition in germany among left-wing parties . " prevention and criminal prosecution is the job of the police and it should remain that way , " said claudia roth , head of the opposition green party .
" this distinction has to be upheld and defended otherwise the rule of law will be buried . " one measure that passed , albeit in the face of tough opposition , was the decision to add fingerprints to germany 's biometric passports from nov .
1 .
the radio-frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- chip in the german biometric passport , which came into use in 2005 , already includes facial recognition data . far-right crimes remain a worry while fierce debate is expected to continue next year on schäuble 's security measures , islamist terrorism was n't the only topic that occupied the attention of german policymakers in 2007 . in may , germany 's office for the protection of the constitution said it had registered 1,115 far-right crimes in 2006 - an increase of nearly 10 percent against the previous year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the victims of the racially-motivated attack on indians in august a few high-profile racially-motivated crimes , including an attack on a group of indians and an assault on a theater group by right-wing thugs in eastern germany , made headlines . the social democrats demanded a renewed ban on the far-right npd party in the face of warnings that the constitutional court would throw out the case as it had four years previously . holger hövelmann , interior minister of the eastern state of saxony-anhalt , where most of the crimes were committed , warned that right-wing extremism posed a serious threat . " right-wing extremism in our country is no longer a marginal phenomenon in our society , rather it presents with us with a central challenge , " hövelmann said .
" largely unnoticed by the public , structures have emerged that question our free democratic principles .
right-wing extremism has gradually begun to seep into daily life . " a threat from the far left debates on domestic security were also dominated by the danger posed by radical left-wing groups .
the discussion was fuelled by strong protests and demonstrations by anti-globalization groups in the run-up to the g8 summit in germany in june . the history of left-wing terrorism in germany also played a big role as this year marked 30 years since the so-called " german autumn , " when the left-wing terrorist group raf unleashed a wave of violence and fear with high-profile kidnappings and murders of influential figures in the german establishment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanns martin schleyer was kidnapped and murdered by the raf numerous retrospectives and massive media coverage kept alive the memory of the murder of hanns martin schleyer , the president of the federation of german industries , and federal prosecutor siegfried buback . even as new court proceedings were opened against some left-wing terrorists , brigitte mohnhaupt , a former raf terrorist , was released prematurely from prison after serving time for 24 years . a new debate erupted over whether german president horst köhler should pardon former raf terrorist , christian klar .
after a long , public and controversial discussion , köhler decided no to do so .
terrorism , both from the past as well as future threats , is bound to grab a prominent place on germany 's political agenda in 2008 as well . daphne antachopoulos -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it was n't all about islamist terrorism . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble consistently grabbed headlines this year as he rolled out new counter-terrorism proposals nearly every other week . from the use of spying software on computers , deadly force in the skies to increased surveillance in the cities and the collection of citizens ' biometric data , schäuble polarized and provoked with his bulging catalogue of security measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble routinely hogged headlines in 2007 " the threat posed by terrorism exists here too .
whether we like it or not : we 're not some blissful island , " schäuble said at the beginning of the year . a setback and a triumph in february , germany 's highest court , dealt a blow to schäuble 's plan for online searches , saying there was no legal basis for the measure and it thus violated the constitution . the plan includes sending e-mails attached with trojan horse software to suspected terrorists .
once opened , the software would secretly install itself onto a computer and send data to police computers as soon as the user went online .
the program would also be able to monitor keystrokes , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers without the suspect realizing the search had taken place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online searches using spy software stirred controversy the court 's decision was welcomed by germany 's social democrats , the junior coalition partner to the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- of which schäuble is a member .
it also relieved many proponents of civil liberties who worried the measure would severely infringe privacy and personal freedom . but a month later , the minister pushed through another controversial measure : a single computer database that allows both police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership in terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data . giving both police and intelligence services equal access to personal information about suspects is a sensitive issue in germany in light of abuses under the nazis and by communist east germany . jörg ziercke , head of germany 's federal criminal office , insisted that the new tool was indispensable in fighting modern terrorism . " the police must use this technological progress to keep up with perpetrators and should not allow them to claim cyberspace as a protective space for themselves , " ziercke said at the time .
" we need this instrument particularly to uncover criminal networks in terrorism , organized crime , child pornography , economic crime , human trafficking and the arms trade . " controversial use of force in early september , the arrest of three suspected terrorists who allegedly planned attacks on the frankfurt airport and an american military base bolstered schäuble 's demands for further far-reaching measures to boost security .
they included proposals to deploy germany 's army , the bundeswehr , within the country in the case of an emergency and to shoot down hijacked planes with terrorists on board if the aircraft were to be used as a weapon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung sparked an uproar with proposals to shoot down hijacked planes defense minister franz josef jung , a fellow cdu member , said he would not abide by a federal constitutional court ruling and would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane to prevent it from being used in a terrorist attack similar to the ones that occurred in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 . the proposal unleashed a storm of opposition in germany among left-wing parties . " prevention and criminal prosecution is the job of the police and it should remain that way , " said claudia roth , head of the opposition green party .
" this distinction has to be upheld and defended otherwise the rule of law will be buried . " one measure that passed , albeit in the face of tough opposition , was the decision to add fingerprints to germany 's biometric passports from nov .

the radio-frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- chip in the german biometric passport , which came into use in 2005 , already includes facial recognition data . far-right crimes remain a worry while fierce debate is expected to continue next year on schäuble 's security measures , islamist terrorism was n't the only topic that occupied the attention of german policymakers in 2007 . in may , germany 's office for the protection of the constitution said it had registered 1,115 far-right crimes in 2006 - an increase of nearly 10 percent against the previous year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the victims of the racially-motivated attack on indians in august a few high-profile racially-motivated crimes , including an attack on a group of indians and an assault on a theater group by right-wing thugs in eastern germany , made headlines . the social democrats demanded a renewed ban on the far-right npd party in the face of warnings that the constitutional court would throw out the case as it had four years previously . holger hövelmann , interior minister of the eastern state of saxony-anhalt , where most of the crimes were committed , warned that right-wing extremism posed a serious threat . " right-wing extremism in our country is no longer a marginal phenomenon in our society , rather it presents with us with a central challenge , " hövelmann said .
" largely unnoticed by the public , structures have emerged that question our free democratic principles .
right-wing extremism has gradually begun to seep into daily life . " a threat from the far left debates on domestic security were also dominated by the danger posed by radical left-wing groups .
the discussion was fuelled by strong protests and demonstrations by anti-globalization groups in the run-up to the g8 summit in germany in june . the history of left-wing terrorism in germany also played a big role as this year marked 30 years since the so-called " german autumn , " when the left-wing terrorist group raf unleashed a wave of violence and fear with high-profile kidnappings and murders of influential figures in the german establishment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanns martin schleyer was kidnapped and murdered by the raf numerous retrospectives and massive media coverage kept alive the memory of the murder of hanns martin schleyer , the president of the federation of german industries , and federal prosecutor siegfried buback . even as new court proceedings were opened against some left-wing terrorists , brigitte mohnhaupt , a former raf terrorist , was released prematurely from prison after serving time for 24 years . a new debate erupted over whether german president horst köhler should pardon former raf terrorist , christian klar .
after a long , public and controversial discussion , köhler decided no to do so .

so say industry watchers looking back on a year in which the field as a whole matured and signs emerged which show how the industry sector is developing .
during the year blizzard 's flagship title consolidated its hold on gamers as its subscriber base kept growing .
but debuts by age of conan , warhammer online and many others may mean that hold begins to weaken .
numbers game " we expected , like all the analysts , to see a dip in subscriptions in 2007 , " said paul younger , an editor at the inc gamers network .
" as it turns out we 've seen the rise and rise of wow . "
at the start of 2007 , the number of active subscribers playing world of warcraft was eight million but by the end of summer the number had passed 9.3 million .
world of warcraft dominates the online gaming world according to statistics gathered by nielsen the average wow player racks up 17 hours of play per week - 12 hours more than its nearest competitor the sims .
as such it was the most played pc game between april and november 2007 .
in online games such as world of warcraft players create an avatar or character , give them a profession and venture out into the game world to battle monsters , find treasure and turn their novice into a powerful hero or heroine .
mr younger said online games such as lord of the rings online , tabula rasa and hellgate : london were widely tipped to poach significant numbers of players from blizzard but , he said , it was not clear that had happened .
" there seems to be an inability by other massively multi-player game makers to capture what blizzard managed to capture , " said mr younger .
rob fahey , industry veteran and columnist for gameindustry.biz , said the new launches and continued success of wow showed how strong the industry had become .
" there 's plenty of choice out there for players now , " he said " you can even play massively multiplayer dancing games , if killing monsters is n't your thing . "
another sign of the growing maturity of online gaming was the notable failure of titles such as vanguard .
although released in february it was error prone and has taken months to become reliable enough .
" it 's clear that it 's no longer acceptable to release buggy games , and players are n't prepared to pay a monthly fee to test an unfinished product , " he said .
fantasy figures the importance of the final polish is also thought to be behind the delayed arrival of age of conan : hyborian adventures and warhammer online : age of reckoning .
both were originally due in 2007 but now are expected before next summer .
many see these as serious contenders to wow because like that game they trade on a long history of earlier works .
large-scale battles will be key in age of conan conan is familiar to many from robert e howard 's original stories , the films starring arnold schwarzenegger and the many contemporary novels that explored the world of the iconic barbarian .
warhammer is the creation of uk firm games workshop and has many fans who played the tabletop game , the role-playing system , the earlier games and has read the books set in its world .

so say industry watchers looking back on a year in which the field as a whole matured and signs emerged which show how the industry sector is developing .
during the year blizzard 's flagship title consolidated its hold on gamers as its subscriber base kept growing .
but debuts by age of conan , warhammer online and many others may mean that hold begins to weaken .
numbers game " we expected , like all the analysts , to see a dip in subscriptions in 2007 , " said paul younger , an editor at the inc gamers network .
" as it turns out we 've seen the rise and rise of wow . "
at the start of 2007 , the number of active subscribers playing world of warcraft was eight million but by the end of summer the number had passed 9.3 million .
world of warcraft dominates the online gaming world according to statistics gathered by nielsen the average wow player racks up 17 hours of play per week - 12 hours more than its nearest competitor the sims .
as such it was the most played pc game between april and november 2007 .
in online games such as world of warcraft players create an avatar or character , give them a profession and venture out into the game world to battle monsters , find treasure and turn their novice into a powerful hero or heroine .
mr younger said online games such as lord of the rings online , tabula rasa and hellgate : london were widely tipped to poach significant numbers of players from blizzard but , he said , it was not clear that had happened .
" there seems to be an inability by other massively multi-player game makers to capture what blizzard managed to capture , " said mr younger .
rob fahey , industry veteran and columnist for gameindustry.biz , said the new launches and continued success of wow showed how strong the industry had become .
" there 's plenty of choice out there for players now , " he said " you can even play massively multiplayer dancing games , if killing monsters is n't your thing . "
another sign of the growing maturity of online gaming was the notable failure of titles such as vanguard .
although released in february it was error prone and has taken months to become reliable enough .
" it 's clear that it 's no longer acceptable to release buggy games , and players are n't prepared to pay a monthly fee to test an unfinished product , " he said .
fantasy figures the importance of the final polish is also thought to be behind the delayed arrival of age of conan : hyborian adventures and warhammer online : age of reckoning .
both were originally due in 2007 but now are expected before next summer .
many see these as serious contenders to wow because like that game they trade on a long history of earlier works .
large-scale battles will be key in age of conan conan is familiar to many from robert e howard 's original stories , the films starring arnold schwarzenegger and the many contemporary novels that explored the world of the iconic barbarian .
warhammer is the creation of uk firm games workshop and has many fans who played the tabletop game , the role-playing system , the earlier games and has read the books set in its world .
perhaps more importantly the titles are attempting to move online gaming on from the mechanics established by blizzard .
in warhammer many areas of the game are contested and factions will battle to regain control of these areas .

so say industry watchers looking back on a year in which the field as a whole matured and signs emerged which show how the industry sector is developing .
during the year blizzard 's flagship title consolidated its hold on gamers as its subscriber base kept growing .
but debuts by age of conan , warhammer online and many others may mean that hold begins to weaken .
numbers game " we expected , like all the analysts , to see a dip in subscriptions in 2007 , " said paul younger , an editor at the inc gamers network .
" as it turns out we 've seen the rise and rise of wow . "
at the start of 2007 , the number of active subscribers playing world of warcraft was eight million but by the end of summer the number had passed 9.3 million .
world of warcraft dominates the online gaming world according to statistics gathered by nielsen the average wow player racks up 17 hours of play per week - 12 hours more than its nearest competitor the sims .
as such it was the most played pc game between april and november 2007 .
in online games such as world of warcraft players create an avatar or character , give them a profession and venture out into the game world to battle monsters , find treasure and turn their novice into a powerful hero or heroine .
mr younger said online games such as lord of the rings online , tabula rasa and hellgate : london were widely tipped to poach significant numbers of players from blizzard but , he said , it was not clear that had happened .
" there seems to be an inability by other massively multi-player game makers to capture what blizzard managed to capture , " said mr younger .

" there 's plenty of choice out there for players now , " he said " you can even play massively multiplayer dancing games , if killing monsters is n't your thing . "
another sign of the growing maturity of online gaming was the notable failure of titles such as vanguard .
although released in february it was error prone and has taken months to become reliable enough .
" it 's clear that it 's no longer acceptable to release buggy games , and players are n't prepared to pay a monthly fee to test an unfinished product , " he said .
fantasy figures the importance of the final polish is also thought to be behind the delayed arrival of age of conan : hyborian adventures and warhammer online : age of reckoning .

conan is familiar to many from robert e howard 's original stories , the films starring arnold schwarzenegger and the many contemporary novels that explored the world of the iconic barbarian .
warhammer is the creation of uk firm games workshop and has many fans who played the tabletop game , the role-playing system , the earlier games and has read the books set in its world .
perhaps more importantly the titles are attempting to move online gaming on from the mechanics established by blizzard .
in warhammer many areas of the game are contested and factions will battle to regain control of these areas .
solo players as well as those who prefer pitched battles will contribute to this back and forth that will see a lot of the game world 's territory change hands many times .
by contrast age of conan is explicitly aiming at a mature audience - in particular combat will be bloody and realistic .
the game will also allow player teams , or guilds , to set up and run their own cities or lay siege to each other 's strongholds .
but , said philip wride , boss of consultancy firm elysium gaming , it could be something entirely outside the field that has a big impact on online gamine in 2008 .
in the uk the byron review is scrutinising video games with a view to drawing up new regulations and guidelines governing them .
" it 's about educating parents more than anything and perhaps making changes in terms of rating systems , " he said .
this was likely to mean best practice guidelines for parents but may eventually involve new legislation .
" that would alter how online games are both portrayed and played , " said mr wride .

but will people love them any less ?
so there you are cruising around a picturesque village in the cotswolds in your aston martin rapide , eating your bacon sandwich covered in lashings of hp sauce and ready to chase it down with a bag of smarties .
what could be more british than that ?
a bond car , a sauce with the houses of parliament on the front and a sweet that has been a part of british childhood since 1937 .
but change is afoot .
aston martin is considering building the rapide abroad , smarties has moved production from york to hamburg in germany and the last bottle of british hp plopped mournfully off the line in aston in march , giving way to production in elst , in the netherlands .
in addition cadbury is moving curly wurly and other chocolates to factories in poland , and there has been a memorable but ultimately vain battle by the workers of treorchy in the rhondda valley to stop burberry taking production of its polo shirts out of the country .
critics of the move acidly pointed out the company 's boast of being " a luxury brand with a distinctive british sensibility " .
never mind luxury , could a british sensibility be manufactured in china , they asked .
when hp sauce made its decision , retired police officer and john bull impersonator ray egan went as far as occupying the roof of the factory in aston .
there were protesters with union jacks at westminster and an mp brandished a bottle in the commons .
the protesters asked how a firm that had launched a campaign to " save the proper british café " just weeks before the decision to move production was made , and which had produced special bottles designed by paul smith for a truly british season at harrods in 2005 , could have the gall to move to the netherlands .
but none could stop the move and heinz is unrepentant .
" it is more popular now , sales have gone up , people buy the product , they love the product , " a spokesman says .
" we did evaluate all sorts of options but we could n't close the considerable financial gap . "
slave labour the company says it is still fully committed to british manufacturing , with 80 % of all the food it sells in the uk made here .
smarties-owner nestle is equally bullish about its move to hamburg .
" smarties are n't going to taste any different , " a spokesman says , adding that sales have not taken a hit .
the company says other top brands such as quality street will not be moving to germany .
after all , quality strasse just does n't sound right .
manufacturing has been moving away from these shores for some decades , but if heinz and nestle are right , the british consumer does not care about even the most iconically british products shifting abroad .
is there no emotional attachment to british products that derives from where they are made ?
rune gustafson , chief executive of branding consultants interbrand , thinks not .
" people are actually aware of where products are made , provenance is important , but from a social aspect - people do n't want to be supporting slave labour , " he says .
" britain as a manufacturing nation has been declining for well over 50 years .
britishness in the past has meant made by british people in good conditions in good factories , maybe britishness in future will refer much more to its design . "
it is a distinction that was starkly made when dyson shifted production to malaysia from malmesbury in wiltshire in 2002 .
manufacturing jobs were lost , while research and design jobs remained .
perhaps a pattern had been set .
buy uk vs buy us to take the example of paul smith himself , despite being a quintessentially english designer much of his product range is made abroad .
if you buy a shirt from his paul smith london range , it is as likely to be made in italy as the uk .
what that label with " london " says is " designed here , not made here " .
and there is a case to be made that while much noise might be made by politicians about the quality of british craftsmanship and manufacture and the need to support domestic industry , there are very few people trying to directly persuade the british customer to do that . "
the big problem for us has been getting people to buy into it and become members " anthony gilsenan british made for quality type " buy british " into google and the first result you get is usually a site selling british food to expats in the us .
it 's not easy to find any kind of site advocating patriotic purchasing .
type " buy american " into the same search engine and you get a slew of entrepreneurs who are keen to tap into americans ' desire to support domestic manufacturing .
british consumer trends research group mintel says it has never done a survey into whether people prefer to support british manufacturing .
one of the few groups that is attempting to support british manufacturing is british made for quality , founded by four british businessmen in 2002 , which does its best to promote domestic industry .
but it seems to be an uphill struggle .
" when we launched we had phenomenal coverage , everything from radio 4 through to the financial times , " says director anthony gilsenan .
" we had 40 potential members .
that was some five years ago .
the big problem for us has been getting people to buy into it and become members .
it only costs £ 50 a year . "
of the few dozen firms that have joined up , thomas crapper traditional toilets and haddonstone garden ornaments are among the biggest names .
the superbrands , even those who do manufacture in britain , rarely seem to feel that advertising the fact would boost their profits .
the bmfq requirements are that a product is at least 65 % manufactured in the uk .
their efforts seem more aimed at guarding the dwindling manufacturing sector , than effecting any real sea change in the mind of the shopper .
" if we can keep what manufacturing we have alive and kicking , if we can do our small bit .
if you go to france , they all drive french cars .
we are becoming a service nation , " says mr gilsenan .
those brands that trumpet their britishness are often luxury labels that are not in the business of massive sales .
knitwear firm john smedley is one .
" economically it would make some sense to manufacture abroad but our particular brand has been established since 1784 on the same site in derbyshire and employs 450 people , " says brand manager dawne stubbs .
" the same families have made the same product for generations and the skills base means it is best to stay put . "
but john smedley produces only half a million garments a year and its main business is selling £ 100 jumpers in selfridges and harvey nichols .
it is never going to have the same effect on customers as that of a giant like marks and spencer , which long ago shifted most of its clothes production overseas .
if the owners of iconic british brands can take production abroad and still maintain sales , then that tells us all we need to know about the diluted nature of our relationship with what we buy and where it is made .
and this lukewarm attitude comes at a time when producers of food in the uk are preparing to benefit from the current obsession with food miles and the environment .
but in the case of manufacturing , the proof of the pudding seems to be in the buying .
a selection of your comments appears below .
i was given a wedgewood box set as a present , which coming from stoke was meant to remind me of home .
as i opened the parcel i was greeted with a very nice box and equally as attractive wedgewood china sitting in it .
it was only when i turned the box over and read the sticker on the bottom - " wedgewood , made in china " i have to admit my heart sank and the love and pride i once had for a nice piece of clay vanished in a flash david mcdermid , stockholm sorry , but as soon as production of these brands moves abroad , i stop buying them .
the worst example is tvr ; i 've always wanted one because they were both british and the best , but if the new owner starts production in italy , i 'm not interested .
they belong in blackpool just as smarties belong in york .
tony fisher , york i will never buy cadbury products , hp sauce , rowntrees or any products from companies who export jobs .
we are being sold out , jobs are going and it may have escaped the companies notice , but if people loose their jobs they do n't have the money to buy the products .
there used to be a call " export or die " just after the second world war , so i have been told .
now it 's more like " export and die " .
chris , somerset i can understand moving production of stuff to poland or china , where it has to be cheaper to operate , but how the hell can it be cheaper to make stuff in germany and holland ?
the cost of doing business , the tax burden and the red tape here must be much worse than generally acknowledged .
until that 's resolved any attempt to " buy british " is doomed .
tim oakley , uxbridge the raleigh bicycle i bought 18 years ago was made in the uk , but when i have to buy a new one , it will be made in randers , denmark !
luci smith , copenhagen , denmark i for one now refuse to buy hp sauce and others should do the same .
i also refuse to speak to call centres with overseas staff and insist on speaking to uk based operators .
i also note in scotland supermarkets carry a large range of " scottish " goods ; meat , vegetables etc which i buy in preference to foreign products .
i recently moved from south west england and the only local produce supermarkets promoted well was milk , despite the local availability of a range of dairy , meats and vegetable products .
it not only supports your local community to buy local it can also help the environment .
j robertson , falkirk " would bond drive a foreign-built aston martin ? "
when bond was handed a fat cheque he drove a bmw so i think that the nationality of his car is hardly a statement of patriotism any more .
orde saunders , kent , england hp sauce was always my favourite brown sauce .
however , when the production was moved to holland resulting in british jobs being lost , i have refused to buy it or use it anymore .
they have shot themselves in the foot as far as i am concerned .
vaughan , malmesbury the governments of both britain and scotland should be running high profile campaigns to encourage the consumer to buy domestically manufactured products .
this makes sense from both the economic and the environmental perspectives .
buying from china may be cheap , but what 's the cost ?
derek dillon , falkirk , scotland i think it 's important to distinguish between emotional and financial values of a brand .
the former can not survive now if a manufacturer can not play by the basic laws of global economics .
does anyone think that a volkswagen tuareg is a slovak car ?
i doubt it .
yet it 's made in slovakia , together with about 50 percent of porsche cayenne .
do you consider hondas and nissans assembled in britain to be british cars ?
probably not .
but everyone seems to think vauxhall is british even though it 's just rebranded german opel .
as is ford focus .
on the other hand , rolls-royce will remain british even it 's now , in terms of technology , german to the deepest core and not a single component is made in the uk .
kristian , bratislava , slovakia " designed in the uk " is all very well but myself and other fellow designers find it very difficult to produce a sample through uk manufacturers as they all want substantial orders before they will assist .
others are simply shop windows for china and in my case a sample for one low cost product cost £ 5000.00 .
the government needs to be proactive in subsidising designer samples through local manufacturers if it wants to shift the economy from a lopsided base of services versus manufacturers .
julie anderson , london watching american cable tv in canada in the 1980s , i remember many ads featuring popular music and sports stars promoting the " buy usa " idea .
the idea quickly took off -lrb- it was a time of increasing japanese and foreign imports -rrb- and the americans have never looked back .
surprising other countries have n't looked to do the same kind of simple , yet effective push to encourage loyalty to domestic products in the uk - or in canada !
paul , kyiv , ukraine what do you expect with your uncivilized trade unions ?
they have broken gb completely and the end is not in sight .
i " exported " myself many years ago and have never regretted it and the proudest day of my life was when i became a us citizen .
gba -lrb- means god bless america ! -rrb-

but will people love them any less ?
so there you are cruising around a picturesque village in the cotswolds in your aston martin rapide , eating your bacon sandwich covered in lashings of hp sauce and ready to chase it down with a bag of smarties .
what could be more british than that ?
a bond car , a sauce with the houses of parliament on the front and a sweet that has been a part of british childhood since 1937 .
but change is afoot .
aston martin is considering building the rapide abroad , smarties has moved production from york to hamburg in germany and the last bottle of british hp plopped mournfully off the line in aston in march , giving way to production in elst , in the netherlands .
smarties have the answer ... move production to germany in addition cadbury is moving curly wurly and other chocolates to factories in poland , and there has been a memorable but ultimately vain battle by the workers of treorchy in the rhondda valley to stop burberry taking production of its polo shirts out of the country .
critics of the move acidly pointed out the company 's boast of being " a luxury brand with a distinctive british sensibility " .
never mind luxury , could a british sensibility be manufactured in china , they asked .
when hp sauce made its decision , retired police officer and john bull impersonator ray egan went as far as occupying the roof of the factory in aston .
there were protesters with union jacks at westminster and an mp brandished a bottle in the commons .
the protesters asked how a firm that had launched a campaign to " save the proper british café " just weeks before the decision to move production was made , and which had produced special bottles designed by paul smith for a truly british season at harrods in 2005 , could have the gall to move to the netherlands .
but none could stop the move and heinz is unrepentant .
" it is more popular now , sales have gone up , people buy the product , they love the product , " a spokesman says .
" we did evaluate all sorts of options but we could n't close the considerable financial gap . "
slave labour the company says it is still fully committed to british manufacturing , with 80 % of all the food it sells in the uk made here .
smarties-owner nestle is equally bullish about its move to hamburg .
" smarties are n't going to taste any different , " a spokesman says , adding that sales have not taken a hit .
the company says other top brands such as quality street will not be moving to germany .
after all , quality strasse just does n't sound right .
what could be more british than hp sauce ?
manufacturing has been moving away from these shores for some decades , but if heinz and nestle are right , the british consumer does not care about even the most iconically british products shifting abroad .
is there no emotional attachment to british products that derives from where they are made ?
rune gustafson , chief executive of branding consultants interbrand , thinks not .
" people are actually aware of where products are made , provenance is important , but from a social aspect - people do n't want to be supporting slave labour , " he says .
" britain as a manufacturing nation has been declining for well over 50 years .
britishness in the past has meant made by british people in good conditions in good factories , maybe britishness in future will refer much more to its design . "
it is a distinction that was starkly made when dyson shifted production to malaysia from malmesbury in wiltshire in 2002 .
manufacturing jobs were lost , while research and design jobs remained .
perhaps a pattern had been set .
buy uk vs buy us to take the example of paul smith himself , despite being a quintessentially english designer much of his product range is made abroad .
if you buy a shirt from his paul smith london range , it is as likely to be made in italy as the uk .
what that label with " london " says is " designed here , not made here " .

but will people love them any less ?
so there you are cruising around a picturesque village in the cotswolds in your aston martin rapide , eating your bacon sandwich covered in lashings of hp sauce and ready to chase it down with a bag of smarties .
what could be more british than that ?
a bond car , a sauce with the houses of parliament on the front and a sweet that has been a part of british childhood since 1937 .
but change is afoot .
aston martin is considering building the rapide abroad , smarties has moved production from york to hamburg in germany and the last bottle of british hp plopped mournfully off the line in aston in march , giving way to production in elst , in the netherlands .
smarties have the answer ... move production to germany in addition cadbury is moving curly wurly and other chocolates to factories in poland , and there has been a memorable but ultimately vain battle by the workers of treorchy in the rhondda valley to stop burberry taking production of its polo shirts out of the country .
critics of the move acidly pointed out the company 's boast of being " a luxury brand with a distinctive british sensibility " .
never mind luxury , could a british sensibility be manufactured in china , they asked .
when hp sauce made its decision , retired police officer and john bull impersonator ray egan went as far as occupying the roof of the factory in aston .
there were protesters with union jacks at westminster and an mp brandished a bottle in the commons .
the protesters asked how a firm that had launched a campaign to " save the proper british café " just weeks before the decision to move production was made , and which had produced special bottles designed by paul smith for a truly british season at harrods in 2005 , could have the gall to move to the netherlands .
but none could stop the move and heinz is unrepentant .
" it is more popular now , sales have gone up , people buy the product , they love the product , " a spokesman says .
" we did evaluate all sorts of options but we could n't close the considerable financial gap . "
slave labour the company says it is still fully committed to british manufacturing , with 80 % of all the food it sells in the uk made here .
smarties-owner nestle is equally bullish about its move to hamburg .
" smarties are n't going to taste any different , " a spokesman says , adding that sales have not taken a hit .
the company says other top brands such as quality street will not be moving to germany .
after all , quality strasse just does n't sound right .
what could be more british than hp sauce ?
manufacturing has been moving away from these shores for some decades , but if heinz and nestle are right , the british consumer does not care about even the most iconically british products shifting abroad .
is there no emotional attachment to british products that derives from where they are made ?
rune gustafson , chief executive of branding consultants interbrand , thinks not .
" people are actually aware of where products are made , provenance is important , but from a social aspect - people do n't want to be supporting slave labour , " he says .
" britain as a manufacturing nation has been declining for well over 50 years .
britishness in the past has meant made by british people in good conditions in good factories , maybe britishness in future will refer much more to its design . "
it is a distinction that was starkly made when dyson shifted production to malaysia from malmesbury in wiltshire in 2002 .
manufacturing jobs were lost , while research and design jobs remained .
perhaps a pattern had been set .
buy uk vs buy us to take the example of paul smith himself , despite being a quintessentially english designer much of his product range is made abroad .
if you buy a shirt from his paul smith london range , it is as likely to be made in italy as the uk .
what that label with " london " says is " designed here , not made here " .
and there is a case to be made that while much noise might be made by politicians about the quality of british craftsmanship and manufacture and the need to support domestic industry , there are very few people trying to directly persuade the british customer to do that .
the big problem for us has been getting people to buy into it and become members anthony gilsenan british made for quality type " buy british " into google and the first result you get is usually a site selling british food to expats in the us .
it 's not easy to find any kind of site advocating patriotic purchasing .
type " buy american " into the same search engine and you get a slew of entrepreneurs who are keen to tap into americans ' desire to support domestic manufacturing .
british consumer trends research group mintel says it has never done a survey into whether people prefer to support british manufacturing .
one of the few groups that is attempting to support british manufacturing is british made for quality , founded by four british businessmen in 2002 , which does its best to promote domestic industry .
but it seems to be an uphill struggle .
" when we launched we had phenomenal coverage , everything from radio 4 through to the financial times , " says director anthony gilsenan .
" we had 40 potential members .
that was some five years ago .
the big problem for us has been getting people to buy into it and become members .
it only costs £ 50 a year . "
hp sauce workers lobbied hard but lost of the few dozen firms that have joined up , thomas crapper traditional toilets and haddonstone garden ornaments are among the biggest names .
the superbrands , even those who do manufacture in britain , rarely seem to feel that advertising the fact would boost their profits .
the bmfq requirements are that a product is at least 65 % manufactured in the uk .
their efforts seem more aimed at guarding the dwindling manufacturing sector , than effecting any real sea change in the mind of the shopper .
" if we can keep what manufacturing we have alive and kicking , if we can do our small bit .
if you go to france , they all drive french cars .
we are becoming a service nation , " says mr gilsenan .
those brands that trumpet their britishness are often luxury labels that are not in the business of massive sales .
knitwear firm john smedley is one .
" economically it would make some sense to manufacture abroad but our particular brand has been established since 1784 on the same site in derbyshire and employs 450 people , " says brand manager dawne stubbs .
would bond drive a foreign-built aston martin ?
" the same families have made the same product for generations and the skills base means it is best to stay put . "
but john smedley produces only half a million garments a year and its main business is selling £ 100 jumpers in selfridges and harvey nichols .
it is never going to have the same effect on customers as that of a giant like marks and spencer , which long ago shifted most of its clothes production overseas .
if the owners of iconic british brands can take production abroad and still maintain sales , then that tells us all we need to know about the diluted nature of our relationship with what we buy and where it is made .
and this lukewarm attitude comes at a time when producers of food in the uk are preparing to benefit from the current obsession with food miles and the environment .
but in the case of manufacturing , the proof of the pudding seems to be in the buying .
a selection of your comments appears below .
i was given a wedgewood box set as a present , which coming from stoke was meant to remind me of home .
as i opened the parcel i was greeted with a very nice box and equally as attractive wedgewood china sitting in it .
it was only when i turned the box over and read the sticker on the bottom - " wedgewood , made in china " i have to admit my heart sank and the love and pride i once had for a nice piece of clay vanished in a flash david mcdermid , stockholm sorry , but as soon as production of these brands moves abroad , i stop buying them .
the worst example is tvr ; i 've always wanted one because they were both british and the best , but if the new owner starts production in italy , i 'm not interested .
they belong in blackpool just as smarties belong in york .
tony fisher , york i will never buy cadbury products , hp sauce , rowntrees or any products from companies who export jobs .
we are being sold out , jobs are going and it may have escaped the companies notice , but if people loose their jobs they do n't have the money to buy the products .
there used to be a call " export or die " just after the second world war , so i have been told .
now it 's more like " export and die " .
chris , somerset i can understand moving production of stuff to poland or china , where it has to be cheaper to operate , but how the hell can it be cheaper to make stuff in germany and holland ?
the cost of doing business , the tax burden and the red tape here must be much worse than generally acknowledged .
until that 's resolved any attempt to " buy british " is doomed .

but will people love them any less ?
so there you are cruising around a picturesque village in the cotswolds in your aston martin rapide , eating your bacon sandwich covered in lashings of hp sauce and ready to chase it down with a bag of smarties .
what could be more british than that ?
a bond car , a sauce with the houses of parliament on the front and a sweet that has been a part of british childhood since 1937 .
but change is afoot .
aston martin is considering building the rapide abroad , smarties has moved production from york to hamburg in germany and the last bottle of british hp plopped mournfully off the line in aston in march , giving way to production in elst , in the netherlands .
smarties have the answer ... move production to germany in addition cadbury is moving curly wurly and other chocolates to factories in poland , and there has been a memorable but ultimately vain battle by the workers of treorchy in the rhondda valley to stop burberry taking production of its polo shirts out of the country .
critics of the move acidly pointed out the company 's boast of being " a luxury brand with a distinctive british sensibility " .
never mind luxury , could a british sensibility be manufactured in china , they asked .
when hp sauce made its decision , retired police officer and john bull impersonator ray egan went as far as occupying the roof of the factory in aston .
there were protesters with union jacks at westminster and an mp brandished a bottle in the commons .
the protesters asked how a firm that had launched a campaign to " save the proper british café " just weeks before the decision to move production was made , and which had produced special bottles designed by paul smith for a truly british season at harrods in 2005 , could have the gall to move to the netherlands .
but none could stop the move and heinz is unrepentant .
" it is more popular now , sales have gone up , people buy the product , they love the product , " a spokesman says .
" we did evaluate all sorts of options but we could n't close the considerable financial gap . "
slave labour the company says it is still fully committed to british manufacturing , with 80 % of all the food it sells in the uk made here .
smarties-owner nestle is equally bullish about its move to hamburg .
" smarties are n't going to taste any different , " a spokesman says , adding that sales have not taken a hit .
the company says other top brands such as quality street will not be moving to germany .
after all , quality strasse just does n't sound right .
what could be more british than hp sauce ?
manufacturing has been moving away from these shores for some decades , but if heinz and nestle are right , the british consumer does not care about even the most iconically british products shifting abroad .
is there no emotional attachment to british products that derives from where they are made ?
rune gustafson , chief executive of branding consultants interbrand , thinks not .
" people are actually aware of where products are made , provenance is important , but from a social aspect - people do n't want to be supporting slave labour , " he says .
" britain as a manufacturing nation has been declining for well over 50 years .
britishness in the past has meant made by british people in good conditions in good factories , maybe britishness in future will refer much more to its design . "
it is a distinction that was starkly made when dyson shifted production to malaysia from malmesbury in wiltshire in 2002 .
manufacturing jobs were lost , while research and design jobs remained .
perhaps a pattern had been set .
buy uk vs buy us to take the example of paul smith himself , despite being a quintessentially english designer much of his product range is made abroad .
if you buy a shirt from his paul smith london range , it is as likely to be made in italy as the uk .
what that label with " london " says is " designed here , not made here " .
and there is a case to be made that while much noise might be made by politicians about the quality of british craftsmanship and manufacture and the need to support domestic industry , there are very few people trying to directly persuade the british customer to do that .
the big problem for us has been getting people to buy into it and become members anthony gilsenan british made for quality type " buy british " into google and the first result you get is usually a site selling british food to expats in the us .
it 's not easy to find any kind of site advocating patriotic purchasing .
type " buy american " into the same search engine and you get a slew of entrepreneurs who are keen to tap into americans ' desire to support domestic manufacturing .
british consumer trends research group mintel says it has never done a survey into whether people prefer to support british manufacturing .
one of the few groups that is attempting to support british manufacturing is british made for quality , founded by four british businessmen in 2002 , which does its best to promote domestic industry .
but it seems to be an uphill struggle .
" when we launched we had phenomenal coverage , everything from radio 4 through to the financial times , " says director anthony gilsenan .
" we had 40 potential members .
that was some five years ago .
the big problem for us has been getting people to buy into it and become members .
it only costs £ 50 a year . "
hp sauce workers lobbied hard but lost of the few dozen firms that have joined up , thomas crapper traditional toilets and haddonstone garden ornaments are among the biggest names .
the superbrands , even those who do manufacture in britain , rarely seem to feel that advertising the fact would boost their profits .
the bmfq requirements are that a product is at least 65 % manufactured in the uk .
their efforts seem more aimed at guarding the dwindling manufacturing sector , than effecting any real sea change in the mind of the shopper .
" if we can keep what manufacturing we have alive and kicking , if we can do our small bit .
if you go to france , they all drive french cars .
we are becoming a service nation , " says mr gilsenan .
those brands that trumpet their britishness are often luxury labels that are not in the business of massive sales .
knitwear firm john smedley is one .
" economically it would make some sense to manufacture abroad but our particular brand has been established since 1784 on the same site in derbyshire and employs 450 people , " says brand manager dawne stubbs .
would bond drive a foreign-built aston martin ?
" the same families have made the same product for generations and the skills base means it is best to stay put . "
but john smedley produces only half a million garments a year and its main business is selling £ 100 jumpers in selfridges and harvey nichols .
it is never going to have the same effect on customers as that of a giant like marks and spencer , which long ago shifted most of its clothes production overseas .
if the owners of iconic british brands can take production abroad and still maintain sales , then that tells us all we need to know about the diluted nature of our relationship with what we buy and where it is made .
and this lukewarm attitude comes at a time when producers of food in the uk are preparing to benefit from the current obsession with food miles and the environment .
but in the case of manufacturing , the proof of the pudding seems to be in the buying .
a selection of your comments appears below .
i was given a wedgewood box set as a present , which coming from stoke was meant to remind me of home .
as i opened the parcel i was greeted with a very nice box and equally as attractive wedgewood china sitting in it .
it was only when i turned the box over and read the sticker on the bottom - " wedgewood , made in china " i have to admit my heart sank and the love and pride i once had for a nice piece of clay vanished in a flash david mcdermid , stockholm sorry , but as soon as production of these brands moves abroad , i stop buying them .
the worst example is tvr ; i 've always wanted one because they were both british and the best , but if the new owner starts production in italy , i 'm not interested .
they belong in blackpool just as smarties belong in york .
tony fisher , york i will never buy cadbury products , hp sauce , rowntrees or any products from companies who export jobs .
we are being sold out , jobs are going and it may have escaped the companies notice , but if people loose their jobs they do n't have the money to buy the products .
there used to be a call " export or die " just after the second world war , so i have been told .
now it 's more like " export and die " .
chris , somerset i can understand moving production of stuff to poland or china , where it has to be cheaper to operate , but how the hell can it be cheaper to make stuff in germany and holland ?
the cost of doing business , the tax burden and the red tape here must be much worse than generally acknowledged .
until that 's resolved any attempt to " buy british " is doomed .
tim oakley , uxbridge the raleigh bicycle i bought 18 years ago was made in the uk , but when i have to buy a new one , it will be made in randers , denmark !
luci smith , copenhagen , denmark i for one now refuse to buy hp sauce and others should do the same .
i also refuse to speak to call centres with overseas staff and insist on speaking to uk based operators .
i also note in scotland supermarkets carry a large range of " scottish " goods ; meat , vegetables etc which i buy in preference to foreign products .
i recently moved from south west england and the only local produce supermarkets promoted well was milk , despite the local availability of a range of dairy , meats and vegetable products .
it not only supports your local community to buy local it can also help the environment .
j robertson , falkirk " would bond drive a foreign-built aston martin ? "
when bond was handed a fat cheque he drove a bmw so i think that the nationality of his car is hardly a statement of patriotism any more .
orde saunders , kent , england hp sauce was always my favourite brown sauce .
however , when the production was moved to holland resulting in british jobs being lost , i have refused to buy it or use it anymore .
they have shot themselves in the foot as far as i am concerned .
vaughan , malmesbury the governments of both britain and scotland should be running high profile campaigns to encourage the consumer to buy domestically manufactured products .
this makes sense from both the economic and the environmental perspectives .
buying from china may be cheap , but what 's the cost ?
derek dillon , falkirk , scotland i think it 's important to distinguish between emotional and financial values of a brand .
the former can not survive now if a manufacturer can not play by the basic laws of global economics .
does anyone think that a volkswagen tuareg is a slovak car ?
i doubt it .
yet it 's made in slovakia , together with about 50 percent of porsche cayenne .
do you consider hondas and nissans assembled in britain to be british cars ?
probably not .
but everyone seems to think vauxhall is british even though it 's just rebranded german opel .
as is ford focus .
on the other hand , rolls-royce will remain british even it 's now , in terms of technology , german to the deepest core and not a single component is made in the uk .
kristian , bratislava , slovakia " designed in the uk " is all very well but myself and other fellow designers find it very difficult to produce a sample through uk manufacturers as they all want substantial orders before they will assist .
others are simply shop windows for china and in my case a sample for one low cost product cost £ 5000.00 .
the government needs to be proactive in subsidising designer samples through local manufacturers if it wants to shift the economy from a lopsided base of services versus manufacturers .
julie anderson , london watching american cable tv in canada in the 1980s , i remember many ads featuring popular music and sports stars promoting the " buy usa " idea .
the idea quickly took off -lrb- it was a time of increasing japanese and foreign imports -rrb- and the americans have never looked back .
surprising other countries have n't looked to do the same kind of simple , yet effective push to encourage loyalty to domestic products in the uk - or in canada !
paul , kyiv , ukraine what do you expect with your uncivilized trade unions ?
they have broken gb completely and the end is not in sight .
i " exported " myself many years ago and have never regretted it and the proudest day of my life was when i became a us citizen .
gba -lrb- means god bless america ! -rrb-

but will people love them any less ?
so there you are cruising around a picturesque village in the cotswolds in your aston martin rapide , eating your bacon sandwich covered in lashings of hp sauce and ready to chase it down with a bag of smarties .
what could be more british than that ?
a bond car , a sauce with the houses of parliament on the front and a sweet that has been a part of british childhood since 1937 .
but change is afoot .
aston martin is considering building the rapide abroad , smarties has moved production from york to hamburg in germany and the last bottle of british hp plopped mournfully off the line in aston in march , giving way to production in elst , in the netherlands .
smarties have the answer ... move production to germany in addition cadbury is moving curly wurly and other chocolates to factories in poland , and there has been a memorable but ultimately vain battle by the workers of treorchy in the rhondda valley to stop burberry taking production of its polo shirts out of the country .
critics of the move acidly pointed out the company 's boast of being " a luxury brand with a distinctive british sensibility " .
never mind luxury , could a british sensibility be manufactured in china , they asked .
when hp sauce made its decision , retired police officer and john bull impersonator ray egan went as far as occupying the roof of the factory in aston .
there were protesters with union jacks at westminster and an mp brandished a bottle in the commons .
the protesters asked how a firm that had launched a campaign to " save the proper british café " just weeks before the decision to move production was made , and which had produced special bottles designed by paul smith for a truly british season at harrods in 2005 , could have the gall to move to the netherlands .

" we did evaluate all sorts of options but we could n't close the considerable financial gap . "
slave labour the company says it is still fully committed to british manufacturing , with 80 % of all the food it sells in the uk made here .
smarties-owner nestle is equally bullish about its move to hamburg .
" smarties are n't going to taste any different , " a spokesman says , adding that sales have not taken a hit .
the company says other top brands such as quality street will not be moving to germany .
after all , quality strasse just does n't sound right .
what could be more british than hp sauce ?
manufacturing has been moving away from these shores for some decades , but if heinz and nestle are right , the british consumer does not care about even the most iconically british products shifting abroad .
is there no emotional attachment to british products that derives from where they are made ?
rune gustafson , chief executive of branding consultants interbrand , thinks not .
" people are actually aware of where products are made , provenance is important , but from a social aspect - people do n't want to be supporting slave labour , " he says .
" britain as a manufacturing nation has been declining for well over 50 years .
britishness in the past has meant made by british people in good conditions in good factories , maybe britishness in future will refer much more to its design . "
it is a distinction that was starkly made when dyson shifted production to malaysia from malmesbury in wiltshire in 2002 .
manufacturing jobs were lost , while research and design jobs remained .
perhaps a pattern had been set .
buy uk vs buy us to take the example of paul smith himself , despite being a quintessentially english designer much of his product range is made abroad .
if you buy a shirt from his paul smith london range , it is as likely to be made in italy as the uk .
what that label with " london " says is " designed here , not made here " .
and there is a case to be made that while much noise might be made by politicians about the quality of british craftsmanship and manufacture and the need to support domestic industry , there are very few people trying to directly persuade the british customer to do that .
the big problem for us has been getting people to buy into it and become members anthony gilsenan british made for quality type " buy british " into google and the first result you get is usually a site selling british food to expats in the us .
it 's not easy to find any kind of site advocating patriotic purchasing .
type " buy american " into the same search engine and you get a slew of entrepreneurs who are keen to tap into americans ' desire to support domestic manufacturing .
british consumer trends research group mintel says it has never done a survey into whether people prefer to support british manufacturing .
one of the few groups that is attempting to support british manufacturing is british made for quality , founded by four british businessmen in 2002 , which does its best to promote domestic industry .
but it seems to be an uphill struggle .
" when we launched we had phenomenal coverage , everything from radio 4 through to the financial times , " says director anthony gilsenan .
" we had 40 potential members .
that was some five years ago .
the big problem for us has been getting people to buy into it and become members .
it only costs £ 50 a year . "
hp sauce workers lobbied hard but lost of the few dozen firms that have joined up , thomas crapper traditional toilets and haddonstone garden ornaments are among the biggest names .
the superbrands , even those who do manufacture in britain , rarely seem to feel that advertising the fact would boost their profits .
the bmfq requirements are that a product is at least 65 % manufactured in the uk .
their efforts seem more aimed at guarding the dwindling manufacturing sector , than effecting any real sea change in the mind of the shopper .
" if we can keep what manufacturing we have alive and kicking , if we can do our small bit .
if you go to france , they all drive french cars .
we are becoming a service nation , " says mr gilsenan .
those brands that trumpet their britishness are often luxury labels that are not in the business of massive sales .
knitwear firm john smedley is one .
" economically it would make some sense to manufacture abroad but our particular brand has been established since 1784 on the same site in derbyshire and employs 450 people , " says brand manager dawne stubbs .
would bond drive a foreign-built aston martin ?
" the same families have made the same product for generations and the skills base means it is best to stay put . "
but john smedley produces only half a million garments a year and its main business is selling £ 100 jumpers in selfridges and harvey nichols .
it is never going to have the same effect on customers as that of a giant like marks and spencer , which long ago shifted most of its clothes production overseas .
if the owners of iconic british brands can take production abroad and still maintain sales , then that tells us all we need to know about the diluted nature of our relationship with what we buy and where it is made .
and this lukewarm attitude comes at a time when producers of food in the uk are preparing to benefit from the current obsession with food miles and the environment .
but in the case of manufacturing , the proof of the pudding seems to be in the buying .
a selection of your comments appears below .
i was given a wedgewood box set as a present , which coming from stoke was meant to remind me of home .
as i opened the parcel i was greeted with a very nice box and equally as attractive wedgewood china sitting in it .
it was only when i turned the box over and read the sticker on the bottom - " wedgewood , made in china " i have to admit my heart sank and the love and pride i once had for a nice piece of clay vanished in a flash david mcdermid , stockholm sorry , but as soon as production of these brands moves abroad , i stop buying them .
the worst example is tvr ; i 've always wanted one because they were both british and the best , but if the new owner starts production in italy , i 'm not interested .
they belong in blackpool just as smarties belong in york .
tony fisher , york i will never buy cadbury products , hp sauce , rowntrees or any products from companies who export jobs .
we are being sold out , jobs are going and it may have escaped the companies notice , but if people loose their jobs they do n't have the money to buy the products .
there used to be a call " export or die " just after the second world war , so i have been told .
now it 's more like " export and die " .
chris , somerset i can understand moving production of stuff to poland or china , where it has to be cheaper to operate , but how the hell can it be cheaper to make stuff in germany and holland ?
the cost of doing business , the tax burden and the red tape here must be much worse than generally acknowledged .
until that 's resolved any attempt to " buy british " is doomed .
tim oakley , uxbridge the raleigh bicycle i bought 18 years ago was made in the uk , but when i have to buy a new one , it will be made in randers , denmark !
luci smith , copenhagen , denmark i for one now refuse to buy hp sauce and others should do the same .
i also refuse to speak to call centres with overseas staff and insist on speaking to uk based operators .
i also note in scotland supermarkets carry a large range of " scottish " goods ; meat , vegetables etc which i buy in preference to foreign products .
i recently moved from south west england and the only local produce supermarkets promoted well was milk , despite the local availability of a range of dairy , meats and vegetable products .
it not only supports your local community to buy local it can also help the environment .
j robertson , falkirk " would bond drive a foreign-built aston martin ? "
when bond was handed a fat cheque he drove a bmw so i think that the nationality of his car is hardly a statement of patriotism any more .
orde saunders , kent , england hp sauce was always my favourite brown sauce .
however , when the production was moved to holland resulting in british jobs being lost , i have refused to buy it or use it anymore .
they have shot themselves in the foot as far as i am concerned .
vaughan , malmesbury the governments of both britain and scotland should be running high profile campaigns to encourage the consumer to buy domestically manufactured products .
this makes sense from both the economic and the environmental perspectives .
buying from china may be cheap , but what 's the cost ?
derek dillon , falkirk , scotland i think it 's important to distinguish between emotional and financial values of a brand .
the former can not survive now if a manufacturer can not play by the basic laws of global economics .
does anyone think that a volkswagen tuareg is a slovak car ?
i doubt it .
yet it 's made in slovakia , together with about 50 percent of porsche cayenne .
do you consider hondas and nissans assembled in britain to be british cars ?
probably not .
but everyone seems to think vauxhall is british even though it 's just rebranded german opel .
as is ford focus .
on the other hand , rolls-royce will remain british even it 's now , in terms of technology , german to the deepest core and not a single component is made in the uk .
kristian , bratislava , slovakia " designed in the uk " is all very well but myself and other fellow designers find it very difficult to produce a sample through uk manufacturers as they all want substantial orders before they will assist .
others are simply shop windows for china and in my case a sample for one low cost product cost £ 5000.00 .
the government needs to be proactive in subsidising designer samples through local manufacturers if it wants to shift the economy from a lopsided base of services versus manufacturers .

but will people love them any less ?
so there you are cruising around a picturesque village in the cotswolds in your aston martin rapide , eating your bacon sandwich covered in lashings of hp sauce and ready to chase it down with a bag of smarties .
what could be more british than that ?
a bond car , a sauce with the houses of parliament on the front and a sweet that has been a part of british childhood since 1937 .
but change is afoot .
aston martin is considering building the rapide abroad , smarties has moved production from york to hamburg in germany and the last bottle of british hp plopped mournfully off the line in aston in march , giving way to production in elst , in the netherlands .
smarties have the answer ... move production to germany in addition cadbury is moving curly wurly and other chocolates to factories in poland , and there has been a memorable but ultimately vain battle by the workers of treorchy in the rhondda valley to stop burberry taking production of its polo shirts out of the country .
critics of the move acidly pointed out the company 's boast of being " a luxury brand with a distinctive british sensibility " .
never mind luxury , could a british sensibility be manufactured in china , they asked .
when hp sauce made its decision , retired police officer and john bull impersonator ray egan went as far as occupying the roof of the factory in aston .
there were protesters with union jacks at westminster and an mp brandished a bottle in the commons .
the protesters asked how a firm that had launched a campaign to " save the proper british café " just weeks before the decision to move production was made , and which had produced special bottles designed by paul smith for a truly british season at harrods in 2005 , could have the gall to move to the netherlands .
but none could stop the move and heinz is unrepentant .
" it is more popular now , sales have gone up , people buy the product , they love the product , " a spokesman says .
" we did evaluate all sorts of options but we could n't close the considerable financial gap . "
slave labour the company says it is still fully committed to british manufacturing , with 80 % of all the food it sells in the uk made here .
smarties-owner nestle is equally bullish about its move to hamburg .
" smarties are n't going to taste any different , " a spokesman says , adding that sales have not taken a hit .
