the spokeswoman would not comment on the magazine report , the associated press reported saturday . according to der spiegel , the iranian government has channeled some of its foreign currency earnings to german banks .
the total held by german financial institutions topped 6.55 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.9 billion -rrb- . levey called iran the " central bank of terrorism , " in an interview with public broadcaster südwestrundfunk last week . germany 's largest bank , deutsche bank , had tacitly agreed to run down its dealings with iran after being placed on a list of institutions dealing with countries the us called state sponsors of terrorism - cuba , iran , north korea , sudan and syria . german companies not alone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuba is another country the us wants international companies to leave the us financial watchdog , the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- , has since removed the list it compiled , which contained names of businesses from the united states , australia , great britain , germany , france and japan , from the internet , saying it had received many complaints from companies , some insisting the list was out of date . hsbc holdings , unilever plc , bp plc , siemens , total , basf and the mitsubishi ufj financial group were just some of the companies highlighted in addition to deutsche bank . the sec list stated that siemens has business dealings with all five named " sponsors of terrorism " while basf is linked solely with iran .

german laws have no clear answer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the threat of deportations can make life hell for some immigrants german authorities are undecided about whether hiv-positive immigrants with temporary residence permits are allowed to stay in the country despite the often poor availability of life-saving treatment back home . every three months , maureen faces a terrifying task : making a trip to the local foreigners ' office in frankfurt to find out whether she can stay on in the country .
the kenyan , who has a precarious residence status in germany , is in danger of deportation despite the fact that she has aids and has been undergoing treatment for several years .
every three months , the german authorities rule afresh on putting off her deportation .
the uncertainty of her situation is taking its toll .
" when i go with her to the foreigners ' office , then she -lsb- maureen -rsb- often has n't slept the night before , " said iris hufnagel , a social worker with an aids campaign group in frankfurt .
" she 's sick with worry that she will be directly sent off to a detention center for deportees . "
at the mercy of immigration laws like maureen , there are some 170,000 foreigners in germany who have been living in the country for more than 15 years and still have a temporary residence permit .
in german bureaucratic language , they are said to be " tolerated . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long line of immigrants at a foreigners ' office in germany in theory , these people are obliged to leave germany .
but they are allowed to stay on humanitarian grounds if they face persecution in their home countries .
in practice , they can be sent home anytime because their residence permit is usually extended by just three months each time .
maureen thus has to spend her life at the mercy of germany 's complicated immigration laws .
for over five years , the authorities handling maureen 's case have been examining whether there 's a " significant , concrete danger for the physical well-being and life , " as the law says , if they deport her .
effective aids treatment in kenya ?
immigration officials are in particular checking whether maureen could die if she was sent back to kenya because of lack of sufficient treatment .
the german embassy in nairobi says that aids infections can be treated effectively in kenya .
therapy is expensive but it 's possible to have it for 200 euros -lrb- $ 276 -rrb- a month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting access to aids treatment in africa is not easy but not everyone buys that argument .
" i just ca n't imagine it , " hufnagel said .
" how will she take medicines there when she 's lacking other things ? "
the social worker added that maureen also faced the risk of being mugged in kenya since the medicines were so expensive .
besides , the therapy would also mean a privilege , hufnagel said .
" imagine being in a family , knowing that the brother too is hiv positive and he does n't get the medicines … that 's an absurd situation . "
aids a reason to stop deportations ?
german courts seem to be confused about whether aids is a reason for freezing deportations .
while a few have ruled in the past that breaking off aids treatment poses a real danger to life , others have argued it does n't since the illness is long drawn out and does n't directly lead to death .
volker beck , a parliamentarian of the opposition green party , said it 's scandalous that these legal questions are discussed at the cost of those affected - a group , he says , faces a double stigma .
" firstly they are migrants , in most cases with a precarious status , and in addition , they have an ailment that leads to societal exclusion , " beck said .
he added that since the number of affected was not high , germany could afford to be much more humane towards them than is currently the case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some migrants first learn of their hiv-positive status in germany authorities in germany fear that if aids was recognized as a valid reason to stop deportations , it would give a free ticket to many african aids patients to come to germany .
beck rebuffed those concerns , pointing out that according to the eu 's current dublin agreement , asylum-seekers are sent back to the eu nation through which they entered the bloc .
besides , it 's much more likely that asylum-seekers would discover their hiv status for the first time in germany , said beck .
uncertain fate " the people who come here are those who are strong-willed and in good health , " hufnagel said .
she added that the diagnosis of an hiv infection is usually traumatic for them .
" the fact that they face so much change could also be the reason why some things then rise to the surface once they 're here . "
learning about her illness was an additional shock for maureen , too .
lured to germany by the promise of marriage , she was abused by her future husband .
when she suffered a serious lung infection , he threw maureen out .
thanks to good medical treatment , the kenyan is on her feet again .
but it 's essential that she continues to receive treatment if her health is to remain stable . nadine wojcik -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german laws have no clear answer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the threat of deportations can make life hell for some immigrants german authorities are undecided about whether hiv-positive immigrants with temporary residence permits are allowed to stay in the country despite the often poor availability of life-saving treatment back home . every three months , maureen faces a terrifying task : making a trip to the local foreigners ' office in frankfurt to find out whether she can stay on in the country .
the kenyan , who has a precarious residence status in germany , is in danger of deportation despite the fact that she has aids and has been undergoing treatment for several years .
every three months , the german authorities rule afresh on putting off her deportation .
the uncertainty of her situation is taking its toll .
" when i go with her to the foreigners ' office , then she -lsb- maureen -rsb- often has n't slept the night before , " said iris hufnagel , a social worker with an aids campaign group in frankfurt .
" she 's sick with worry that she will be directly sent off to a detention center for deportees . "
at the mercy of immigration laws like maureen , there are some 170,000 foreigners in germany who have been living in the country for more than 15 years and still have a temporary residence permit .
in german bureaucratic language , they are said to be " tolerated . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long line of immigrants at a foreigners ' office in germany in theory , these people are obliged to leave germany .
but they are allowed to stay on humanitarian grounds if they face persecution in their home countries .
in practice , they can be sent home anytime because their residence permit is usually extended by just three months each time .
maureen thus has to spend her life at the mercy of germany 's complicated immigration laws .
for over five years , the authorities handling maureen 's case have been examining whether there 's a " significant , concrete danger for the physical well-being and life , " as the law says , if they deport her .
effective aids treatment in kenya ?
immigration officials are in particular checking whether maureen could die if she was sent back to kenya because of lack of sufficient treatment .
the german embassy in nairobi says that aids infections can be treated effectively in kenya .
therapy is expensive but it 's possible to have it for 200 euros -lrb- $ 276 -rrb- a month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting access to aids treatment in africa is not easy but not everyone buys that argument .
" i just ca n't imagine it , " hufnagel said .
" how will she take medicines there when she 's lacking other things ? "
the social worker added that maureen also faced the risk of being mugged in kenya since the medicines were so expensive .
besides , the therapy would also mean a privilege , hufnagel said .
" imagine being in a family , knowing that the brother too is hiv positive and he does n't get the medicines … that 's an absurd situation . "
aids a reason to stop deportations ?
german courts seem to be confused about whether aids is a reason for freezing deportations .
while a few have ruled in the past that breaking off aids treatment poses a real danger to life , others have argued it does n't since the illness is long drawn out and does n't directly lead to death .
volker beck , a parliamentarian of the opposition green party , said it 's scandalous that these legal questions are discussed at the cost of those affected - a group , he says , faces a double stigma .
" firstly they are migrants , in most cases with a precarious status , and in addition , they have an ailment that leads to societal exclusion , " beck said .
he added that since the number of affected was not high , germany could afford to be much more humane towards them than is currently the case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some migrants first learn of their hiv-positive status in germany authorities in germany fear that if aids was recognized as a valid reason to stop deportations , it would give a free ticket to many african aids patients to come to germany .
beck rebuffed those concerns , pointing out that according to the eu 's current dublin agreement , asylum-seekers are sent back to the eu nation through which they entered the bloc .
besides , it 's much more likely that asylum-seekers would discover their hiv status for the first time in germany , said beck .
uncertain fate " the people who come here are those who are strong-willed and in good health , " hufnagel said .
she added that the diagnosis of an hiv infection is usually traumatic for them .
" the fact that they face so much change could also be the reason why some things then rise to the surface once they 're here . "
learning about her illness was an additional shock for maureen , too .
lured to germany by the promise of marriage , she was abused by her future husband .
when she suffered a serious lung infection , he threw maureen out .

the african country also provided details on the deal that led to the doctor and five nurses ' release . " the detainees should have been detained upon their arrival -lsb- in sofia -rsb- , and not freed in this celebratory and illegal manner , " libyan foreign minister abdel rahman shalgham said saturday at a news conference in tripoli .
bulgaria 's actions " violated the legal procedures regarding extradition , as set down under international law and in the agreement on judicial cooperation signed between the two countries " in 1984 , added prime minister baghdadi mahmudi .
" we followed the procedure - it is bulgaria that betrayed us . "
mahmundi also said that french president nicolas sarkozy expressed similar dissatisfaction with the bulgarian decision to pardon the medics when he made a trip to libya this week .
shalgham also criticized " humanitarian and international organisations who , instead of criticising the liberation of the criminals , welcomed and greeted this step . "
main fund sponsors announced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy made a high-profile visit to libya shortly after the medics ' release at the same press conference , mahmudi said the czech republic , bulgaria , slovakia and qatar were the main donors to a fund set up to pay hundreds of families of children who contracted the hiv virus at a libyan hospital in the 1990s .
he also said that france had pledged to train some 50 libyan doctors .
bulgaria contributed to the fund through a non-governmental organisation open to private bulgarian and foreign companies , deputy foreign minister feim chaushev told reuters .
" one of the options for bulgaria 's contribution to the fund is forgiving the libyan debt , " chaushev added .
" we are to decide on that option .
we are discussing other options as well , such as technical assistance . "
the six bulgarian medics were detained in 1999 and later found guilty and sentenced to death by libyan courts of intentionally infecting 438 children with the aids causing hiv virus .
fifty six of the children have died .
the medics , five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor who has been given bulgarian citizenship , maintained their innocence .
foreign health experts have said poor sanitary conditions in libya 's hospitals were to blame for the spread of the disease among patients .
libya calls for international protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several medics said they were tortured during the eight-year imprisonment as a protest to bulgarian president georgy parvanov 's pardon , libya called on arab league members to adopt a common stand on the affair at a meeting of representatives on monday , the prime minister said .
tripoli will also seek support from the african union and the organisation of the islamic conference , mahmudi added .
libya allowed the medics to return to bulgaria on tuesday , where they had been due to serve life terms in prison .
since their release the medics have said their confessions were extracted under torture .
" all of us were treated like animals , " the doctor ashraf juma hajuj said thursday .
" we were tortured for a long time , with electricity , beatings , deprivation of sleep . "
the families of the deceased and hiv-positive children have criticised bulgaria 's decision , and their representative idriss lagha again on saturday called on libya 's government to request that interpol arrest the medics again , and for tripoli to cut all diplomatic ties with sofia .
bulgaria , however , said it wants to close this chapter of relations with libya and move on .

" the uci has displayed a lack of lucidity , of professionalism , a total unawareness , " clerc said .
" either it is incompetence or they wanted to do damage ...
the management has no other choice but to resign , " clerc told journalists before the start of the next-to-last stage of the tour , in the city of cognac . however , uci president pat mcquaid told reuters : " it 's ridiculous .
it is not up to him to ask for that .
only the uci congress can . " clerc , who heads the amaury sport organization , and tour director christian prudhomme have accused the uci of having intentionally neglected to inform them of a positive doping test of german cyclist patrik sinkewitz and of danish rider micheal rasmussen missing at least one doping test and lying about his whereabouts to avoid the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour could look very different next year both situations were revealed during the running of the tour , leading german public television stations ard and zdf to stop live broadcasts of the race and rasmussen being forced out of the race when he was leading it . clerc and prudhomme have charged that the uci withheld the information in order to destabilize the race . " the uci is not able to lead the reconstruction of the -lrb- anti-doping -rrb- system , " clerc said .
" we will attempt to unite all people of good will , riders , teams ...
we do n't want to exclude the sports authorities , but we want a sports authority that is ethical , neutral , independent and responsible . " end of cooperation prudhomme said that he felt " betrayed " by the uci . " the result of the -lrb- sinkewitz -rrb- positive test took a month and a week to be made public , " he said .
that 's a very surprising delay . " clerc said the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- " is certainly the most competent body to lead the fight that touches every sport . " earlier saturday , prudhomme was quoted as saying that the tour de france would no longer cooperate with the uci . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entire astana team left the tour after its lead racer tested positive " we will no longer work together with the uci , there will be special rules for the tour de france , " prudhomme told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung on saturday .
" it -lrb- the uci -rrb- is good for nothing .
the uci never wanted a clean tour . " prudhomme said that he was ready to attend an anti-doping summit proposed by wada and that " we will next year co-operate with wada and the french anti-doping agency " instead of the uci . " things will be better without the uci , they must become better , " he said . uci gives support to germany but german cycling officials appear to believe the uci is doing a satisfactory job .
they announced on thursday that they had received the organization 's signature on an anti-doping declaration for the road racing world championships to be held in stuttgart in late september . under the agreement , the uci , german sports authorities , local organizers and germany 's anti-doping agency will conduct a multitude of tests ahead of the championships , including pre-event random testing and requiring all cyclists to provide blood samples prior to racing . " the measures announced at the beginning of july are intended to send a strong signal , namely that cycling has taken a new stance , " said wolfgang schneider , the general secretary of the event 's steering committee . article based on news reprots -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the african country also provided details on the deal that led to the doctor and five nurses ' release . " the detainees should have been detained upon their arrival -lsb- in sofia -rsb- , and not freed in this celebratory and illegal manner , " libyan foreign minister abdel rahman shalgham said saturday at a news conference in tripoli .
bulgaria 's actions " violated the legal procedures regarding extradition , as set down under international law and in the agreement on judicial cooperation signed between the two countries " in 1984 , added prime minister baghdadi mahmudi .
" we followed the procedure - it is bulgaria that betrayed us . "
mahmundi also said that french president nicolas sarkozy expressed similar dissatisfaction with the bulgarian decision to pardon the medics when he made a trip to libya this week .
shalgham also criticized " humanitarian and international organisations who , instead of criticising the liberation of the criminals , welcomed and greeted this step . "
main fund sponsors announced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy made a high-profile visit to libya shortly after the medics ' release at the same press conference , mahmudi said the czech republic , bulgaria , slovakia and qatar were the main donors to a fund set up to pay hundreds of families of children who contracted the hiv virus at a libyan hospital in the 1990s .
he also said that france had pledged to train some 50 libyan doctors .
bulgaria contributed to the fund through a non-governmental organisation open to private bulgarian and foreign companies , deputy foreign minister feim chaushev told reuters .
" one of the options for bulgaria 's contribution to the fund is forgiving the libyan debt , " chaushev added .
" we are to decide on that option .
we are discussing other options as well , such as technical assistance . "
the six bulgarian medics were detained in 1999 and later found guilty and sentenced to death by libyan courts of intentionally infecting 438 children with the aids causing hiv virus .
fifty six of the children have died .
the medics , five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor who has been given bulgarian citizenship , maintained their innocence .
foreign health experts have said poor sanitary conditions in libya 's hospitals were to blame for the spread of the disease among patients .
libya calls for international protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several medics said they were tortured during the eight-year imprisonment as a protest to bulgarian president georgy parvanov 's pardon , libya called on arab league members to adopt a common stand on the affair at a meeting of representatives on monday , the prime minister said .
tripoli will also seek support from the african union and the organisation of the islamic conference , mahmudi added .
libya allowed the medics to return to bulgaria on tuesday , where they had been due to serve life terms in prison .
since their release the medics have said their confessions were extracted under torture .
" all of us were treated like animals , " the doctor ashraf juma hajuj said thursday .
" we were tortured for a long time , with electricity , beatings , deprivation of sleep . "
the families of the deceased and hiv-positive children have criticised bulgaria 's decision , and their representative idriss lagha again on saturday called on libya 's government to request that interpol arrest the medics again , and for tripoli to cut all diplomatic ties with sofia .
bulgaria , however , said it wants to close this chapter of relations with libya and move on .
" the most important thing is to restore our relations with libya because in the last eight years they have stalled in the medics ' case , " bulgarian foreign minister ivailo kalfin told darik radio . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the african country also provided details on the deal that led to the doctor and five nurses ' release . " the detainees should have been detained upon their arrival -lsb- in sofia -rsb- , and not freed in this celebratory and illegal manner , " libyan foreign minister abdel rahman shalgham said saturday at a news conference in tripoli .
bulgaria 's actions " violated the legal procedures regarding extradition , as set down under international law and in the agreement on judicial cooperation signed between the two countries " in 1984 , added prime minister baghdadi mahmudi .
" we followed the procedure - it is bulgaria that betrayed us . "
mahmundi also said that french president nicolas sarkozy expressed similar dissatisfaction with the bulgarian decision to pardon the medics when he made a trip to libya this week .
shalgham also criticized " humanitarian and international organisations who , instead of criticising the liberation of the criminals , welcomed and greeted this step . "
main fund sponsors announced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy made a high-profile visit to libya shortly after the medics ' release at the same press conference , mahmudi said the czech republic , bulgaria , slovakia and qatar were the main donors to a fund set up to pay hundreds of families of children who contracted the hiv virus at a libyan hospital in the 1990s .
he also said that france had pledged to train some 50 libyan doctors .
bulgaria contributed to the fund through a non-governmental organisation open to private bulgarian and foreign companies , deputy foreign minister feim chaushev told reuters .
" one of the options for bulgaria 's contribution to the fund is forgiving the libyan debt , " chaushev added .
" we are to decide on that option .
we are discussing other options as well , such as technical assistance . "
the six bulgarian medics were detained in 1999 and later found guilty and sentenced to death by libyan courts of intentionally infecting 438 children with the aids causing hiv virus .
fifty six of the children have died .
the medics , five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor who has been given bulgarian citizenship , maintained their innocence .
foreign health experts have said poor sanitary conditions in libya 's hospitals were to blame for the spread of the disease among patients .
libya calls for international protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several medics said they were tortured during the eight-year imprisonment as a protest to bulgarian president georgy parvanov 's pardon , libya called on arab league members to adopt a common stand on the affair at a meeting of representatives on monday , the prime minister said .
tripoli will also seek support from the african union and the organisation of the islamic conference , mahmudi added .
libya allowed the medics to return to bulgaria on tuesday , where they had been due to serve life terms in prison .
since their release the medics have said their confessions were extracted under torture .
" all of us were treated like animals , " the doctor ashraf juma hajuj said thursday .
" we were tortured for a long time , with electricity , beatings , deprivation of sleep . "
the families of the deceased and hiv-positive children have criticised bulgaria 's decision , and their representative idriss lagha again on saturday called on libya 's government to request that interpol arrest the medics again , and for tripoli to cut all diplomatic ties with sofia .
bulgaria , however , said it wants to close this chapter of relations with libya and move on .
" the most important thing is to restore our relations with libya because in the last eight years they have stalled in the medics ' case , " bulgarian foreign minister ivailo kalfin told darik radio . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german laws have no clear answer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the threat of deportations can make life hell for some immigrants german authorities are undecided about whether hiv-positive immigrants with temporary residence permits are allowed to stay in the country despite the often poor availability of life-saving treatment back home . every three months , maureen faces a terrifying task : making a trip to the local foreigners ' office in frankfurt to find out whether she can stay on in the country .
the kenyan , who has a precarious residence status in germany , is in danger of deportation despite the fact that she has aids and has been undergoing treatment for several years .
every three months , the german authorities rule afresh on putting off her deportation .
the uncertainty of her situation is taking its toll .
" when i go with her to the foreigners ' office , then she -lsb- maureen -rsb- often has n't slept the night before , " said iris hufnagel , a social worker with an aids campaign group in frankfurt .
" she 's sick with worry that she will be directly sent off to a detention center for deportees . "
at the mercy of immigration laws like maureen , there are some 170,000 foreigners in germany who have been living in the country for more than 15 years and still have a temporary residence permit .

maureen thus has to spend her life at the mercy of germany 's complicated immigration laws .
for over five years , the authorities handling maureen 's case have been examining whether there 's a " significant , concrete danger for the physical well-being and life , " as the law says , if they deport her .

besides , the therapy would also mean a privilege , hufnagel said .
" imagine being in a family , knowing that the brother too is hiv positive and he does n't get the medicines … that 's an absurd situation . "
aids a reason to stop deportations ?
german courts seem to be confused about whether aids is a reason for freezing deportations .
while a few have ruled in the past that breaking off aids treatment poses a real danger to life , others have argued it does n't since the illness is long drawn out and does n't directly lead to death .
volker beck , a parliamentarian of the opposition green party , said it 's scandalous that these legal questions are discussed at the cost of those affected - a group , he says , faces a double stigma .
" firstly they are migrants , in most cases with a precarious status , and in addition , they have an ailment that leads to societal exclusion , " beck said .
he added that since the number of affected was not high , germany could afford to be much more humane towards them than is currently the case .

german laws have no clear answer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the threat of deportations can make life hell for some immigrants german authorities are undecided about whether hiv-positive immigrants with temporary residence permits are allowed to stay in the country despite the often poor availability of life-saving treatment back home . every three months , maureen faces a terrifying task : making a trip to the local foreigners ' office in frankfurt to find out whether she can stay on in the country .
the kenyan , who has a precarious residence status in germany , is in danger of deportation despite the fact that she has aids and has been undergoing treatment for several years .
every three months , the german authorities rule afresh on putting off her deportation .
the uncertainty of her situation is taking its toll .
" when i go with her to the foreigners ' office , then she -lsb- maureen -rsb- often has n't slept the night before , " said iris hufnagel , a social worker with an aids campaign group in frankfurt .
" she 's sick with worry that she will be directly sent off to a detention center for deportees . "
at the mercy of immigration laws like maureen , there are some 170,000 foreigners in germany who have been living in the country for more than 15 years and still have a temporary residence permit .
in german bureaucratic language , they are said to be " tolerated . "

in practice , they can be sent home anytime because their residence permit is usually extended by just three months each time .
maureen thus has to spend her life at the mercy of germany 's complicated immigration laws .
for over five years , the authorities handling maureen 's case have been examining whether there 's a " significant , concrete danger for the physical well-being and life , " as the law says , if they deport her .

the social worker added that maureen also faced the risk of being mugged in kenya since the medicines were so expensive .
besides , the therapy would also mean a privilege , hufnagel said .
" imagine being in a family , knowing that the brother too is hiv positive and he does n't get the medicines … that 's an absurd situation . "
aids a reason to stop deportations ?
german courts seem to be confused about whether aids is a reason for freezing deportations .
while a few have ruled in the past that breaking off aids treatment poses a real danger to life , others have argued it does n't since the illness is long drawn out and does n't directly lead to death .
volker beck , a parliamentarian of the opposition green party , said it 's scandalous that these legal questions are discussed at the cost of those affected - a group , he says , faces a double stigma .
" firstly they are migrants , in most cases with a precarious status , and in addition , they have an ailment that leads to societal exclusion , " beck said .
he added that since the number of affected was not high , germany could afford to be much more humane towards them than is currently the case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some migrants first learn of their hiv-positive status in germany authorities in germany fear that if aids was recognized as a valid reason to stop deportations , it would give a free ticket to many african aids patients to come to germany .

besides , it 's much more likely that asylum-seekers would discover their hiv status for the first time in germany , said beck .
uncertain fate " the people who come here are those who are strong-willed and in good health , " hufnagel said .

" the uci has displayed a lack of lucidity , of professionalism , a total unawareness , " clerc said .
" either it is incompetence or they wanted to do damage ...
the management has no other choice but to resign , " clerc told journalists before the start of the next-to-last stage of the tour , in the city of cognac . however , uci president pat mcquaid told reuters : " it 's ridiculous .
it is not up to him to ask for that .
only the uci congress can . " clerc , who heads the amaury sport organization , and tour director christian prudhomme have accused the uci of having intentionally neglected to inform them of a positive doping test of german cyclist patrik sinkewitz and of danish rider micheal rasmussen missing at least one doping test and lying about his whereabouts to avoid the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour could look very different next year both situations were revealed during the running of the tour , leading german public television stations ard and zdf to stop live broadcasts of the race and rasmussen being forced out of the race when he was leading it . clerc and prudhomme have charged that the uci withheld the information in order to destabilize the race . " the uci is not able to lead the reconstruction of the -lrb- anti-doping -rrb- system , " clerc said .
" we will attempt to unite all people of good will , riders , teams ...
we do n't want to exclude the sports authorities , but we want a sports authority that is ethical , neutral , independent and responsible . " end of cooperation prudhomme said that he felt " betrayed " by the uci . " the result of the -lrb- sinkewitz -rrb- positive test took a month and a week to be made public , " he said .
that 's a very surprising delay . " clerc said the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- " is certainly the most competent body to lead the fight that touches every sport . " earlier saturday , prudhomme was quoted as saying that the tour de france would no longer cooperate with the uci . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entire astana team left the tour after its lead racer tested positive " we will no longer work together with the uci , there will be special rules for the tour de france , " prudhomme told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung on saturday .
" it -lrb- the uci -rrb- is good for nothing .
the uci never wanted a clean tour . " prudhomme said that he was ready to attend an anti-doping summit proposed by wada and that " we will next year co-operate with wada and the french anti-doping agency " instead of the uci . " things will be better without the uci , they must become better , " he said . uci gives support to germany but german cycling officials appear to believe the uci is doing a satisfactory job .
they announced on thursday that they had received the organization 's signature on an anti-doping declaration for the road racing world championships to be held in stuttgart in late september . under the agreement , the uci , german sports authorities , local organizers and germany 's anti-doping agency will conduct a multitude of tests ahead of the championships , including pre-event random testing and requiring all cyclists to provide blood samples prior to racing . " the measures announced at the beginning of july are intended to send a strong signal , namely that cycling has taken a new stance , " said wolfgang schneider , the general secretary of the event 's steering committee . article based on news reprots -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de tour de france sinking in doping mire the tour de france continues on thursday minus its leader .
the rabobank team has kicked michael rasmussen out , as more doping-related scandals tarnished the famous race 's reputation .
-lrb- 26.07.2007 -rrb- opinion : doping threatens cycling more than other sports as the tour de france deals with yet another doping scandal , some hardcore fans say the press unfairly singles out cycling .

" the uci has displayed a lack of lucidity , of professionalism , a total unawareness , " clerc said .
" either it is incompetence or they wanted to do damage ...
the management has no other choice but to resign , " clerc told journalists before the start of the next-to-last stage of the tour , in the city of cognac . however , uci president pat mcquaid told reuters : " it 's ridiculous .
it is not up to him to ask for that .
only the uci congress can . " clerc , who heads the amaury sport organization , and tour director christian prudhomme have accused the uci of having intentionally neglected to inform them of a positive doping test of german cyclist patrik sinkewitz and of danish rider micheal rasmussen missing at least one doping test and lying about his whereabouts to avoid the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour could look very different next year both situations were revealed during the running of the tour , leading german public television stations ard and zdf to stop live broadcasts of the race and rasmussen being forced out of the race when he was leading it . clerc and prudhomme have charged that the uci withheld the information in order to destabilize the race . " the uci is not able to lead the reconstruction of the -lrb- anti-doping -rrb- system , " clerc said .
" we will attempt to unite all people of good will , riders , teams ...
we do n't want to exclude the sports authorities , but we want a sports authority that is ethical , neutral , independent and responsible . " end of cooperation prudhomme said that he felt " betrayed " by the uci . " the result of the -lrb- sinkewitz -rrb- positive test took a month and a week to be made public , " he said .
that 's a very surprising delay . " clerc said the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- " is certainly the most competent body to lead the fight that touches every sport . " earlier saturday , prudhomme was quoted as saying that the tour de france would no longer cooperate with the uci . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entire astana team left the tour after its lead racer tested positive " we will no longer work together with the uci , there will be special rules for the tour de france , " prudhomme told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung on saturday .
" it -lrb- the uci -rrb- is good for nothing .
the uci never wanted a clean tour . " prudhomme said that he was ready to attend an anti-doping summit proposed by wada and that " we will next year co-operate with wada and the french anti-doping agency " instead of the uci . " things will be better without the uci , they must become better , " he said . uci gives support to germany but german cycling officials appear to believe the uci is doing a satisfactory job .
they announced on thursday that they had received the organization 's signature on an anti-doping declaration for the road racing world championships to be held in stuttgart in late september . under the agreement , the uci , german sports authorities , local organizers and germany 's anti-doping agency will conduct a multitude of tests ahead of the championships , including pre-event random testing and requiring all cyclists to provide blood samples prior to racing . " the measures announced at the beginning of july are intended to send a strong signal , namely that cycling has taken a new stance , " said wolfgang schneider , the general secretary of the event 's steering committee . article based on news reprots -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the uci has displayed a lack of lucidity , of professionalism , a total unawareness , " clerc said .
" either it is incompetence or they wanted to do damage ...
the management has no other choice but to resign , " clerc told journalists before the start of the next-to-last stage of the tour , in the city of cognac . however , uci president pat mcquaid told reuters : " it 's ridiculous .
it is not up to him to ask for that .
only the uci congress can . " clerc , who heads the amaury sport organization , and tour director christian prudhomme have accused the uci of having intentionally neglected to inform them of a positive doping test of german cyclist patrik sinkewitz and of danish rider micheal rasmussen missing at least one doping test and lying about his whereabouts to avoid the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour could look very different next year both situations were revealed during the running of the tour , leading german public television stations ard and zdf to stop live broadcasts of the race and rasmussen being forced out of the race when he was leading it . clerc and prudhomme have charged that the uci withheld the information in order to destabilize the race . " the uci is not able to lead the reconstruction of the -lrb- anti-doping -rrb- system , " clerc said .
" we will attempt to unite all people of good will , riders , teams ...
we do n't want to exclude the sports authorities , but we want a sports authority that is ethical , neutral , independent and responsible . " end of cooperation prudhomme said that he felt " betrayed " by the uci . " the result of the -lrb- sinkewitz -rrb- positive test took a month and a week to be made public , " he said .
that 's a very surprising delay . " clerc said the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- " is certainly the most competent body to lead the fight that touches every sport . " earlier saturday , prudhomme was quoted as saying that the tour de france would no longer cooperate with the uci . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entire astana team left the tour after its lead racer tested positive " we will no longer work together with the uci , there will be special rules for the tour de france , " prudhomme told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung on saturday .
" it -lrb- the uci -rrb- is good for nothing .
the uci never wanted a clean tour . " prudhomme said that he was ready to attend an anti-doping summit proposed by wada and that " we will next year co-operate with wada and the french anti-doping agency " instead of the uci . " things will be better without the uci , they must become better , " he said . uci gives support to germany but german cycling officials appear to believe the uci is doing a satisfactory job .
they announced on thursday that they had received the organization 's signature on an anti-doping declaration for the road racing world championships to be held in stuttgart in late september . under the agreement , the uci , german sports authorities , local organizers and germany 's anti-doping agency will conduct a multitude of tests ahead of the championships , including pre-event random testing and requiring all cyclists to provide blood samples prior to racing . " the measures announced at the beginning of july are intended to send a strong signal , namely that cycling has taken a new stance , " said wolfgang schneider , the general secretary of the event 's steering committee . article based on news reprots -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the african country also provided details on the deal that led to the doctor and five nurses ' release . " the detainees should have been detained upon their arrival -lsb- in sofia -rsb- , and not freed in this celebratory and illegal manner , " libyan foreign minister abdel rahman shalgham said saturday at a news conference in tripoli .
bulgaria 's actions " violated the legal procedures regarding extradition , as set down under international law and in the agreement on judicial cooperation signed between the two countries " in 1984 , added prime minister baghdadi mahmudi .
" we followed the procedure - it is bulgaria that betrayed us . "
mahmundi also said that french president nicolas sarkozy expressed similar dissatisfaction with the bulgarian decision to pardon the medics when he made a trip to libya this week .
shalgham also criticized " humanitarian and international organisations who , instead of criticising the liberation of the criminals , welcomed and greeted this step . "
main fund sponsors announced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy made a high-profile visit to libya shortly after the medics ' release at the same press conference , mahmudi said the czech republic , bulgaria , slovakia and qatar were the main donors to a fund set up to pay hundreds of families of children who contracted the hiv virus at a libyan hospital in the 1990s .
he also said that france had pledged to train some 50 libyan doctors .
bulgaria contributed to the fund through a non-governmental organisation open to private bulgarian and foreign companies , deputy foreign minister feim chaushev told reuters .
" one of the options for bulgaria 's contribution to the fund is forgiving the libyan debt , " chaushev added .
" we are to decide on that option .
we are discussing other options as well , such as technical assistance . "
the six bulgarian medics were detained in 1999 and later found guilty and sentenced to death by libyan courts of intentionally infecting 438 children with the aids causing hiv virus .
fifty six of the children have died .
the medics , five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor who has been given bulgarian citizenship , maintained their innocence .
foreign health experts have said poor sanitary conditions in libya 's hospitals were to blame for the spread of the disease among patients .
libya calls for international protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several medics said they were tortured during the eight-year imprisonment as a protest to bulgarian president georgy parvanov 's pardon , libya called on arab league members to adopt a common stand on the affair at a meeting of representatives on monday , the prime minister said .
tripoli will also seek support from the african union and the organisation of the islamic conference , mahmudi added .
libya allowed the medics to return to bulgaria on tuesday , where they had been due to serve life terms in prison .
since their release the medics have said their confessions were extracted under torture .
" all of us were treated like animals , " the doctor ashraf juma hajuj said thursday .
" we were tortured for a long time , with electricity , beatings , deprivation of sleep . "
the families of the deceased and hiv-positive children have criticised bulgaria 's decision , and their representative idriss lagha again on saturday called on libya 's government to request that interpol arrest the medics again , and for tripoli to cut all diplomatic ties with sofia .
bulgaria , however , said it wants to close this chapter of relations with libya and move on .

the spokeswoman would not comment on the magazine report , the associated press reported saturday . according to der spiegel , the iranian government has channeled some of its foreign currency earnings to german banks .
the total held by german financial institutions topped 6.55 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.9 billion -rrb- . levey called iran the " central bank of terrorism , " in an interview with public broadcaster südwestrundfunk last week . germany 's largest bank , deutsche bank , had tacitly agreed to run down its dealings with iran after being placed on a list of institutions dealing with countries the us called state sponsors of terrorism - cuba , iran , north korea , sudan and syria . german companies not alone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuba is another country the us wants international companies to leave the us financial watchdog , the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- , has since removed the list it compiled , which contained names of businesses from the united states , australia , great britain , germany , france and japan , from the internet , saying it had received many complaints from companies , some insisting the list was out of date . hsbc holdings , unilever plc , bp plc , siemens , total , basf and the mitsubishi ufj financial group were just some of the companies highlighted in addition to deutsche bank . the sec list stated that siemens has business dealings with all five named " sponsors of terrorism " while basf is linked solely with iran .
deutsche bank has connections with both iran and sudan .
deutsche bank spokesman ronald weichert confirmed in an earlier handelsblatt report that the bank 's " commercial relations " with iran and sudan were common knowledge .
declining to comment further , the bank did add that its iranian business made up only 0.1 percent of turnover and was being reduced further . us blackmail ? another large german bank , commerzbank , stopped financing trade deals with iran in january , according to the report . an unnamed german banker said german institutions were effectively being " blackmailed " into signing on to us foreign policy decisions . der spiegel said levey had secured less success in pressuring the german government to end financial guarantees for exports through the hermes scheme . thousands of jobs in germany were linked to the 4 billion euros in exports that go to the gulf region every year , it noted . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

main fund sponsors announced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy made a high-profile visit to libya shortly after the medics ' release at the same press conference , mahmudi said the czech republic , bulgaria , slovakia and qatar were the main donors to a fund set up to pay hundreds of families of children who contracted the hiv virus at a libyan hospital in the 1990s .
he also said that france had pledged to train some 50 libyan doctors .
bulgaria contributed to the fund through a non-governmental organisation open to private bulgarian and foreign companies , deputy foreign minister feim chaushev told reuters .
" one of the options for bulgaria 's contribution to the fund is forgiving the libyan debt , " chaushev added .
" we are to decide on that option .
we are discussing other options as well , such as technical assistance . "
the six bulgarian medics were detained in 1999 and later found guilty and sentenced to death by libyan courts of intentionally infecting 438 children with the aids causing hiv virus .
fifty six of the children have died .
the medics , five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor who has been given bulgarian citizenship , maintained their innocence .
foreign health experts have said poor sanitary conditions in libya 's hospitals were to blame for the spread of the disease among patients .
libya calls for international protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several medics said they were tortured during the eight-year imprisonment as a protest to bulgarian president georgy parvanov 's pardon , libya called on arab league members to adopt a common stand on the affair at a meeting of representatives on monday , the prime minister said .
tripoli will also seek support from the african union and the organisation of the islamic conference , mahmudi added .
libya allowed the medics to return to bulgaria on tuesday , where they had been due to serve life terms in prison .
since their release the medics have said their confessions were extracted under torture .
" all of us were treated like animals , " the doctor ashraf juma hajuj said thursday .
" we were tortured for a long time , with electricity , beatings , deprivation of sleep . "
the families of the deceased and hiv-positive children have criticised bulgaria 's decision , and their representative idriss lagha again on saturday called on libya 's government to request that interpol arrest the medics again , and for tripoli to cut all diplomatic ties with sofia .
bulgaria , however , said it wants to close this chapter of relations with libya and move on .
" the most important thing is to restore our relations with libya because in the last eight years they have stalled in the medics ' case , " bulgarian foreign minister ivailo kalfin told darik radio . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the uci has displayed a lack of lucidity , of professionalism , a total unawareness , " clerc said .
" either it is incompetence or they wanted to do damage ...
the management has no other choice but to resign , " clerc told journalists before the start of the next-to-last stage of the tour , in the city of cognac . however , uci president pat mcquaid told reuters : " it 's ridiculous .
it is not up to him to ask for that .
only the uci congress can . " clerc , who heads the amaury sport organization , and tour director christian prudhomme have accused the uci of having intentionally neglected to inform them of a positive doping test of german cyclist patrik sinkewitz and of danish rider micheal rasmussen missing at least one doping test and lying about his whereabouts to avoid the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour could look very different next year both situations were revealed during the running of the tour , leading german public television stations ard and zdf to stop live broadcasts of the race and rasmussen being forced out of the race when he was leading it . clerc and prudhomme have charged that the uci withheld the information in order to destabilize the race . " the uci is not able to lead the reconstruction of the -lrb- anti-doping -rrb- system , " clerc said .
" we will attempt to unite all people of good will , riders , teams ...
we do n't want to exclude the sports authorities , but we want a sports authority that is ethical , neutral , independent and responsible . " end of cooperation prudhomme said that he felt " betrayed " by the uci . " the result of the -lrb- sinkewitz -rrb- positive test took a month and a week to be made public , " he said .
that 's a very surprising delay . " clerc said the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- " is certainly the most competent body to lead the fight that touches every sport . " earlier saturday , prudhomme was quoted as saying that the tour de france would no longer cooperate with the uci . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entire astana team left the tour after its lead racer tested positive " we will no longer work together with the uci , there will be special rules for the tour de france , " prudhomme told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung on saturday .
" it -lrb- the uci -rrb- is good for nothing .
the uci never wanted a clean tour . " prudhomme said that he was ready to attend an anti-doping summit proposed by wada and that " we will next year co-operate with wada and the french anti-doping agency " instead of the uci . " things will be better without the uci , they must become better , " he said . uci gives support to germany but german cycling officials appear to believe the uci is doing a satisfactory job .
they announced on thursday that they had received the organization 's signature on an anti-doping declaration for the road racing world championships to be held in stuttgart in late september . under the agreement , the uci , german sports authorities , local organizers and germany 's anti-doping agency will conduct a multitude of tests ahead of the championships , including pre-event random testing and requiring all cyclists to provide blood samples prior to racing . " the measures announced at the beginning of july are intended to send a strong signal , namely that cycling has taken a new stance , " said wolfgang schneider , the general secretary of the event 's steering committee . article based on news reprots -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the african country also provided details on the deal that led to the doctor and five nurses ' release . " the detainees should have been detained upon their arrival -lsb- in sofia -rsb- , and not freed in this celebratory and illegal manner , " libyan foreign minister abdel rahman shalgham said saturday at a news conference in tripoli .
bulgaria 's actions " violated the legal procedures regarding extradition , as set down under international law and in the agreement on judicial cooperation signed between the two countries " in 1984 , added prime minister baghdadi mahmudi .
" we followed the procedure - it is bulgaria that betrayed us . "
mahmundi also said that french president nicolas sarkozy expressed similar dissatisfaction with the bulgarian decision to pardon the medics when he made a trip to libya this week .
shalgham also criticized " humanitarian and international organisations who , instead of criticising the liberation of the criminals , welcomed and greeted this step . "
main fund sponsors announced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy made a high-profile visit to libya shortly after the medics ' release at the same press conference , mahmudi said the czech republic , bulgaria , slovakia and qatar were the main donors to a fund set up to pay hundreds of families of children who contracted the hiv virus at a libyan hospital in the 1990s .
he also said that france had pledged to train some 50 libyan doctors .
bulgaria contributed to the fund through a non-governmental organisation open to private bulgarian and foreign companies , deputy foreign minister feim chaushev told reuters .
" one of the options for bulgaria 's contribution to the fund is forgiving the libyan debt , " chaushev added .
" we are to decide on that option .
we are discussing other options as well , such as technical assistance . "
the six bulgarian medics were detained in 1999 and later found guilty and sentenced to death by libyan courts of intentionally infecting 438 children with the aids causing hiv virus .
fifty six of the children have died .
the medics , five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor who has been given bulgarian citizenship , maintained their innocence .
foreign health experts have said poor sanitary conditions in libya 's hospitals were to blame for the spread of the disease among patients .
libya calls for international protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several medics said they were tortured during the eight-year imprisonment as a protest to bulgarian president georgy parvanov 's pardon , libya called on arab league members to adopt a common stand on the affair at a meeting of representatives on monday , the prime minister said .
tripoli will also seek support from the african union and the organisation of the islamic conference , mahmudi added .
libya allowed the medics to return to bulgaria on tuesday , where they had been due to serve life terms in prison .
since their release the medics have said their confessions were extracted under torture .
" all of us were treated like animals , " the doctor ashraf juma hajuj said thursday .
" we were tortured for a long time , with electricity , beatings , deprivation of sleep . "
the families of the deceased and hiv-positive children have criticised bulgaria 's decision , and their representative idriss lagha again on saturday called on libya 's government to request that interpol arrest the medics again , and for tripoli to cut all diplomatic ties with sofia .
bulgaria , however , said it wants to close this chapter of relations with libya and move on .
" the most important thing is to restore our relations with libya because in the last eight years they have stalled in the medics ' case , " bulgarian foreign minister ivailo kalfin told darik radio . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german laws have no clear answer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the threat of deportations can make life hell for some immigrants german authorities are undecided about whether hiv-positive immigrants with temporary residence permits are allowed to stay in the country despite the often poor availability of life-saving treatment back home . every three months , maureen faces a terrifying task : making a trip to the local foreigners ' office in frankfurt to find out whether she can stay on in the country .
the kenyan , who has a precarious residence status in germany , is in danger of deportation despite the fact that she has aids and has been undergoing treatment for several years .
every three months , the german authorities rule afresh on putting off her deportation .
the uncertainty of her situation is taking its toll .
" when i go with her to the foreigners ' office , then she -lsb- maureen -rsb- often has n't slept the night before , " said iris hufnagel , a social worker with an aids campaign group in frankfurt .
" she 's sick with worry that she will be directly sent off to a detention center for deportees . "
at the mercy of immigration laws like maureen , there are some 170,000 foreigners in germany who have been living in the country for more than 15 years and still have a temporary residence permit .
in german bureaucratic language , they are said to be " tolerated . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long line of immigrants at a foreigners ' office in germany in theory , these people are obliged to leave germany .
but they are allowed to stay on humanitarian grounds if they face persecution in their home countries .
in practice , they can be sent home anytime because their residence permit is usually extended by just three months each time .
maureen thus has to spend her life at the mercy of germany 's complicated immigration laws .
for over five years , the authorities handling maureen 's case have been examining whether there 's a " significant , concrete danger for the physical well-being and life , " as the law says , if they deport her .
effective aids treatment in kenya ?
immigration officials are in particular checking whether maureen could die if she was sent back to kenya because of lack of sufficient treatment .
the german embassy in nairobi says that aids infections can be treated effectively in kenya .
therapy is expensive but it 's possible to have it for 200 euros -lrb- $ 276 -rrb- a month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting access to aids treatment in africa is not easy but not everyone buys that argument .
" i just ca n't imagine it , " hufnagel said .
" how will she take medicines there when she 's lacking other things ? "
the social worker added that maureen also faced the risk of being mugged in kenya since the medicines were so expensive .
besides , the therapy would also mean a privilege , hufnagel said .
" imagine being in a family , knowing that the brother too is hiv positive and he does n't get the medicines … that 's an absurd situation . "
aids a reason to stop deportations ?
german courts seem to be confused about whether aids is a reason for freezing deportations .
while a few have ruled in the past that breaking off aids treatment poses a real danger to life , others have argued it does n't since the illness is long drawn out and does n't directly lead to death .
volker beck , a parliamentarian of the opposition green party , said it 's scandalous that these legal questions are discussed at the cost of those affected - a group , he says , faces a double stigma .
" firstly they are migrants , in most cases with a precarious status , and in addition , they have an ailment that leads to societal exclusion , " beck said .
he added that since the number of affected was not high , germany could afford to be much more humane towards them than is currently the case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some migrants first learn of their hiv-positive status in germany authorities in germany fear that if aids was recognized as a valid reason to stop deportations , it would give a free ticket to many african aids patients to come to germany .
beck rebuffed those concerns , pointing out that according to the eu 's current dublin agreement , asylum-seekers are sent back to the eu nation through which they entered the bloc .
besides , it 's much more likely that asylum-seekers would discover their hiv status for the first time in germany , said beck .
uncertain fate " the people who come here are those who are strong-willed and in good health , " hufnagel said .
she added that the diagnosis of an hiv infection is usually traumatic for them .
" the fact that they face so much change could also be the reason why some things then rise to the surface once they 're here . "
learning about her illness was an additional shock for maureen , too .
lured to germany by the promise of marriage , she was abused by her future husband .

the african country also provided details on the deal that led to the doctor and five nurses ' release . " the detainees should have been detained upon their arrival -lsb- in sofia -rsb- , and not freed in this celebratory and illegal manner , " libyan foreign minister abdel rahman shalgham said saturday at a news conference in tripoli .
bulgaria 's actions " violated the legal procedures regarding extradition , as set down under international law and in the agreement on judicial cooperation signed between the two countries " in 1984 , added prime minister baghdadi mahmudi .
" we followed the procedure - it is bulgaria that betrayed us . "
mahmundi also said that french president nicolas sarkozy expressed similar dissatisfaction with the bulgarian decision to pardon the medics when he made a trip to libya this week .
shalgham also criticized " humanitarian and international organisations who , instead of criticising the liberation of the criminals , welcomed and greeted this step . "
main fund sponsors announced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy made a high-profile visit to libya shortly after the medics ' release at the same press conference , mahmudi said the czech republic , bulgaria , slovakia and qatar were the main donors to a fund set up to pay hundreds of families of children who contracted the hiv virus at a libyan hospital in the 1990s .
he also said that france had pledged to train some 50 libyan doctors .
bulgaria contributed to the fund through a non-governmental organisation open to private bulgarian and foreign companies , deputy foreign minister feim chaushev told reuters .
" one of the options for bulgaria 's contribution to the fund is forgiving the libyan debt , " chaushev added .
" we are to decide on that option .
we are discussing other options as well , such as technical assistance . "
the six bulgarian medics were detained in 1999 and later found guilty and sentenced to death by libyan courts of intentionally infecting 438 children with the aids causing hiv virus .
fifty six of the children have died .
the medics , five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor who has been given bulgarian citizenship , maintained their innocence .
foreign health experts have said poor sanitary conditions in libya 's hospitals were to blame for the spread of the disease among patients .
libya calls for international protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several medics said they were tortured during the eight-year imprisonment as a protest to bulgarian president georgy parvanov 's pardon , libya called on arab league members to adopt a common stand on the affair at a meeting of representatives on monday , the prime minister said .
tripoli will also seek support from the african union and the organisation of the islamic conference , mahmudi added .
libya allowed the medics to return to bulgaria on tuesday , where they had been due to serve life terms in prison .
since their release the medics have said their confessions were extracted under torture .
" all of us were treated like animals , " the doctor ashraf juma hajuj said thursday .
" we were tortured for a long time , with electricity , beatings , deprivation of sleep . "
the families of the deceased and hiv-positive children have criticised bulgaria 's decision , and their representative idriss lagha again on saturday called on libya 's government to request that interpol arrest the medics again , and for tripoli to cut all diplomatic ties with sofia .
bulgaria , however , said it wants to close this chapter of relations with libya and move on .
" the most important thing is to restore our relations with libya because in the last eight years they have stalled in the medics ' case , " bulgarian foreign minister ivailo kalfin told darik radio . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the african country also provided details on the deal that led to the doctor and five nurses ' release . " the detainees should have been detained upon their arrival -lsb- in sofia -rsb- , and not freed in this celebratory and illegal manner , " libyan foreign minister abdel rahman shalgham said saturday at a news conference in tripoli .
bulgaria 's actions " violated the legal procedures regarding extradition , as set down under international law and in the agreement on judicial cooperation signed between the two countries " in 1984 , added prime minister baghdadi mahmudi .
" we followed the procedure - it is bulgaria that betrayed us . "
mahmundi also said that french president nicolas sarkozy expressed similar dissatisfaction with the bulgarian decision to pardon the medics when he made a trip to libya this week .
shalgham also criticized " humanitarian and international organisations who , instead of criticising the liberation of the criminals , welcomed and greeted this step . "
main fund sponsors announced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy made a high-profile visit to libya shortly after the medics ' release at the same press conference , mahmudi said the czech republic , bulgaria , slovakia and qatar were the main donors to a fund set up to pay hundreds of families of children who contracted the hiv virus at a libyan hospital in the 1990s .
he also said that france had pledged to train some 50 libyan doctors .
bulgaria contributed to the fund through a non-governmental organisation open to private bulgarian and foreign companies , deputy foreign minister feim chaushev told reuters .
" one of the options for bulgaria 's contribution to the fund is forgiving the libyan debt , " chaushev added .
" we are to decide on that option .
we are discussing other options as well , such as technical assistance . "
the six bulgarian medics were detained in 1999 and later found guilty and sentenced to death by libyan courts of intentionally infecting 438 children with the aids causing hiv virus .
fifty six of the children have died .
the medics , five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor who has been given bulgarian citizenship , maintained their innocence .
foreign health experts have said poor sanitary conditions in libya 's hospitals were to blame for the spread of the disease among patients .
libya calls for international protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several medics said they were tortured during the eight-year imprisonment as a protest to bulgarian president georgy parvanov 's pardon , libya called on arab league members to adopt a common stand on the affair at a meeting of representatives on monday , the prime minister said .
tripoli will also seek support from the african union and the organisation of the islamic conference , mahmudi added .
libya allowed the medics to return to bulgaria on tuesday , where they had been due to serve life terms in prison .
since their release the medics have said their confessions were extracted under torture .
" all of us were treated like animals , " the doctor ashraf juma hajuj said thursday .
" we were tortured for a long time , with electricity , beatings , deprivation of sleep . "
the families of the deceased and hiv-positive children have criticised bulgaria 's decision , and their representative idriss lagha again on saturday called on libya 's government to request that interpol arrest the medics again , and for tripoli to cut all diplomatic ties with sofia .
bulgaria , however , said it wants to close this chapter of relations with libya and move on .
" the most important thing is to restore our relations with libya because in the last eight years they have stalled in the medics ' case , " bulgarian foreign minister ivailo kalfin told darik radio . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german laws have no clear answer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the threat of deportations can make life hell for some immigrants german authorities are undecided about whether hiv-positive immigrants with temporary residence permits are allowed to stay in the country despite the often poor availability of life-saving treatment back home . every three months , maureen faces a terrifying task : making a trip to the local foreigners ' office in frankfurt to find out whether she can stay on in the country .
the kenyan , who has a precarious residence status in germany , is in danger of deportation despite the fact that she has aids and has been undergoing treatment for several years .
every three months , the german authorities rule afresh on putting off her deportation .
the uncertainty of her situation is taking its toll .
" when i go with her to the foreigners ' office , then she -lsb- maureen -rsb- often has n't slept the night before , " said iris hufnagel , a social worker with an aids campaign group in frankfurt .
" she 's sick with worry that she will be directly sent off to a detention center for deportees . "
at the mercy of immigration laws like maureen , there are some 170,000 foreigners in germany who have been living in the country for more than 15 years and still have a temporary residence permit .
in german bureaucratic language , they are said to be " tolerated . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long line of immigrants at a foreigners ' office in germany in theory , these people are obliged to leave germany .
but they are allowed to stay on humanitarian grounds if they face persecution in their home countries .
in practice , they can be sent home anytime because their residence permit is usually extended by just three months each time .
maureen thus has to spend her life at the mercy of germany 's complicated immigration laws .
for over five years , the authorities handling maureen 's case have been examining whether there 's a " significant , concrete danger for the physical well-being and life , " as the law says , if they deport her .
effective aids treatment in kenya ?
immigration officials are in particular checking whether maureen could die if she was sent back to kenya because of lack of sufficient treatment .
the german embassy in nairobi says that aids infections can be treated effectively in kenya .
therapy is expensive but it 's possible to have it for 200 euros -lrb- $ 276 -rrb- a month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting access to aids treatment in africa is not easy but not everyone buys that argument .
" i just ca n't imagine it , " hufnagel said .
" how will she take medicines there when she 's lacking other things ? "
the social worker added that maureen also faced the risk of being mugged in kenya since the medicines were so expensive .
besides , the therapy would also mean a privilege , hufnagel said .
" imagine being in a family , knowing that the brother too is hiv positive and he does n't get the medicines … that 's an absurd situation . "
aids a reason to stop deportations ?
german courts seem to be confused about whether aids is a reason for freezing deportations .
while a few have ruled in the past that breaking off aids treatment poses a real danger to life , others have argued it does n't since the illness is long drawn out and does n't directly lead to death .
volker beck , a parliamentarian of the opposition green party , said it 's scandalous that these legal questions are discussed at the cost of those affected - a group , he says , faces a double stigma .
" firstly they are migrants , in most cases with a precarious status , and in addition , they have an ailment that leads to societal exclusion , " beck said .
he added that since the number of affected was not high , germany could afford to be much more humane towards them than is currently the case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some migrants first learn of their hiv-positive status in germany authorities in germany fear that if aids was recognized as a valid reason to stop deportations , it would give a free ticket to many african aids patients to come to germany .
beck rebuffed those concerns , pointing out that according to the eu 's current dublin agreement , asylum-seekers are sent back to the eu nation through which they entered the bloc .
besides , it 's much more likely that asylum-seekers would discover their hiv status for the first time in germany , said beck .
uncertain fate " the people who come here are those who are strong-willed and in good health , " hufnagel said .
she added that the diagnosis of an hiv infection is usually traumatic for them .
" the fact that they face so much change could also be the reason why some things then rise to the surface once they 're here . "
learning about her illness was an additional shock for maureen , too .
lured to germany by the promise of marriage , she was abused by her future husband .
when she suffered a serious lung infection , he threw maureen out .
thanks to good medical treatment , the kenyan is on her feet again .
but it 's essential that she continues to receive treatment if her health is to remain stable . nadine wojcik -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the uci has displayed a lack of lucidity , of professionalism , a total unawareness , " clerc said .
" either it is incompetence or they wanted to do damage ...
the management has no other choice but to resign , " clerc told journalists before the start of the next-to-last stage of the tour , in the city of cognac . however , uci president pat mcquaid told reuters : " it 's ridiculous .
it is not up to him to ask for that .
only the uci congress can . " clerc , who heads the amaury sport organization , and tour director christian prudhomme have accused the uci of having intentionally neglected to inform them of a positive doping test of german cyclist patrik sinkewitz and of danish rider micheal rasmussen missing at least one doping test and lying about his whereabouts to avoid the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour could look very different next year both situations were revealed during the running of the tour , leading german public television stations ard and zdf to stop live broadcasts of the race and rasmussen being forced out of the race when he was leading it . clerc and prudhomme have charged that the uci withheld the information in order to destabilize the race . " the uci is not able to lead the reconstruction of the -lrb- anti-doping -rrb- system , " clerc said .
" we will attempt to unite all people of good will , riders , teams ...
we do n't want to exclude the sports authorities , but we want a sports authority that is ethical , neutral , independent and responsible . " end of cooperation prudhomme said that he felt " betrayed " by the uci . " the result of the -lrb- sinkewitz -rrb- positive test took a month and a week to be made public , " he said .
that 's a very surprising delay . " clerc said the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- " is certainly the most competent body to lead the fight that touches every sport . " earlier saturday , prudhomme was quoted as saying that the tour de france would no longer cooperate with the uci . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entire astana team left the tour after its lead racer tested positive " we will no longer work together with the uci , there will be special rules for the tour de france , " prudhomme told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung on saturday .
" it -lrb- the uci -rrb- is good for nothing .
the uci never wanted a clean tour . " prudhomme said that he was ready to attend an anti-doping summit proposed by wada and that " we will next year co-operate with wada and the french anti-doping agency " instead of the uci . " things will be better without the uci , they must become better , " he said . uci gives support to germany but german cycling officials appear to believe the uci is doing a satisfactory job .
they announced on thursday that they had received the organization 's signature on an anti-doping declaration for the road racing world championships to be held in stuttgart in late september . under the agreement , the uci , german sports authorities , local organizers and germany 's anti-doping agency will conduct a multitude of tests ahead of the championships , including pre-event random testing and requiring all cyclists to provide blood samples prior to racing .

the spokeswoman would not comment on the magazine report , the associated press reported saturday . according to der spiegel , the iranian government has channeled some of its foreign currency earnings to german banks .
the total held by german financial institutions topped 6.55 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.9 billion -rrb- . levey called iran the " central bank of terrorism , " in an interview with public broadcaster südwestrundfunk last week . germany 's largest bank , deutsche bank , had tacitly agreed to run down its dealings with iran after being placed on a list of institutions dealing with countries the us called state sponsors of terrorism - cuba , iran , north korea , sudan and syria . german companies not alone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuba is another country the us wants international companies to leave the us financial watchdog , the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- , has since removed the list it compiled , which contained names of businesses from the united states , australia , great britain , germany , france and japan , from the internet , saying it had received many complaints from companies , some insisting the list was out of date . hsbc holdings , unilever plc , bp plc , siemens , total , basf and the mitsubishi ufj financial group were just some of the companies highlighted in addition to deutsche bank . the sec list stated that siemens has business dealings with all five named " sponsors of terrorism " while basf is linked solely with iran .
deutsche bank has connections with both iran and sudan .
deutsche bank spokesman ronald weichert confirmed in an earlier handelsblatt report that the bank 's " commercial relations " with iran and sudan were common knowledge .
declining to comment further , the bank did add that its iranian business made up only 0.1 percent of turnover and was being reduced further . us blackmail ? another large german bank , commerzbank , stopped financing trade deals with iran in january , according to the report . an unnamed german banker said german institutions were effectively being " blackmailed " into signing on to us foreign policy decisions . der spiegel said levey had secured less success in pressuring the german government to end financial guarantees for exports through the hermes scheme . thousands of jobs in germany were linked to the 4 billion euros in exports that go to the gulf region every year , it noted . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the uci has displayed a lack of lucidity , of professionalism , a total unawareness , " clerc said .
" either it is incompetence or they wanted to do damage ...
the management has no other choice but to resign , " clerc told journalists before the start of the next-to-last stage of the tour , in the city of cognac . however , uci president pat mcquaid told reuters : " it 's ridiculous .
it is not up to him to ask for that .
only the uci congress can . " clerc , who heads the amaury sport organization , and tour director christian prudhomme have accused the uci of having intentionally neglected to inform them of a positive doping test of german cyclist patrik sinkewitz and of danish rider micheal rasmussen missing at least one doping test and lying about his whereabouts to avoid the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour could look very different next year both situations were revealed during the running of the tour , leading german public television stations ard and zdf to stop live broadcasts of the race and rasmussen being forced out of the race when he was leading it . clerc and prudhomme have charged that the uci withheld the information in order to destabilize the race . " the uci is not able to lead the reconstruction of the -lrb- anti-doping -rrb- system , " clerc said .
" we will attempt to unite all people of good will , riders , teams ...
we do n't want to exclude the sports authorities , but we want a sports authority that is ethical , neutral , independent and responsible . " end of cooperation prudhomme said that he felt " betrayed " by the uci . " the result of the -lrb- sinkewitz -rrb- positive test took a month and a week to be made public , " he said .

the spokeswoman would not comment on the magazine report , the associated press reported saturday . according to der spiegel , the iranian government has channeled some of its foreign currency earnings to german banks .
the total held by german financial institutions topped 6.55 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.9 billion -rrb- . levey called iran the " central bank of terrorism , " in an interview with public broadcaster südwestrundfunk last week . germany 's largest bank , deutsche bank , had tacitly agreed to run down its dealings with iran after being placed on a list of institutions dealing with countries the us called state sponsors of terrorism - cuba , iran , north korea , sudan and syria . german companies not alone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuba is another country the us wants international companies to leave the us financial watchdog , the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- , has since removed the list it compiled , which contained names of businesses from the united states , australia , great britain , germany , france and japan , from the internet , saying it had received many complaints from companies , some insisting the list was out of date . hsbc holdings , unilever plc , bp plc , siemens , total , basf and the mitsubishi ufj financial group were just some of the companies highlighted in addition to deutsche bank . the sec list stated that siemens has business dealings with all five named " sponsors of terrorism " while basf is linked solely with iran .
deutsche bank has connections with both iran and sudan .
deutsche bank spokesman ronald weichert confirmed in an earlier handelsblatt report that the bank 's " commercial relations " with iran and sudan were common knowledge .
declining to comment further , the bank did add that its iranian business made up only 0.1 percent of turnover and was being reduced further . us blackmail ? another large german bank , commerzbank , stopped financing trade deals with iran in january , according to the report . an unnamed german banker said german institutions were effectively being " blackmailed " into signing on to us foreign policy decisions . der spiegel said levey had secured less success in pressuring the german government to end financial guarantees for exports through the hermes scheme . thousands of jobs in germany were linked to the 4 billion euros in exports that go to the gulf region every year , it noted . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is not up to him to ask for that .
only the uci congress can . " clerc , who heads the amaury sport organization , and tour director christian prudhomme have accused the uci of having intentionally neglected to inform them of a positive doping test of german cyclist patrik sinkewitz and of danish rider micheal rasmussen missing at least one doping test and lying about his whereabouts to avoid the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour could look very different next year both situations were revealed during the running of the tour , leading german public television stations ard and zdf to stop live broadcasts of the race and rasmussen being forced out of the race when he was leading it . clerc and prudhomme have charged that the uci withheld the information in order to destabilize the race . " the uci is not able to lead the reconstruction of the -lrb- anti-doping -rrb- system , " clerc said .
" we will attempt to unite all people of good will , riders , teams ...
we do n't want to exclude the sports authorities , but we want a sports authority that is ethical , neutral , independent and responsible .

the african country also provided details on the deal that led to the doctor and five nurses ' release . " the detainees should have been detained upon their arrival -lsb- in sofia -rsb- , and not freed in this celebratory and illegal manner , " libyan foreign minister abdel rahman shalgham said saturday at a news conference in tripoli .
bulgaria 's actions " violated the legal procedures regarding extradition , as set down under international law and in the agreement on judicial cooperation signed between the two countries " in 1984 , added prime minister baghdadi mahmudi .
" we followed the procedure - it is bulgaria that betrayed us . "
mahmundi also said that french president nicolas sarkozy expressed similar dissatisfaction with the bulgarian decision to pardon the medics when he made a trip to libya this week .
shalgham also criticized " humanitarian and international organisations who , instead of criticising the liberation of the criminals , welcomed and greeted this step . "
main fund sponsors announced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy made a high-profile visit to libya shortly after the medics ' release at the same press conference , mahmudi said the czech republic , bulgaria , slovakia and qatar were the main donors to a fund set up to pay hundreds of families of children who contracted the hiv virus at a libyan hospital in the 1990s .
he also said that france had pledged to train some 50 libyan doctors .
bulgaria contributed to the fund through a non-governmental organisation open to private bulgarian and foreign companies , deputy foreign minister feim chaushev told reuters .
" one of the options for bulgaria 's contribution to the fund is forgiving the libyan debt , " chaushev added .
" we are to decide on that option .
we are discussing other options as well , such as technical assistance . "
the six bulgarian medics were detained in 1999 and later found guilty and sentenced to death by libyan courts of intentionally infecting 438 children with the aids causing hiv virus .
fifty six of the children have died .
the medics , five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor who has been given bulgarian citizenship , maintained their innocence .
foreign health experts have said poor sanitary conditions in libya 's hospitals were to blame for the spread of the disease among patients .
libya calls for international protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several medics said they were tortured during the eight-year imprisonment as a protest to bulgarian president georgy parvanov 's pardon , libya called on arab league members to adopt a common stand on the affair at a meeting of representatives on monday , the prime minister said .
tripoli will also seek support from the african union and the organisation of the islamic conference , mahmudi added .
libya allowed the medics to return to bulgaria on tuesday , where they had been due to serve life terms in prison .
since their release the medics have said their confessions were extracted under torture .
" all of us were treated like animals , " the doctor ashraf juma hajuj said thursday .
" we were tortured for a long time , with electricity , beatings , deprivation of sleep . "
the families of the deceased and hiv-positive children have criticised bulgaria 's decision , and their representative idriss lagha again on saturday called on libya 's government to request that interpol arrest the medics again , and for tripoli to cut all diplomatic ties with sofia .
bulgaria , however , said it wants to close this chapter of relations with libya and move on .
" the most important thing is to restore our relations with libya because in the last eight years they have stalled in the medics ' case , " bulgarian foreign minister ivailo kalfin told darik radio . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german laws have no clear answer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the threat of deportations can make life hell for some immigrants german authorities are undecided about whether hiv-positive immigrants with temporary residence permits are allowed to stay in the country despite the often poor availability of life-saving treatment back home . every three months , maureen faces a terrifying task : making a trip to the local foreigners ' office in frankfurt to find out whether she can stay on in the country .
the kenyan , who has a precarious residence status in germany , is in danger of deportation despite the fact that she has aids and has been undergoing treatment for several years .
every three months , the german authorities rule afresh on putting off her deportation .
the uncertainty of her situation is taking its toll .
" when i go with her to the foreigners ' office , then she -lsb- maureen -rsb- often has n't slept the night before , " said iris hufnagel , a social worker with an aids campaign group in frankfurt .
" she 's sick with worry that she will be directly sent off to a detention center for deportees . "
at the mercy of immigration laws like maureen , there are some 170,000 foreigners in germany who have been living in the country for more than 15 years and still have a temporary residence permit .
in german bureaucratic language , they are said to be " tolerated . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long line of immigrants at a foreigners ' office in germany in theory , these people are obliged to leave germany .
but they are allowed to stay on humanitarian grounds if they face persecution in their home countries .
in practice , they can be sent home anytime because their residence permit is usually extended by just three months each time .
maureen thus has to spend her life at the mercy of germany 's complicated immigration laws .
for over five years , the authorities handling maureen 's case have been examining whether there 's a " significant , concrete danger for the physical well-being and life , " as the law says , if they deport her .
effective aids treatment in kenya ?
immigration officials are in particular checking whether maureen could die if she was sent back to kenya because of lack of sufficient treatment .
the german embassy in nairobi says that aids infections can be treated effectively in kenya .
therapy is expensive but it 's possible to have it for 200 euros -lrb- $ 276 -rrb- a month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting access to aids treatment in africa is not easy but not everyone buys that argument .
" i just ca n't imagine it , " hufnagel said .
" how will she take medicines there when she 's lacking other things ? "
the social worker added that maureen also faced the risk of being mugged in kenya since the medicines were so expensive .
besides , the therapy would also mean a privilege , hufnagel said .
" imagine being in a family , knowing that the brother too is hiv positive and he does n't get the medicines … that 's an absurd situation . "
aids a reason to stop deportations ?
german courts seem to be confused about whether aids is a reason for freezing deportations .
while a few have ruled in the past that breaking off aids treatment poses a real danger to life , others have argued it does n't since the illness is long drawn out and does n't directly lead to death .
volker beck , a parliamentarian of the opposition green party , said it 's scandalous that these legal questions are discussed at the cost of those affected - a group , he says , faces a double stigma .
" firstly they are migrants , in most cases with a precarious status , and in addition , they have an ailment that leads to societal exclusion , " beck said .
he added that since the number of affected was not high , germany could afford to be much more humane towards them than is currently the case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some migrants first learn of their hiv-positive status in germany authorities in germany fear that if aids was recognized as a valid reason to stop deportations , it would give a free ticket to many african aids patients to come to germany .
beck rebuffed those concerns , pointing out that according to the eu 's current dublin agreement , asylum-seekers are sent back to the eu nation through which they entered the bloc .
besides , it 's much more likely that asylum-seekers would discover their hiv status for the first time in germany , said beck .
uncertain fate " the people who come here are those who are strong-willed and in good health , " hufnagel said .
she added that the diagnosis of an hiv infection is usually traumatic for them .
" the fact that they face so much change could also be the reason why some things then rise to the surface once they 're here . "
learning about her illness was an additional shock for maureen , too .
lured to germany by the promise of marriage , she was abused by her future husband .
when she suffered a serious lung infection , he threw maureen out .
thanks to good medical treatment , the kenyan is on her feet again .
but it 's essential that she continues to receive treatment if her health is to remain stable . nadine wojcik -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german laws have no clear answer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the threat of deportations can make life hell for some immigrants german authorities are undecided about whether hiv-positive immigrants with temporary residence permits are allowed to stay in the country despite the often poor availability of life-saving treatment back home . every three months , maureen faces a terrifying task : making a trip to the local foreigners ' office in frankfurt to find out whether she can stay on in the country .
the kenyan , who has a precarious residence status in germany , is in danger of deportation despite the fact that she has aids and has been undergoing treatment for several years .
every three months , the german authorities rule afresh on putting off her deportation .
the uncertainty of her situation is taking its toll .
" when i go with her to the foreigners ' office , then she -lsb- maureen -rsb- often has n't slept the night before , " said iris hufnagel , a social worker with an aids campaign group in frankfurt .
" she 's sick with worry that she will be directly sent off to a detention center for deportees . "
at the mercy of immigration laws like maureen , there are some 170,000 foreigners in germany who have been living in the country for more than 15 years and still have a temporary residence permit .
in german bureaucratic language , they are said to be " tolerated . "

maureen thus has to spend her life at the mercy of germany 's complicated immigration laws .
for over five years , the authorities handling maureen 's case have been examining whether there 's a " significant , concrete danger for the physical well-being and life , " as the law says , if they deport her .
effective aids treatment in kenya ?
immigration officials are in particular checking whether maureen could die if she was sent back to kenya because of lack of sufficient treatment .
the german embassy in nairobi says that aids infections can be treated effectively in kenya .
therapy is expensive but it 's possible to have it for 200 euros -lrb- $ 276 -rrb- a month .

" i just ca n't imagine it , " hufnagel said .
" how will she take medicines there when she 's lacking other things ? "
the social worker added that maureen also faced the risk of being mugged in kenya since the medicines were so expensive .
besides , the therapy would also mean a privilege , hufnagel said .
" imagine being in a family , knowing that the brother too is hiv positive and he does n't get the medicines … that 's an absurd situation . "
aids a reason to stop deportations ?
german courts seem to be confused about whether aids is a reason for freezing deportations .
while a few have ruled in the past that breaking off aids treatment poses a real danger to life , others have argued it does n't since the illness is long drawn out and does n't directly lead to death .
volker beck , a parliamentarian of the opposition green party , said it 's scandalous that these legal questions are discussed at the cost of those affected - a group , he says , faces a double stigma .
" firstly they are migrants , in most cases with a precarious status , and in addition , they have an ailment that leads to societal exclusion , " beck said .
he added that since the number of affected was not high , germany could afford to be much more humane towards them than is currently the case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some migrants first learn of their hiv-positive status in germany authorities in germany fear that if aids was recognized as a valid reason to stop deportations , it would give a free ticket to many african aids patients to come to germany .
beck rebuffed those concerns , pointing out that according to the eu 's current dublin agreement , asylum-seekers are sent back to the eu nation through which they entered the bloc .
besides , it 's much more likely that asylum-seekers would discover their hiv status for the first time in germany , said beck .
uncertain fate " the people who come here are those who are strong-willed and in good health , " hufnagel said .
she added that the diagnosis of an hiv infection is usually traumatic for them .
" the fact that they face so much change could also be the reason why some things then rise to the surface once they 're here . "
learning about her illness was an additional shock for maureen , too .
lured to germany by the promise of marriage , she was abused by her future husband .

german laws have no clear answer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the threat of deportations can make life hell for some immigrants german authorities are undecided about whether hiv-positive immigrants with temporary residence permits are allowed to stay in the country despite the often poor availability of life-saving treatment back home . every three months , maureen faces a terrifying task : making a trip to the local foreigners ' office in frankfurt to find out whether she can stay on in the country .
the kenyan , who has a precarious residence status in germany , is in danger of deportation despite the fact that she has aids and has been undergoing treatment for several years .
every three months , the german authorities rule afresh on putting off her deportation .
the uncertainty of her situation is taking its toll .
" when i go with her to the foreigners ' office , then she -lsb- maureen -rsb- often has n't slept the night before , " said iris hufnagel , a social worker with an aids campaign group in frankfurt .
" she 's sick with worry that she will be directly sent off to a detention center for deportees . "
at the mercy of immigration laws like maureen , there are some 170,000 foreigners in germany who have been living in the country for more than 15 years and still have a temporary residence permit .
in german bureaucratic language , they are said to be " tolerated . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long line of immigrants at a foreigners ' office in germany in theory , these people are obliged to leave germany .
but they are allowed to stay on humanitarian grounds if they face persecution in their home countries .
in practice , they can be sent home anytime because their residence permit is usually extended by just three months each time .
maureen thus has to spend her life at the mercy of germany 's complicated immigration laws .
for over five years , the authorities handling maureen 's case have been examining whether there 's a " significant , concrete danger for the physical well-being and life , " as the law says , if they deport her .
effective aids treatment in kenya ?
immigration officials are in particular checking whether maureen could die if she was sent back to kenya because of lack of sufficient treatment .
the german embassy in nairobi says that aids infections can be treated effectively in kenya .
therapy is expensive but it 's possible to have it for 200 euros -lrb- $ 276 -rrb- a month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting access to aids treatment in africa is not easy but not everyone buys that argument .
" i just ca n't imagine it , " hufnagel said .
" how will she take medicines there when she 's lacking other things ? "
the social worker added that maureen also faced the risk of being mugged in kenya since the medicines were so expensive .
besides , the therapy would also mean a privilege , hufnagel said .
" imagine being in a family , knowing that the brother too is hiv positive and he does n't get the medicines … that 's an absurd situation . "
aids a reason to stop deportations ?
german courts seem to be confused about whether aids is a reason for freezing deportations .
while a few have ruled in the past that breaking off aids treatment poses a real danger to life , others have argued it does n't since the illness is long drawn out and does n't directly lead to death .
volker beck , a parliamentarian of the opposition green party , said it 's scandalous that these legal questions are discussed at the cost of those affected - a group , he says , faces a double stigma .
" firstly they are migrants , in most cases with a precarious status , and in addition , they have an ailment that leads to societal exclusion , " beck said .
he added that since the number of affected was not high , germany could afford to be much more humane towards them than is currently the case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some migrants first learn of their hiv-positive status in germany authorities in germany fear that if aids was recognized as a valid reason to stop deportations , it would give a free ticket to many african aids patients to come to germany .
beck rebuffed those concerns , pointing out that according to the eu 's current dublin agreement , asylum-seekers are sent back to the eu nation through which they entered the bloc .
besides , it 's much more likely that asylum-seekers would discover their hiv status for the first time in germany , said beck .
uncertain fate " the people who come here are those who are strong-willed and in good health , " hufnagel said .
she added that the diagnosis of an hiv infection is usually traumatic for them .
" the fact that they face so much change could also be the reason why some things then rise to the surface once they 're here . "
learning about her illness was an additional shock for maureen , too .
lured to germany by the promise of marriage , she was abused by her future husband .
when she suffered a serious lung infection , he threw maureen out .

german laws have no clear answer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the threat of deportations can make life hell for some immigrants german authorities are undecided about whether hiv-positive immigrants with temporary residence permits are allowed to stay in the country despite the often poor availability of life-saving treatment back home . every three months , maureen faces a terrifying task : making a trip to the local foreigners ' office in frankfurt to find out whether she can stay on in the country .
the kenyan , who has a precarious residence status in germany , is in danger of deportation despite the fact that she has aids and has been undergoing treatment for several years .
every three months , the german authorities rule afresh on putting off her deportation .
the uncertainty of her situation is taking its toll .
" when i go with her to the foreigners ' office , then she -lsb- maureen -rsb- often has n't slept the night before , " said iris hufnagel , a social worker with an aids campaign group in frankfurt .
" she 's sick with worry that she will be directly sent off to a detention center for deportees . "
at the mercy of immigration laws like maureen , there are some 170,000 foreigners in germany who have been living in the country for more than 15 years and still have a temporary residence permit .
in german bureaucratic language , they are said to be " tolerated . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long line of immigrants at a foreigners ' office in germany in theory , these people are obliged to leave germany .
but they are allowed to stay on humanitarian grounds if they face persecution in their home countries .
in practice , they can be sent home anytime because their residence permit is usually extended by just three months each time .
maureen thus has to spend her life at the mercy of germany 's complicated immigration laws .
for over five years , the authorities handling maureen 's case have been examining whether there 's a " significant , concrete danger for the physical well-being and life , " as the law says , if they deport her .
effective aids treatment in kenya ?
immigration officials are in particular checking whether maureen could die if she was sent back to kenya because of lack of sufficient treatment .
the german embassy in nairobi says that aids infections can be treated effectively in kenya .
therapy is expensive but it 's possible to have it for 200 euros -lrb- $ 276 -rrb- a month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting access to aids treatment in africa is not easy but not everyone buys that argument .
" i just ca n't imagine it , " hufnagel said .
" how will she take medicines there when she 's lacking other things ? "
the social worker added that maureen also faced the risk of being mugged in kenya since the medicines were so expensive .
besides , the therapy would also mean a privilege , hufnagel said .
" imagine being in a family , knowing that the brother too is hiv positive and he does n't get the medicines … that 's an absurd situation . "
aids a reason to stop deportations ?
german courts seem to be confused about whether aids is a reason for freezing deportations .
while a few have ruled in the past that breaking off aids treatment poses a real danger to life , others have argued it does n't since the illness is long drawn out and does n't directly lead to death .
volker beck , a parliamentarian of the opposition green party , said it 's scandalous that these legal questions are discussed at the cost of those affected - a group , he says , faces a double stigma .
" firstly they are migrants , in most cases with a precarious status , and in addition , they have an ailment that leads to societal exclusion , " beck said .
he added that since the number of affected was not high , germany could afford to be much more humane towards them than is currently the case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some migrants first learn of their hiv-positive status in germany authorities in germany fear that if aids was recognized as a valid reason to stop deportations , it would give a free ticket to many african aids patients to come to germany .
beck rebuffed those concerns , pointing out that according to the eu 's current dublin agreement , asylum-seekers are sent back to the eu nation through which they entered the bloc .
besides , it 's much more likely that asylum-seekers would discover their hiv status for the first time in germany , said beck .
uncertain fate " the people who come here are those who are strong-willed and in good health , " hufnagel said .
she added that the diagnosis of an hiv infection is usually traumatic for them .
" the fact that they face so much change could also be the reason why some things then rise to the surface once they 're here . "
learning about her illness was an additional shock for maureen , too .

the african country also provided details on the deal that led to the doctor and five nurses ' release . " the detainees should have been detained upon their arrival -lsb- in sofia -rsb- , and not freed in this celebratory and illegal manner , " libyan foreign minister abdel rahman shalgham said saturday at a news conference in tripoli .
bulgaria 's actions " violated the legal procedures regarding extradition , as set down under international law and in the agreement on judicial cooperation signed between the two countries " in 1984 , added prime minister baghdadi mahmudi .
" we followed the procedure - it is bulgaria that betrayed us . "
mahmundi also said that french president nicolas sarkozy expressed similar dissatisfaction with the bulgarian decision to pardon the medics when he made a trip to libya this week .
shalgham also criticized " humanitarian and international organisations who , instead of criticising the liberation of the criminals , welcomed and greeted this step . "
main fund sponsors announced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy made a high-profile visit to libya shortly after the medics ' release at the same press conference , mahmudi said the czech republic , bulgaria , slovakia and qatar were the main donors to a fund set up to pay hundreds of families of children who contracted the hiv virus at a libyan hospital in the 1990s .
he also said that france had pledged to train some 50 libyan doctors .
bulgaria contributed to the fund through a non-governmental organisation open to private bulgarian and foreign companies , deputy foreign minister feim chaushev told reuters .
" one of the options for bulgaria 's contribution to the fund is forgiving the libyan debt , " chaushev added .
" we are to decide on that option .
we are discussing other options as well , such as technical assistance . "
the six bulgarian medics were detained in 1999 and later found guilty and sentenced to death by libyan courts of intentionally infecting 438 children with the aids causing hiv virus .
fifty six of the children have died .
the medics , five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor who has been given bulgarian citizenship , maintained their innocence .
foreign health experts have said poor sanitary conditions in libya 's hospitals were to blame for the spread of the disease among patients .
libya calls for international protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several medics said they were tortured during the eight-year imprisonment as a protest to bulgarian president georgy parvanov 's pardon , libya called on arab league members to adopt a common stand on the affair at a meeting of representatives on monday , the prime minister said .
tripoli will also seek support from the african union and the organisation of the islamic conference , mahmudi added .
libya allowed the medics to return to bulgaria on tuesday , where they had been due to serve life terms in prison .
since their release the medics have said their confessions were extracted under torture .
" all of us were treated like animals , " the doctor ashraf juma hajuj said thursday .
" we were tortured for a long time , with electricity , beatings , deprivation of sleep . "
the families of the deceased and hiv-positive children have criticised bulgaria 's decision , and their representative idriss lagha again on saturday called on libya 's government to request that interpol arrest the medics again , and for tripoli to cut all diplomatic ties with sofia .
bulgaria , however , said it wants to close this chapter of relations with libya and move on .
" the most important thing is to restore our relations with libya because in the last eight years they have stalled in the medics ' case , " bulgarian foreign minister ivailo kalfin told darik radio . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the african country also provided details on the deal that led to the doctor and five nurses ' release . " the detainees should have been detained upon their arrival -lsb- in sofia -rsb- , and not freed in this celebratory and illegal manner , " libyan foreign minister abdel rahman shalgham said saturday at a news conference in tripoli .
bulgaria 's actions " violated the legal procedures regarding extradition , as set down under international law and in the agreement on judicial cooperation signed between the two countries " in 1984 , added prime minister baghdadi mahmudi .
" we followed the procedure - it is bulgaria that betrayed us . "
mahmundi also said that french president nicolas sarkozy expressed similar dissatisfaction with the bulgarian decision to pardon the medics when he made a trip to libya this week .
shalgham also criticized " humanitarian and international organisations who , instead of criticising the liberation of the criminals , welcomed and greeted this step . "

he also said that france had pledged to train some 50 libyan doctors .
bulgaria contributed to the fund through a non-governmental organisation open to private bulgarian and foreign companies , deputy foreign minister feim chaushev told reuters .
" one of the options for bulgaria 's contribution to the fund is forgiving the libyan debt , " chaushev added .
" we are to decide on that option .
we are discussing other options as well , such as technical assistance . "
the six bulgarian medics were detained in 1999 and later found guilty and sentenced to death by libyan courts of intentionally infecting 438 children with the aids causing hiv virus .
fifty six of the children have died .

tripoli will also seek support from the african union and the organisation of the islamic conference , mahmudi added .
libya allowed the medics to return to bulgaria on tuesday , where they had been due to serve life terms in prison .
since their release the medics have said their confessions were extracted under torture .
" all of us were treated like animals , " the doctor ashraf juma hajuj said thursday .

the families of the deceased and hiv-positive children have criticised bulgaria 's decision , and their representative idriss lagha again on saturday called on libya 's government to request that interpol arrest the medics again , and for tripoli to cut all diplomatic ties with sofia .
bulgaria , however , said it wants to close this chapter of relations with libya and move on .

" the uci has displayed a lack of lucidity , of professionalism , a total unawareness , " clerc said .
" either it is incompetence or they wanted to do damage ...
the management has no other choice but to resign , " clerc told journalists before the start of the next-to-last stage of the tour , in the city of cognac . however , uci president pat mcquaid told reuters : " it 's ridiculous .
it is not up to him to ask for that .
only the uci congress can . " clerc , who heads the amaury sport organization , and tour director christian prudhomme have accused the uci of having intentionally neglected to inform them of a positive doping test of german cyclist patrik sinkewitz and of danish rider micheal rasmussen missing at least one doping test and lying about his whereabouts to avoid the tests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour could look very different next year both situations were revealed during the running of the tour , leading german public television stations ard and zdf to stop live broadcasts of the race and rasmussen being forced out of the race when he was leading it . clerc and prudhomme have charged that the uci withheld the information in order to destabilize the race . " the uci is not able to lead the reconstruction of the -lrb- anti-doping -rrb- system , " clerc said .
" we will attempt to unite all people of good will , riders , teams ...
we do n't want to exclude the sports authorities , but we want a sports authority that is ethical , neutral , independent and responsible . " end of cooperation prudhomme said that he felt " betrayed " by the uci . " the result of the -lrb- sinkewitz -rrb- positive test took a month and a week to be made public , " he said .
that 's a very surprising delay . " clerc said the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- " is certainly the most competent body to lead the fight that touches every sport . " earlier saturday , prudhomme was quoted as saying that the tour de france would no longer cooperate with the uci . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entire astana team left the tour after its lead racer tested positive " we will no longer work together with the uci , there will be special rules for the tour de france , " prudhomme told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung on saturday .
" it -lrb- the uci -rrb- is good for nothing .
the uci never wanted a clean tour . " prudhomme said that he was ready to attend an anti-doping summit proposed by wada and that " we will next year co-operate with wada and the french anti-doping agency " instead of the uci . " things will be better without the uci , they must become better , " he said . uci gives support to germany but german cycling officials appear to believe the uci is doing a satisfactory job .

the spokeswoman would not comment on the magazine report , the associated press reported saturday . according to der spiegel , the iranian government has channeled some of its foreign currency earnings to german banks .
the total held by german financial institutions topped 6.55 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.9 billion -rrb- . levey called iran the " central bank of terrorism , " in an interview with public broadcaster südwestrundfunk last week . germany 's largest bank , deutsche bank , had tacitly agreed to run down its dealings with iran after being placed on a list of institutions dealing with countries the us called state sponsors of terrorism - cuba , iran , north korea , sudan and syria . german companies not alone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuba is another country the us wants international companies to leave the us financial watchdog , the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- , has since removed the list it compiled , which contained names of businesses from the united states , australia , great britain , germany , france and japan , from the internet , saying it had received many complaints from companies , some insisting the list was out of date . hsbc holdings , unilever plc , bp plc , siemens , total , basf and the mitsubishi ufj financial group were just some of the companies highlighted in addition to deutsche bank . the sec list stated that siemens has business dealings with all five named " sponsors of terrorism " while basf is linked solely with iran .

the uci never wanted a clean tour .

" things will be better without the uci , they must become better , " he said . uci gives support to germany but german cycling officials appear to believe the uci is doing a satisfactory job .
they announced on thursday that they had received the organization 's signature on an anti-doping declaration for the road racing world championships to be held in stuttgart in late september . under the agreement , the uci , german sports authorities , local organizers and germany 's anti-doping agency will conduct a multitude of tests ahead of the championships , including pre-event random testing and requiring all cyclists to provide blood samples prior to racing . " the measures announced at the beginning of july are intended to send a strong signal , namely that cycling has taken a new stance , " said wolfgang schneider , the general secretary of the event 's steering committee . article based on news reprots -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the spokeswoman would not comment on the magazine report , the associated press reported saturday . according to der spiegel , the iranian government has channeled some of its foreign currency earnings to german banks .
the total held by german financial institutions topped 6.55 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.9 billion -rrb- . levey called iran the " central bank of terrorism , " in an interview with public broadcaster südwestrundfunk last week . germany 's largest bank , deutsche bank , had tacitly agreed to run down its dealings with iran after being placed on a list of institutions dealing with countries the us called state sponsors of terrorism - cuba , iran , north korea , sudan and syria . german companies not alone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuba is another country the us wants international companies to leave the us financial watchdog , the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- , has since removed the list it compiled , which contained names of businesses from the united states , australia , great britain , germany , france and japan , from the internet , saying it had received many complaints from companies , some insisting the list was out of date . hsbc holdings , unilever plc , bp plc , siemens , total , basf and the mitsubishi ufj financial group were just some of the companies highlighted in addition to deutsche bank . the sec list stated that siemens has business dealings with all five named " sponsors of terrorism " while basf is linked solely with iran .
deutsche bank has connections with both iran and sudan .
deutsche bank spokesman ronald weichert confirmed in an earlier handelsblatt report that the bank 's " commercial relations " with iran and sudan were common knowledge .

the african country also provided details on the deal that led to the doctor and five nurses ' release . " the detainees should have been detained upon their arrival -lsb- in sofia -rsb- , and not freed in this celebratory and illegal manner , " libyan foreign minister abdel rahman shalgham said saturday at a news conference in tripoli .
bulgaria 's actions " violated the legal procedures regarding extradition , as set down under international law and in the agreement on judicial cooperation signed between the two countries " in 1984 , added prime minister baghdadi mahmudi .
" we followed the procedure - it is bulgaria that betrayed us . "
mahmundi also said that french president nicolas sarkozy expressed similar dissatisfaction with the bulgarian decision to pardon the medics when he made a trip to libya this week .
shalgham also criticized " humanitarian and international organisations who , instead of criticising the liberation of the criminals , welcomed and greeted this step . "
main fund sponsors announced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy made a high-profile visit to libya shortly after the medics ' release at the same press conference , mahmudi said the czech republic , bulgaria , slovakia and qatar were the main donors to a fund set up to pay hundreds of families of children who contracted the hiv virus at a libyan hospital in the 1990s .
he also said that france had pledged to train some 50 libyan doctors .
bulgaria contributed to the fund through a non-governmental organisation open to private bulgarian and foreign companies , deputy foreign minister feim chaushev told reuters .
" one of the options for bulgaria 's contribution to the fund is forgiving the libyan debt , " chaushev added .
" we are to decide on that option .
we are discussing other options as well , such as technical assistance . "
the six bulgarian medics were detained in 1999 and later found guilty and sentenced to death by libyan courts of intentionally infecting 438 children with the aids causing hiv virus .
fifty six of the children have died .
the medics , five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor who has been given bulgarian citizenship , maintained their innocence .
foreign health experts have said poor sanitary conditions in libya 's hospitals were to blame for the spread of the disease among patients .
libya calls for international protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several medics said they were tortured during the eight-year imprisonment as a protest to bulgarian president georgy parvanov 's pardon , libya called on arab league members to adopt a common stand on the affair at a meeting of representatives on monday , the prime minister said .
tripoli will also seek support from the african union and the organisation of the islamic conference , mahmudi added .
libya allowed the medics to return to bulgaria on tuesday , where they had been due to serve life terms in prison .
since their release the medics have said their confessions were extracted under torture .
" all of us were treated like animals , " the doctor ashraf juma hajuj said thursday .
" we were tortured for a long time , with electricity , beatings , deprivation of sleep . "
the families of the deceased and hiv-positive children have criticised bulgaria 's decision , and their representative idriss lagha again on saturday called on libya 's government to request that interpol arrest the medics again , and for tripoli to cut all diplomatic ties with sofia .
bulgaria , however , said it wants to close this chapter of relations with libya and move on .
" the most important thing is to restore our relations with libya because in the last eight years they have stalled in the medics ' case , " bulgarian foreign minister ivailo kalfin told darik radio . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german laws have no clear answer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the threat of deportations can make life hell for some immigrants german authorities are undecided about whether hiv-positive immigrants with temporary residence permits are allowed to stay in the country despite the often poor availability of life-saving treatment back home . every three months , maureen faces a terrifying task : making a trip to the local foreigners ' office in frankfurt to find out whether she can stay on in the country .
the kenyan , who has a precarious residence status in germany , is in danger of deportation despite the fact that she has aids and has been undergoing treatment for several years .
every three months , the german authorities rule afresh on putting off her deportation .
the uncertainty of her situation is taking its toll .
" when i go with her to the foreigners ' office , then she -lsb- maureen -rsb- often has n't slept the night before , " said iris hufnagel , a social worker with an aids campaign group in frankfurt .
" she 's sick with worry that she will be directly sent off to a detention center for deportees . "
at the mercy of immigration laws like maureen , there are some 170,000 foreigners in germany who have been living in the country for more than 15 years and still have a temporary residence permit .
in german bureaucratic language , they are said to be " tolerated . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long line of immigrants at a foreigners ' office in germany in theory , these people are obliged to leave germany .
but they are allowed to stay on humanitarian grounds if they face persecution in their home countries .
in practice , they can be sent home anytime because their residence permit is usually extended by just three months each time .
maureen thus has to spend her life at the mercy of germany 's complicated immigration laws .
for over five years , the authorities handling maureen 's case have been examining whether there 's a " significant , concrete danger for the physical well-being and life , " as the law says , if they deport her .
effective aids treatment in kenya ?
immigration officials are in particular checking whether maureen could die if she was sent back to kenya because of lack of sufficient treatment .
the german embassy in nairobi says that aids infections can be treated effectively in kenya .
therapy is expensive but it 's possible to have it for 200 euros -lrb- $ 276 -rrb- a month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting access to aids treatment in africa is not easy but not everyone buys that argument .
" i just ca n't imagine it , " hufnagel said .
" how will she take medicines there when she 's lacking other things ? "
the social worker added that maureen also faced the risk of being mugged in kenya since the medicines were so expensive .
besides , the therapy would also mean a privilege , hufnagel said .
" imagine being in a family , knowing that the brother too is hiv positive and he does n't get the medicines … that 's an absurd situation . "
aids a reason to stop deportations ?
german courts seem to be confused about whether aids is a reason for freezing deportations .

german laws have no clear answer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the threat of deportations can make life hell for some immigrants german authorities are undecided about whether hiv-positive immigrants with temporary residence permits are allowed to stay in the country despite the often poor availability of life-saving treatment back home . every three months , maureen faces a terrifying task : making a trip to the local foreigners ' office in frankfurt to find out whether she can stay on in the country .
the kenyan , who has a precarious residence status in germany , is in danger of deportation despite the fact that she has aids and has been undergoing treatment for several years .
every three months , the german authorities rule afresh on putting off her deportation .
the uncertainty of her situation is taking its toll .
" when i go with her to the foreigners ' office , then she -lsb- maureen -rsb- often has n't slept the night before , " said iris hufnagel , a social worker with an aids campaign group in frankfurt .
" she 's sick with worry that she will be directly sent off to a detention center for deportees . "
at the mercy of immigration laws like maureen , there are some 170,000 foreigners in germany who have been living in the country for more than 15 years and still have a temporary residence permit .
in german bureaucratic language , they are said to be " tolerated . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long line of immigrants at a foreigners ' office in germany in theory , these people are obliged to leave germany .
but they are allowed to stay on humanitarian grounds if they face persecution in their home countries .
in practice , they can be sent home anytime because their residence permit is usually extended by just three months each time .
maureen thus has to spend her life at the mercy of germany 's complicated immigration laws .
for over five years , the authorities handling maureen 's case have been examining whether there 's a " significant , concrete danger for the physical well-being and life , " as the law says , if they deport her .
effective aids treatment in kenya ?
immigration officials are in particular checking whether maureen could die if she was sent back to kenya because of lack of sufficient treatment .
the german embassy in nairobi says that aids infections can be treated effectively in kenya .
therapy is expensive but it 's possible to have it for 200 euros -lrb- $ 276 -rrb- a month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting access to aids treatment in africa is not easy but not everyone buys that argument .
" i just ca n't imagine it , " hufnagel said .
" how will she take medicines there when she 's lacking other things ? "
the social worker added that maureen also faced the risk of being mugged in kenya since the medicines were so expensive .
besides , the therapy would also mean a privilege , hufnagel said .
" imagine being in a family , knowing that the brother too is hiv positive and he does n't get the medicines … that 's an absurd situation . "

six people were killed in a single week in a number of attacks this month , the un stabilisation mission in haiti says .
mr mulet said he hoped the sharp rise would not be become a trend , in an interview with the associated press .
he blamed corruption in the legal system , saying people were fed up and taking justice into their own hands .
lynchings have become more frequent in rural areas , where the police presence is thin and courts barely operate .
' fed up ' mr mulet , a guatemalan diplomat who is also head of the un mission , minustah , said there had been a very large number of lynchings in recent months . "
you have cases of gang leaders being released after paying judges " edmond mulet un special representative in haiti he said the rise was in part the result of a lack of confidence in haiti 's corrupt judicial system , which detains hundreds of people without trial while those who can afford to pay a bribe are released .
" you have cases of gang leaders being released after paying judges , " he told the associated press on friday .
" the population knows , so they 're fed up ... and they take justice into their hands . "
mr mulet described one incident , where two men were mistaken for kidnappers and were beaten to death by a crowd of people armed with rocks and sticks .
ten people were subsequently arrested , but only one has been imprisoned .
mr mulet said minustah would launch a campaign to remind people lynchings were a crime and urge churches to denounce the practice .
the un has a 9,000-strong peacekeeping force in place in haiti .
