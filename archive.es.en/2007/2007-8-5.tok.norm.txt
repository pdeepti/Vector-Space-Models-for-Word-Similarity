the site 's creators say educators should n't complain as they 're getting pretty good grades . the times are past when it was only schoolchildren whose stomachs churned before they got their grades .
now teachers in germany are being graded by their pupils .
many teachers are vehemently opposed to it .
they are not so much afraid of how they are evaluated , but rather upset because the results are then posted on the internet - and accessible to millions of internet users .
more than 150,000 users have so far registered on the web site spickmich.de and over the past four months alone they have posted their evaluations of a good 100,000 teachers , according to the web site 's creators , who have already had to defend their creation in court .

the teachers are graded according to such categories as " motivated " or " good instruction , " " easy examinations " - or even " sexy . "
heinz-peter meidinger , chairman of the german teachers association , said that evaluations in such a form do not really reveal much .
" whether an examination is easy or not can not be a criterion , since , after all , it 's the curriculum which has to be fulfilled , " he said .

dicks added that the pupils are largely quite satisfied with their teachers .
on a grading scale of one to six , the teachers ' average grade is 2.7 - and lately improving .
while some psychologists say that teachers should learn to accept evaluation by their students , others caution that educators are virtually unprotected against the criticism on the internet .
" there is a lack of dialogue , " said wolfgang hagemann , a psychotherapist who has written a book on the stress teachers face in germany .

sommer added that punitive legal action would be taken in the future against any harrassment of teachers on the internet .
" we can not accept it when teachers are exposed in an often humiliating fashion , " the minister said .
in a few cases , the web site has had messages posted that called for violence against teachers .
dicks confirmed that two entries on the web site had been erased .

the site 's creators say educators should n't complain as they 're getting pretty good grades . the times are past when it was only schoolchildren whose stomachs churned before they got their grades .
now teachers in germany are being graded by their pupils .
many teachers are vehemently opposed to it .
they are not so much afraid of how they are evaluated , but rather upset because the results are then posted on the internet - and accessible to millions of internet users .
more than 150,000 users have so far registered on the web site spickmich.de and over the past four months alone they have posted their evaluations of a good 100,000 teachers , according to the web site 's creators , who have already had to defend their creation in court .
judges in cologne , however , ruled in late june that grading teachers on the internet is covered under the basic right to free expression .
the verdict rejected a suit filed by a secondary-school teacher who felt that data protection rules concerning her had been violated by the web site .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students can share views about their teachers in just a few clicks many teachers say their privacy rights have been violated by the pupils ' assessments being posted on the web site without their approval .
the teachers are graded according to such categories as " motivated " or " good instruction , " " easy examinations " - or even " sexy . "
heinz-peter meidinger , chairman of the german teachers association , said that evaluations in such a form do not really reveal much .
" whether an examination is easy or not can not be a criterion , since , after all , it 's the curriculum which has to be fulfilled , " he said .
providing feedback the web site 's creators say they are " baffled " by the nationwide uproar .
they say students are only being offered the chance , via a non-commercial channel , to provide teachers with some feedback about their classroom instruction .
" teachers also must learn to live with criticism , " said bernd dicks , a 24-year-old social sciences student and one of three people behind the web site .
dicks added that the pupils are largely quite satisfied with their teachers .
on a grading scale of one to six , the teachers ' average grade is 2.7 - and lately improving .
while some psychologists say that teachers should learn to accept evaluation by their students , others caution that educators are virtually unprotected against the criticism on the internet .
" there is a lack of dialogue , " said wolfgang hagemann , a psychotherapist who has written a book on the stress teachers face in germany .
no tolerance for violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials say they wo n't tolerate teachers being harrassed meanwhile , the education minister for the state of north-rhine westphalia , barbara sommer , categorically ruled out the danger that the internet grades are used in deciding whether to hire a teacher .
sommer added that punitive legal action would be taken in the future against any harrassment of teachers on the internet .
" we can not accept it when teachers are exposed in an often humiliating fashion , " the minister said .
in a few cases , the web site has had messages posted that called for violence against teachers .
dicks confirmed that two entries on the web site had been erased .
but still , the site is not totally immune from attempts at manipulation , one teacher near the northern city of hanover recently showed .

the site 's creators say educators should n't complain as they 're getting pretty good grades . the times are past when it was only schoolchildren whose stomachs churned before they got their grades .
now teachers in germany are being graded by their pupils .
many teachers are vehemently opposed to it .
they are not so much afraid of how they are evaluated , but rather upset because the results are then posted on the internet - and accessible to millions of internet users .
more than 150,000 users have so far registered on the web site spickmich.de and over the past four months alone they have posted their evaluations of a good 100,000 teachers , according to the web site 's creators , who have already had to defend their creation in court .

the teachers are graded according to such categories as " motivated " or " good instruction , " " easy examinations " - or even " sexy . "
heinz-peter meidinger , chairman of the german teachers association , said that evaluations in such a form do not really reveal much .

" teachers also must learn to live with criticism , " said bernd dicks , a 24-year-old social sciences student and one of three people behind the web site .
dicks added that the pupils are largely quite satisfied with their teachers .
on a grading scale of one to six , the teachers ' average grade is 2.7 - and lately improving .
while some psychologists say that teachers should learn to accept evaluation by their students , others caution that educators are virtually unprotected against the criticism on the internet .

sommer added that punitive legal action would be taken in the future against any harrassment of teachers on the internet .
" we can not accept it when teachers are exposed in an often humiliating fashion , " the minister said .
in a few cases , the web site has had messages posted that called for violence against teachers .
dicks confirmed that two entries on the web site had been erased .

the site 's creators say educators should n't complain as they 're getting pretty good grades . the times are past when it was only schoolchildren whose stomachs churned before they got their grades .
now teachers in germany are being graded by their pupils .
many teachers are vehemently opposed to it .
they are not so much afraid of how they are evaluated , but rather upset because the results are then posted on the internet - and accessible to millions of internet users .
more than 150,000 users have so far registered on the web site spickmich.de and over the past four months alone they have posted their evaluations of a good 100,000 teachers , according to the web site 's creators , who have already had to defend their creation in court .
judges in cologne , however , ruled in late june that grading teachers on the internet is covered under the basic right to free expression .
the verdict rejected a suit filed by a secondary-school teacher who felt that data protection rules concerning her had been violated by the web site .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students can share views about their teachers in just a few clicks many teachers say their privacy rights have been violated by the pupils ' assessments being posted on the web site without their approval .
the teachers are graded according to such categories as " motivated " or " good instruction , " " easy examinations " - or even " sexy . "
heinz-peter meidinger , chairman of the german teachers association , said that evaluations in such a form do not really reveal much .
" whether an examination is easy or not can not be a criterion , since , after all , it 's the curriculum which has to be fulfilled , " he said .
providing feedback the web site 's creators say they are " baffled " by the nationwide uproar .
they say students are only being offered the chance , via a non-commercial channel , to provide teachers with some feedback about their classroom instruction .
" teachers also must learn to live with criticism , " said bernd dicks , a 24-year-old social sciences student and one of three people behind the web site .
dicks added that the pupils are largely quite satisfied with their teachers .
on a grading scale of one to six , the teachers ' average grade is 2.7 - and lately improving .
while some psychologists say that teachers should learn to accept evaluation by their students , others caution that educators are virtually unprotected against the criticism on the internet .
" there is a lack of dialogue , " said wolfgang hagemann , a psychotherapist who has written a book on the stress teachers face in germany .
no tolerance for violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials say they wo n't tolerate teachers being harrassed meanwhile , the education minister for the state of north-rhine westphalia , barbara sommer , categorically ruled out the danger that the internet grades are used in deciding whether to hire a teacher .
sommer added that punitive legal action would be taken in the future against any harrassment of teachers on the internet .
" we can not accept it when teachers are exposed in an often humiliating fashion , " the minister said .
in a few cases , the web site has had messages posted that called for violence against teachers .
dicks confirmed that two entries on the web site had been erased .
but still , the site is not totally immune from attempts at manipulation , one teacher near the northern city of hanover recently showed .

all animal movements throughout the uk have been banned following the disease 's discovery on a surrey farm .
in response some agricultural events in wales have been cancelled while others have stopped livestock competitions .
mr jones insisted there were " no plans for a blanket closure of footpaths " and rural wales was there to be enjoyed .
wales was badly affected in the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak when more than 350,000 animals were slaughtered .
a large swathe of the countryside was also closed to visitors , cancelling major events like the royal welsh show .
but ieuan wyn jones said the assembly government now has a " well-rehearsed contingency plan " to deal with any foot-and-mouth outbreak , which was part of the overall uk strategy , and that has been implemented .
advice for farmers defra helpline : 0845 9335577 animal health offices - caernarfon : 01286 674144 carmarthen : 01267 245400 ; 07000 780144 -lrb- eve -rrb- cardiff : 029 20 768500 welsh assembly website a national ban on livestock movement in wales , has been in place since 2130 bst on friday , when the surrey case was confirmed .
north wales police have confirmed that a load of sheep were delivered to anglesey on saturday under licence having left oxfordshire .
they were checked on a55 at llanfairfechan and were found to be all legal .
sixty cattle have been culled in surrey after testing positive for foot-and-mouth and a 3km protection zone put in place to try to stop the spread of the disease .
the strain has been identified by defra as being identical to that used at the institute for animal health , at pirbright , about three miles from the farm .
mr jones said this development had made him more optimistic that the disease would not spread to wales .
but he added : " clearly we now know that this is the strain used in pirbright , but we still need to be clear about the source of the outbreak , and once that is in place then obviously we can take some clear steps . "
the assembly 's rural affairs minister elin jones has cut short her holiday in new zealand and is returning to wales on sunday .
but mr jones said a number of lessons have been learnt since 2001 .
" for example , we now have a routine six-day standstill following the movement of susceptible animals onto a farm .
this has provided an extra level of protection we did n't have in 2001 .
" we have advice for farmers on our website on the disease and on biosecurity . "
" i would urge farmers to continue to be vigilant and to report any suspicious signs in their animals to their local animal health offices , " the deputy first minister said .
farmers have been asked to remain vigilant farmer 's leaders in wales have praised the authorities ' swift response to the latest case of foot-and-mouth .
dai davies , president of the national farmer 's union cymru , welcomed the identification of the strain involved in the surrey case , but added : " after bs £ and the foot-and-mouth of 2001 , it 's the last thing we need at this moment in time when we are finding a foothold back in our historical export countries . "
gareth vaughan , president of the farmers ' union of wales , said : " a significant number of lessons were learnt following the 2001 outbreak , and we must now hope that the significant contingency planning that has occurred over recent years will prove its worth . "
' no threat ' on saturday the gower show , which was expecting 10,000 visitors , was cancelled , along with cattle and sheep competitions at the brecon show .
a cattlemarket at whitland in carmarthenshire was also called off as was the llangeinor hunt game fair , which was due to take place at pencoed near bridgend on sunday .
however , organisers of the anglesey show which is due to be held on 14 and 15 august have said it will go ahead - even if animals are not allowed .
the pembrokeshire show which is due to be staged on 14-16 august is also unaffected .
the national eisteddfod , the annual festival celebrating the welsh language , is still taking place on agricultural land at mold in flintshire this week eisteddfod chief executive elfed roberts said : " we 've already held talks with the government and we will wait for their advice .
but there is no threat to the festival . "

some posters used in rural areas will be banned , such as one which read " one more baby means one more tomb . "
a list of 190 acceptable slogans is being issued instead .
chinese authorities believe the strong language of some slogans is harming the image of the one-child policy , in place since 1979 to limit population growth .
the official xinhua news agency explained the decision of the national population and family planning commission as " an effort to win more understanding to the country 's population control policy . "
largest population it gave examples of " low quality " slogans posted on rural banners or the internet : " raise fewer babies but more piggies " , " houses toppled , cows confiscated , if abortion demand rejected " and " one more baby means one more tomb . "
among the new slogans recommended are " the mother earth is too tired to sustain more children " and " both boys and girls are parents ' hearts . "
china 's 28-year-old family planning policy limits most urban couples to just one child and allows some families in the countryside to have a second child if their first is a girl .
critics say it has led to forced abortions , sterilizations and a dangerously imbalanced sex ratio due to a traditional preference for male heirs , which has prompted some families to abort female foetuses in the hope of getting boys .
china has the largest population in the world - 1.3bn in 2005 - and says its policies have helped limit its growth rate .

he said : " farming and tourism go hand in hand , it 's a time to promote a healthy countryside - which we are " .
farmers have been introducing further measures to keep their farms free of foot-and-mouth .
there have been no reported cases in the south west but officials said " tight bio-security " is essential .
mr bell added : " approximately 60 % of farmers in the region derive part of their income from tourism , the two industries are inter-twined " .
precautions ian johnson , from the south west national farmers ' union -lrb- nfu -rrb- , said : " the news from surrey sends a shiver down the spine of all farmers .
" since the last outbreak so many restrictions have been put in place that farmers must adhere to - so hopefully this incident can be contained .
" farmers must just keep practising extreme bio-security " .
defra has imposed a ban on moving farm animals after cattle at a farm in surrey were found to have the disease .
some 60 animals on the farm close to the village of wanborough near guildford have tested positive .
back in the 2001 outbreak , just over 2,000 cases of foot-and-mouth animals were confirmed during the epidemic , yet another four million animals were slaughtered .

dr adam mosley will study cosmography , a subject believed to combine geography , history and astronomy .
he will also try to find out how it died out in around the 17th century .
the lecturer wants to discover more about its study and how strong its links were with the seafarers ' art of navigating by the stars .
the subject became popular around 500 years ago but died out and part of dr mosley 's work will be to find out why .
he is undertaking a two month fellowship at cambridge university to find out more historians believe that cosmography as a discipline originated as the result of a mistake in translating texts recovered from the ancient world .
it is first used in a translation of a text by the mathematician , geographer and astronomer claudius ptolemy , in a description of the world as it was known to the ancient greeks and romans .
" we are not sure why cosmography died or even to what extent it ever really existed as a subject , " said dr mosley , who specialises in the history of early modern science . "

"
dr mosley will be trying to find out the extent to which it was pursued within the universities of europe .
he wants to establish whether it was part of a practical activity taught to and studied by sailors looking to navigate by the stars .
" you can argue that the global positioning systems -lrb- gps -rrb- in use today are a modern form of cosmography as they combine geography and astronomy to give users precise locations , " said the doctor .
cosmography is a term also associated with the flemish cartographer , mercator , who published his own atlas that included corrected versions of the maps first produced by ptolemy .
he also gave his name to the standard way in which world maps were represented -lrb- the mercator projection -rrb- .
john dee , queen elizabeth i 's astrologer , who claimed welsh descent , also wrote texts on mathematics that offered definition of the subject of cosmography .
dr mosley said : " it may be misleading to describe john dee as a cosmographer , but he is a part of the subject 's history and i hope that my research in cambridge will answer a few questions about the role he played in the development of the discipline . "

a swansea university historian hopes to discover more about an ancient discipline which may have provided " the gps system " of its day , 500 years ago .
dr adam mosley will study cosmography , a subject believed to combine geography , history and astronomy .
he will also try to find out how it died out in around the 17th century .
the lecturer wants to discover more about its study and how strong its links were with the seafarers ' art of navigating by the stars .
the subject became popular around 500 years ago but died out and part of dr mosley 's work will be to find out why .
he is undertaking a two month fellowship at cambridge university to find out more historians believe that cosmography as a discipline originated as the result of a mistake in translating texts recovered from the ancient world .
it is first used in a translation of a text by the mathematician , geographer and astronomer claudius ptolemy , in a description of the world as it was known to the ancient greeks and romans .
" we are not sure why cosmography died or even to what extent it ever really existed as a subject , " said dr mosley , who specialises in the history of early modern science .

"
dr mosley will be trying to find out the extent to which it was pursued within the universities of europe .
he wants to establish whether it was part of a practical activity taught to and studied by sailors looking to navigate by the stars .
