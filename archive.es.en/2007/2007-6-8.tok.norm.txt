program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 08.06.2007 thirsty yanks prowl cologne for special suds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kölsch 's fame has spread as far as manhattan prompted by an article in the new york times , american tourists to germany are getting interested in kölsch beer .
dw-world.de talked to one of the world 's leading beer experts about the appeal of the cologne speciality . think of americans in germany and beer , and you 'd probably think of package holiday makers braving the sloshed masses at munich 's oktoberfest . but a local cologne newspaper , the kölner stadt-anzeiger , is reporting increasing numbers of us tourists haunting the city 's bars with copies of the new york times in their hands - this after the times travel section ran a piece raving about the local beer , kölsch . what makes kölsch different from the familiar lager beer drunk in most other places in germany ?
the question is one that puzzles even michael jackson , the award-winning author of " the world guide to beer " and the host of the bbc tv show " the beer hunter . " " other than saying it 's a top-fermented version of a pilsner , it 's difficult to explain , " jackson told dw-world .
" kölsch is teasingly delicate but also elusive . " like a classic german beer daydreaming that it 's a glass of champagne ? " yeah , " jackson said .
" i think that 's a pretty good way of putting it . " a local treat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kölsch is served in special tall glasses to preserve freshness the microbrewery movement that 's radically changed american and british drinking habits in the past two decades has n't caught on in germany , where most people prefer to stick with standard , albeit high-quality , lagers and wheat beers . if tourists want to try beer styles not widely available outside germany , they need to look in specific local regions .
that 's down to history .
the development of kölsch , for instance , was an innovative reaction to the growing industrialization of beer brewing in the mid-nineteenth century . " it 's like the brewers in cologne said : ' we want to stay as we are , so we 'd better define and protect a cologne style of beer , " ' jackson said . kölsch , then , was the result of something like a microbrewery movement during the industrial revolution .
and päffgen , früh and other cologne breweries have stayed true to that original idea . a registered name bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to cologne often ca n't resist the idea of just one more beer part of kölsch 's appeal may be that american microbrewers have never succeeded in copying it . " american brewers are fantastic , but they 've never gotten kölsch quite right , " jackson said , and even if they had , they would n't be allowed to use the name .
by international agreement , the word " kölsch " - like the terms " cognac " or " champagne " - is reserved for products made in and around cologne . that 's one more reason to travel to germany 's fourth-largest city and one of its few centers of alternative beer brewing . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on the final day of the summit , the group of eight wealthiest nations are expected to announce a $ 60 billion -lrb- 44.5 billion euro -rrb- pledge to fight aids , malaria and tuberculosis in africa . summit host german chancellor angela merkel formally announced the agreement friday morning . " we are aware of our responsibilities and we will rise to them , " she said .
" on the other hand , we want to stress that we also have expectations about what should happen in africa . " in the run-up to the summit , merkel had already emphasized the hope that african countries would be stepping up their own efforts to modernize .
this would entail clamping down on corruption , consolidating democracy and strengthening civil society . about half of the sum has already been pledged by the us .
the rest will be paid by the other g8 countries , with some 4 billion euros coming from germany . us president george w. bush - who remained in his hotel suite friday morning on account of a stomach upset - announced the main thrust of the initiative in may . among the heads of the six african nations representing the needs of the poorest continent was south african president thabo mbeki .
the other countries represented were egypt , ghana , algeria , nigeria and ethiopia . wrangling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders did not follow through on pledges made at gleneagles in 2005 the g8 countries wrangled late into thursday night about the finer points of the aid program for africa , with certain countries including italy apparently dragging their feet . broadly , the eight nations have now reiterated pledges made at the 2005 summit in gleneagles , scotland , when they said they would double development funding by 2010 . some campaigners for africa , meanwhile , insist $ 60 billion still falls short of un targets . two leading campaigners , rock stars bono and bob geldof , were in town to put pressure on merkel and her fellow leaders . " the chancellor has asked us to trust her and we are tempted , but we can not risk being let down by the g8 again , " bono was quoted by reuters as saying . on friday , merkel said that progress on the aid program would be monitored at the next g8 meeting in japan set to take place in a year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this would entail clamping down on corruption , consolidating democracy and strengthening civil society . about half of the sum has already been pledged by the us .

but the world 's richest nations - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states and russia - have so far spectacularly failed to find a common line on the issue .
the lack of consensus was apparent again in a declaration released on the second day of the three-day summit of g8 leaders in this baltic coast resort , where germany 's goals were effectively swept under the carpet .
" we discussed recent developments in global financial markets , including hedge funds , " the text said .
highly speculative hedge funds are highly speculative and aggressive investment instruments that are estimated to manage close to one and a half trillion dollars in assets worldwide .
an estimated 9,000 such funds are currently in operation , most of them based in the us and britain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister steinbrück has discussed hedge funds before berlin fears a possible domino effect should one of the big funds fail .
but it has been gradually forced to scale back its ambitions for increased transparency and more disclosure in the sector in the face of fierce resistance , particularly from britain , the united states and japan .
in their declaration on thursday , the g8 members said that hedge funds had " contributed significantly to the efficiency of the financial system . "
complex risks nevertheless , " the assessment of potential systemic and operational risks associated with these activities has become more complex and challenging , " the statement continued .
" given the strong growth of the hedge fund industry and the increasing complexity of the instruments they trade , we reaffirm the need to be vigilant . "
the g8 said it " welcomed " a specially commissioned report compiled for the g8 by the so-called financial stability forum which recommended the industry " review and enhance existing sound practice benchmarks . "
and the grouping said it also welcomed " that the fsf will report to finance ministers as from october of this year on the progress and actions taken in respect of these recommendations .

but it is the climate that is getting the most heat .
-lrb- 06.06.2007 -rrb- experts : globalization improves , does n't worsen peoples ' lives proponents of globalization say that free trade and open markets mean more prosperity for the world 's population .
at issue is how to make globalization work better for poor countries than is the case right now .
-lrb- 04.06.2007 -rrb- g8 still poles apart on hedge fund regulation the g8 showed no sign friday of moving any closer to a consensus on the hotly debated issue of regulation of hedge funds , a matter which lies particularly close to the heart of the g8 's current host , germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 08.06.2007 european press review : " not the breakthrough of the century " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some headway was made on the climate protection as the group of eight summit in heiligendamm continued , european papers reflected on the " compromise " on climate change the first day of talks brought . italy 's la stampa called the compromise a " disappointing agreement , " but was moderate in its assessment .
" there are two central elements in the climate accord that will be officially presented this friday : one , the necessity to ' decisively ' reduce greenhouse gases .
the other one - which marks the real political success of the summit - is that once the kyoto protocol -lrb- which the us has never ratified -rrb- expires in 2012 , the framework for combating climate change will be under the auspices of the united nations .
it was difficult to achieve anything more at the summit with such deep divisions among leaders over the issue - the europeans , with the support of japan and canada , on the one hand , and the americans and russians on the other . "
france 's libération took a much tougher approach .
" just like at the un , at the g8 the devil is in the details .
president george w. bush , as head of the largest polluting country in the world , did not want binding commitments for reducing co2 emissions .
he did not give in .
the climate accord does outline that which was so precious to the europeans : a 50 percent reduction by 2050 , but it merely says that should ' be considered . '
the accord lacks any firm commitment whatsoever .
it is a compromise that lets everyone at the summit save face . -lrb- … -rrb- no one admitted it , but some people surely thought quite clearly : this compromise is a bet on the near future , one in which people are placing a lot of hope - a new era for the climate simply called " the period after bush . "
switzerland 's tages-anzeiger agreed .
" what the powerful -lrb- … -rrb- are selling as a success is primarily a way for them to save face : thanks to non-binding agreements , host chancellor angela merkel does not have to stand there empty-handed .
bush 's willingness after all to work together on a treaty to succeed the kyoto protocol , under the auspices of the un , keeps him from looking like the bad guy .
it is a weak signal , however , for the uno environment conference at the end of the year in bali . -lrb- … -rrb- merkel overestimated her global-political influence in the climate protection arena . "
austria 's die presse said that g8 success on the climate was limited .
" it -lrb- the accord -rrb- could not exactly be called the breakthrough of the century .
greenpeace activists - the self-proclaimed guardians of the environment - reacted promptly when they called the outcome of the climate talks " far too little . "
at the baltic sea resort heiligendamm , the absolute claims of starry-eyed idealists once again clashed with the sober pragmatism of world leaders representing their own national interestss .
coming to an agreement is normally next to impossible in situations like that .
that was also evident after chancellor merkel 's talk with bono and bob geldof .
bono apparently became depressed because merkel did not agree to enough aid for africa .
as if g8 leaders should beckon to the calls of rock stars .
smart rock stars always say politics is not their business .
but smart politicians should also avoid selling vague declarations of intent as major steps . "
germany 's financial times deutschland put it succintly : " in terms of chancellor merkel 's own high expectations about climate talks at the summit , she has failed .
but in terms of what was realistic , she has succeeded at the meeting of world leaders in heiligendamm . " dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 08.06.2007 european press review : " not the breakthrough of the century " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some headway was made on the climate protection as the group of eight summit in heiligendamm continued , european papers reflected on the " compromise " on climate change the first day of talks brought . italy 's la stampa called the compromise a " disappointing agreement , " but was moderate in its assessment .
" there are two central elements in the climate accord that will be officially presented this friday : one , the necessity to ' decisively ' reduce greenhouse gases .
the other one - which marks the real political success of the summit - is that once the kyoto protocol -lrb- which the us has never ratified -rrb- expires in 2012 , the framework for combating climate change will be under the auspices of the united nations .
it was difficult to achieve anything more at the summit with such deep divisions among leaders over the issue - the europeans , with the support of japan and canada , on the one hand , and the americans and russians on the other . "
france 's libération took a much tougher approach .
" just like at the un , at the g8 the devil is in the details .
president george w. bush , as head of the largest polluting country in the world , did not want binding commitments for reducing co2 emissions .
he did not give in .
the climate accord does outline that which was so precious to the europeans : a 50 percent reduction by 2050 , but it merely says that should ' be considered . '
the accord lacks any firm commitment whatsoever .
it is a compromise that lets everyone at the summit save face . -lrb- … -rrb- no one admitted it , but some people surely thought quite clearly : this compromise is a bet on the near future , one in which people are placing a lot of hope - a new era for the climate simply called " the period after bush . "
switzerland 's tages-anzeiger agreed .
" what the powerful -lrb- … -rrb- are selling as a success is primarily a way for them to save face : thanks to non-binding agreements , host chancellor angela merkel does not have to stand there empty-handed .
bush 's willingness after all to work together on a treaty to succeed the kyoto protocol , under the auspices of the un , keeps him from looking like the bad guy .
it is a weak signal , however , for the uno environment conference at the end of the year in bali . -lrb- … -rrb- merkel overestimated her global-political influence in the climate protection arena . "
austria 's die presse said that g8 success on the climate was limited .
" it -lrb- the accord -rrb- could not exactly be called the breakthrough of the century .

it was difficult to achieve anything more at the summit with such deep divisions among leaders over the issue - the europeans , with the support of japan and canada , on the one hand , and the americans and russians on the other . "
france 's libération took a much tougher approach .
" just like at the un , at the g8 the devil is in the details .
president george w. bush , as head of the largest polluting country in the world , did not want binding commitments for reducing co2 emissions .
he did not give in .
the climate accord does outline that which was so precious to the europeans : a 50 percent reduction by 2050 , but it merely says that should ' be considered . '
the accord lacks any firm commitment whatsoever .
it is a compromise that lets everyone at the summit save face . -lrb- … -rrb- no one admitted it , but some people surely thought quite clearly : this compromise is a bet on the near future , one in which people are placing a lot of hope - a new era for the climate simply called " the period after bush . "
switzerland 's tages-anzeiger agreed .
" what the powerful -lrb- … -rrb- are selling as a success is primarily a way for them to save face : thanks to non-binding agreements , host chancellor angela merkel does not have to stand there empty-handed .
bush 's willingness after all to work together on a treaty to succeed the kyoto protocol , under the auspices of the un , keeps him from looking like the bad guy .
it is a weak signal , however , for the uno environment conference at the end of the year in bali . -lrb- … -rrb- merkel overestimated her global-political influence in the climate protection arena . "
austria 's die presse said that g8 success on the climate was limited .
" it -lrb- the accord -rrb- could not exactly be called the breakthrough of the century .
greenpeace activists - the self-proclaimed guardians of the environment - reacted promptly when they called the outcome of the climate talks " far too little . "
at the baltic sea resort heiligendamm , the absolute claims of starry-eyed idealists once again clashed with the sober pragmatism of world leaders representing their own national interestss .
coming to an agreement is normally next to impossible in situations like that .
that was also evident after chancellor merkel 's talk with bono and bob geldof .
bono apparently became depressed because merkel did not agree to enough aid for africa .
as if g8 leaders should beckon to the calls of rock stars .
smart rock stars always say politics is not their business .
but smart politicians should also avoid selling vague declarations of intent as major steps . "
germany 's financial times deutschland put it succintly : " in terms of chancellor merkel 's own high expectations about climate talks at the summit , she has failed .
but in terms of what was realistic , she has succeeded at the meeting of world leaders in heiligendamm . " dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but activists from a diverse range of groups have criticized the results . at the official conclusion of the three-day meeting on friday , merkel said : " we have made far-reaching decisions on core issues . "
climate protection , globalization and africa were at the center of the summit at the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
the leaders of the world 's wealthiest states agreed to " seriously consider " the goal of having global emissions by 2050 .
but merkel was not successful in getting states to make firm numerical commitments .
the g8 also pledged $ 60 billion -lrb- 44.5 billion euros -rrb- to fight aids , malaria and tuberculosis .
but the declaration did not set out a specific timetable .
gleneagles revisited ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two years ago , g8 leaders made similar pledges on africa .
will they keep them this time ?
in addition to the cash promises to tackle disease , the eight nations broadly reiterated pledges on africa made at the 2005 summit in gleneagles , scotland , when they said they would double development funding by 2010 .
but activist groups have criticized both of the main measures agreed at the summit , which was attended by the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
development campaigners complained the g8 leaders had offered little fresh cash for the poor .
pop stars bob geldof and bono , who have committed themselves to publicizing africa 's plight and who had met with merkel ahead of the summit , were extremely dismissive .
pop ambassadors unhappy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bono and geldof 's performance seems to have found more listeners in nearby rostock geldof described the situation as a " farce " and , referring to the g8 leaders as " creeps , " he urged them to " get serious . "
bono said the g8 communiqué on africa was designed to deliberately cloud the issue .
aid agency oxfam also attacked the pledges .
" we must not be distracted by big numbers , " said an oxfam policy adviser .
" what the $ 60 billion headline means at best is just $ 3 billion extra in aid by 2010 . "
environmental groups were also critical of the summit 's achievements .
greenpeace would have preferred eu leaders to have moved ahead on climate change without the backing of the united states .
but the leaders launched the so-called heiligendamm process , a two-year project where the oecd will serve as a mediator for more permanent consultation between the g8 powers and the emerging market economies china , india , brazil , mexico and south africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 08.06.2007 helping africa to help itself großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with african leaders on friday african nations may have their problems , but many would be capable of helping themselves if the international community were more patient and gave initiatives more time to flourish , says aid expert alan duncan . dw-world.de : many concerned citizens in the west view the problems in africa as problems that can only be solved through colonial-style investment initiatives , while others consider the continent to be beyond saving .
is either of these views close to the reality on the ground in africa ? africa is changing and changing for the better in more ways than is apparent to the outside observer at times .
it ’ s easy to look at the problematic elections in nigeria , the violent land clearance and slum destruction in zimbabwe or the continuing civilian deaths in the democratic republic of congo and see only regression and destruction on the continent .
media pictures , both outside africa as well as within , place very little emphasis on the positive developments that have taken place .
there are clearly a number of major issues within the continent that continue to hinder individual countries ' economic and political growth , such as the continued single party despotic rule in a number of governments .
however , these situations are becoming the exception rather than the rule in africa .
a growing number of countries have transformed from the picture of the octogenarian clinging onto power , changing constitutions or disregarding them completely to secure continued power to one of peaceful handover of civil rule through , although sometimes flawed , democratic processes . what has changed to create this embryonic empowerment ? economic growth in sectors outside of the traditional agricultural environment continues to expand in large swathes of east and southern africa , most of which is fuelled by inward investment that was in the past either tied up in highly lucrative government bonds or denied access and opportunities to invest through uncertain political and investment conditions which are being addressed by the new bread of governments that are taking over .
there is clearly still significant change that is required both politically and economically within the continent to allow for the full participation of the population within the countries .
however , the change that has happened should be recognized and rewarded .
it should also be recognized that this change is also largely home grown and driven by an increasingly politically sophisticated electorate demanding change within their own governments . some of the changes that have occurred in the recent years in african economic and political growth have been directly influenced by donor pressure and support to the programs of change and development within the region .
however , change in the magnitude of reform that is required and is developing , requires long term support and commitment both within the country implementing the changes as well as more importantly within the donor community that is supporting the reforms .
however , transformation of governments is not an easy or a short-term process that can be completed within a few years .
the types of reform underway in africa will take years and maybe generations to make significant progress and this has to be understood and supported by organizations such as the g8 as well as individual donor governments . is the inability of organizations like the g8 to recognize the need for patience a reason why so many initiatives promoted by the rich nations apparently fail in africa ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alan duncan thinks there needs to be more patience with africa all too often , good initiatives are launched and basically abandoned in their infancy as they did not produce the results that had been envisaged within a short time frame and therefore some other “ better or improved ” mechanism for transformation is developed .
if we followed these rules for the international mechanisms that govern the g8 countries then the eu , nato , wto , un would have been abandoned years ago rather than given the continued support and funding that they are , in the knowledge that progress is being made , albeit slowly . how are africans helping themselves ? another positive force for change and development within africa is the increasing economic power and influence of the diaspora within europe and north america that had come over to carry out mainly low paid manual jobs but over time have progressed to increasingly higher skilled and better paid employment .
unlike most other employees within europe that spend most , or in the case of the uk , more than their income every month , the african immigrants remit the majority of their salary to their home country to support their families and communities there . this flow of funds has been growing over the past decade to such an extent that the central bank of ghana estimated that the remittances for 2006 coming from the diaspora was in the region of $ 1 billion .
although most of this money could not be classed as development expenditure in the same sense that money spent on behalf of european donor governments could , it still contributes significantly to the economic development of the recipient country .
when put in perspective , the total contributions for budget support from ten donor countries to ghana in 2006 was estimated at $ 300 million , a sum dwarfed by the remittances from the countries own population . so what is the future of international aid in africa ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helping africa help itself for european donors and institutions to remain relevant and connected to the development and change within africa there needs to be change in the terms of engagement between the various actors .
as i said before , the support given to governments in africa from donors has to change from the short-termism of the present to longer term commitment and continuity of engagement to provide the confidence and respect of the recipient government for the work being undertaken . although difficult for european farmers to accept , the opening of markets for african grown agricultural produce is one of the fastest and most equitable ways of improving the living conditions of people in africa .
the deregulation of agricultural markets in europe need not be a zero sum game , where the gain in africa is a loss in europe .
the improving living conditions and available income in africa gained from this would result in increased demand for consumer goods from europe as well .
sure it will not be european farmers that are producing and selling the consumer goods to africa but this type of structural reform in markets has always been the natural progression of changing markets .
what is stopping this structural change at the moment is the protectionism of the eu and north america which is restricting the natural progression of economic activity within the world and drastically distorting markets to the detriment of all . alan duncan is a project coordinator for economic consultants kpmg east africa in southern sudan .
he has coordinated several international aid projects in the refugee camps spread throughout the war-torn region , sometimes under fire from both government and rebel forces .
he currently works as a consultant for the kenyan government ’ s finance ministry . alan duncan was interviewed by nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is either of these views close to the reality on the ground in africa ? africa is changing and changing for the better in more ways than is apparent to the outside observer at times .
it ’ s easy to look at the problematic elections in nigeria , the violent land clearance and slum destruction in zimbabwe or the continuing civilian deaths in the democratic republic of congo and see only regression and destruction on the continent .
media pictures , both outside africa as well as within , place very little emphasis on the positive developments that have taken place .
there are clearly a number of major issues within the continent that continue to hinder individual countries ' economic and political growth , such as the continued single party despotic rule in a number of governments .
however , these situations are becoming the exception rather than the rule in africa .
a growing number of countries have transformed from the picture of the octogenarian clinging onto power , changing constitutions or disregarding them completely to secure continued power to one of peaceful handover of civil rule through , although sometimes flawed , democratic processes . what has changed to create this embryonic empowerment ? economic growth in sectors outside of the traditional agricultural environment continues to expand in large swathes of east and southern africa , most of which is fuelled by inward investment that was in the past either tied up in highly lucrative government bonds or denied access and opportunities to invest through uncertain political and investment conditions which are being addressed by the new bread of governments that are taking over .
there is clearly still significant change that is required both politically and economically within the continent to allow for the full participation of the population within the countries .
however , the change that has happened should be recognized and rewarded .
it should also be recognized that this change is also largely home grown and driven by an increasingly politically sophisticated electorate demanding change within their own governments . some of the changes that have occurred in the recent years in african economic and political growth have been directly influenced by donor pressure and support to the programs of change and development within the region .
however , change in the magnitude of reform that is required and is developing , requires long term support and commitment both within the country implementing the changes as well as more importantly within the donor community that is supporting the reforms .
however , transformation of governments is not an easy or a short-term process that can be completed within a few years .
the types of reform underway in africa will take years and maybe generations to make significant progress and this has to be understood and supported by organizations such as the g8 as well as individual donor governments . is the inability of organizations like the g8 to recognize the need for patience a reason why so many initiatives promoted by the rich nations apparently fail in africa ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alan duncan thinks there needs to be more patience with africa all too often , good initiatives are launched and basically abandoned in their infancy as they did not produce the results that had been envisaged within a short time frame and therefore some other “ better or improved ” mechanism for transformation is developed .
if we followed these rules for the international mechanisms that govern the g8 countries then the eu , nato , wto , un would have been abandoned years ago rather than given the continued support and funding that they are , in the knowledge that progress is being made , albeit slowly . how are africans helping themselves ? another positive force for change and development within africa is the increasing economic power and influence of the diaspora within europe and north america that had come over to carry out mainly low paid manual jobs but over time have progressed to increasingly higher skilled and better paid employment .
unlike most other employees within europe that spend most , or in the case of the uk , more than their income every month , the african immigrants remit the majority of their salary to their home country to support their families and communities there . this flow of funds has been growing over the past decade to such an extent that the central bank of ghana estimated that the remittances for 2006 coming from the diaspora was in the region of $ 1 billion .
although most of this money could not be classed as development expenditure in the same sense that money spent on behalf of european donor governments could , it still contributes significantly to the economic development of the recipient country .
when put in perspective , the total contributions for budget support from ten donor countries to ghana in 2006 was estimated at $ 300 million , a sum dwarfed by the remittances from the countries own population . so what is the future of international aid in africa ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helping africa help itself for european donors and institutions to remain relevant and connected to the development and change within africa there needs to be change in the terms of engagement between the various actors .
as i said before , the support given to governments in africa from donors has to change from the short-termism of the present to longer term commitment and continuity of engagement to provide the confidence and respect of the recipient government for the work being undertaken . although difficult for european farmers to accept , the opening of markets for african grown agricultural produce is one of the fastest and most equitable ways of improving the living conditions of people in africa .
the deregulation of agricultural markets in europe need not be a zero sum game , where the gain in africa is a loss in europe .
the improving living conditions and available income in africa gained from this would result in increased demand for consumer goods from europe as well .
sure it will not be european farmers that are producing and selling the consumer goods to africa but this type of structural reform in markets has always been the natural progression of changing markets .
what is stopping this structural change at the moment is the protectionism of the eu and north america which is restricting the natural progression of economic activity within the world and drastically distorting markets to the detriment of all . alan duncan is a project coordinator for economic consultants kpmg east africa in southern sudan .

is either of these views close to the reality on the ground in africa ? africa is changing and changing for the better in more ways than is apparent to the outside observer at times .
it ’ s easy to look at the problematic elections in nigeria , the violent land clearance and slum destruction in zimbabwe or the continuing civilian deaths in the democratic republic of congo and see only regression and destruction on the continent .
media pictures , both outside africa as well as within , place very little emphasis on the positive developments that have taken place .
there are clearly a number of major issues within the continent that continue to hinder individual countries ' economic and political growth , such as the continued single party despotic rule in a number of governments .
however , these situations are becoming the exception rather than the rule in africa .
a growing number of countries have transformed from the picture of the octogenarian clinging onto power , changing constitutions or disregarding them completely to secure continued power to one of peaceful handover of civil rule through , although sometimes flawed , democratic processes . what has changed to create this embryonic empowerment ? economic growth in sectors outside of the traditional agricultural environment continues to expand in large swathes of east and southern africa , most of which is fuelled by inward investment that was in the past either tied up in highly lucrative government bonds or denied access and opportunities to invest through uncertain political and investment conditions which are being addressed by the new bread of governments that are taking over .
there is clearly still significant change that is required both politically and economically within the continent to allow for the full participation of the population within the countries .
however , the change that has happened should be recognized and rewarded .
it should also be recognized that this change is also largely home grown and driven by an increasingly politically sophisticated electorate demanding change within their own governments . some of the changes that have occurred in the recent years in african economic and political growth have been directly influenced by donor pressure and support to the programs of change and development within the region .
however , change in the magnitude of reform that is required and is developing , requires long term support and commitment both within the country implementing the changes as well as more importantly within the donor community that is supporting the reforms .
however , transformation of governments is not an easy or a short-term process that can be completed within a few years .
the types of reform underway in africa will take years and maybe generations to make significant progress and this has to be understood and supported by organizations such as the g8 as well as individual donor governments . is the inability of organizations like the g8 to recognize the need for patience a reason why so many initiatives promoted by the rich nations apparently fail in africa ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alan duncan thinks there needs to be more patience with africa all too often , good initiatives are launched and basically abandoned in their infancy as they did not produce the results that had been envisaged within a short time frame and therefore some other “ better or improved ” mechanism for transformation is developed .
if we followed these rules for the international mechanisms that govern the g8 countries then the eu , nato , wto , un would have been abandoned years ago rather than given the continued support and funding that they are , in the knowledge that progress is being made , albeit slowly . how are africans helping themselves ? another positive force for change and development within africa is the increasing economic power and influence of the diaspora within europe and north america that had come over to carry out mainly low paid manual jobs but over time have progressed to increasingly higher skilled and better paid employment .

but activists from a diverse range of groups have criticized the results . at the official conclusion of the three-day meeting on friday , merkel said : " we have made far-reaching decisions on core issues . "
climate protection , globalization and africa were at the center of the summit at the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
the leaders of the world 's wealthiest states agreed to " seriously consider " the goal of having global emissions by 2050 .
but merkel was not successful in getting states to make firm numerical commitments .
the g8 also pledged $ 60 billion -lrb- 44.5 billion euros -rrb- to fight aids , malaria and tuberculosis .
but the declaration did not set out a specific timetable .
gleneagles revisited ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two years ago , g8 leaders made similar pledges on africa .
will they keep them this time ?
in addition to the cash promises to tackle disease , the eight nations broadly reiterated pledges on africa made at the 2005 summit in gleneagles , scotland , when they said they would double development funding by 2010 .
but activist groups have criticized both of the main measures agreed at the summit , which was attended by the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
development campaigners complained the g8 leaders had offered little fresh cash for the poor .
pop stars bob geldof and bono , who have committed themselves to publicizing africa 's plight and who had met with merkel ahead of the summit , were extremely dismissive .
pop ambassadors unhappy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bono and geldof 's performance seems to have found more listeners in nearby rostock geldof described the situation as a " farce " and , referring to the g8 leaders as " creeps , " he urged them to " get serious . "
bono said the g8 communiqué on africa was designed to deliberately cloud the issue .
aid agency oxfam also attacked the pledges .
" we must not be distracted by big numbers , " said an oxfam policy adviser .
" what the $ 60 billion headline means at best is just $ 3 billion extra in aid by 2010 . "
environmental groups were also critical of the summit 's achievements .
greenpeace would have preferred eu leaders to have moved ahead on climate change without the backing of the united states .
but the leaders launched the so-called heiligendamm process , a two-year project where the oecd will serve as a mediator for more permanent consultation between the g8 powers and the emerging market economies china , india , brazil , mexico and south africa .

is either of these views close to the reality on the ground in africa ? africa is changing and changing for the better in more ways than is apparent to the outside observer at times .
it ’ s easy to look at the problematic elections in nigeria , the violent land clearance and slum destruction in zimbabwe or the continuing civilian deaths in the democratic republic of congo and see only regression and destruction on the continent .
media pictures , both outside africa as well as within , place very little emphasis on the positive developments that have taken place .
there are clearly a number of major issues within the continent that continue to hinder individual countries ' economic and political growth , such as the continued single party despotic rule in a number of governments .
however , these situations are becoming the exception rather than the rule in africa .
a growing number of countries have transformed from the picture of the octogenarian clinging onto power , changing constitutions or disregarding them completely to secure continued power to one of peaceful handover of civil rule through , although sometimes flawed , democratic processes . what has changed to create this embryonic empowerment ? economic growth in sectors outside of the traditional agricultural environment continues to expand in large swathes of east and southern africa , most of which is fuelled by inward investment that was in the past either tied up in highly lucrative government bonds or denied access and opportunities to invest through uncertain political and investment conditions which are being addressed by the new bread of governments that are taking over .
there is clearly still significant change that is required both politically and economically within the continent to allow for the full participation of the population within the countries .
however , the change that has happened should be recognized and rewarded .
it should also be recognized that this change is also largely home grown and driven by an increasingly politically sophisticated electorate demanding change within their own governments . some of the changes that have occurred in the recent years in african economic and political growth have been directly influenced by donor pressure and support to the programs of change and development within the region .
however , change in the magnitude of reform that is required and is developing , requires long term support and commitment both within the country implementing the changes as well as more importantly within the donor community that is supporting the reforms .
however , transformation of governments is not an easy or a short-term process that can be completed within a few years .
the types of reform underway in africa will take years and maybe generations to make significant progress and this has to be understood and supported by organizations such as the g8 as well as individual donor governments . is the inability of organizations like the g8 to recognize the need for patience a reason why so many initiatives promoted by the rich nations apparently fail in africa ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alan duncan thinks there needs to be more patience with africa all too often , good initiatives are launched and basically abandoned in their infancy as they did not produce the results that had been envisaged within a short time frame and therefore some other “ better or improved ” mechanism for transformation is developed .
if we followed these rules for the international mechanisms that govern the g8 countries then the eu , nato , wto , un would have been abandoned years ago rather than given the continued support and funding that they are , in the knowledge that progress is being made , albeit slowly . how are africans helping themselves ? another positive force for change and development within africa is the increasing economic power and influence of the diaspora within europe and north america that had come over to carry out mainly low paid manual jobs but over time have progressed to increasingly higher skilled and better paid employment .
unlike most other employees within europe that spend most , or in the case of the uk , more than their income every month , the african immigrants remit the majority of their salary to their home country to support their families and communities there . this flow of funds has been growing over the past decade to such an extent that the central bank of ghana estimated that the remittances for 2006 coming from the diaspora was in the region of $ 1 billion .
although most of this money could not be classed as development expenditure in the same sense that money spent on behalf of european donor governments could , it still contributes significantly to the economic development of the recipient country .
when put in perspective , the total contributions for budget support from ten donor countries to ghana in 2006 was estimated at $ 300 million , a sum dwarfed by the remittances from the countries own population . so what is the future of international aid in africa ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helping africa help itself for european donors and institutions to remain relevant and connected to the development and change within africa there needs to be change in the terms of engagement between the various actors .
as i said before , the support given to governments in africa from donors has to change from the short-termism of the present to longer term commitment and continuity of engagement to provide the confidence and respect of the recipient government for the work being undertaken . although difficult for european farmers to accept , the opening of markets for african grown agricultural produce is one of the fastest and most equitable ways of improving the living conditions of people in africa .
the deregulation of agricultural markets in europe need not be a zero sum game , where the gain in africa is a loss in europe .
the improving living conditions and available income in africa gained from this would result in increased demand for consumer goods from europe as well .
sure it will not be european farmers that are producing and selling the consumer goods to africa but this type of structural reform in markets has always been the natural progression of changing markets .
what is stopping this structural change at the moment is the protectionism of the eu and north america which is restricting the natural progression of economic activity within the world and drastically distorting markets to the detriment of all . alan duncan is a project coordinator for economic consultants kpmg east africa in southern sudan .
he has coordinated several international aid projects in the refugee camps spread throughout the war-torn region , sometimes under fire from both government and rebel forces .

is either of these views close to the reality on the ground in africa ? africa is changing and changing for the better in more ways than is apparent to the outside observer at times .
it ’ s easy to look at the problematic elections in nigeria , the violent land clearance and slum destruction in zimbabwe or the continuing civilian deaths in the democratic republic of congo and see only regression and destruction on the continent .
media pictures , both outside africa as well as within , place very little emphasis on the positive developments that have taken place .
there are clearly a number of major issues within the continent that continue to hinder individual countries ' economic and political growth , such as the continued single party despotic rule in a number of governments .
however , these situations are becoming the exception rather than the rule in africa .
a growing number of countries have transformed from the picture of the octogenarian clinging onto power , changing constitutions or disregarding them completely to secure continued power to one of peaceful handover of civil rule through , although sometimes flawed , democratic processes . what has changed to create this embryonic empowerment ? economic growth in sectors outside of the traditional agricultural environment continues to expand in large swathes of east and southern africa , most of which is fuelled by inward investment that was in the past either tied up in highly lucrative government bonds or denied access and opportunities to invest through uncertain political and investment conditions which are being addressed by the new bread of governments that are taking over .
there is clearly still significant change that is required both politically and economically within the continent to allow for the full participation of the population within the countries .
however , the change that has happened should be recognized and rewarded .
it should also be recognized that this change is also largely home grown and driven by an increasingly politically sophisticated electorate demanding change within their own governments . some of the changes that have occurred in the recent years in african economic and political growth have been directly influenced by donor pressure and support to the programs of change and development within the region .
however , change in the magnitude of reform that is required and is developing , requires long term support and commitment both within the country implementing the changes as well as more importantly within the donor community that is supporting the reforms .
however , transformation of governments is not an easy or a short-term process that can be completed within a few years .
the types of reform underway in africa will take years and maybe generations to make significant progress and this has to be understood and supported by organizations such as the g8 as well as individual donor governments . is the inability of organizations like the g8 to recognize the need for patience a reason why so many initiatives promoted by the rich nations apparently fail in africa ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alan duncan thinks there needs to be more patience with africa all too often , good initiatives are launched and basically abandoned in their infancy as they did not produce the results that had been envisaged within a short time frame and therefore some other “ better or improved ” mechanism for transformation is developed .
if we followed these rules for the international mechanisms that govern the g8 countries then the eu , nato , wto , un would have been abandoned years ago rather than given the continued support and funding that they are , in the knowledge that progress is being made , albeit slowly . how are africans helping themselves ? another positive force for change and development within africa is the increasing economic power and influence of the diaspora within europe and north america that had come over to carry out mainly low paid manual jobs but over time have progressed to increasingly higher skilled and better paid employment .
unlike most other employees within europe that spend most , or in the case of the uk , more than their income every month , the african immigrants remit the majority of their salary to their home country to support their families and communities there . this flow of funds has been growing over the past decade to such an extent that the central bank of ghana estimated that the remittances for 2006 coming from the diaspora was in the region of $ 1 billion .
although most of this money could not be classed as development expenditure in the same sense that money spent on behalf of european donor governments could , it still contributes significantly to the economic development of the recipient country .
when put in perspective , the total contributions for budget support from ten donor countries to ghana in 2006 was estimated at $ 300 million , a sum dwarfed by the remittances from the countries own population . so what is the future of international aid in africa ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helping africa help itself for european donors and institutions to remain relevant and connected to the development and change within africa there needs to be change in the terms of engagement between the various actors .
as i said before , the support given to governments in africa from donors has to change from the short-termism of the present to longer term commitment and continuity of engagement to provide the confidence and respect of the recipient government for the work being undertaken . although difficult for european farmers to accept , the opening of markets for african grown agricultural produce is one of the fastest and most equitable ways of improving the living conditions of people in africa .
the deregulation of agricultural markets in europe need not be a zero sum game , where the gain in africa is a loss in europe .
the improving living conditions and available income in africa gained from this would result in increased demand for consumer goods from europe as well .
sure it will not be european farmers that are producing and selling the consumer goods to africa but this type of structural reform in markets has always been the natural progression of changing markets .
what is stopping this structural change at the moment is the protectionism of the eu and north america which is restricting the natural progression of economic activity within the world and drastically distorting markets to the detriment of all . alan duncan is a project coordinator for economic consultants kpmg east africa in southern sudan .
he has coordinated several international aid projects in the refugee camps spread throughout the war-torn region , sometimes under fire from both government and rebel forces .
he currently works as a consultant for the kenyan government ’ s finance ministry . alan duncan was interviewed by nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the world 's richest nations - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states and russia - have so far spectacularly failed to find a common line on the issue .
the lack of consensus was apparent again in a declaration released on the second day of the three-day summit of g8 leaders in this baltic coast resort , where germany 's goals were effectively swept under the carpet .
" we discussed recent developments in global financial markets , including hedge funds , " the text said .

in their declaration on thursday , the g8 members said that hedge funds had " contributed significantly to the efficiency of the financial system . "
complex risks nevertheless , " the assessment of potential systemic and operational risks associated with these activities has become more complex and challenging , " the statement continued .
" given the strong growth of the hedge fund industry and the increasing complexity of the instruments they trade , we reaffirm the need to be vigilant . "
the g8 said it " welcomed " a specially commissioned report compiled for the g8 by the so-called financial stability forum which recommended the industry " review and enhance existing sound practice benchmarks . "

the success story of carl zeiss , the university innovator who had a keen sense for business is one example of the city 's claim to fame . optical pioneer and city patron bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carl zeiss the age of modern industry began in jena in the mid-1800s when carl zeiss , together with researchers ernst abbe and otto schott , laid the foundation for precision optical engineering .
their pioneering inventions - astronomical instruments , microscopes and the first planetarium - have since spread to every corner of the world . to the advantage of their city , the scientists were also far-sighted in terms of financial matters .
the companies they founded - zeiss precision optics and schott and gen. chemical plant - boosted jena 's economy and attracted thousands of workers to the central german town . with a part of his profits , zeiss financed the construction of jena 's " volkshaus , " a large concert hall , as well as the reconstruction of the university 's new main building . a model city bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schott , painted in 1913 by max liebermann , returning to his villa the gdr used the zeiss name with great pride .
after the second world war the zeiss factories were nationalized and continued production . jena was regarded as a model socialist city , and the city was crowned with the ultra-modern research tower , a symbol of socialistic architecture .
originally intended to house the zeiss enterprises , the building later became home to university scientists . star gdr architect herbert henselmann designed the tower in the form of a huge telescope .
one of the most beautiful old squares in town was sacrificed to make room for the building .
after germany was reunified in 1990 , the newly renovated building was bought by a software company . goethe and gingko bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a jena sunset worthy of goethe 's pen even before carl zeiss , jena was recognized as a scientific center .
johann wolfgang von goethe often traveled from weimar to jena to encourage the natural science studies there .
the poet 's discovery of the intermaxillary bone in the human mandible is still regarded as a medical sensation . it is also said that goethe was the first to have planted a gingko tree in europe .
also called a " maidenhair tree , " it can be seen along with 12,000 other cultivated plants from all of the earth 's climate zones at jena 's botanical garden . jena - the " storehouse of knowledge and science , " as goethe referred to the city - attracted top minds in the 18th century .
hegel , fichte , and schelling , as well as schiller and the schlegel brothers , taught at the university , and hölderlin , novalis and brentano sat in their lectures .
their names represent the glorious epochs of the german classical age and romanticism . science meets money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the optic tradition zeiss started in jena is carried on today as was the case in zeiss ' time , science and the economy are again forming alliances in jena .
in just a short time , the " boomtown of thuringia " registered more listed start-ups than the western german financial metropolis of frankfurt am main . according to mckinsey , consulting companies regard jena as the second most important center of innovation in germany , with munich taking first place and dresden third . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eastern german town boasts cutting-edge technology there 's more to eastern germany than just chronic joblessness and neo-nazism .

" there are two central elements in the climate accord that will be officially presented this friday : one , the necessity to ' decisively ' reduce greenhouse gases .
the other one - which marks the real political success of the summit - is that once the kyoto protocol -lrb- which the us has never ratified -rrb- expires in 2012 , the framework for combating climate change will be under the auspices of the united nations .
it was difficult to achieve anything more at the summit with such deep divisions among leaders over the issue - the europeans , with the support of japan and canada , on the one hand , and the americans and russians on the other . "
france 's libération took a much tougher approach .
" just like at the un , at the g8 the devil is in the details .
president george w. bush , as head of the largest polluting country in the world , did not want binding commitments for reducing co2 emissions .
he did not give in .
the climate accord does outline that which was so precious to the europeans : a 50 percent reduction by 2050 , but it merely says that should ' be considered . '
the accord lacks any firm commitment whatsoever .
it is a compromise that lets everyone at the summit save face . -lrb- … -rrb- no one admitted it , but some people surely thought quite clearly : this compromise is a bet on the near future , one in which people are placing a lot of hope - a new era for the climate simply called " the period after bush . "
switzerland 's tages-anzeiger agreed .
" what the powerful -lrb- … -rrb- are selling as a success is primarily a way for them to save face : thanks to non-binding agreements , host chancellor angela merkel does not have to stand there empty-handed .
bush 's willingness after all to work together on a treaty to succeed the kyoto protocol , under the auspices of the un , keeps him from looking like the bad guy .
it is a weak signal , however , for the uno environment conference at the end of the year in bali . -lrb- … -rrb- merkel overestimated her global-political influence in the climate protection arena . "
austria 's die presse said that g8 success on the climate was limited .
" it -lrb- the accord -rrb- could not exactly be called the breakthrough of the century .
greenpeace activists - the self-proclaimed guardians of the environment - reacted promptly when they called the outcome of the climate talks " far too little . "
at the baltic sea resort heiligendamm , the absolute claims of starry-eyed idealists once again clashed with the sober pragmatism of world leaders representing their own national interestss .
coming to an agreement is normally next to impossible in situations like that .
that was also evident after chancellor merkel 's talk with bono and bob geldof .
bono apparently became depressed because merkel did not agree to enough aid for africa .
as if g8 leaders should beckon to the calls of rock stars .
smart rock stars always say politics is not their business .
but smart politicians should also avoid selling vague declarations of intent as major steps . "
germany 's financial times deutschland put it succintly : " in terms of chancellor merkel 's own high expectations about climate talks at the summit , she has failed .
but in terms of what was realistic , she has succeeded at the meeting of world leaders in heiligendamm . " dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on the final day of the summit , the group of eight wealthiest nations are expected to announce a $ 60 billion -lrb- 44.5 billion euro -rrb- pledge to fight aids , malaria and tuberculosis in africa . summit host german chancellor angela merkel formally announced the agreement friday morning . " we are aware of our responsibilities and we will rise to them , " she said .
" on the other hand , we want to stress that we also have expectations about what should happen in africa . " in the run-up to the summit , merkel had already emphasized the hope that african countries would be stepping up their own efforts to modernize .
this would entail clamping down on corruption , consolidating democracy and strengthening civil society . about half of the sum has already been pledged by the us .
the rest will be paid by the other g8 countries , with some 4 billion euros coming from germany . us president george w. bush - who remained in his hotel suite friday morning on account of a stomach upset - announced the main thrust of the initiative in may . among the heads of the six african nations representing the needs of the poorest continent was south african president thabo mbeki .
the other countries represented were egypt , ghana , algeria , nigeria and ethiopia . wrangling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders did not follow through on pledges made at gleneagles in 2005 the g8 countries wrangled late into thursday night about the finer points of the aid program for africa , with certain countries including italy apparently dragging their feet . broadly , the eight nations have now reiterated pledges made at the 2005 summit in gleneagles , scotland , when they said they would double development funding by 2010 . some campaigners for africa , meanwhile , insist $ 60 billion still falls short of un targets . two leading campaigners , rock stars bono and bob geldof , were in town to put pressure on merkel and her fellow leaders . " the chancellor has asked us to trust her and we are tempted , but we can not risk being let down by the g8 again , " bono was quoted by reuters as saying . on friday , merkel said that progress on the aid program would be monitored at the next g8 meeting in japan set to take place in a year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on the final day of the summit , the group of eight wealthiest nations are expected to announce a $ 60 billion -lrb- 44.5 billion euro -rrb- pledge to fight aids , malaria and tuberculosis in africa . summit host german chancellor angela merkel formally announced the agreement friday morning . " we are aware of our responsibilities and we will rise to them , " she said .
" on the other hand , we want to stress that we also have expectations about what should happen in africa . " in the run-up to the summit , merkel had already emphasized the hope that african countries would be stepping up their own efforts to modernize .
this would entail clamping down on corruption , consolidating democracy and strengthening civil society . about half of the sum has already been pledged by the us .
the rest will be paid by the other g8 countries , with some 4 billion euros coming from germany . us president george w. bush - who remained in his hotel suite friday morning on account of a stomach upset - announced the main thrust of the initiative in may . among the heads of the six african nations representing the needs of the poorest continent was south african president thabo mbeki .
the other countries represented were egypt , ghana , algeria , nigeria and ethiopia . wrangling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders did not follow through on pledges made at gleneagles in 2005 the g8 countries wrangled late into thursday night about the finer points of the aid program for africa , with certain countries including italy apparently dragging their feet . broadly , the eight nations have now reiterated pledges made at the 2005 summit in gleneagles , scotland , when they said they would double development funding by 2010 . some campaigners for africa , meanwhile , insist $ 60 billion still falls short of un targets . two leading campaigners , rock stars bono and bob geldof , were in town to put pressure on merkel and her fellow leaders . " the chancellor has asked us to trust her and we are tempted , but we can not risk being let down by the g8 again , " bono was quoted by reuters as saying . on friday , merkel said that progress on the aid program would be monitored at the next g8 meeting in japan set to take place in a year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but activists from a diverse range of groups have criticized the results . at the official conclusion of the three-day meeting on friday , merkel said : " we have made far-reaching decisions on core issues . "
climate protection , globalization and africa were at the center of the summit at the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
the leaders of the world 's wealthiest states agreed to " seriously consider " the goal of having global emissions by 2050 .
but merkel was not successful in getting states to make firm numerical commitments .
the g8 also pledged $ 60 billion -lrb- 44.5 billion euros -rrb- to fight aids , malaria and tuberculosis .
but the declaration did not set out a specific timetable .
gleneagles revisited ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two years ago , g8 leaders made similar pledges on africa .
will they keep them this time ?
in addition to the cash promises to tackle disease , the eight nations broadly reiterated pledges on africa made at the 2005 summit in gleneagles , scotland , when they said they would double development funding by 2010 .
but activist groups have criticized both of the main measures agreed at the summit , which was attended by the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
development campaigners complained the g8 leaders had offered little fresh cash for the poor .
pop stars bob geldof and bono , who have committed themselves to publicizing africa 's plight and who had met with merkel ahead of the summit , were extremely dismissive .
pop ambassadors unhappy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bono and geldof 's performance seems to have found more listeners in nearby rostock geldof described the situation as a " farce " and , referring to the g8 leaders as " creeps , " he urged them to " get serious . "
bono said the g8 communiqué on africa was designed to deliberately cloud the issue .
aid agency oxfam also attacked the pledges .
" we must not be distracted by big numbers , " said an oxfam policy adviser .
" what the $ 60 billion headline means at best is just $ 3 billion extra in aid by 2010 . "
environmental groups were also critical of the summit 's achievements .
greenpeace would have preferred eu leaders to have moved ahead on climate change without the backing of the united states .
but the leaders launched the so-called heiligendamm process , a two-year project where the oecd will serve as a mediator for more permanent consultation between the g8 powers and the emerging market economies china , india , brazil , mexico and south africa .
coming closer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heiligendamm marks the start of a new dialogue between g8 and emerging economies issues such as climate protection and common obligations regarding aid to africa are likely to feature in the talks .
" the message is that we can no longer get along without one another , " merkel said .
the g8 also called for a swift conclusion to the doha round of world trade talk and urged all sides to show flexibility to get a deal .
the round has been blighted by differences between the eu and the us over farm trade liberalization and soured disagreements with india and brazil over high industrial tariffs .
on the last day of the summit , leaders made no progress on the question of the future status of the breakaway serbian province of kosovo .
russia opposes independence for the area , which has an ethnic albanian majority .
police defends arrests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police say g8 summit security was the biggest poswar operation for them german police officials meanwhile said that they kept 1,057 violent demonstrators in special detention centres during the g8 summit and were still holding 125 of them friday . police commander knut abramowski said the police strategy had " basically " worked but admitted that he had been caught off-guard by demonstrators swarming through fields to the fence at the heiligendamm compound . he defended the preventive detention of violent protesters saying he had to protect his officers . leftist groups have denounced the conditions in the holding centers and asserted that many inmates were only held for donning the attire of the black block , a loose formation of anarchists and communists in the crowds . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de talked to one of the world 's leading beer experts about the appeal of the cologne speciality . think of americans in germany and beer , and you 'd probably think of package holiday makers braving the sloshed masses at munich 's oktoberfest . but a local cologne newspaper , the kölner stadt-anzeiger , is reporting increasing numbers of us tourists haunting the city 's bars with copies of the new york times in their hands - this after the times travel section ran a piece raving about the local beer , kölsch . what makes kölsch different from the familiar lager beer drunk in most other places in germany ?
the question is one that puzzles even michael jackson , the award-winning author of " the world guide to beer " and the host of the bbc tv show " the beer hunter . " " other than saying it 's a top-fermented version of a pilsner , it 's difficult to explain , " jackson told dw-world .
" kölsch is teasingly delicate but also elusive . " like a classic german beer daydreaming that it 's a glass of champagne ? " yeah , " jackson said .
" i think that 's a pretty good way of putting it . " a local treat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kölsch is served in special tall glasses to preserve freshness the microbrewery movement that 's radically changed american and british drinking habits in the past two decades has n't caught on in germany , where most people prefer to stick with standard , albeit high-quality , lagers and wheat beers . if tourists want to try beer styles not widely available outside germany , they need to look in specific local regions .
that 's down to history .

in addition to the cash promises to tackle disease , the eight nations broadly reiterated pledges on africa made at the 2005 summit in gleneagles , scotland , when they said they would double development funding by 2010 .
but activist groups have criticized both of the main measures agreed at the summit , which was attended by the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states .

the g8 also called for a swift conclusion to the doha round of world trade talk and urged all sides to show flexibility to get a deal .
the round has been blighted by differences between the eu and the us over farm trade liberalization and soured disagreements with india and brazil over high industrial tariffs .

in addition to the cash promises to tackle disease , the eight nations broadly reiterated pledges on africa made at the 2005 summit in gleneagles , scotland , when they said they would double development funding by 2010 .

the g8 also called for a swift conclusion to the doha round of world trade talk and urged all sides to show flexibility to get a deal .

is either of these views close to the reality on the ground in africa ? africa is changing and changing for the better in more ways than is apparent to the outside observer at times .
it ’ s easy to look at the problematic elections in nigeria , the violent land clearance and slum destruction in zimbabwe or the continuing civilian deaths in the democratic republic of congo and see only regression and destruction on the continent .
media pictures , both outside africa as well as within , place very little emphasis on the positive developments that have taken place .
there are clearly a number of major issues within the continent that continue to hinder individual countries ' economic and political growth , such as the continued single party despotic rule in a number of governments .
however , these situations are becoming the exception rather than the rule in africa .
a growing number of countries have transformed from the picture of the octogenarian clinging onto power , changing constitutions or disregarding them completely to secure continued power to one of peaceful handover of civil rule through , although sometimes flawed , democratic processes . what has changed to create this embryonic empowerment ? economic growth in sectors outside of the traditional agricultural environment continues to expand in large swathes of east and southern africa , most of which is fuelled by inward investment that was in the past either tied up in highly lucrative government bonds or denied access and opportunities to invest through uncertain political and investment conditions which are being addressed by the new bread of governments that are taking over .
there is clearly still significant change that is required both politically and economically within the continent to allow for the full participation of the population within the countries .
however , the change that has happened should be recognized and rewarded .
it should also be recognized that this change is also largely home grown and driven by an increasingly politically sophisticated electorate demanding change within their own governments . some of the changes that have occurred in the recent years in african economic and political growth have been directly influenced by donor pressure and support to the programs of change and development within the region .
however , change in the magnitude of reform that is required and is developing , requires long term support and commitment both within the country implementing the changes as well as more importantly within the donor community that is supporting the reforms .
however , transformation of governments is not an easy or a short-term process that can be completed within a few years .
the types of reform underway in africa will take years and maybe generations to make significant progress and this has to be understood and supported by organizations such as the g8 as well as individual donor governments . is the inability of organizations like the g8 to recognize the need for patience a reason why so many initiatives promoted by the rich nations apparently fail in africa ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alan duncan thinks there needs to be more patience with africa all too often , good initiatives are launched and basically abandoned in their infancy as they did not produce the results that had been envisaged within a short time frame and therefore some other “ better or improved ” mechanism for transformation is developed .
if we followed these rules for the international mechanisms that govern the g8 countries then the eu , nato , wto , un would have been abandoned years ago rather than given the continued support and funding that they are , in the knowledge that progress is being made , albeit slowly . how are africans helping themselves ? another positive force for change and development within africa is the increasing economic power and influence of the diaspora within europe and north america that had come over to carry out mainly low paid manual jobs but over time have progressed to increasingly higher skilled and better paid employment .
unlike most other employees within europe that spend most , or in the case of the uk , more than their income every month , the african immigrants remit the majority of their salary to their home country to support their families and communities there . this flow of funds has been growing over the past decade to such an extent that the central bank of ghana estimated that the remittances for 2006 coming from the diaspora was in the region of $ 1 billion .
although most of this money could not be classed as development expenditure in the same sense that money spent on behalf of european donor governments could , it still contributes significantly to the economic development of the recipient country .
when put in perspective , the total contributions for budget support from ten donor countries to ghana in 2006 was estimated at $ 300 million , a sum dwarfed by the remittances from the countries own population . so what is the future of international aid in africa ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helping africa help itself for european donors and institutions to remain relevant and connected to the development and change within africa there needs to be change in the terms of engagement between the various actors .
as i said before , the support given to governments in africa from donors has to change from the short-termism of the present to longer term commitment and continuity of engagement to provide the confidence and respect of the recipient government for the work being undertaken . although difficult for european farmers to accept , the opening of markets for african grown agricultural produce is one of the fastest and most equitable ways of improving the living conditions of people in africa .
the deregulation of agricultural markets in europe need not be a zero sum game , where the gain in africa is a loss in europe .
the improving living conditions and available income in africa gained from this would result in increased demand for consumer goods from europe as well .
sure it will not be european farmers that are producing and selling the consumer goods to africa but this type of structural reform in markets has always been the natural progression of changing markets .
what is stopping this structural change at the moment is the protectionism of the eu and north america which is restricting the natural progression of economic activity within the world and drastically distorting markets to the detriment of all . alan duncan is a project coordinator for economic consultants kpmg east africa in southern sudan .
he has coordinated several international aid projects in the refugee camps spread throughout the war-torn region , sometimes under fire from both government and rebel forces .

is either of these views close to the reality on the ground in africa ? africa is changing and changing for the better in more ways than is apparent to the outside observer at times .
it ’ s easy to look at the problematic elections in nigeria , the violent land clearance and slum destruction in zimbabwe or the continuing civilian deaths in the democratic republic of congo and see only regression and destruction on the continent .
media pictures , both outside africa as well as within , place very little emphasis on the positive developments that have taken place .
there are clearly a number of major issues within the continent that continue to hinder individual countries ' economic and political growth , such as the continued single party despotic rule in a number of governments .
however , these situations are becoming the exception rather than the rule in africa .
a growing number of countries have transformed from the picture of the octogenarian clinging onto power , changing constitutions or disregarding them completely to secure continued power to one of peaceful handover of civil rule through , although sometimes flawed , democratic processes . what has changed to create this embryonic empowerment ? economic growth in sectors outside of the traditional agricultural environment continues to expand in large swathes of east and southern africa , most of which is fuelled by inward investment that was in the past either tied up in highly lucrative government bonds or denied access and opportunities to invest through uncertain political and investment conditions which are being addressed by the new bread of governments that are taking over .
there is clearly still significant change that is required both politically and economically within the continent to allow for the full participation of the population within the countries .
however , the change that has happened should be recognized and rewarded .
it should also be recognized that this change is also largely home grown and driven by an increasingly politically sophisticated electorate demanding change within their own governments . some of the changes that have occurred in the recent years in african economic and political growth have been directly influenced by donor pressure and support to the programs of change and development within the region .
however , change in the magnitude of reform that is required and is developing , requires long term support and commitment both within the country implementing the changes as well as more importantly within the donor community that is supporting the reforms .
however , transformation of governments is not an easy or a short-term process that can be completed within a few years .
the types of reform underway in africa will take years and maybe generations to make significant progress and this has to be understood and supported by organizations such as the g8 as well as individual donor governments . is the inability of organizations like the g8 to recognize the need for patience a reason why so many initiatives promoted by the rich nations apparently fail in africa ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alan duncan thinks there needs to be more patience with africa all too often , good initiatives are launched and basically abandoned in their infancy as they did not produce the results that had been envisaged within a short time frame and therefore some other “ better or improved ” mechanism for transformation is developed .
if we followed these rules for the international mechanisms that govern the g8 countries then the eu , nato , wto , un would have been abandoned years ago rather than given the continued support and funding that they are , in the knowledge that progress is being made , albeit slowly . how are africans helping themselves ? another positive force for change and development within africa is the increasing economic power and influence of the diaspora within europe and north america that had come over to carry out mainly low paid manual jobs but over time have progressed to increasingly higher skilled and better paid employment .
unlike most other employees within europe that spend most , or in the case of the uk , more than their income every month , the african immigrants remit the majority of their salary to their home country to support their families and communities there . this flow of funds has been growing over the past decade to such an extent that the central bank of ghana estimated that the remittances for 2006 coming from the diaspora was in the region of $ 1 billion .
although most of this money could not be classed as development expenditure in the same sense that money spent on behalf of european donor governments could , it still contributes significantly to the economic development of the recipient country .
when put in perspective , the total contributions for budget support from ten donor countries to ghana in 2006 was estimated at $ 300 million , a sum dwarfed by the remittances from the countries own population . so what is the future of international aid in africa ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helping africa help itself for european donors and institutions to remain relevant and connected to the development and change within africa there needs to be change in the terms of engagement between the various actors .
as i said before , the support given to governments in africa from donors has to change from the short-termism of the present to longer term commitment and continuity of engagement to provide the confidence and respect of the recipient government for the work being undertaken . although difficult for european farmers to accept , the opening of markets for african grown agricultural produce is one of the fastest and most equitable ways of improving the living conditions of people in africa .
the deregulation of agricultural markets in europe need not be a zero sum game , where the gain in africa is a loss in europe .
the improving living conditions and available income in africa gained from this would result in increased demand for consumer goods from europe as well .
sure it will not be european farmers that are producing and selling the consumer goods to africa but this type of structural reform in markets has always been the natural progression of changing markets .

but the world 's richest nations - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states and russia - have so far spectacularly failed to find a common line on the issue .
the lack of consensus was apparent again in a declaration released on the second day of the three-day summit of g8 leaders in this baltic coast resort , where germany 's goals were effectively swept under the carpet .
" we discussed recent developments in global financial markets , including hedge funds , " the text said .
highly speculative hedge funds are highly speculative and aggressive investment instruments that are estimated to manage close to one and a half trillion dollars in assets worldwide .
an estimated 9,000 such funds are currently in operation , most of them based in the us and britain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister steinbrück has discussed hedge funds before berlin fears a possible domino effect should one of the big funds fail .
but it has been gradually forced to scale back its ambitions for increased transparency and more disclosure in the sector in the face of fierce resistance , particularly from britain , the united states and japan .
in their declaration on thursday , the g8 members said that hedge funds had " contributed significantly to the efficiency of the financial system . "
complex risks nevertheless , " the assessment of potential systemic and operational risks associated with these activities has become more complex and challenging , " the statement continued .
" given the strong growth of the hedge fund industry and the increasing complexity of the instruments they trade , we reaffirm the need to be vigilant . "
the g8 said it " welcomed " a specially commissioned report compiled for the g8 by the so-called financial stability forum which recommended the industry " review and enhance existing sound practice benchmarks . "
and the grouping said it also welcomed " that the fsf will report to finance ministers as from october of this year on the progress and actions taken in respect of these recommendations . " dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de outlook is bleak for big strides on climate issues germany 's agenda for the g8 summit ranges from africa and trade to hedge funds , relations with russia , the middle east and kosovo .
but it is the climate that is getting the most heat .
-lrb- 06.06.2007 -rrb- experts : globalization improves , does n't worsen peoples ' lives proponents of globalization say that free trade and open markets mean more prosperity for the world 's population .
at issue is how to make globalization work better for poor countries than is the case right now .
-lrb- 04.06.2007 -rrb- g8 still poles apart on hedge fund regulation the g8 showed no sign friday of moving any closer to a consensus on the hotly debated issue of regulation of hedge funds , a matter which lies particularly close to the heart of the g8 's current host , germany .

but the world 's richest nations - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states and russia - have so far spectacularly failed to find a common line on the issue .
the lack of consensus was apparent again in a declaration released on the second day of the three-day summit of g8 leaders in this baltic coast resort , where germany 's goals were effectively swept under the carpet .
" we discussed recent developments in global financial markets , including hedge funds , " the text said .
highly speculative hedge funds are highly speculative and aggressive investment instruments that are estimated to manage close to one and a half trillion dollars in assets worldwide .
an estimated 9,000 such funds are currently in operation , most of them based in the us and britain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister steinbrück has discussed hedge funds before berlin fears a possible domino effect should one of the big funds fail .
but it has been gradually forced to scale back its ambitions for increased transparency and more disclosure in the sector in the face of fierce resistance , particularly from britain , the united states and japan .
in their declaration on thursday , the g8 members said that hedge funds had " contributed significantly to the efficiency of the financial system . "
complex risks nevertheless , " the assessment of potential systemic and operational risks associated with these activities has become more complex and challenging , " the statement continued .
" given the strong growth of the hedge fund industry and the increasing complexity of the instruments they trade , we reaffirm the need to be vigilant . "
the g8 said it " welcomed " a specially commissioned report compiled for the g8 by the so-called financial stability forum which recommended the industry " review and enhance existing sound practice benchmarks . "
and the grouping said it also welcomed " that the fsf will report to finance ministers as from october of this year on the progress and actions taken in respect of these recommendations . " dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de outlook is bleak for big strides on climate issues germany 's agenda for the g8 summit ranges from africa and trade to hedge funds , relations with russia , the middle east and kosovo .
but it is the climate that is getting the most heat .
-lrb- 06.06.2007 -rrb- experts : globalization improves , does n't worsen peoples ' lives proponents of globalization say that free trade and open markets mean more prosperity for the world 's population .
at issue is how to make globalization work better for poor countries than is the case right now .
-lrb- 04.06.2007 -rrb- g8 still poles apart on hedge fund regulation the g8 showed no sign friday of moving any closer to a consensus on the hotly debated issue of regulation of hedge funds , a matter which lies particularly close to the heart of the g8 's current host , germany .

"
this follows the release of a council of europe report . european commission spokesman friso roscam abbing stressed the need " for the member states concerned to conduct impartial investigations to establish the truth . " " indeed , such investigations should be fully carried out as quickly as possible in order to establish responsibility and for the victims to obtain compensation , " he told reporters in brussels . in a report friday , the council of europe said the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- ran secret prisons in poland and romania from 2003 to 2005 to interrogate terror suspects under a program authorized by the two countries ' presidents . both poland and romania have denied the allegations . denials from poland and romania bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : council of europe investigator dick marty according to the report , poland 's former president aleksander kwasniewski had known about the covert cia activities on polish soil . " poland maintains its position on the issue of the alleged cia prisons on the territory of our country - there were no secret bases in poland , " polish foreign ministry spokesperson robert szaniawski was quoted by polish pap news agency friday . szaniawski added that polish officials were waiting for the council of europe to produce more details and evidence to support its claims . " up to now the evidence presented on this issue has been worth very little , " he said . romania has also rejected claims that it held secret prisons . " it is regrettable that the rapporteur thinks romania ' welcomed secret prisons , " the romanian foreign ministry said in a statement . " this report , like the previous one , provides no evidence to confirm these allegations , except for unidentified ' sources , ' whose credibility can not be assessed , " the statement continued . " global spider 's web " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : possibly a covert detention center - mihail kogalniceanu base in romania council of europe investigator dick marty had said in his report that the prisons , in northeast poland and southeast romania , were part of a " global spider 's web " of detentions and illegal transfers spun out around the world by the united states and its allies after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks . marty also suggested that nato and the united states reached a secret deal in 2001 allowing the central intelligence agency to run the covert prisons . liberal democrat members of a european parliamentary committee that studied the issue welcomed marty 's report . committee vice-president sarah ludford , a british mep , said : " we must expose the secret agreements between us intelligence services and some european governments . " bildunterschrift : romanian leaders deny that mihail kogalniceanu airbase hosted a secret prison " these illegal , undemocratic and unacceptable actions must be accounted for and punished , " she said . roscam abbing said that the european commission - the executive arm of the european union - would study their report carefully before deciding whether to take any action against the member states involved . " this is a very serious matter with very , very serious and strong allegations , " he said .
" we intend to discuss the matter further . " in 2005 eu justice and security commissioner franco frattini said that the states concerned could face penalties - including suspension of eu voting rights - if found to have taken part in the secret cia prison system . poland joined the european union in 2004 and romania this year . both also belong to the north atlantic treaty organization . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this follows the release of a council of europe report . european commission spokesman friso roscam abbing stressed the need " for the member states concerned to conduct impartial investigations to establish the truth . " " indeed , such investigations should be fully carried out as quickly as possible in order to establish responsibility and for the victims to obtain compensation , " he told reporters in brussels . in a report friday , the council of europe said the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- ran secret prisons in poland and romania from 2003 to 2005 to interrogate terror suspects under a program authorized by the two countries ' presidents . both poland and romania have denied the allegations . denials from poland and romania bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : council of europe investigator dick marty according to the report , poland 's former president aleksander kwasniewski had known about the covert cia activities on polish soil . " poland maintains its position on the issue of the alleged cia prisons on the territory of our country - there were no secret bases in poland , " polish foreign ministry spokesperson robert szaniawski was quoted by polish pap news agency friday . szaniawski added that polish officials were waiting for the council of europe to produce more details and evidence to support its claims . " up to now the evidence presented on this issue has been worth very little , " he said . romania has also rejected claims that it held secret prisons . " it is regrettable that the rapporteur thinks romania ' welcomed secret prisons , " the romanian foreign ministry said in a statement . " this report , like the previous one , provides no evidence to confirm these allegations , except for unidentified ' sources , ' whose credibility can not be assessed , " the statement continued . " global spider 's web " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : possibly a covert detention center - mihail kogalniceanu base in romania council of europe investigator dick marty had said in his report that the prisons , in northeast poland and southeast romania , were part of a " global spider 's web " of detentions and illegal transfers spun out around the world by the united states and its allies after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks . marty also suggested that nato and the united states reached a secret deal in 2001 allowing the central intelligence agency to run the covert prisons . liberal democrat members of a european parliamentary committee that studied the issue welcomed marty 's report . committee vice-president sarah ludford , a british mep , said : " we must expose the secret agreements between us intelligence services and some european governments . " bildunterschrift : romanian leaders deny that mihail kogalniceanu airbase hosted a secret prison " these illegal , undemocratic and unacceptable actions must be accounted for and punished , " she said . roscam abbing said that the european commission - the executive arm of the european union - would study their report carefully before deciding whether to take any action against the member states involved . " this is a very serious matter with very , very serious and strong allegations , " he said .
" we intend to discuss the matter further . " in 2005 eu justice and security commissioner franco frattini said that the states concerned could face penalties - including suspension of eu voting rights - if found to have taken part in the secret cia prison system . poland joined the european union in 2004 and romania this year . both also belong to the north atlantic treaty organization . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are two central elements in the climate accord that will be officially presented this friday : one , the necessity to ' decisively ' reduce greenhouse gases .
the other one - which marks the real political success of the summit - is that once the kyoto protocol -lrb- which the us has never ratified -rrb- expires in 2012 , the framework for combating climate change will be under the auspices of the united nations .
it was difficult to achieve anything more at the summit with such deep divisions among leaders over the issue - the europeans , with the support of japan and canada , on the one hand , and the americans and russians on the other . "
france 's libération took a much tougher approach .
" just like at the un , at the g8 the devil is in the details .
president george w. bush , as head of the largest polluting country in the world , did not want binding commitments for reducing co2 emissions .
he did not give in .
the climate accord does outline that which was so precious to the europeans : a 50 percent reduction by 2050 , but it merely says that should ' be considered . '
the accord lacks any firm commitment whatsoever .
it is a compromise that lets everyone at the summit save face . -lrb- … -rrb- no one admitted it , but some people surely thought quite clearly : this compromise is a bet on the near future , one in which people are placing a lot of hope - a new era for the climate simply called " the period after bush . "
switzerland 's tages-anzeiger agreed .
" what the powerful -lrb- … -rrb- are selling as a success is primarily a way for them to save face : thanks to non-binding agreements , host chancellor angela merkel does not have to stand there empty-handed .
bush 's willingness after all to work together on a treaty to succeed the kyoto protocol , under the auspices of the un , keeps him from looking like the bad guy .
it is a weak signal , however , for the uno environment conference at the end of the year in bali . -lrb- … -rrb- merkel overestimated her global-political influence in the climate protection arena . "
austria 's die presse said that g8 success on the climate was limited .
" it -lrb- the accord -rrb- could not exactly be called the breakthrough of the century .
greenpeace activists - the self-proclaimed guardians of the environment - reacted promptly when they called the outcome of the climate talks " far too little . "
at the baltic sea resort heiligendamm , the absolute claims of starry-eyed idealists once again clashed with the sober pragmatism of world leaders representing their own national interestss .
coming to an agreement is normally next to impossible in situations like that .
that was also evident after chancellor merkel 's talk with bono and bob geldof .
bono apparently became depressed because merkel did not agree to enough aid for africa .
as if g8 leaders should beckon to the calls of rock stars .
smart rock stars always say politics is not their business .
but smart politicians should also avoid selling vague declarations of intent as major steps . "

in their declaration on thursday , the g8 members said that hedge funds had " contributed significantly to the efficiency of the financial system . "
complex risks nevertheless , " the assessment of potential systemic and operational risks associated with these activities has become more complex and challenging , " the statement continued .
" given the strong growth of the hedge fund industry and the increasing complexity of the instruments they trade , we reaffirm the need to be vigilant . "
the g8 said it " welcomed " a specially commissioned report compiled for the g8 by the so-called financial stability forum which recommended the industry " review and enhance existing sound practice benchmarks . "
and the grouping said it also welcomed " that the fsf will report to finance ministers as from october of this year on the progress and actions taken in respect of these recommendations .

is either of these views close to the reality on the ground in africa ? africa is changing and changing for the better in more ways than is apparent to the outside observer at times .
it ’ s easy to look at the problematic elections in nigeria , the violent land clearance and slum destruction in zimbabwe or the continuing civilian deaths in the democratic republic of congo and see only regression and destruction on the continent .
media pictures , both outside africa as well as within , place very little emphasis on the positive developments that have taken place .
there are clearly a number of major issues within the continent that continue to hinder individual countries ' economic and political growth , such as the continued single party despotic rule in a number of governments .
however , these situations are becoming the exception rather than the rule in africa .
a growing number of countries have transformed from the picture of the octogenarian clinging onto power , changing constitutions or disregarding them completely to secure continued power to one of peaceful handover of civil rule through , although sometimes flawed , democratic processes . what has changed to create this embryonic empowerment ? economic growth in sectors outside of the traditional agricultural environment continues to expand in large swathes of east and southern africa , most of which is fuelled by inward investment that was in the past either tied up in highly lucrative government bonds or denied access and opportunities to invest through uncertain political and investment conditions which are being addressed by the new bread of governments that are taking over .
there is clearly still significant change that is required both politically and economically within the continent to allow for the full participation of the population within the countries .
however , the change that has happened should be recognized and rewarded .
it should also be recognized that this change is also largely home grown and driven by an increasingly politically sophisticated electorate demanding change within their own governments . some of the changes that have occurred in the recent years in african economic and political growth have been directly influenced by donor pressure and support to the programs of change and development within the region .
however , change in the magnitude of reform that is required and is developing , requires long term support and commitment both within the country implementing the changes as well as more importantly within the donor community that is supporting the reforms .
however , transformation of governments is not an easy or a short-term process that can be completed within a few years .
the types of reform underway in africa will take years and maybe generations to make significant progress and this has to be understood and supported by organizations such as the g8 as well as individual donor governments . is the inability of organizations like the g8 to recognize the need for patience a reason why so many initiatives promoted by the rich nations apparently fail in africa ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alan duncan thinks there needs to be more patience with africa all too often , good initiatives are launched and basically abandoned in their infancy as they did not produce the results that had been envisaged within a short time frame and therefore some other “ better or improved ” mechanism for transformation is developed .
if we followed these rules for the international mechanisms that govern the g8 countries then the eu , nato , wto , un would have been abandoned years ago rather than given the continued support and funding that they are , in the knowledge that progress is being made , albeit slowly . how are africans helping themselves ? another positive force for change and development within africa is the increasing economic power and influence of the diaspora within europe and north america that had come over to carry out mainly low paid manual jobs but over time have progressed to increasingly higher skilled and better paid employment .
unlike most other employees within europe that spend most , or in the case of the uk , more than their income every month , the african immigrants remit the majority of their salary to their home country to support their families and communities there . this flow of funds has been growing over the past decade to such an extent that the central bank of ghana estimated that the remittances for 2006 coming from the diaspora was in the region of $ 1 billion .
although most of this money could not be classed as development expenditure in the same sense that money spent on behalf of european donor governments could , it still contributes significantly to the economic development of the recipient country .
when put in perspective , the total contributions for budget support from ten donor countries to ghana in 2006 was estimated at $ 300 million , a sum dwarfed by the remittances from the countries own population . so what is the future of international aid in africa ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helping africa help itself for european donors and institutions to remain relevant and connected to the development and change within africa there needs to be change in the terms of engagement between the various actors .
as i said before , the support given to governments in africa from donors has to change from the short-termism of the present to longer term commitment and continuity of engagement to provide the confidence and respect of the recipient government for the work being undertaken . although difficult for european farmers to accept , the opening of markets for african grown agricultural produce is one of the fastest and most equitable ways of improving the living conditions of people in africa .
the deregulation of agricultural markets in europe need not be a zero sum game , where the gain in africa is a loss in europe .
the improving living conditions and available income in africa gained from this would result in increased demand for consumer goods from europe as well .
sure it will not be european farmers that are producing and selling the consumer goods to africa but this type of structural reform in markets has always been the natural progression of changing markets .

"
this follows the release of a council of europe report . european commission spokesman friso roscam abbing stressed the need " for the member states concerned to conduct impartial investigations to establish the truth . " " indeed , such investigations should be fully carried out as quickly as possible in order to establish responsibility and for the victims to obtain compensation , " he told reporters in brussels . in a report friday , the council of europe said the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- ran secret prisons in poland and romania from 2003 to 2005 to interrogate terror suspects under a program authorized by the two countries ' presidents . both poland and romania have denied the allegations . denials from poland and romania bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : council of europe investigator dick marty according to the report , poland 's former president aleksander kwasniewski had known about the covert cia activities on polish soil . " poland maintains its position on the issue of the alleged cia prisons on the territory of our country - there were no secret bases in poland , " polish foreign ministry spokesperson robert szaniawski was quoted by polish pap news agency friday . szaniawski added that polish officials were waiting for the council of europe to produce more details and evidence to support its claims . " up to now the evidence presented on this issue has been worth very little , " he said . romania has also rejected claims that it held secret prisons . " it is regrettable that the rapporteur thinks romania ' welcomed secret prisons , " the romanian foreign ministry said in a statement . " this report , like the previous one , provides no evidence to confirm these allegations , except for unidentified ' sources , ' whose credibility can not be assessed , " the statement continued . " global spider 's web " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : possibly a covert detention center - mihail kogalniceanu base in romania council of europe investigator dick marty had said in his report that the prisons , in northeast poland and southeast romania , were part of a " global spider 's web " of detentions and illegal transfers spun out around the world by the united states and its allies after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks . marty also suggested that nato and the united states reached a secret deal in 2001 allowing the central intelligence agency to run the covert prisons . liberal democrat members of a european parliamentary committee that studied the issue welcomed marty 's report . committee vice-president sarah ludford , a british mep , said : " we must expose the secret agreements between us intelligence services and some european governments . " bildunterschrift : romanian leaders deny that mihail kogalniceanu airbase hosted a secret prison " these illegal , undemocratic and unacceptable actions must be accounted for and punished , " she said . roscam abbing said that the european commission - the executive arm of the european union - would study their report carefully before deciding whether to take any action against the member states involved . " this is a very serious matter with very , very serious and strong allegations , " he said .
" we intend to discuss the matter further . " in 2005 eu justice and security commissioner franco frattini said that the states concerned could face penalties - including suspension of eu voting rights - if found to have taken part in the secret cia prison system . poland joined the european union in 2004 and romania this year . both also belong to the north atlantic treaty organization . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but activists from a diverse range of groups have criticized the results . at the official conclusion of the three-day meeting on friday , merkel said : " we have made far-reaching decisions on core issues . "
climate protection , globalization and africa were at the center of the summit at the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
the leaders of the world 's wealthiest states agreed to " seriously consider " the goal of having global emissions by 2050 .
but merkel was not successful in getting states to make firm numerical commitments .
the g8 also pledged $ 60 billion -lrb- 44.5 billion euros -rrb- to fight aids , malaria and tuberculosis .
but the declaration did not set out a specific timetable .
gleneagles revisited ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two years ago , g8 leaders made similar pledges on africa .
will they keep them this time ?
in addition to the cash promises to tackle disease , the eight nations broadly reiterated pledges on africa made at the 2005 summit in gleneagles , scotland , when they said they would double development funding by 2010 .
but activist groups have criticized both of the main measures agreed at the summit , which was attended by the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states .
development campaigners complained the g8 leaders had offered little fresh cash for the poor .
pop stars bob geldof and bono , who have committed themselves to publicizing africa 's plight and who had met with merkel ahead of the summit , were extremely dismissive .
pop ambassadors unhappy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bono and geldof 's performance seems to have found more listeners in nearby rostock geldof described the situation as a " farce " and , referring to the g8 leaders as " creeps , " he urged them to " get serious . "
bono said the g8 communiqué on africa was designed to deliberately cloud the issue .
aid agency oxfam also attacked the pledges .
" we must not be distracted by big numbers , " said an oxfam policy adviser .
" what the $ 60 billion headline means at best is just $ 3 billion extra in aid by 2010 . "
environmental groups were also critical of the summit 's achievements .
greenpeace would have preferred eu leaders to have moved ahead on climate change without the backing of the united states .
but the leaders launched the so-called heiligendamm process , a two-year project where the oecd will serve as a mediator for more permanent consultation between the g8 powers and the emerging market economies china , india , brazil , mexico and south africa .
coming closer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heiligendamm marks the start of a new dialogue between g8 and emerging economies issues such as climate protection and common obligations regarding aid to africa are likely to feature in the talks .
" the message is that we can no longer get along without one another , " merkel said .
the g8 also called for a swift conclusion to the doha round of world trade talk and urged all sides to show flexibility to get a deal .
the round has been blighted by differences between the eu and the us over farm trade liberalization and soured disagreements with india and brazil over high industrial tariffs .
on the last day of the summit , leaders made no progress on the question of the future status of the breakaway serbian province of kosovo .
russia opposes independence for the area , which has an ethnic albanian majority .
police defends arrests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police say g8 summit security was the biggest poswar operation for them german police officials meanwhile said that they kept 1,057 violent demonstrators in special detention centres during the g8 summit and were still holding 125 of them friday . police commander knut abramowski said the police strategy had " basically " worked but admitted that he had been caught off-guard by demonstrators swarming through fields to the fence at the heiligendamm compound . he defended the preventive detention of violent protesters saying he had to protect his officers . leftist groups have denounced the conditions in the holding centers and asserted that many inmates were only held for donning the attire of the black block , a loose formation of anarchists and communists in the crowds . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on the final day of the summit , the group of eight wealthiest nations are expected to announce a $ 60 billion -lrb- 44.5 billion euro -rrb- pledge to fight aids , malaria and tuberculosis in africa . summit host german chancellor angela merkel formally announced the agreement friday morning . " we are aware of our responsibilities and we will rise to them , " she said .
" on the other hand , we want to stress that we also have expectations about what should happen in africa . " in the run-up to the summit , merkel had already emphasized the hope that african countries would be stepping up their own efforts to modernize .
this would entail clamping down on corruption , consolidating democracy and strengthening civil society . about half of the sum has already been pledged by the us .
the rest will be paid by the other g8 countries , with some 4 billion euros coming from germany . us president george w. bush - who remained in his hotel suite friday morning on account of a stomach upset - announced the main thrust of the initiative in may . among the heads of the six african nations representing the needs of the poorest continent was south african president thabo mbeki .
the other countries represented were egypt , ghana , algeria , nigeria and ethiopia . wrangling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders did not follow through on pledges made at gleneagles in 2005 the g8 countries wrangled late into thursday night about the finer points of the aid program for africa , with certain countries including italy apparently dragging their feet . broadly , the eight nations have now reiterated pledges made at the 2005 summit in gleneagles , scotland , when they said they would double development funding by 2010 . some campaigners for africa , meanwhile , insist $ 60 billion still falls short of un targets . two leading campaigners , rock stars bono and bob geldof , were in town to put pressure on merkel and her fellow leaders . " the chancellor has asked us to trust her and we are tempted , but we can not risk being let down by the g8 again , " bono was quoted by reuters as saying . on friday , merkel said that progress on the aid program would be monitored at the next g8 meeting in japan set to take place in a year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are two central elements in the climate accord that will be officially presented this friday : one , the necessity to ' decisively ' reduce greenhouse gases .
the other one - which marks the real political success of the summit - is that once the kyoto protocol -lrb- which the us has never ratified -rrb- expires in 2012 , the framework for combating climate change will be under the auspices of the united nations .
it was difficult to achieve anything more at the summit with such deep divisions among leaders over the issue - the europeans , with the support of japan and canada , on the one hand , and the americans and russians on the other . "
france 's libération took a much tougher approach .
" just like at the un , at the g8 the devil is in the details .
president george w. bush , as head of the largest polluting country in the world , did not want binding commitments for reducing co2 emissions .
he did not give in .
the climate accord does outline that which was so precious to the europeans : a 50 percent reduction by 2050 , but it merely says that should ' be considered . '
the accord lacks any firm commitment whatsoever .
it is a compromise that lets everyone at the summit save face . -lrb- … -rrb- no one admitted it , but some people surely thought quite clearly : this compromise is a bet on the near future , one in which people are placing a lot of hope - a new era for the climate simply called " the period after bush . "

" there are two central elements in the climate accord that will be officially presented this friday : one , the necessity to ' decisively ' reduce greenhouse gases .
the other one - which marks the real political success of the summit - is that once the kyoto protocol -lrb- which the us has never ratified -rrb- expires in 2012 , the framework for combating climate change will be under the auspices of the united nations .
it was difficult to achieve anything more at the summit with such deep divisions among leaders over the issue - the europeans , with the support of japan and canada , on the one hand , and the americans and russians on the other . "
france 's libération took a much tougher approach .
" just like at the un , at the g8 the devil is in the details .
president george w. bush , as head of the largest polluting country in the world , did not want binding commitments for reducing co2 emissions .
he did not give in .
the climate accord does outline that which was so precious to the europeans : a 50 percent reduction by 2050 , but it merely says that should ' be considered . '
the accord lacks any firm commitment whatsoever .
it is a compromise that lets everyone at the summit save face . -lrb- … -rrb- no one admitted it , but some people surely thought quite clearly : this compromise is a bet on the near future , one in which people are placing a lot of hope - a new era for the climate simply called " the period after bush . "
switzerland 's tages-anzeiger agreed .
" what the powerful -lrb- … -rrb- are selling as a success is primarily a way for them to save face : thanks to non-binding agreements , host chancellor angela merkel does not have to stand there empty-handed .

is either of these views close to the reality on the ground in africa ? africa is changing and changing for the better in more ways than is apparent to the outside observer at times .
it ’ s easy to look at the problematic elections in nigeria , the violent land clearance and slum destruction in zimbabwe or the continuing civilian deaths in the democratic republic of congo and see only regression and destruction on the continent .
media pictures , both outside africa as well as within , place very little emphasis on the positive developments that have taken place .
there are clearly a number of major issues within the continent that continue to hinder individual countries ' economic and political growth , such as the continued single party despotic rule in a number of governments .
however , these situations are becoming the exception rather than the rule in africa .
a growing number of countries have transformed from the picture of the octogenarian clinging onto power , changing constitutions or disregarding them completely to secure continued power to one of peaceful handover of civil rule through , although sometimes flawed , democratic processes . what has changed to create this embryonic empowerment ? economic growth in sectors outside of the traditional agricultural environment continues to expand in large swathes of east and southern africa , most of which is fuelled by inward investment that was in the past either tied up in highly lucrative government bonds or denied access and opportunities to invest through uncertain political and investment conditions which are being addressed by the new bread of governments that are taking over .
there is clearly still significant change that is required both politically and economically within the continent to allow for the full participation of the population within the countries .
however , the change that has happened should be recognized and rewarded .
it should also be recognized that this change is also largely home grown and driven by an increasingly politically sophisticated electorate demanding change within their own governments . some of the changes that have occurred in the recent years in african economic and political growth have been directly influenced by donor pressure and support to the programs of change and development within the region .
however , change in the magnitude of reform that is required and is developing , requires long term support and commitment both within the country implementing the changes as well as more importantly within the donor community that is supporting the reforms .
however , transformation of governments is not an easy or a short-term process that can be completed within a few years .
the types of reform underway in africa will take years and maybe generations to make significant progress and this has to be understood and supported by organizations such as the g8 as well as individual donor governments . is the inability of organizations like the g8 to recognize the need for patience a reason why so many initiatives promoted by the rich nations apparently fail in africa ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alan duncan thinks there needs to be more patience with africa all too often , good initiatives are launched and basically abandoned in their infancy as they did not produce the results that had been envisaged within a short time frame and therefore some other “ better or improved ” mechanism for transformation is developed .
if we followed these rules for the international mechanisms that govern the g8 countries then the eu , nato , wto , un would have been abandoned years ago rather than given the continued support and funding that they are , in the knowledge that progress is being made , albeit slowly . how are africans helping themselves ? another positive force for change and development within africa is the increasing economic power and influence of the diaspora within europe and north america that had come over to carry out mainly low paid manual jobs but over time have progressed to increasingly higher skilled and better paid employment .
unlike most other employees within europe that spend most , or in the case of the uk , more than their income every month , the african immigrants remit the majority of their salary to their home country to support their families and communities there . this flow of funds has been growing over the past decade to such an extent that the central bank of ghana estimated that the remittances for 2006 coming from the diaspora was in the region of $ 1 billion .
although most of this money could not be classed as development expenditure in the same sense that money spent on behalf of european donor governments could , it still contributes significantly to the economic development of the recipient country .
when put in perspective , the total contributions for budget support from ten donor countries to ghana in 2006 was estimated at $ 300 million , a sum dwarfed by the remittances from the countries own population . so what is the future of international aid in africa ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helping africa help itself for european donors and institutions to remain relevant and connected to the development and change within africa there needs to be change in the terms of engagement between the various actors .
as i said before , the support given to governments in africa from donors has to change from the short-termism of the present to longer term commitment and continuity of engagement to provide the confidence and respect of the recipient government for the work being undertaken . although difficult for european farmers to accept , the opening of markets for african grown agricultural produce is one of the fastest and most equitable ways of improving the living conditions of people in africa .
the deregulation of agricultural markets in europe need not be a zero sum game , where the gain in africa is a loss in europe .
the improving living conditions and available income in africa gained from this would result in increased demand for consumer goods from europe as well .
sure it will not be european farmers that are producing and selling the consumer goods to africa but this type of structural reform in markets has always been the natural progression of changing markets .
what is stopping this structural change at the moment is the protectionism of the eu and north america which is restricting the natural progression of economic activity within the world and drastically distorting markets to the detriment of all . alan duncan is a project coordinator for economic consultants kpmg east africa in southern sudan .
he has coordinated several international aid projects in the refugee camps spread throughout the war-torn region , sometimes under fire from both government and rebel forces .
he currently works as a consultant for the kenyan government ’ s finance ministry . alan duncan was interviewed by nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are two central elements in the climate accord that will be officially presented this friday : one , the necessity to ' decisively ' reduce greenhouse gases .
the other one - which marks the real political success of the summit - is that once the kyoto protocol -lrb- which the us has never ratified -rrb- expires in 2012 , the framework for combating climate change will be under the auspices of the united nations .
it was difficult to achieve anything more at the summit with such deep divisions among leaders over the issue - the europeans , with the support of japan and canada , on the one hand , and the americans and russians on the other . "
france 's libération took a much tougher approach .
" just like at the un , at the g8 the devil is in the details .
president george w. bush , as head of the largest polluting country in the world , did not want binding commitments for reducing co2 emissions .
he did not give in .
the climate accord does outline that which was so precious to the europeans : a 50 percent reduction by 2050 , but it merely says that should ' be considered . '
the accord lacks any firm commitment whatsoever .
it is a compromise that lets everyone at the summit save face . -lrb- … -rrb- no one admitted it , but some people surely thought quite clearly : this compromise is a bet on the near future , one in which people are placing a lot of hope - a new era for the climate simply called " the period after bush .

" what the powerful -lrb- … -rrb- are selling as a success is primarily a way for them to save face : thanks to non-binding agreements , host chancellor angela merkel does not have to stand there empty-handed .
bush 's willingness after all to work together on a treaty to succeed the kyoto protocol , under the auspices of the un , keeps him from looking like the bad guy .
it is a weak signal , however , for the uno environment conference at the end of the year in bali . -lrb- … -rrb- merkel overestimated her global-political influence in the climate protection arena . "
austria 's die presse said that g8 success on the climate was limited .

if we followed these rules for the international mechanisms that govern the g8 countries then the eu , nato , wto , un would have been abandoned years ago rather than given the continued support and funding that they are , in the knowledge that progress is being made , albeit slowly . how are africans helping themselves ? another positive force for change and development within africa is the increasing economic power and influence of the diaspora within europe and north america that had come over to carry out mainly low paid manual jobs but over time have progressed to increasingly higher skilled and better paid employment .
unlike most other employees within europe that spend most , or in the case of the uk , more than their income every month , the african immigrants remit the majority of their salary to their home country to support their families and communities there . this flow of funds has been growing over the past decade to such an extent that the central bank of ghana estimated that the remittances for 2006 coming from the diaspora was in the region of $ 1 billion .
although most of this money could not be classed as development expenditure in the same sense that money spent on behalf of european donor governments could , it still contributes significantly to the economic development of the recipient country .
when put in perspective , the total contributions for budget support from ten donor countries to ghana in 2006 was estimated at $ 300 million , a sum dwarfed by the remittances from the countries own population . so what is the future of international aid in africa ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helping africa help itself for european donors and institutions to remain relevant and connected to the development and change within africa there needs to be change in the terms of engagement between the various actors .
as i said before , the support given to governments in africa from donors has to change from the short-termism of the present to longer term commitment and continuity of engagement to provide the confidence and respect of the recipient government for the work being undertaken . although difficult for european farmers to accept , the opening of markets for african grown agricultural produce is one of the fastest and most equitable ways of improving the living conditions of people in africa .
the deregulation of agricultural markets in europe need not be a zero sum game , where the gain in africa is a loss in europe .
the improving living conditions and available income in africa gained from this would result in increased demand for consumer goods from europe as well .
sure it will not be european farmers that are producing and selling the consumer goods to africa but this type of structural reform in markets has always been the natural progression of changing markets .

it ’ s easy to look at the problematic elections in nigeria , the violent land clearance and slum destruction in zimbabwe or the continuing civilian deaths in the democratic republic of congo and see only regression and destruction on the continent .

there is clearly still significant change that is required both politically and economically within the continent to allow for the full participation of the population within the countries .
however , the change that has happened should be recognized and rewarded .
it should also be recognized that this change is also largely home grown and driven by an increasingly politically sophisticated electorate demanding change within their own governments . some of the changes that have occurred in the recent years in african economic and political growth have been directly influenced by donor pressure and support to the programs of change and development within the region .

but the world 's richest nations - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states and russia - have so far spectacularly failed to find a common line on the issue .
the lack of consensus was apparent again in a declaration released on the second day of the three-day summit of g8 leaders in this baltic coast resort , where germany 's goals were effectively swept under the carpet .
" we discussed recent developments in global financial markets , including hedge funds , " the text said .
highly speculative hedge funds are highly speculative and aggressive investment instruments that are estimated to manage close to one and a half trillion dollars in assets worldwide .
an estimated 9,000 such funds are currently in operation , most of them based in the us and britain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister steinbrück has discussed hedge funds before berlin fears a possible domino effect should one of the big funds fail .
but it has been gradually forced to scale back its ambitions for increased transparency and more disclosure in the sector in the face of fierce resistance , particularly from britain , the united states and japan .
in their declaration on thursday , the g8 members said that hedge funds had " contributed significantly to the efficiency of the financial system . "
complex risks nevertheless , " the assessment of potential systemic and operational risks associated with these activities has become more complex and challenging , " the statement continued .
" given the strong growth of the hedge fund industry and the increasing complexity of the instruments they trade , we reaffirm the need to be vigilant . "
the g8 said it " welcomed " a specially commissioned report compiled for the g8 by the so-called financial stability forum which recommended the industry " review and enhance existing sound practice benchmarks . "
and the grouping said it also welcomed " that the fsf will report to finance ministers as from october of this year on the progress and actions taken in respect of these recommendations . " dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de outlook is bleak for big strides on climate issues germany 's agenda for the g8 summit ranges from africa and trade to hedge funds , relations with russia , the middle east and kosovo .
but it is the climate that is getting the most heat .
-lrb- 06.06.2007 -rrb- experts : globalization improves , does n't worsen peoples ' lives proponents of globalization say that free trade and open markets mean more prosperity for the world 's population .
at issue is how to make globalization work better for poor countries than is the case right now .

" there are two central elements in the climate accord that will be officially presented this friday : one , the necessity to ' decisively ' reduce greenhouse gases .
the other one - which marks the real political success of the summit - is that once the kyoto protocol -lrb- which the us has never ratified -rrb- expires in 2012 , the framework for combating climate change will be under the auspices of the united nations .
it was difficult to achieve anything more at the summit with such deep divisions among leaders over the issue - the europeans , with the support of japan and canada , on the one hand , and the americans and russians on the other . "
france 's libération took a much tougher approach .
" just like at the un , at the g8 the devil is in the details .
president george w. bush , as head of the largest polluting country in the world , did not want binding commitments for reducing co2 emissions .
he did not give in .
the climate accord does outline that which was so precious to the europeans : a 50 percent reduction by 2050 , but it merely says that should ' be considered . '
the accord lacks any firm commitment whatsoever .
it is a compromise that lets everyone at the summit save face . -lrb- … -rrb- no one admitted it , but some people surely thought quite clearly : this compromise is a bet on the near future , one in which people are placing a lot of hope - a new era for the climate simply called " the period after bush . "
switzerland 's tages-anzeiger agreed .
" what the powerful -lrb- … -rrb- are selling as a success is primarily a way for them to save face : thanks to non-binding agreements , host chancellor angela merkel does not have to stand there empty-handed .
bush 's willingness after all to work together on a treaty to succeed the kyoto protocol , under the auspices of the un , keeps him from looking like the bad guy .
it is a weak signal , however , for the uno environment conference at the end of the year in bali . -lrb- … -rrb- merkel overestimated her global-political influence in the climate protection arena . "
austria 's die presse said that g8 success on the climate was limited .
" it -lrb- the accord -rrb- could not exactly be called the breakthrough of the century .
greenpeace activists - the self-proclaimed guardians of the environment - reacted promptly when they called the outcome of the climate talks " far too little . "
at the baltic sea resort heiligendamm , the absolute claims of starry-eyed idealists once again clashed with the sober pragmatism of world leaders representing their own national interestss .
coming to an agreement is normally next to impossible in situations like that .
that was also evident after chancellor merkel 's talk with bono and bob geldof .
bono apparently became depressed because merkel did not agree to enough aid for africa .
as if g8 leaders should beckon to the calls of rock stars .
smart rock stars always say politics is not their business .
but smart politicians should also avoid selling vague declarations of intent as major steps . "
germany 's financial times deutschland put it succintly : " in terms of chancellor merkel 's own high expectations about climate talks at the summit , she has failed .

but the world 's richest nations - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states and russia - have so far spectacularly failed to find a common line on the issue .
the lack of consensus was apparent again in a declaration released on the second day of the three-day summit of g8 leaders in this baltic coast resort , where germany 's goals were effectively swept under the carpet .
" we discussed recent developments in global financial markets , including hedge funds , " the text said .
highly speculative hedge funds are highly speculative and aggressive investment instruments that are estimated to manage close to one and a half trillion dollars in assets worldwide .
an estimated 9,000 such funds are currently in operation , most of them based in the us and britain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister steinbrück has discussed hedge funds before berlin fears a possible domino effect should one of the big funds fail .
but it has been gradually forced to scale back its ambitions for increased transparency and more disclosure in the sector in the face of fierce resistance , particularly from britain , the united states and japan .
in their declaration on thursday , the g8 members said that hedge funds had " contributed significantly to the efficiency of the financial system . "
complex risks nevertheless , " the assessment of potential systemic and operational risks associated with these activities has become more complex and challenging , " the statement continued .
" given the strong growth of the hedge fund industry and the increasing complexity of the instruments they trade , we reaffirm the need to be vigilant . "
the g8 said it " welcomed " a specially commissioned report compiled for the g8 by the so-called financial stability forum which recommended the industry " review and enhance existing sound practice benchmarks . "
and the grouping said it also welcomed " that the fsf will report to finance ministers as from october of this year on the progress and actions taken in respect of these recommendations .

is either of these views close to the reality on the ground in africa ? africa is changing and changing for the better in more ways than is apparent to the outside observer at times .
it ’ s easy to look at the problematic elections in nigeria , the violent land clearance and slum destruction in zimbabwe or the continuing civilian deaths in the democratic republic of congo and see only regression and destruction on the continent .
media pictures , both outside africa as well as within , place very little emphasis on the positive developments that have taken place .
there are clearly a number of major issues within the continent that continue to hinder individual countries ' economic and political growth , such as the continued single party despotic rule in a number of governments .
however , these situations are becoming the exception rather than the rule in africa .
a growing number of countries have transformed from the picture of the octogenarian clinging onto power , changing constitutions or disregarding them completely to secure continued power to one of peaceful handover of civil rule through , although sometimes flawed , democratic processes . what has changed to create this embryonic empowerment ? economic growth in sectors outside of the traditional agricultural environment continues to expand in large swathes of east and southern africa , most of which is fuelled by inward investment that was in the past either tied up in highly lucrative government bonds or denied access and opportunities to invest through uncertain political and investment conditions which are being addressed by the new bread of governments that are taking over .
there is clearly still significant change that is required both politically and economically within the continent to allow for the full participation of the population within the countries .
however , the change that has happened should be recognized and rewarded .
it should also be recognized that this change is also largely home grown and driven by an increasingly politically sophisticated electorate demanding change within their own governments . some of the changes that have occurred in the recent years in african economic and political growth have been directly influenced by donor pressure and support to the programs of change and development within the region .
however , change in the magnitude of reform that is required and is developing , requires long term support and commitment both within the country implementing the changes as well as more importantly within the donor community that is supporting the reforms .
however , transformation of governments is not an easy or a short-term process that can be completed within a few years .
the types of reform underway in africa will take years and maybe generations to make significant progress and this has to be understood and supported by organizations such as the g8 as well as individual donor governments . is the inability of organizations like the g8 to recognize the need for patience a reason why so many initiatives promoted by the rich nations apparently fail in africa ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alan duncan thinks there needs to be more patience with africa all too often , good initiatives are launched and basically abandoned in their infancy as they did not produce the results that had been envisaged within a short time frame and therefore some other “ better or improved ” mechanism for transformation is developed .
if we followed these rules for the international mechanisms that govern the g8 countries then the eu , nato , wto , un would have been abandoned years ago rather than given the continued support and funding that they are , in the knowledge that progress is being made , albeit slowly . how are africans helping themselves ? another positive force for change and development within africa is the increasing economic power and influence of the diaspora within europe and north america that had come over to carry out mainly low paid manual jobs but over time have progressed to increasingly higher skilled and better paid employment .
unlike most other employees within europe that spend most , or in the case of the uk , more than their income every month , the african immigrants remit the majority of their salary to their home country to support their families and communities there . this flow of funds has been growing over the past decade to such an extent that the central bank of ghana estimated that the remittances for 2006 coming from the diaspora was in the region of $ 1 billion .
although most of this money could not be classed as development expenditure in the same sense that money spent on behalf of european donor governments could , it still contributes significantly to the economic development of the recipient country .
when put in perspective , the total contributions for budget support from ten donor countries to ghana in 2006 was estimated at $ 300 million , a sum dwarfed by the remittances from the countries own population . so what is the future of international aid in africa ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helping africa help itself for european donors and institutions to remain relevant and connected to the development and change within africa there needs to be change in the terms of engagement between the various actors .
as i said before , the support given to governments in africa from donors has to change from the short-termism of the present to longer term commitment and continuity of engagement to provide the confidence and respect of the recipient government for the work being undertaken . although difficult for european farmers to accept , the opening of markets for african grown agricultural produce is one of the fastest and most equitable ways of improving the living conditions of people in africa .
the deregulation of agricultural markets in europe need not be a zero sum game , where the gain in africa is a loss in europe .
the improving living conditions and available income in africa gained from this would result in increased demand for consumer goods from europe as well .
sure it will not be european farmers that are producing and selling the consumer goods to africa but this type of structural reform in markets has always been the natural progression of changing markets .

but the world 's richest nations - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states and russia - have so far spectacularly failed to find a common line on the issue .
the lack of consensus was apparent again in a declaration released on the second day of the three-day summit of g8 leaders in this baltic coast resort , where germany 's goals were effectively swept under the carpet .
" we discussed recent developments in global financial markets , including hedge funds , " the text said .
highly speculative hedge funds are highly speculative and aggressive investment instruments that are estimated to manage close to one and a half trillion dollars in assets worldwide .
an estimated 9,000 such funds are currently in operation , most of them based in the us and britain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister steinbrück has discussed hedge funds before berlin fears a possible domino effect should one of the big funds fail .
but it has been gradually forced to scale back its ambitions for increased transparency and more disclosure in the sector in the face of fierce resistance , particularly from britain , the united states and japan .
in their declaration on thursday , the g8 members said that hedge funds had " contributed significantly to the efficiency of the financial system . "
complex risks nevertheless , " the assessment of potential systemic and operational risks associated with these activities has become more complex and challenging , " the statement continued .
" given the strong growth of the hedge fund industry and the increasing complexity of the instruments they trade , we reaffirm the need to be vigilant . "
the g8 said it " welcomed " a specially commissioned report compiled for the g8 by the so-called financial stability forum which recommended the industry " review and enhance existing sound practice benchmarks . "

" there are two central elements in the climate accord that will be officially presented this friday : one , the necessity to ' decisively ' reduce greenhouse gases .
the other one - which marks the real political success of the summit - is that once the kyoto protocol -lrb- which the us has never ratified -rrb- expires in 2012 , the framework for combating climate change will be under the auspices of the united nations .
it was difficult to achieve anything more at the summit with such deep divisions among leaders over the issue - the europeans , with the support of japan and canada , on the one hand , and the americans and russians on the other . "
france 's libération took a much tougher approach .
" just like at the un , at the g8 the devil is in the details .
president george w. bush , as head of the largest polluting country in the world , did not want binding commitments for reducing co2 emissions .
he did not give in .
the climate accord does outline that which was so precious to the europeans : a 50 percent reduction by 2050 , but it merely says that should ' be considered . '
the accord lacks any firm commitment whatsoever .
it is a compromise that lets everyone at the summit save face . -lrb- … -rrb- no one admitted it , but some people surely thought quite clearly : this compromise is a bet on the near future , one in which people are placing a lot of hope - a new era for the climate simply called " the period after bush . "
switzerland 's tages-anzeiger agreed .
" what the powerful -lrb- … -rrb- are selling as a success is primarily a way for them to save face : thanks to non-binding agreements , host chancellor angela merkel does not have to stand there empty-handed .
bush 's willingness after all to work together on a treaty to succeed the kyoto protocol , under the auspices of the un , keeps him from looking like the bad guy .
it is a weak signal , however , for the uno environment conference at the end of the year in bali . -lrb- … -rrb- merkel overestimated her global-political influence in the climate protection arena . "
austria 's die presse said that g8 success on the climate was limited .
" it -lrb- the accord -rrb- could not exactly be called the breakthrough of the century .
greenpeace activists - the self-proclaimed guardians of the environment - reacted promptly when they called the outcome of the climate talks " far too little . "
at the baltic sea resort heiligendamm , the absolute claims of starry-eyed idealists once again clashed with the sober pragmatism of world leaders representing their own national interestss .
coming to an agreement is normally next to impossible in situations like that .
that was also evident after chancellor merkel 's talk with bono and bob geldof .
bono apparently became depressed because merkel did not agree to enough aid for africa .
as if g8 leaders should beckon to the calls of rock stars .
smart rock stars always say politics is not their business .
but smart politicians should also avoid selling vague declarations of intent as major steps . "
germany 's financial times deutschland put it succintly : " in terms of chancellor merkel 's own high expectations about climate talks at the summit , she has failed .
but in terms of what was realistic , she has succeeded at the meeting of world leaders in heiligendamm . " dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in any case , the residents of bamberg are the most content with their city , concluded a survey .
bamberg also made the unesco world heritage list in 1993 . according to a survey conducted by a german magazine , bamberg is the " dream city " of many germans .
citizens in 115 german cities were asked to assess the place where they live , and it was the people of bamberg who claimed to be the most content with their city .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de cities -pipe- 08.06.2007 bamberg : where the people are happiest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamberg 's old town was added to unesco 's world heritage list in 1993 is it the medieval architecture or its nine types of local beer ?
in any case , the residents of bamberg are the most content with their city , concluded a survey .
bamberg also made the unesco world heritage list in 1993 . according to a survey conducted by a german magazine , bamberg is the " dream city " of many germans .
citizens in 115 german cities were asked to assess the place where they live , and it was the people of bamberg who claimed to be the most content with their city .
nowhere else in germany did those surveyed identify more with their city than the residents of this northern bavarian town . its majestic baroque flair , the two branches of the regnitz river meandering through the city , the blend of mountain and valley landscapes - all this makes bamberg so appealing . the city is marked by the past in a way few other german cities are .
its " golden age " - when bamberg 's local bishop was named pope - may have been a long time ago , but for true bamberg natives , those events are still part of today . unesco also recognized bamberg 's historical value and placed the completely intact old portion of the city on its world heritage list in 1993 . rome of franconia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamberg was once the seat of the catholic church what do bamberg and rome have in common ?
like rome , bamberg was built atop seven hills .
it was also a powerful seat of the catholic church for centuries . the " golden " age of the city began in the year 1007 , when kaiser heinrich ii established a diocese in bamberg for converting the people in the eastern part of his empire to christianity .
he also built an imperial palace and an impressive cathedral , which later caught fire . bamberg became a rich and powerful city , as well as a meeting place for princes and arch-bishops - so much so that kaiser heinrich ii named bamberg " rome of franconia .

dw-world.de talked to one of the world 's leading beer experts about the appeal of the cologne speciality . think of americans in germany and beer , and you 'd probably think of package holiday makers braving the sloshed masses at munich 's oktoberfest . but a local cologne newspaper , the kölner stadt-anzeiger , is reporting increasing numbers of us tourists haunting the city 's bars with copies of the new york times in their hands - this after the times travel section ran a piece raving about the local beer , kölsch . what makes kölsch different from the familiar lager beer drunk in most other places in germany ?
the question is one that puzzles even michael jackson , the award-winning author of " the world guide to beer " and the host of the bbc tv show " the beer hunter . " " other than saying it 's a top-fermented version of a pilsner , it 's difficult to explain , " jackson told dw-world .
" kölsch is teasingly delicate but also elusive . " like a classic german beer daydreaming that it 's a glass of champagne ? " yeah , " jackson said .
" i think that 's a pretty good way of putting it . " a local treat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kölsch is served in special tall glasses to preserve freshness the microbrewery movement that 's radically changed american and british drinking habits in the past two decades has n't caught on in germany , where most people prefer to stick with standard , albeit high-quality , lagers and wheat beers . if tourists want to try beer styles not widely available outside germany , they need to look in specific local regions .
that 's down to history .
the development of kölsch , for instance , was an innovative reaction to the growing industrialization of beer brewing in the mid-nineteenth century . " it 's like the brewers in cologne said : ' we want to stay as we are , so we 'd better define and protect a cologne style of beer , " ' jackson said . kölsch , then , was the result of something like a microbrewery movement during the industrial revolution .
and päffgen , früh and other cologne breweries have stayed true to that original idea . a registered name bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to cologne often ca n't resist the idea of just one more beer part of kölsch 's appeal may be that american microbrewers have never succeeded in copying it . " american brewers are fantastic , but they 've never gotten kölsch quite right , " jackson said , and even if they had , they would n't be allowed to use the name .
by international agreement , the word " kölsch " - like the terms " cognac " or " champagne " - is reserved for products made in and around cologne . that 's one more reason to travel to germany 's fourth-largest city and one of its few centers of alternative beer brewing . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on the final day of the summit , the group of eight wealthiest nations are expected to announce a $ 60 billion -lrb- 44.5 billion euro -rrb- pledge to fight aids , malaria and tuberculosis in africa . summit host german chancellor angela merkel formally announced the agreement friday morning . " we are aware of our responsibilities and we will rise to them , " she said .
" on the other hand , we want to stress that we also have expectations about what should happen in africa . " in the run-up to the summit , merkel had already emphasized the hope that african countries would be stepping up their own efforts to modernize .
this would entail clamping down on corruption , consolidating democracy and strengthening civil society . about half of the sum has already been pledged by the us .
the rest will be paid by the other g8 countries , with some 4 billion euros coming from germany . us president george w. bush - who remained in his hotel suite friday morning on account of a stomach upset - announced the main thrust of the initiative in may . among the heads of the six african nations representing the needs of the poorest continent was south african president thabo mbeki .
the other countries represented were egypt , ghana , algeria , nigeria and ethiopia . wrangling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders did not follow through on pledges made at gleneagles in 2005 the g8 countries wrangled late into thursday night about the finer points of the aid program for africa , with certain countries including italy apparently dragging their feet . broadly , the eight nations have now reiterated pledges made at the 2005 summit in gleneagles , scotland , when they said they would double development funding by 2010 . some campaigners for africa , meanwhile , insist $ 60 billion still falls short of un targets . two leading campaigners , rock stars bono and bob geldof , were in town to put pressure on merkel and her fellow leaders . " the chancellor has asked us to trust her and we are tempted , but we can not risk being let down by the g8 again , " bono was quoted by reuters as saying . on friday , merkel said that progress on the aid program would be monitored at the next g8 meeting in japan set to take place in a year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on the final day of the summit , the group of eight wealthiest nations are expected to announce a $ 60 billion -lrb- 44.5 billion euro -rrb- pledge to fight aids , malaria and tuberculosis in africa . summit host german chancellor angela merkel formally announced the agreement friday morning . " we are aware of our responsibilities and we will rise to them , " she said .
" on the other hand , we want to stress that we also have expectations about what should happen in africa . " in the run-up to the summit , merkel had already emphasized the hope that african countries would be stepping up their own efforts to modernize .
this would entail clamping down on corruption , consolidating democracy and strengthening civil society . about half of the sum has already been pledged by the us .
the rest will be paid by the other g8 countries , with some 4 billion euros coming from germany . us president george w. bush - who remained in his hotel suite friday morning on account of a stomach upset - announced the main thrust of the initiative in may . among the heads of the six african nations representing the needs of the poorest continent was south african president thabo mbeki .
the other countries represented were egypt , ghana , algeria , nigeria and ethiopia . wrangling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders did not follow through on pledges made at gleneagles in 2005 the g8 countries wrangled late into thursday night about the finer points of the aid program for africa , with certain countries including italy apparently dragging their feet . broadly , the eight nations have now reiterated pledges made at the 2005 summit in gleneagles , scotland , when they said they would double development funding by 2010 . some campaigners for africa , meanwhile , insist $ 60 billion still falls short of un targets . two leading campaigners , rock stars bono and bob geldof , were in town to put pressure on merkel and her fellow leaders . " the chancellor has asked us to trust her and we are tempted , but we can not risk being let down by the g8 again , " bono was quoted by reuters as saying . on friday , merkel said that progress on the aid program would be monitored at the next g8 meeting in japan set to take place in a year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the world 's richest nations - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states and russia - have so far spectacularly failed to find a common line on the issue .
the lack of consensus was apparent again in a declaration released on the second day of the three-day summit of g8 leaders in this baltic coast resort , where germany 's goals were effectively swept under the carpet .
" we discussed recent developments in global financial markets , including hedge funds , " the text said .
highly speculative hedge funds are highly speculative and aggressive investment instruments that are estimated to manage close to one and a half trillion dollars in assets worldwide .
an estimated 9,000 such funds are currently in operation , most of them based in the us and britain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister steinbrück has discussed hedge funds before berlin fears a possible domino effect should one of the big funds fail .
but it has been gradually forced to scale back its ambitions for increased transparency and more disclosure in the sector in the face of fierce resistance , particularly from britain , the united states and japan .
in their declaration on thursday , the g8 members said that hedge funds had " contributed significantly to the efficiency of the financial system . "
complex risks nevertheless , " the assessment of potential systemic and operational risks associated with these activities has become more complex and challenging , " the statement continued .
" given the strong growth of the hedge fund industry and the increasing complexity of the instruments they trade , we reaffirm the need to be vigilant . "
the g8 said it " welcomed " a specially commissioned report compiled for the g8 by the so-called financial stability forum which recommended the industry " review and enhance existing sound practice benchmarks . "
and the grouping said it also welcomed " that the fsf will report to finance ministers as from october of this year on the progress and actions taken in respect of these recommendations . " dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de outlook is bleak for big strides on climate issues germany 's agenda for the g8 summit ranges from africa and trade to hedge funds , relations with russia , the middle east and kosovo .
but it is the climate that is getting the most heat .
-lrb- 06.06.2007 -rrb- experts : globalization improves , does n't worsen peoples ' lives proponents of globalization say that free trade and open markets mean more prosperity for the world 's population .
at issue is how to make globalization work better for poor countries than is the case right now .
-lrb- 04.06.2007 -rrb- g8 still poles apart on hedge fund regulation the g8 showed no sign friday of moving any closer to a consensus on the hotly debated issue of regulation of hedge funds , a matter which lies particularly close to the heart of the g8 's current host , germany .

but the world 's richest nations - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states and russia - have so far spectacularly failed to find a common line on the issue .
the lack of consensus was apparent again in a declaration released on the second day of the three-day summit of g8 leaders in this baltic coast resort , where germany 's goals were effectively swept under the carpet .
" we discussed recent developments in global financial markets , including hedge funds , " the text said .
highly speculative hedge funds are highly speculative and aggressive investment instruments that are estimated to manage close to one and a half trillion dollars in assets worldwide .
an estimated 9,000 such funds are currently in operation , most of them based in the us and britain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister steinbrück has discussed hedge funds before berlin fears a possible domino effect should one of the big funds fail .
but it has been gradually forced to scale back its ambitions for increased transparency and more disclosure in the sector in the face of fierce resistance , particularly from britain , the united states and japan .
in their declaration on thursday , the g8 members said that hedge funds had " contributed significantly to the efficiency of the financial system . "
complex risks nevertheless , " the assessment of potential systemic and operational risks associated with these activities has become more complex and challenging , " the statement continued .
" given the strong growth of the hedge fund industry and the increasing complexity of the instruments they trade , we reaffirm the need to be vigilant . "
the g8 said it " welcomed " a specially commissioned report compiled for the g8 by the so-called financial stability forum which recommended the industry " review and enhance existing sound practice benchmarks . "

is either of these views close to the reality on the ground in africa ? africa is changing and changing for the better in more ways than is apparent to the outside observer at times .
it ’ s easy to look at the problematic elections in nigeria , the violent land clearance and slum destruction in zimbabwe or the continuing civilian deaths in the democratic republic of congo and see only regression and destruction on the continent .
media pictures , both outside africa as well as within , place very little emphasis on the positive developments that have taken place .
there are clearly a number of major issues within the continent that continue to hinder individual countries ' economic and political growth , such as the continued single party despotic rule in a number of governments .
however , these situations are becoming the exception rather than the rule in africa .
a growing number of countries have transformed from the picture of the octogenarian clinging onto power , changing constitutions or disregarding them completely to secure continued power to one of peaceful handover of civil rule through , although sometimes flawed , democratic processes . what has changed to create this embryonic empowerment ? economic growth in sectors outside of the traditional agricultural environment continues to expand in large swathes of east and southern africa , most of which is fuelled by inward investment that was in the past either tied up in highly lucrative government bonds or denied access and opportunities to invest through uncertain political and investment conditions which are being addressed by the new bread of governments that are taking over .
there is clearly still significant change that is required both politically and economically within the continent to allow for the full participation of the population within the countries .
however , the change that has happened should be recognized and rewarded .
it should also be recognized that this change is also largely home grown and driven by an increasingly politically sophisticated electorate demanding change within their own governments . some of the changes that have occurred in the recent years in african economic and political growth have been directly influenced by donor pressure and support to the programs of change and development within the region .
however , change in the magnitude of reform that is required and is developing , requires long term support and commitment both within the country implementing the changes as well as more importantly within the donor community that is supporting the reforms .
however , transformation of governments is not an easy or a short-term process that can be completed within a few years .
the types of reform underway in africa will take years and maybe generations to make significant progress and this has to be understood and supported by organizations such as the g8 as well as individual donor governments . is the inability of organizations like the g8 to recognize the need for patience a reason why so many initiatives promoted by the rich nations apparently fail in africa ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alan duncan thinks there needs to be more patience with africa all too often , good initiatives are launched and basically abandoned in their infancy as they did not produce the results that had been envisaged within a short time frame and therefore some other “ better or improved ” mechanism for transformation is developed .
if we followed these rules for the international mechanisms that govern the g8 countries then the eu , nato , wto , un would have been abandoned years ago rather than given the continued support and funding that they are , in the knowledge that progress is being made , albeit slowly . how are africans helping themselves ? another positive force for change and development within africa is the increasing economic power and influence of the diaspora within europe and north america that had come over to carry out mainly low paid manual jobs but over time have progressed to increasingly higher skilled and better paid employment .
unlike most other employees within europe that spend most , or in the case of the uk , more than their income every month , the african immigrants remit the majority of their salary to their home country to support their families and communities there . this flow of funds has been growing over the past decade to such an extent that the central bank of ghana estimated that the remittances for 2006 coming from the diaspora was in the region of $ 1 billion .
although most of this money could not be classed as development expenditure in the same sense that money spent on behalf of european donor governments could , it still contributes significantly to the economic development of the recipient country .
when put in perspective , the total contributions for budget support from ten donor countries to ghana in 2006 was estimated at $ 300 million , a sum dwarfed by the remittances from the countries own population . so what is the future of international aid in africa ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helping africa help itself for european donors and institutions to remain relevant and connected to the development and change within africa there needs to be change in the terms of engagement between the various actors .
as i said before , the support given to governments in africa from donors has to change from the short-termism of the present to longer term commitment and continuity of engagement to provide the confidence and respect of the recipient government for the work being undertaken . although difficult for european farmers to accept , the opening of markets for african grown agricultural produce is one of the fastest and most equitable ways of improving the living conditions of people in africa .
the deregulation of agricultural markets in europe need not be a zero sum game , where the gain in africa is a loss in europe .
the improving living conditions and available income in africa gained from this would result in increased demand for consumer goods from europe as well .
sure it will not be european farmers that are producing and selling the consumer goods to africa but this type of structural reform in markets has always been the natural progression of changing markets .
what is stopping this structural change at the moment is the protectionism of the eu and north america which is restricting the natural progression of economic activity within the world and drastically distorting markets to the detriment of all . alan duncan is a project coordinator for economic consultants kpmg east africa in southern sudan .

if we followed these rules for the international mechanisms that govern the g8 countries then the eu , nato , wto , un would have been abandoned years ago rather than given the continued support and funding that they are , in the knowledge that progress is being made , albeit slowly . how are africans helping themselves ? another positive force for change and development within africa is the increasing economic power and influence of the diaspora within europe and north america that had come over to carry out mainly low paid manual jobs but over time have progressed to increasingly higher skilled and better paid employment .
unlike most other employees within europe that spend most , or in the case of the uk , more than their income every month , the african immigrants remit the majority of their salary to their home country to support their families and communities there . this flow of funds has been growing over the past decade to such an extent that the central bank of ghana estimated that the remittances for 2006 coming from the diaspora was in the region of $ 1 billion .
although most of this money could not be classed as development expenditure in the same sense that money spent on behalf of european donor governments could , it still contributes significantly to the economic development of the recipient country .
when put in perspective , the total contributions for budget support from ten donor countries to ghana in 2006 was estimated at $ 300 million , a sum dwarfed by the remittances from the countries own population . so what is the future of international aid in africa ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helping africa help itself for european donors and institutions to remain relevant and connected to the development and change within africa there needs to be change in the terms of engagement between the various actors .
as i said before , the support given to governments in africa from donors has to change from the short-termism of the present to longer term commitment and continuity of engagement to provide the confidence and respect of the recipient government for the work being undertaken . although difficult for european farmers to accept , the opening of markets for african grown agricultural produce is one of the fastest and most equitable ways of improving the living conditions of people in africa .
the deregulation of agricultural markets in europe need not be a zero sum game , where the gain in africa is a loss in europe .
the improving living conditions and available income in africa gained from this would result in increased demand for consumer goods from europe as well .
sure it will not be european farmers that are producing and selling the consumer goods to africa but this type of structural reform in markets has always been the natural progression of changing markets .
what is stopping this structural change at the moment is the protectionism of the eu and north america which is restricting the natural progression of economic activity within the world and drastically distorting markets to the detriment of all . alan duncan is a project coordinator for economic consultants kpmg east africa in southern sudan .
he has coordinated several international aid projects in the refugee camps spread throughout the war-torn region , sometimes under fire from both government and rebel forces .
he currently works as a consultant for the kenyan government ’ s finance ministry . alan duncan was interviewed by nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de talked to one of the world 's leading beer experts about the appeal of the cologne speciality . think of americans in germany and beer , and you 'd probably think of package holiday makers braving the sloshed masses at munich 's oktoberfest . but a local cologne newspaper , the kölner stadt-anzeiger , is reporting increasing numbers of us tourists haunting the city 's bars with copies of the new york times in their hands - this after the times travel section ran a piece raving about the local beer , kölsch . what makes kölsch different from the familiar lager beer drunk in most other places in germany ?
the question is one that puzzles even michael jackson , the award-winning author of " the world guide to beer " and the host of the bbc tv show " the beer hunter . " " other than saying it 's a top-fermented version of a pilsner , it 's difficult to explain , " jackson told dw-world .
" kölsch is teasingly delicate but also elusive . " like a classic german beer daydreaming that it 's a glass of champagne ? " yeah , " jackson said .
" i think that 's a pretty good way of putting it . " a local treat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kölsch is served in special tall glasses to preserve freshness the microbrewery movement that 's radically changed american and british drinking habits in the past two decades has n't caught on in germany , where most people prefer to stick with standard , albeit high-quality , lagers and wheat beers . if tourists want to try beer styles not widely available outside germany , they need to look in specific local regions .
that 's down to history .
the development of kölsch , for instance , was an innovative reaction to the growing industrialization of beer brewing in the mid-nineteenth century . " it 's like the brewers in cologne said : ' we want to stay as we are , so we 'd better define and protect a cologne style of beer , " ' jackson said . kölsch , then , was the result of something like a microbrewery movement during the industrial revolution .
and päffgen , früh and other cologne breweries have stayed true to that original idea . a registered name bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to cologne often ca n't resist the idea of just one more beer part of kölsch 's appeal may be that american microbrewers have never succeeded in copying it . " american brewers are fantastic , but they 've never gotten kölsch quite right , " jackson said , and even if they had , they would n't be allowed to use the name .
by international agreement , the word " kölsch " - like the terms " cognac " or " champagne " - is reserved for products made in and around cologne . that 's one more reason to travel to germany 's fourth-largest city and one of its few centers of alternative beer brewing . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on the final day of the summit , the group of eight wealthiest nations are expected to announce a $ 60 billion -lrb- 44.5 billion euro -rrb- pledge to fight aids , malaria and tuberculosis in africa . summit host german chancellor angela merkel formally announced the agreement friday morning . " we are aware of our responsibilities and we will rise to them , " she said .
" on the other hand , we want to stress that we also have expectations about what should happen in africa . " in the run-up to the summit , merkel had already emphasized the hope that african countries would be stepping up their own efforts to modernize .
this would entail clamping down on corruption , consolidating democracy and strengthening civil society . about half of the sum has already been pledged by the us .
the rest will be paid by the other g8 countries , with some 4 billion euros coming from germany . us president george w. bush - who remained in his hotel suite friday morning on account of a stomach upset - announced the main thrust of the initiative in may . among the heads of the six african nations representing the needs of the poorest continent was south african president thabo mbeki .

" the chancellor has asked us to trust her and we are tempted , but we can not risk being let down by the g8 again , " bono was quoted by reuters as saying . on friday , merkel said that progress on the aid program would be monitored at the next g8 meeting in japan set to take place in a year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

years later , jena is rediscovering its scientific roots . wherever you happen to be in jena , the " keksrolle " -lrb- " cookie roll " -rrb- is always in sight .
this is the nickname the inhabitants have given the 122-meter -lrb- 400-foot -rrb- high university tower that looms above all the rooftops and church steeples . also referred to as the " lange elend " -lrb- " long misery " -rrb- , it is among the few successful construction experiments from the communist era and appears modern even today . the renown the city now enjoys has its roots in the university .
the success story of carl zeiss , the university innovator who had a keen sense for business is one example of the city 's claim to fame . optical pioneer and city patron bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carl zeiss the age of modern industry began in jena in the mid-1800s when carl zeiss , together with researchers ernst abbe and otto schott , laid the foundation for precision optical engineering .
their pioneering inventions - astronomical instruments , microscopes and the first planetarium - have since spread to every corner of the world . to the advantage of their city , the scientists were also far-sighted in terms of financial matters .
the companies they founded - zeiss precision optics and schott and gen. chemical plant - boosted jena 's economy and attracted thousands of workers to the central german town . with a part of his profits , zeiss financed the construction of jena 's " volkshaus , " a large concert hall , as well as the reconstruction of the university 's new main building . a model city bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schott , painted in 1913 by max liebermann , returning to his villa the gdr used the zeiss name with great pride .

originally intended to house the zeiss enterprises , the building later became home to university scientists . star gdr architect herbert henselmann designed the tower in the form of a huge telescope .
one of the most beautiful old squares in town was sacrificed to make room for the building .

the poet 's discovery of the intermaxillary bone in the human mandible is still regarded as a medical sensation . it is also said that goethe was the first to have planted a gingko tree in europe .
also called a " maidenhair tree , " it can be seen along with 12,000 other cultivated plants from all of the earth 's climate zones at jena 's botanical garden . jena - the " storehouse of knowledge and science , " as goethe referred to the city - attracted top minds in the 18th century .
hegel , fichte , and schelling , as well as schiller and the schlegel brothers , taught at the university , and hölderlin , novalis and brentano sat in their lectures .
their names represent the glorious epochs of the german classical age and romanticism . science meets money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the optic tradition zeiss started in jena is carried on today as was the case in zeiss ' time , science and the economy are again forming alliances in jena .
in just a short time , the " boomtown of thuringia " registered more listed start-ups than the western german financial metropolis of frankfurt am main . according to mckinsey , consulting companies regard jena as the second most important center of innovation in germany , with munich taking first place and dresden third . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eastern german town boasts cutting-edge technology there 's more to eastern germany than just chronic joblessness and neo-nazism .

the companies they founded - zeiss precision optics and schott and gen. chemical plant - boosted jena 's economy and attracted thousands of workers to the central german town . with a part of his profits , zeiss financed the construction of jena 's " volkshaus , " a large concert hall , as well as the reconstruction of the university 's new main building . a model city bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schott , painted in 1913 by max liebermann , returning to his villa the gdr used the zeiss name with great pride .
after the second world war the zeiss factories were nationalized and continued production . jena was regarded as a model socialist city , and the city was crowned with the ultra-modern research tower , a symbol of socialistic architecture .
originally intended to house the zeiss enterprises , the building later became home to university scientists . star gdr architect herbert henselmann designed the tower in the form of a huge telescope .
one of the most beautiful old squares in town was sacrificed to make room for the building .
after germany was reunified in 1990 , the newly renovated building was bought by a software company . goethe and gingko bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a jena sunset worthy of goethe 's pen even before carl zeiss , jena was recognized as a scientific center .
johann wolfgang von goethe often traveled from weimar to jena to encourage the natural science studies there .
the poet 's discovery of the intermaxillary bone in the human mandible is still regarded as a medical sensation . it is also said that goethe was the first to have planted a gingko tree in europe .
also called a " maidenhair tree , " it can be seen along with 12,000 other cultivated plants from all of the earth 's climate zones at jena 's botanical garden . jena - the " storehouse of knowledge and science , " as goethe referred to the city - attracted top minds in the 18th century .
hegel , fichte , and schelling , as well as schiller and the schlegel brothers , taught at the university , and hölderlin , novalis and brentano sat in their lectures .
their names represent the glorious epochs of the german classical age and romanticism . science meets money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the optic tradition zeiss started in jena is carried on today as was the case in zeiss ' time , science and the economy are again forming alliances in jena .
in just a short time , the " boomtown of thuringia " registered more listed start-ups than the western german financial metropolis of frankfurt am main . according to mckinsey , consulting companies regard jena as the second most important center of innovation in germany , with munich taking first place and dresden third . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eastern german town boasts cutting-edge technology there 's more to eastern germany than just chronic joblessness and neo-nazism .

is either of these views close to the reality on the ground in africa ? africa is changing and changing for the better in more ways than is apparent to the outside observer at times .
it ’ s easy to look at the problematic elections in nigeria , the violent land clearance and slum destruction in zimbabwe or the continuing civilian deaths in the democratic republic of congo and see only regression and destruction on the continent .
media pictures , both outside africa as well as within , place very little emphasis on the positive developments that have taken place .
there are clearly a number of major issues within the continent that continue to hinder individual countries ' economic and political growth , such as the continued single party despotic rule in a number of governments .
however , these situations are becoming the exception rather than the rule in africa .
a growing number of countries have transformed from the picture of the octogenarian clinging onto power , changing constitutions or disregarding them completely to secure continued power to one of peaceful handover of civil rule through , although sometimes flawed , democratic processes . what has changed to create this embryonic empowerment ? economic growth in sectors outside of the traditional agricultural environment continues to expand in large swathes of east and southern africa , most of which is fuelled by inward investment that was in the past either tied up in highly lucrative government bonds or denied access and opportunities to invest through uncertain political and investment conditions which are being addressed by the new bread of governments that are taking over .
there is clearly still significant change that is required both politically and economically within the continent to allow for the full participation of the population within the countries .
however , the change that has happened should be recognized and rewarded .
it should also be recognized that this change is also largely home grown and driven by an increasingly politically sophisticated electorate demanding change within their own governments . some of the changes that have occurred in the recent years in african economic and political growth have been directly influenced by donor pressure and support to the programs of change and development within the region .
however , change in the magnitude of reform that is required and is developing , requires long term support and commitment both within the country implementing the changes as well as more importantly within the donor community that is supporting the reforms .
however , transformation of governments is not an easy or a short-term process that can be completed within a few years .
the types of reform underway in africa will take years and maybe generations to make significant progress and this has to be understood and supported by organizations such as the g8 as well as individual donor governments . is the inability of organizations like the g8 to recognize the need for patience a reason why so many initiatives promoted by the rich nations apparently fail in africa ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alan duncan thinks there needs to be more patience with africa all too often , good initiatives are launched and basically abandoned in their infancy as they did not produce the results that had been envisaged within a short time frame and therefore some other “ better or improved ” mechanism for transformation is developed .
if we followed these rules for the international mechanisms that govern the g8 countries then the eu , nato , wto , un would have been abandoned years ago rather than given the continued support and funding that they are , in the knowledge that progress is being made , albeit slowly . how are africans helping themselves ? another positive force for change and development within africa is the increasing economic power and influence of the diaspora within europe and north america that had come over to carry out mainly low paid manual jobs but over time have progressed to increasingly higher skilled and better paid employment .
unlike most other employees within europe that spend most , or in the case of the uk , more than their income every month , the african immigrants remit the majority of their salary to their home country to support their families and communities there . this flow of funds has been growing over the past decade to such an extent that the central bank of ghana estimated that the remittances for 2006 coming from the diaspora was in the region of $ 1 billion .
although most of this money could not be classed as development expenditure in the same sense that money spent on behalf of european donor governments could , it still contributes significantly to the economic development of the recipient country .
when put in perspective , the total contributions for budget support from ten donor countries to ghana in 2006 was estimated at $ 300 million , a sum dwarfed by the remittances from the countries own population . so what is the future of international aid in africa ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helping africa help itself for european donors and institutions to remain relevant and connected to the development and change within africa there needs to be change in the terms of engagement between the various actors .
as i said before , the support given to governments in africa from donors has to change from the short-termism of the present to longer term commitment and continuity of engagement to provide the confidence and respect of the recipient government for the work being undertaken . although difficult for european farmers to accept , the opening of markets for african grown agricultural produce is one of the fastest and most equitable ways of improving the living conditions of people in africa .
the deregulation of agricultural markets in europe need not be a zero sum game , where the gain in africa is a loss in europe .
the improving living conditions and available income in africa gained from this would result in increased demand for consumer goods from europe as well .
sure it will not be european farmers that are producing and selling the consumer goods to africa but this type of structural reform in markets has always been the natural progression of changing markets .
what is stopping this structural change at the moment is the protectionism of the eu and north america which is restricting the natural progression of economic activity within the world and drastically distorting markets to the detriment of all . alan duncan is a project coordinator for economic consultants kpmg east africa in southern sudan .
he has coordinated several international aid projects in the refugee camps spread throughout the war-torn region , sometimes under fire from both government and rebel forces .
he currently works as a consultant for the kenyan government ’ s finance ministry . alan duncan was interviewed by nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is either of these views close to the reality on the ground in africa ? africa is changing and changing for the better in more ways than is apparent to the outside observer at times .
it ’ s easy to look at the problematic elections in nigeria , the violent land clearance and slum destruction in zimbabwe or the continuing civilian deaths in the democratic republic of congo and see only regression and destruction on the continent .
media pictures , both outside africa as well as within , place very little emphasis on the positive developments that have taken place .
there are clearly a number of major issues within the continent that continue to hinder individual countries ' economic and political growth , such as the continued single party despotic rule in a number of governments .
however , these situations are becoming the exception rather than the rule in africa .
a growing number of countries have transformed from the picture of the octogenarian clinging onto power , changing constitutions or disregarding them completely to secure continued power to one of peaceful handover of civil rule through , although sometimes flawed , democratic processes . what has changed to create this embryonic empowerment ? economic growth in sectors outside of the traditional agricultural environment continues to expand in large swathes of east and southern africa , most of which is fuelled by inward investment that was in the past either tied up in highly lucrative government bonds or denied access and opportunities to invest through uncertain political and investment conditions which are being addressed by the new bread of governments that are taking over .
there is clearly still significant change that is required both politically and economically within the continent to allow for the full participation of the population within the countries .
however , the change that has happened should be recognized and rewarded .
it should also be recognized that this change is also largely home grown and driven by an increasingly politically sophisticated electorate demanding change within their own governments . some of the changes that have occurred in the recent years in african economic and political growth have been directly influenced by donor pressure and support to the programs of change and development within the region .
however , change in the magnitude of reform that is required and is developing , requires long term support and commitment both within the country implementing the changes as well as more importantly within the donor community that is supporting the reforms .
however , transformation of governments is not an easy or a short-term process that can be completed within a few years .
the types of reform underway in africa will take years and maybe generations to make significant progress and this has to be understood and supported by organizations such as the g8 as well as individual donor governments . is the inability of organizations like the g8 to recognize the need for patience a reason why so many initiatives promoted by the rich nations apparently fail in africa ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alan duncan thinks there needs to be more patience with africa all too often , good initiatives are launched and basically abandoned in their infancy as they did not produce the results that had been envisaged within a short time frame and therefore some other “ better or improved ” mechanism for transformation is developed .
if we followed these rules for the international mechanisms that govern the g8 countries then the eu , nato , wto , un would have been abandoned years ago rather than given the continued support and funding that they are , in the knowledge that progress is being made , albeit slowly . how are africans helping themselves ? another positive force for change and development within africa is the increasing economic power and influence of the diaspora within europe and north america that had come over to carry out mainly low paid manual jobs but over time have progressed to increasingly higher skilled and better paid employment .
unlike most other employees within europe that spend most , or in the case of the uk , more than their income every month , the african immigrants remit the majority of their salary to their home country to support their families and communities there . this flow of funds has been growing over the past decade to such an extent that the central bank of ghana estimated that the remittances for 2006 coming from the diaspora was in the region of $ 1 billion .
although most of this money could not be classed as development expenditure in the same sense that money spent on behalf of european donor governments could , it still contributes significantly to the economic development of the recipient country .
when put in perspective , the total contributions for budget support from ten donor countries to ghana in 2006 was estimated at $ 300 million , a sum dwarfed by the remittances from the countries own population . so what is the future of international aid in africa ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helping africa help itself for european donors and institutions to remain relevant and connected to the development and change within africa there needs to be change in the terms of engagement between the various actors .
as i said before , the support given to governments in africa from donors has to change from the short-termism of the present to longer term commitment and continuity of engagement to provide the confidence and respect of the recipient government for the work being undertaken . although difficult for european farmers to accept , the opening of markets for african grown agricultural produce is one of the fastest and most equitable ways of improving the living conditions of people in africa .
the deregulation of agricultural markets in europe need not be a zero sum game , where the gain in africa is a loss in europe .
the improving living conditions and available income in africa gained from this would result in increased demand for consumer goods from europe as well .
sure it will not be european farmers that are producing and selling the consumer goods to africa but this type of structural reform in markets has always been the natural progression of changing markets .
what is stopping this structural change at the moment is the protectionism of the eu and north america which is restricting the natural progression of economic activity within the world and drastically distorting markets to the detriment of all . alan duncan is a project coordinator for economic consultants kpmg east africa in southern sudan .
he has coordinated several international aid projects in the refugee camps spread throughout the war-torn region , sometimes under fire from both government and rebel forces .
he currently works as a consultant for the kenyan government ’ s finance ministry . alan duncan was interviewed by nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de talked to one of the world 's leading beer experts about the appeal of the cologne speciality . think of americans in germany and beer , and you 'd probably think of package holiday makers braving the sloshed masses at munich 's oktoberfest . but a local cologne newspaper , the kölner stadt-anzeiger , is reporting increasing numbers of us tourists haunting the city 's bars with copies of the new york times in their hands - this after the times travel section ran a piece raving about the local beer , kölsch . what makes kölsch different from the familiar lager beer drunk in most other places in germany ?
the question is one that puzzles even michael jackson , the award-winning author of " the world guide to beer " and the host of the bbc tv show " the beer hunter . " " other than saying it 's a top-fermented version of a pilsner , it 's difficult to explain , " jackson told dw-world .
" kölsch is teasingly delicate but also elusive . " like a classic german beer daydreaming that it 's a glass of champagne ? " yeah , " jackson said .
" i think that 's a pretty good way of putting it . " a local treat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kölsch is served in special tall glasses to preserve freshness the microbrewery movement that 's radically changed american and british drinking habits in the past two decades has n't caught on in germany , where most people prefer to stick with standard , albeit high-quality , lagers and wheat beers . if tourists want to try beer styles not widely available outside germany , they need to look in specific local regions .
that 's down to history .
the development of kölsch , for instance , was an innovative reaction to the growing industrialization of beer brewing in the mid-nineteenth century . " it 's like the brewers in cologne said : ' we want to stay as we are , so we 'd better define and protect a cologne style of beer , " ' jackson said . kölsch , then , was the result of something like a microbrewery movement during the industrial revolution .
and päffgen , früh and other cologne breweries have stayed true to that original idea . a registered name bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to cologne often ca n't resist the idea of just one more beer part of kölsch 's appeal may be that american microbrewers have never succeeded in copying it . " american brewers are fantastic , but they 've never gotten kölsch quite right , " jackson said , and even if they had , they would n't be allowed to use the name .
by international agreement , the word " kölsch " - like the terms " cognac " or " champagne " - is reserved for products made in and around cologne . that 's one more reason to travel to germany 's fourth-largest city and one of its few centers of alternative beer brewing . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are two central elements in the climate accord that will be officially presented this friday : one , the necessity to ' decisively ' reduce greenhouse gases .
the other one - which marks the real political success of the summit - is that once the kyoto protocol -lrb- which the us has never ratified -rrb- expires in 2012 , the framework for combating climate change will be under the auspices of the united nations .
it was difficult to achieve anything more at the summit with such deep divisions among leaders over the issue - the europeans , with the support of japan and canada , on the one hand , and the americans and russians on the other . "
france 's libération took a much tougher approach .
" just like at the un , at the g8 the devil is in the details .
president george w. bush , as head of the largest polluting country in the world , did not want binding commitments for reducing co2 emissions .
he did not give in .
the climate accord does outline that which was so precious to the europeans : a 50 percent reduction by 2050 , but it merely says that should ' be considered . '
the accord lacks any firm commitment whatsoever .
it is a compromise that lets everyone at the summit save face . -lrb- … -rrb- no one admitted it , but some people surely thought quite clearly : this compromise is a bet on the near future , one in which people are placing a lot of hope - a new era for the climate simply called " the period after bush . "
switzerland 's tages-anzeiger agreed .
" what the powerful -lrb- … -rrb- are selling as a success is primarily a way for them to save face : thanks to non-binding agreements , host chancellor angela merkel does not have to stand there empty-handed .
bush 's willingness after all to work together on a treaty to succeed the kyoto protocol , under the auspices of the un , keeps him from looking like the bad guy .
it is a weak signal , however , for the uno environment conference at the end of the year in bali . -lrb- … -rrb- merkel overestimated her global-political influence in the climate protection arena . "
austria 's die presse said that g8 success on the climate was limited .
" it -lrb- the accord -rrb- could not exactly be called the breakthrough of the century .
greenpeace activists - the self-proclaimed guardians of the environment - reacted promptly when they called the outcome of the climate talks " far too little . "
at the baltic sea resort heiligendamm , the absolute claims of starry-eyed idealists once again clashed with the sober pragmatism of world leaders representing their own national interestss .
coming to an agreement is normally next to impossible in situations like that .
that was also evident after chancellor merkel 's talk with bono and bob geldof .
bono apparently became depressed because merkel did not agree to enough aid for africa .
as if g8 leaders should beckon to the calls of rock stars .
smart rock stars always say politics is not their business .
but smart politicians should also avoid selling vague declarations of intent as major steps . "
germany 's financial times deutschland put it succintly : " in terms of chancellor merkel 's own high expectations about climate talks at the summit , she has failed .
but in terms of what was realistic , she has succeeded at the meeting of world leaders in heiligendamm . " dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de talked to one of the world 's leading beer experts about the appeal of the cologne speciality . think of americans in germany and beer , and you 'd probably think of package holiday makers braving the sloshed masses at munich 's oktoberfest . but a local cologne newspaper , the kölner stadt-anzeiger , is reporting increasing numbers of us tourists haunting the city 's bars with copies of the new york times in their hands - this after the times travel section ran a piece raving about the local beer , kölsch . what makes kölsch different from the familiar lager beer drunk in most other places in germany ?
the question is one that puzzles even michael jackson , the award-winning author of " the world guide to beer " and the host of the bbc tv show " the beer hunter . " " other than saying it 's a top-fermented version of a pilsner , it 's difficult to explain , " jackson told dw-world .
" kölsch is teasingly delicate but also elusive . " like a classic german beer daydreaming that it 's a glass of champagne ? " yeah , " jackson said .
" i think that 's a pretty good way of putting it . " a local treat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kölsch is served in special tall glasses to preserve freshness the microbrewery movement that 's radically changed american and british drinking habits in the past two decades has n't caught on in germany , where most people prefer to stick with standard , albeit high-quality , lagers and wheat beers . if tourists want to try beer styles not widely available outside germany , they need to look in specific local regions .
that 's down to history .
the development of kölsch , for instance , was an innovative reaction to the growing industrialization of beer brewing in the mid-nineteenth century . " it 's like the brewers in cologne said : ' we want to stay as we are , so we 'd better define and protect a cologne style of beer , " ' jackson said . kölsch , then , was the result of something like a microbrewery movement during the industrial revolution .
and päffgen , früh and other cologne breweries have stayed true to that original idea . a registered name bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to cologne often ca n't resist the idea of just one more beer part of kölsch 's appeal may be that american microbrewers have never succeeded in copying it . " american brewers are fantastic , but they 've never gotten kölsch quite right , " jackson said , and even if they had , they would n't be allowed to use the name .
by international agreement , the word " kölsch " - like the terms " cognac " or " champagne " - is reserved for products made in and around cologne . that 's one more reason to travel to germany 's fourth-largest city and one of its few centers of alternative beer brewing . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by rob lemkin bbc money programme has a private equity takeover been good or bad for the aa ?
since the private equity firm permira helped take over the aa in 2004 , about one third of its workforce of 10,000 have lost their jobs .
former award-winning aa patrolman steve thompson is among several current and former aa staff who tell the money programme that private equity has , in their view , damaged the company they love .
" if anybody hears that private equity is taking over their company , beware of the signs , " he says .
some of the aa 's staff were represented by the gmb trade union .
its officer paul maloney is critical of the management 's approach during the job cuts .
he describes it as " horrendous " and says it amounted to " corporate bullying " .
the aa 's chief executive , tim parker , installed by its private equity owners , strongly rejects the bullying claim and says the company had genuine performance issues that necessitated the restructure .
" they had not been addressed for many , many years and it was essential that we did that for the members . "
strong financial position apart from the aa , private equity takeovers have often resulted in radical job losses for the company in question .
" it could be argued these are unproductive jobs , but that 's rather harsh when looked at in a social context , " says former chairman of marks & spencer , paul myners .
but permira partner charles sherwood , one of the private equity owners at the aa , defends the practice , saying , " there are some businesses where you have to take an initial step backward before you can take a business forward " .
" if they do not produce good value services for customers then they have no long term future and they will employ no-one , " he says .
mr parker admits that last year " we could have done with slightly more patrols , and we learnt something from that " .
but he maintains the aa 's patrol force is now more effective than ever before .
in fact , he thinks the aa in its entirety is stronger than ever .
" we are a good example of a business which had a good business plan which has delivered improvement and sales and is now in a very strong financial position , " he says .
vulnerable company the aa 's current management says the company 's earnings are now up by £ 120m a year .
it sounds like the company is doing brilliantly .
but then there 's the small issue of debt .
the private equity owners loaded the aa with £ 1.3bn of borrowed money during the takeover .
this has since risen considerably .
understanding how this works is the key to understanding the private equity buyout system .
some £ 1.3bn of the aa 's initial buyout of just less than £ 1.8bn came as loans arranged by barclays bank .
former venture capitalist peter folkman argues the prudence behind this level of debt is dependent on the general health of the economy .
" if the company is making more profits , it can service the debt .
that 's fine , " he reasons .
" if we get hard times then , undoubtedly , it 'll make the aa much more vulnerable . "
high debt levels as private equity investors become bigger players in the uk economy - the £ 11bn buyout of boots is set to be the largest ever in the uk - there is concern at very high levels at the size of the debt being piled on the companies that get taken over .
the financial services authority has raised concerns that one day a private equity company might collapse under the weight of its own debt .
but at permira , one of the aa 's private equity owners , partner charles sherwood adamantly denies overloading this or any of their other companies with debt .
" it serves us no good at all to burden the company with more debt than it is capable of servicing in a sensible way , " he insists .

some of the aa 's staff were represented by the gmb trade union .
its officer paul maloney is critical of the management 's approach during the job cuts .
he describes it as " horrendous " and says it amounted to " corporate bullying " .
the aa 's chief executive , tim parker , installed by its private equity owners , strongly rejects the bullying claim and says the company had genuine performance issues that necessitated the restructure .
" they had not been addressed for many , many years and it was essential that we did that for the members . "
strong financial position apart from the aa , private equity takeovers have often resulted in radical job losses for the company in question .
are customers left waiting longer on the left shoulder ?
" it could be argued these are unproductive jobs , but that 's rather harsh when looked at in a social context , " says former chairman of marks & spencer , paul myners .
but permira partner charles sherwood , one of the private equity owners at the aa , defends the practice , saying , " there are some businesses where you have to take an initial step backward before you can take a business forward " .
" if they do not produce good value services for customers then they have no long term future and they will employ no-one , " he says .
mr parker admits that last year " we could have done with slightly more patrols , and we learnt something from that " .
but he maintains the aa 's patrol force is now more effective than ever before .
in fact , he thinks the aa in its entirety is stronger than ever .
" we are a good example of a business which had a good business plan which has delivered improvement and sales and is now in a very strong financial position , " he says .
vulnerable company the aa 's current management says the company 's earnings are now up by £ 120m a year .
the aa believes its business is flowing better now than before it sounds like the company is doing brilliantly .
but then there 's the small issue of debt .
the private equity owners loaded the aa with £ 1.3bn of borrowed money during the takeover .
this has since risen considerably .
understanding how this works is the key to understanding the private equity buyout system .
some £ 1.3bn of the aa 's initial buyout of just less than £ 1.8bn came as loans arranged by barclays bank .
former venture capitalist peter folkman argues the prudence behind this level of debt is dependent on the general health of the economy .
" if the company is making more profits , it can service the debt .
that 's fine , " he reasons .
" if we get hard times then , undoubtedly , it 'll make the aa much more vulnerable . "
high debt levels as private equity investors become bigger players in the uk economy - the £ 11bn buyout of boots is set to be the largest ever in the uk - there is concern at very high levels at the size of the debt being piled on the companies that get taken over .
the financial services authority has raised concerns that one day a private equity company might collapse under the weight of its own debt .
but at permira , one of the aa 's private equity owners , partner charles sherwood adamantly denies overloading this or any of their other companies with debt .
" it serves us no good at all to burden the company with more debt than it is capable of servicing in a sensible way , " he insists .

philadelphia media holdings chief executive brian tierney indicated that his firm would be willing to offer as much as rupert murdoch 's current bid .
mr murdoch 's news corporation made its $ 5bn -lrb- £ 2.5bn -rrb- offer for the wall street journal owner at the start of may .
while dow jones has yet to decide on this bid , its unions are opposed .
" we do n't believe news corporation is overpaying , " said mr tierney .
" this is one of the greatest journalistic enterprises ever created . "
his comments came as the main union at dow jones said an unnamed internet entrepreneur and wall street group were also looking at mounting a possible bid .
the union , the independent association of publishers ' employees , has also approached billionaire investors ron burkle and warren buffett .
' editorial independence fears ' dow jones ' future is in the hands of the bancroft family , which controls 64 % of the firm 's voting rights .
mr murdoch held his first meeting with members of this family earlier this week and both sides said the talks were " constructive " .
yet neither gave any more details , especially regarding whether the family was willing to sell .
amid fears that mr murdoch will interfere in the running of the wall street journal , he has already promised to establish " an independent , autonomous editorial board " for the newspaper if his bid for dow jones is accepted .

an ageing and more wealthy population also meant the uk gardening sector had a bright future , it added .

" garden centres are ideally placed to support this , because for many people , gardening is the way they express their desire to be green . "
products such as water butts , composting kits and organic fertilisers , as well as carbon-efficient home insulation , domestic wind power generators and solar panels , could meet this demand , he added .
" it is an excellent business with a first-class management team and a great brand that we will retain and develop from its scottish base , " mr leahy said .
" the brand name is strong and already well-respected in the local communities in which dobbies operates . "
chairman of dobbies , alex hammond-chambers said that the deal would " allow our scottish success story to grow " .
tesco said it had already secured an agreement to buy 22.6 % of the firm .

bbc news -pipe- europe -pipe- russian viewpoint - your comments bbc news / europe graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- friday , 8 june 2007 , 07:42 gmt 08:42 uk russian viewpoint - your comments a selection of your comments on our viewpoint piece , russia 's missile fears , in which fyodor lukyanov , editor of foreign affairs journal russia in global affairs , spoke to the bbc news website about the spat over us plans to install an anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic .
viewpoint : russia 's missile fears i am very glad to read these words by prominent russian analyst .
he gets right to the point and gives all pros and cons of the current freeze in the us-russia relationship .
as for me , united states use eastern europe , especially those states that suffered a lot from russian empire -lrb- poland and ukraine -rrb- as a small change .
those countries feel insulted and annoyed by long lasting russian dominance , and that is why their leading politicians exploit any trifle to pinch a bear -lrb- russia -rrb- .
from 1990s up until 2004-2005 the bear was in hibernation .
now it is awakened and strives to establish status quo .
i hope the bear would have enough wisdom not to race with an eagle -lrb- us -rrb- and they would leave in peace .
otherwise , catastrophe might happen , eventually , because bears can not fly ? .
ilshat , manchester , usa even though they talk a lot about n korea and iran , but in fact , us control them quite well and they have got a lot cheaper solutions to protect anyone from the " danger " .
the ams is not related to them at all , and done for completely different purposes .
it 's geopolitics , and anyone related to it would not even mention " axis of evil " countries seriously ...
it is obvious that russia , and some other countries would be left with no choice , but develop new systems to overcome the ams .
not that they do n't do already , but as imbalance increases they would have to speed up the process .
you can say honestly -lrb- as putin did -rrb- or not talk about it openly , but there is no doubt that ams bases , radars , missiles bases , etc -lrb- russian or american -rrb- are the first targets of attack in an escalating conflict .
all that would not make any country more secured .
alex , uk president putin takes a very sensible stance on the proposed us military expansion into eastern europe .
the ams becomes an integral part of the us nuclear arsenal .
do the europeans really need american nukes in their back yard ?
russia is already surrounded by a ring of american military bases in the former eastern block states and soviet republics .
she also now shares borders with several new quazi-tyrannical states that the us keeps on a short leash and sets them off to bite russia when expedient .
the ams is another affront that does not achieve any useful purpose , but makes things globally much worse .
yuri zharikov , odessa , ukraine putin is right : the us anti-missile system is an existential threat to russia 's existance .
10 missiles now will become 1000 missiles in ten years time .
and who will guarantee the us would n't tip these alleged " anti-missile missiles " with nuke warheads ?
the defunct abm-treaty recognized that , if country 1 could nuke country 2 with impunity , because it could shoot down incoming missiles of country 2 , the only logical course of action for country 2 was to pre-emptively fire its missiles at country 1 , before country 1 had brought this anti-missile system online .
in short : " use ' em , or lose ' em " ...
roel , leuven , belgium is it any surprise that the us would want to maintain its global dominance and provide every option available , especially when we know that we can not rely on other nations to solve our problems ?
those in the eu need to realize that this is n't being unwillingly imposed on your governments .
the eu should grow a spine and prove that it can independently act without the us military / economy , otherwise nothing is going to change- get real !
additionally , it really does n't help that the russians and the chinese consistently undermine the us 's position in dealing with rouge states .
what the hell are we supposed to do ?
if those " powerful " states want to play with the big boys then so be it .
certainly there are always more diplomatic options , but the truth is every nation is out for its own interest and if there is room to expand and flex muscle , someone will always fill that vacuum .
andrew , chicago , usa quote : " many of the people i have talked to in private have told me they believe the anti-missile system is a us tactic to prevent the eu from becoming an independent player in foreign policy " .
a fantastic point which is rarely articulated - us foreign policy & particularly it 's ' special relationship with britain ' always seems divisive & geared to weaken the eu , maintaining their superior position as the world 's only superpower .
coincidence ?
iain , bristol , uk " -lsb- putin 's -rsb- country is skid row , and he 's worrying about u.s. missiles ? ! "
john kluver bbc news website reader , tucson , usa hmm , let 's see - putin has botched the ukraine -lrb- remember he called to congratulate yanukovich -rrb- , and he 's botched georgia , the baltics and poland .
he 's killed off the free press , in particular tv , in his country .
remember that no matter what he says or does he is always portrayed as a winner on tv in russia .
russia is far less free today , for example , than it was even in 1988 in the ussr ! !
and the u.s. is supposed to listen to him ? ? ?
his country is weak and poor , and old ladies beg everywhere on the streets of moscow .
his country is skid row , and he 's worrying about u.s. missiles ? !
geez , maybe solve your domestic problems first .
should n't he worry more about russia 's shrinking population ? ?
he 's a loser leader of a loser country and he should be ignored .
john kluver , tucson , usa rogue nations .
who 's to decide which nation is a ' rogue ' one ? and what ' rogue ' exactly means ?
there are un rules and russia strictly abides with them as nuclear materials are concerned .
why the us did n't stop pakistan -lrb- israel -rrb- and bomb it into quarks after it acquired nuclear weapons ?
why iran is worse ?
pakistan is surely more unstable and unpredictable .
what if japan decides to go nuclear ?
there are no easy answers , it is better to wait and see .
a country may acquire a nuclear deterrent and behave .
you can always launch a nuclear war .
how can you stop iran ?
a military action may cause worse consequences than patient politics .
pavel , rostov , russia a pox upon both your houses .
the global economic and military dominionism of the usa government and the resurgent autocratism of putin 's government are the festering poison that is so revolting for the average citizen of the world who is trying to make a world that is livable for all it 's citizens .
the impudent arrogance of both governments is reprehensible .
harold l nicol , st paul usa ... ever since britain lost superpower status at the end of 19th century it has been thriving on balancing power dynamic between europe and the us ...
what is happening today is no different .
britain and the us are trying to keep the status quo in the regional and global distribution of power .
they are trying hard to preempt any meaningful change that can undermine their strategic positions .
they want to deny the continent any chance of emerging strong as a whole .
playing on anti-russian and pro-american sentiments in young states of eastern europe is a smart preventive tactic to weaken european unity and regional security and , thus , secure the status quo for long time to come ...
the only problems is , as mr. lukyanov put it " there are big players watching on the sidelines - china , india , and iran - that can emerge as winners " if the us gets stuck keeping european continent weak .
if , however , the us and britain jointly manage to drive another long-term wedge in europe -lrb- regional " cold war " -rrb- , it will be able to afford to get busy with weakening others .
now that will be the start of the new american century .
if that happens , britain will have to get busy making the us dependent on british as the irreplacable agents meddling in european affairs and keeping europe weak .
otherwise , britain risks being reduced to a mere lapdog of the americans .
although that will happen anyway if the us project of the new american century truly gets realized .
yevgeni , moscow , russia as a citizen of the country , ukraine , which mr lukanov calls former integral part of the soviet union , i would million times say " god bless america ! " , again , just in the case of deploying anti-missile defence shield in eastern europe , because this is completely correct and up-to-date decision , despite of my criticism of other actions of the bush 's administration .
i 'm surprised how blind sometimes western europeans are in terms of russia .
something i 've conceived of mr lukanov 's article as well as russian president 's behaviour is that this country has been planning to become new soviet union -lrb- even precursory look at modern putin 's russia displays that it had become so already -rrb- .
and i want to ask all people here so worried about global warming , why mrs merkel , if she is so worried about this issue , does not openly say that russia is major energetic terrorist ?
in the beginning of 2006 , when russia blackmailed my country by gas price , i heard words of support only from poland , baltic countries and the united states .
mrs. merkel instead called only for fast compromise between ukraine and russia , clearly understanding that the price of this compromise could be only shifting control over our main gas pipelines to russian gazprom ?
oh , of course , do german enterprises , which 40 % depend on russian gas supplies , causing pollution too , care about something like ukraine ?
oksana , kyiv , ukraine " this should be discussed at the un to ratify the implications of such moves , this does n't just affect russia " gerry mangan bbc news website reader , basingstoke , england this defense system tips the balance of power completely , creating a super power with the single most biggest nuclear arsenal .
what would a wannabe president with the same superiority complex as bush do with this power on nations opposed or making things difficult .
this should be discussed at the un to ratify the implications of such moves , this does n't just affect russia .
gerry mangan , basingstoke , england all russia has to do is stop providing uranium to iran , stop largely siding with them on their nuclear program and forth and stronger back the calls for north korea to disarm .
if russia was n't aiding these countries through it 's lack of will for tougher sanctions or tougher action against these nations then they would n't be a nuclear risk , hence the us would also have no excuse for needing a missile shield .
russia is as much at fault in helping give the us an excuse for a missile shield in the first place helping these rogue nations ...
ian , leeds i think that ' europe ' just need someone to be afraid of , and now i read so many anti-russian reviews and almost nothing that explains russian position without fear of ' big bad russia ' . its very pity igor , moscow , russian federation i have no brief to make for mr. putin , who seems to be more of an autocrat than a democrat .
but it is absurd to compare contemporary russia to the former soviet union .
u.s. presidents abraham lincoln , franklin d. roosevelt , and harry s. truman had the wisdom to understand that you do not treat a former foe like a convicted criminal , but rather like an errant friend whose friendship might be won again .
it was needlessly provocative to extend nato right up to the russian border , and it is needlessly provocative to attempt to put elements of an anti-missile defense in countries bordering on russia .
there are anti-ballistic missile radars and interceptor missiles that can be deployed aboard ships which can be stationed off of the coasts of north korea and iran .
this is where it is most feasable to detect and intercept ballistic missiles just after they are launched anyway .
george , somewhere in texas " the onus is on russia to decide whether its imperial past or a potentially prosperous future is more important " tomek bbc news website reader , londonderry , nh , us ... it is not the case that europe 's russia policy is filtered through poland ; only in the last few weeks has the eu finally recognized any of poland 's concerns about russia 's behaviors .
further , if the eu did base its policies towards russia on poland , that would still be a potentially advantageous situation for moscow , as , for all the historical hostility , most poles understand that their security and prosperity ultimately depend on finding some accommodation with russia .
poland will never be fully secure without russia also feeling secure , and an economically prosperous russia would benefit poland immensely - while an impoverished and politically unstable russia will always threaten poland 's own economic and political security .
we have no choice ; we are -lrb- relative -rrb- neighbors , like it or not , and most poles understand that just as renewed relations with germany had to be rebuilt , so too will someday a rapprochement with moscow be necessary .
that , however , will take two sides to achieve , and as i said , for now the onus is on russia to decide whether its imperial past or a potentially prosperous future is more important .
tomek , londonderry , nh usa the shield is " defensive . "
so calm down all of you america haters .
in fact , after listening to how much you hate us i think we need more defense sites .
i bet you wish you had a shield too .
well , if you 're nice we 'll put you under the umbrella .
if not , you can play with the trustworthy russians , the loving north koreans , and the ever so friendly iranians .
i 'm sorry that we 're not like them enough for you to like us .
alex turner , las vegas , us the analysis is mostly excellent .
russia , however , is not " sadly encouraging " the situation : it is all the us that is being obdurate because it can not begin to imagine life on a planet where it does not , in the manner of the most spoiled of brats , get its own way .
neither are britain & france " formerly " empires : that is just pap for the primary grades .
we all know that america , britain , france , spain & germany continue to command vast empires to this day , even if there is some self-government in their cultural or economic dependencies .
russia is not " asking to get something back " - i.e. ' superpower ' or even ' great power ' status .
russia was , and remains , a mighty nuclear power not to be taken lightly .
the idea that it was ever not powerful is as silly as the suggestion would be that american was not a global power during its global depression - or after 9/11 , or even now , when it remains on its knees in iraq & incapable of extricating itself from a small botched war .
let 's set aside the propaganda slogans & the politically correct cant , and look at simple , patent realities staring us in the face .
can the us afford to go to war with russia , for example over kosovo ?
of course not .
can europeans afford a revival of the decade of gore & agony that brought about the kosovo problem in the first place ?
not at all - much less a major or even minor conflict between the us & russia .
kindly simply turn off bush 's microphone ... & stop throwing petrol on a fire that is rapidly swelling out of control ...
maria amadei ashot , berkeley , california i 'm not sure i particularly believe / trust russia or the us , but i do envy russia 's ability and willingness to stand up to bush and say ' no ' .
nik , milton keynes " why does america antagonize russia while pretending that unapologetically totalitarian regimes in p. r. of china and saudi arabia are ' friends ' ? "
mike bbc news website reader , ancaster , ontario , canada the true question is why america is taking this course of action against russia at this time ?
its military is overstretched , its global popularity is at an all-time-low , and russia is one of the few world powers that is content to not challenge america if it is left alone .
why does america antagonize russia while pretending that unapologetically totalitarian regimes in p. r. of china and saudi arabia are ' friends ' ?
mike , ancaster , ontario , canada the fact of the matter is , the american have provided security to the world , can you imagine without american security ?
god bless america ...
alex , london great analysis !
when the ussr put nuclear missiles in cuba it did n't change anything strategically either , both the us and the su were capable of mutual destruction .
a few extra missiles fired from cuba would not have changed that .
yet , the americans made a huge fuss about it !
that 's exactly the situation here , anything that diminishes or degrades russia 's nuclear capability is clearly an act of aggression .
vladislav , moscow what a shame that no eu country leader has guts to accept that mr putin is right .
alan , " amazing timing : did bush and putin agree in advance of the g8 meeting to have this missile issue overshadow ... global warming , so that they could avoid having to discuss it ? "
colin mckenzie bbc news website reader , manchester , uk amazing timing : did bush and putin agree in advance of the g8 meeting to have this missile issue overshadow the very real threat to this planet , global warming , so that they could avoid having to discuss it ?
and by the way has bush ever stopped to think that rising sea levels caused by global warming triggered by us in-action could be just as devastating to coastal areas of nuclear armed india and pakistan as a direct attack on them and that at some point in many years time they may point their weapons at the us to save their own land ?
colin mckenzie , manchester , uk the article that is presented here has some validity in some respect about the protection of eastern european countries because neither the russian nor the western eurpean countries would come forward to protect them other than united states of america .
the eastern europeans feel much secure if the americans are there to save them and by virtue if and when their security interests are jeopardized by either western europe or the russians .
in this context , it is fair to point out that out of this tension about the missile defense system initiated by the u.s may have some validity to the protection of europe overall as we all know that western europe will not make such a defense plan that would serve up as a common goal for all europeans .
it is not only going to bankrupt them but also will not have a cohessive defense policy to safeguard european interest .
yes , putin may have a reason to be upset about but he may take it easy not worrying to much about russian security interest because he has asserted himself aligning with the the americans and the europeans in a common security interest of the global world that we live in .
he must realize that the old geopolitical game that had been fought early in the 20th century is not going to work and for that reason he must work jointly with the u.s to irradicate poverty , terrorism from the face of this earth .
azim , harrisburg , pa , united states yes we did drop the bomb ... and the entire planet was not destroyed .
as a matter of fact , the enemy did not care enough about therr own people so we had to drop a second one before they surrendered .
it 's tough being the only remaining super power .
it would be a lot tougher on the rest of you , if we were n't .
chuck d , us mil - deployed i think the bases could just be a wedge issue to put pressure on russia to deal with iran .
it 's the russians who are building the reactor for tehran .
i would n't be suprised if the state department says " russia , if you can help us make sure iran does n't get the bomb we wo n't humiliate you by putting these bases in your former sphere of influence . "
the same goes for the british and the russian spy case .
it might all be a way to put pressure on moscow .
tj , south dakota usa it 's obvious that the west is on the path of confrontation with anything it regards as ' incompatible ' with western interests and was encouraged , so to speak , by the unbalance in the unsc after the ussr and allies ceased to exist .
it was offered a finger and decided to go for the whole hand .
the russian government finds that the circling of its territory by us / nato -lrb- and belittling of slavs ? -rrb- has gone far enough - rightfully imo - and is determined to restore the balance .
we should get used to the idea that there ca n't be a yin without yang .
jj van kempen , den haag , netherlands why is everyone so quick to call the united states a bully ?
modern russia under putin is just the ussr by another name .
it is deeply unsettling .
have we forgotten their barbarousness in afghanistan and inside the iron curtain ?
putin is ... a despotic autocrat - just how accountable is he ?
is russia trustworthy ?
no.they use their new-found economic clout to strangle former cis countries .
is russia stable ?
no .
what happens when oil prices drop etc ?
why should we continue fearing a vast poverty stricken country with a declining population.why ca n't the us protect the west from nuclear attacks ?
russia only need to fear this if they plan on bombing the west otherwise they should relax .
why should we respond every time a decaying ex-superpower wants to flex its muscles ?
maybe the nuclear defence system might finally highlight the absurdity of nuclear missiles .
if not- at least we 're safe .
dexter galvin , dublin , ireland no-one needs to be a lap dog , and surely no-one will laugh if us does put the missiles shield .
takes one or the other radical view point to tip the balance , does n't it ?
actually , it might not happen -lrb- it 's expensive and military spend only helps sending us into a solid budget deficit -rrb- - some of the us objectives are already achieved 100 % anyway - divide and conquer that is .
it 's amazing how oblivious people remain : may i ask a simple question - to whose benefit the current situation is ? who exactly is provoking , dividing and conquering ; preventing us to benefit ?
has eu not learnt any lessons from history ? we have a great leverage of strong western economies and a willing growing strong market next door !
as well as an excellent collar for provision of peace .
let 's be honest - it 's a gold mine for the city ..
why in the world are we not pursuing it and entertaining someone else 's tactics and interests -lrb- who 's interests , by the way , do not include our wellbeing - wake up -rrb- ? ? , london mr lukyanov is absolutely right .
russia has every right to be aggressive in this case .
it is a cause of worry for india also and any other country with nuclear weapons if a global missile defence system comes into place .
it would give the us complete immunity in case of a war .
america is systematically trying to conquer the world .
they seem to be afraid of the fact that china , russia and india are growing stronger and want to stop this .
europe on the other hand should realise they are not going to benefit from this missile shield .
when it comes to a war , america would not care one bit what happens to europe .
europe should not alienate russia keeping old cold war memories in mind .
they have to realise the present situation with america having it selfish and dangerous objectives .
anand , bangalore i can see a few fair points in general however when talk about russia 's interest in economic growth and want to be in the club i think they should be prepare to play by the rules of the club .
can any of the developed nations see russia contributing anything to that extent other than playing cheap games with immaturity and aggressive outburst from kremlin instad of intelligent political and tactical manoeuvres to promote their genuine desire and comitment.what actualy went wrong to glasnost & perestroika one should wonder .
m thomas , london , uk europe needs what the us has to offer ! !
its not only rogue states like iran and north korea which we need to contend with , but russia as well .
the most feared would be russia , because when the chips are down , its the rogue states and russia who will join hands against the us and europe .
and believe me , its heading that way soon , unfortunately though !
juliana smith , croydon the various comments are quite enlightening .
but whatever the real reasons for this new chill in global nuclear politics , the most worrying thing may be the growing inability of u.s policy-makers to distinguish their own propaganda from real threats , and to systematically dismiss the protests of those who disagree like mr putin .
it would be excessive to claim that the world no longer cares for any thing that washington says , but people - powerless as they may be - are not idiots , and it is equally doubtful if a nation 's strategic interests can be durably ensured through browbeating and force .
the other serious reason for concern is the complacency of major nuclear stakeholders like china .
their fence sitting tactics , far from weakening the u.s or gaining them any strategic edge , has instead helped to reinforce the position of the u.s , thus enabling this latter to move its mile stones into central asia since the collapse of the ussr and its satelite states .
dominic lulu , c.d spain russia is right .
anyone who takes a detailed look at what the experts are saying and have been saying for the last decade or so -lrb- and not since last week -rrb- will know that the us , being in a unique position as the most militarily powerful nation on earth , will want to consolidate it 's position and keep ahead of the other rising powers while it can before the other world powers can catch up .
one of the ways the us will stay ahead of the others is by having a nuclear first strike option , where by the us military can destroy a rival nuclear power in a first strike without having to fear a devastating nuclear retaliatory response since what nuclear weapons the opposing military may launch -lrb- those that survived the first strike -rrb- will be intercepted by the global us abm system .
of course to set up such a system will take a few more decades -lrb- more or less -rrb- but for the us military , it will be worth it .
what we are seeing in poland and the czech republic is the first steps for such a system .
such systems will be able to track and intercept the older russian missiles that are in it 's radar coverage even if russia shoots them towards the north pole .
the us knows only they have the financial resources and technical know how to build a global abm network at this moment in time .
they are going ahead with it .
the us will not be able to impose itself on others using purely conventional means , but with wmds it can .
bablu rahman , haywards heath , u.k we polish do not want missiles on our soil , do not want to be a target but we know , we can not rely on europe which is depending on russia 's energy supplies more and more .
russia 's never been reliable partner !
you witness it on daily basis .
russia -lrb- soviet u -rrb- had destroyed our country for 50 years , plus between 1939 - 41 of wwii killed more poles then germans did .
i know us shields ai n't the best solution but at least something .
do n't get me wrong , i think that the usa is the bigest danger for peace on our globe but that 's why we need to stick with them .
this is business .
rob , krakow , poland reagan offered to make the original " star wars " systems available to other nations - " we 're not gonna give it away , they 're gonna have to pay for it ... "
if the us makes the current systems available to russia , surely that rebalances the equation ?
it could be useful for all concerned to have interceptors closer to the likely origins of hostile missile launches .
d wilson , london , uk yeah , i also agree with the article. lets agree on that us is the sole power and is trying very hard to protect its interests while undermining the others . be it the attacks on the middle east or the simplest thing like not accepting the co2 emission curbs set prior to the g8 meet .
it is doing the same thing in india by that nuclear agreement which will retard the nuclear capabilities of india while 2 nuclear countries namely china and pakistan sit next to it and mind you both are hostile to india .
devendra , new delhi , india its all about putin ...
just as russia was about to emerge from 1000 years of darkness , into the light of democratic freedom - putin and his kgb gang has plunged his people back into the abyss ...
the eu must go directly to the russian people and offer them a different vision of their future ¿ a future of a strong democratic russia - economically and politically .
the eu must explain to the russian people that because of the expansion of nato and the eu for the first time in a thousand years - russia is free from invasion from the west .
russian mothers no longer have to bury their sons by the millions due to invasion or leave their dead bodies on european battlefields due to their government alliances with western countries .
the expansion of the eu through the enlargement process and the creation of a special free trade zone including a privileged partnership with russia is the only way to guarantee freedom and democracy for russia and central asia and oil / gas supply security for europe .
larry houle , spring texas i think russia are right to object in this instance and can understand why putin has reacted in the way he has done .
i was infuriated when i heard of how the usa wanted to plant various defence systems across europe as though the continent belongs to them ...
it 's about time someone stood up to them and said ' no , this is unacceptable ' .
sarah , hereford , uk and what if russia , or venezuela , or some other party not in the freedom club , did a deal so they could place military bases in either canada or mexico -lrb- or cuba -rrb- to protect some intangible interests against unidentified parties ?
would the us stand idly by ?
also , given current us record with truth and integrity and -lrb- almost -rrb- unilateral interventionism , why should n't russia hyperventilate ? paolo , powell , usa in my opinion , we should fear not only russia , but also the us .
if russia 's and china 's nuclear capabilities are undermined , or even useless , then the us would be the only nuclear superpower capable of sending one of those missiles -lrb- of which they 've got thousands , by the way -rrb- to europe .
this situation is a double edged sword .
we , europe , should arm ourselves against both .
markus pihlström , helsingfors , finland i thought your article was another in a long list of ' pundits ' making their living by chewing up today 's news and regurgitating it to market to the masses .
until the ending statement about -lrb- russia -rrb- being " a young ... " .
it reminds me of us history in the 1800s , when today 's powerful families and organizations were first starting up , ie . ' the robber barons ' of the old west -lrb- trains and newspapers -rrb- .
i think i understand russia a bit better now - thanks .
bill , cedar rapids , iowa , usa under the current administration the moral compass of america has changed dramatically .
in a world of rapid technological advances and changes in warfare the us is pursuing an approach easily circumvented .
the us appears to becoming more out of step with the world at a time when friends and allies are most important .
combine this with the us habit of pursuing its interests at the expense of all others and we have a worrying scenario. bill wallace , perth , australia i think mr. lukyanov fails to mention the primary reason for the us missile defenses in europe : the inevitable attack by iran and north korea against poland .
as bush said , these defenses have nothing to do with russia .
russia really has no missiles to speak of .
and , even if it did , everyone in poland loves the russians .
it 's the north koreans that the polish are really concerned with .
hordes of starving north korean soldiers .
thus , every major kielbasa -lsb- polish sausage -rsb- factory must be protected .
veniamin nikolayev , philadelphia , usa take a look at the geography - if russia were to fire missiles at the usa , they would go over the north pole , not poland or the czech republic .
i would suggest , therefore , that they are next to useless as a defence against russian missiles .
now if they base any in northern canada that would be a different matter altogether .
mike , salisbury uk europe is pathetically spineless , divided and weak and the us and russia untrustworthy and childish .
with the enlargement of the eu , any possibility of a common foreign and defense policy is lost which is why it is necessary to retain the british nuclear deterrent , however russia itself poses little threat as long as we maintain independent energy supplies -lrb- i.e. nuclear -rrb- as at the moment the russian state does not have the money to throw at a huge increase in its military capability .
european incompetence on foreign policy is just staggering . , why do we always dodge the real issue - oil ?
the ongoing iraq war is about installing a u.s. friendly regime to secure oil for america 's future energy requirements .
the war in afghanistan is due to the taliban not allowing a gas-pipe to run through it from kazakhstan to the pakistan coast .
and now that iran has started negotiating oil sales to china , instead of america , the u.s. seems to be moving its pieces around the global chess-board in readiness to secure yet more oil , by force -lrb- again -rrb- if need be .
no wonder putin 's worried .
russia , with its own not inconsiderable oil and gas reserves , could be the next battleground - sandwiched between china one side , and america 's ams on the other .
robert hossack , st austell , uk all i see is american neo-cons forcing their world view agenda & russian fascists pushing theirs .
all it does is highlight europe 's weakness , even if you 're generous it 's obvious that economic " soft power " can only get you so far .
europe has common interests with both america and russia but without europe-wide co-ordinated miltary procurement , strategy and forces then europe will always be stepped on by one or the other or both .
until europe has the military muscle to push it 's viewpoint and command some respect then we 'll always be sidelined and at risk .
chas , manchester , uk we must do everything in our power not to become dependent on russian gas and oil .
back track on deals already done or in negotiations .
the americans are playing some long term strategy for their own benefit .
just keep out of it .
ray sparrow , woodley england i 'm an american engineer who earned my living designing missile defense systems for many years , and i agree with russia .
this is the start of a world-wide system of surveillance radars and interceptor missiles .
it is part of the neocon 's agenda to establish a lasting american hegemony .
countries who do not wish to live under such a new world order should oppose it now .
george works , st. eustatius , netherlands antilles in ascribing to the latest ' defensive ' missile plan a diabolically devious long-term plan to ensure us hegemony well into the 21st century is probably to credit us foreign policy planners with far more intelligence and foresight than history suggests they actually possess .
the problem for us all , including mr putin , is not that the us is too clever , too sophisticated in its understanding of the world and us global interests : the problem surely is the dangerously unsophisticated world view which permeates all levels of american society , including the higher echelons of the us administration .
shouting at mr bush et al from behind the barricades is counter-productive in-so-far as it only serves to further reinforce their simplistic perception of foreign affairs .
in school , in life and in the conduct of foreign policy understanding is more usually achieved through reasoned explanation , rather than polemics or confrontation .
mark , bristol do not think that everyone in america -lrb- usa -rrb- supports this " shield " for europe .
most of us in the us do not want this war in iraq , we do not want nato , we do not want our troops in europe , we do not support " free trade " or " globilization " .
do n't just judge us by cnn or " w " .
he does not speak for most of us .
give america some credit .
at least we try to pretend to care about others , we raise money for relief efforts , some of us are trying to be good world citizens ... so do n't give up on america .
please .
marc daniel , charleston , south carolina , usa excellent summary from fyodor lukyanov ...
what i wonder is whether mr lukyanov would agree that , from the usa 's point of view , the ams could be perceived as a mechanism for diverting global attention away from us failures / war crimes -lrb- depending on your point of view -rrb- in the middle east .
this dispute flared up a couple of months ago , when the 4-year anniversary of the iraq invasion had just been clocked , the democrat-led congress was fighting for withdrawal -lrb- which it seems to have given up , sadly -rrb- , and us military strategy was under intense scrutiny and criticism .
suddenly the front page focus is all on russia , and the eu and usa seem to have succesfully sidelined the issues of the middle east and other problem areas .
the middle east is no less volatile than before , with palestine , lebanon and turkey / kurdistan witnessing either mass violence or heightened tensions , guantanamo is in a legal shambles , israel 's brutal military occupation of palestine is reaching its landmark 40th anniversary , yet the top international stories have consistently been putin 's rhetoric on the west and the ams , the russia-estonia clashes , and so on .
president putin insists that the ams is an affront because there is no threat to the us from either iran or north korea - apparently iran have no icbms and will not do so for 5-8 years , and as for north korea - if they were to attack the usa , even in theory , surely they would go over the pacific , which is much shorter in distance ?
there are plenty of indicators that the threat countered by the ams is a fabrication , and recent history has shown that the us -lrb- and uk -rrb- governments under the present administrations are prepared to lie to the public to get what they want .
it is one thing to say that putin is electioneering , which is a perfectly reasonable theory , but given that both the current us and uk governments may well be on their way out within the next two years , this could be perceived as a last stand to ensure that their neo-conservative , ' new american century ' ways remain embedded in the global political framework .
-lrb- they really have nothing to fear , for , as zbigniew brzezinski shows in his latest book , the democrats ' way of thinking in foreign policy does n't differ hugely in its imperialist overtones -rrb- .
as for the czechs and poles and the east-west europe divide , it is the usa , still the global superpower despite upsurges from india , china , russia and others , which has the most to gain from exploiting these disagreements .
they continue to " divide and rule " , as they always have , all over the world .
putin 's russia is countering the usa 's power games by befriending the middle east -lrb- talk of a ' gas-opec ' or equivalent " forum " springs to mind straight away -rrb- and builiding diplomatic and economic relations with strategic countries including venezuela , kazakhstan , japan , and china .
simon lewis , london , uk well ...
i try to look @ it from both sides .
the whole plan is useless .
if someone wants to fire a nuke , they will .
if they do then ?
guess we are done as humans .
every single one of us know the consequences .
oh , wait a minute !
someone did drop the bomb , right ?
anyway ...
i hope peace will prevail as usual .
its only going to take all the righteous to bond together and defeat whatever evil that is out there !
jzen , sf , california russia only has to worry about the us anti-missile defence if she plans on firing her nuclear missiles .
does russia really anticipate doing this ?
if so then we need the protection of the shield and if not then russia can laugh as bush wasting billions .
peter , nottingham the idea of an unopposed and un-opposable us superpower , a power that need not fear anyone else and is able to obtain the ' full spectrum dominance ' it craves , is deeply scary .
the quiet birth of the kind of global dominance set out in the project for a new american century , must be noticed .
or else we may see a kind of global apartheid , where the us gets whatever it wants whenever it wants and howsoever it desires and the only way for any other nation to have its interests even nearly served is to be play lap dog .
just as the us thought it was its manifest destiny to control the continent of north america , at the expense of the natives , it now seems to think it is its manifest destiny to control the globe , at the expense of every other person on the planet .
at least the cold war brought balance .
james waldorf-nicol , kent , uk mr lukyanov said : " if the idea of a global anti-missile system becomes a reality , the nuclear capability of russia , china and other countries will be undermined . "
and why exactly is this a bad thing ?
surely we , in europe , would be safer if russia and china were unable to use their nuclear weapons against us ?
i find it very hard to sympathise with the russian viewpoint when their president is threatening to point nukes at us ... -lsb- no name supplied -rsb- " russia only has to worry about the us anti-missile defence if she plans on firing her nuclear missiles .
does russia really anticipate doing this ?
if so then we need the protection of the shield and if not then russia can laugh as bush wasting billions . "
you miss the point entirely .
a system like this can be used aggressively .
the us can launch a strike against another nation in full knowledge that that nation can not strike back .
it is the death of the concept of mutually assured destruction which is what prevented the cold war escalating .
the us can use the leverage of its ability to launch unanswered nuclear and conventional strikes to achieve whatever it demands .
james waldorf-nicol , kent , uk putin is totally right to be concerned .
the us hypocrisy on this is frightening .
why should russia 's reaction to us plans be described as aggressive and unhelpful when it is us plans for domination that give rise to this level of anxiety the globe over .
some are describing this as ' cold peace ' - i do n't think the us ever ended the cold war ... and are now threating a nuclear strike on iran to stop it developing a defence against us armed israel !
as a us general said long ago - " we fought ww1 in europe , we fought ww2 in europe and if you fools let us we 'll fight ww3 there too " . grahame , sheffield i 've thought from the start that this all seems like the us causing trouble , and reading more into the background just strengthens my views .
bush is n't trying to protect " the homeland " , he is sending out a message that the us is in charge , and in charge of a lot .
i 'm sorry , but it 's not russia that needs to be put in it 's place , it 's the united states .
miles hayler , warwickshire , uk wake up people , the us that people looked towards for inspiration is no longer there - it has n't been since bush came to power in the questionable elections of 2000 .
although russia is n't a better option , we need a bi-polar world in order to be free and safe - each side will think very carefully before launching wars to impose their wills on the peoples of the world .
nawaz the us under the bush administration invaded iraq under false pretences so why should the russian government trust them on anti-missile systems .
president putin is right to resist this plan and it says little for the east europeans who are allowing anti-missile systems on their territory .
kenneth clark , hemel hempstead uk putin is exactly right to be concerned as should we .
whats going on with the world ?
is the eu that useless ?
why ca n't we put our own missile defence system in ?
by relying on the americans we are removing any control in world affairs we thought we had .
its pathetic how weak europe is as a power .
so weak we do n't mind being used by america as a dumping ground for shot down nuclear missiles .
tony blair 's support for bush in this makes him more than a laptop dog , it makes him a traitor .

viewpoint : russia 's missile fears i am very glad to read these words by prominent russian analyst .
he gets right to the point and gives all pros and cons of the current freeze in the us-russia relationship .
as for me , united states use eastern europe , especially those states that suffered a lot from russian empire -lrb- poland and ukraine -rrb- as a small change .
those countries feel insulted and annoyed by long lasting russian dominance , and that is why their leading politicians exploit any trifle to pinch a bear -lrb- russia -rrb- .
from 1990s up until 2004-2005 the bear was in hibernation .
now it is awakened and strives to establish status quo .
i hope the bear would have enough wisdom not to race with an eagle -lrb- us -rrb- and they would leave in peace .
otherwise , catastrophe might happen , eventually , because bears can not fly ? .
ilshat , manchester , usa even though they talk a lot about n korea and iran , but in fact , us control them quite well and they have got a lot cheaper solutions to protect anyone from the " danger " .
the ams is not related to them at all , and done for completely different purposes .
it 's geopolitics , and anyone related to it would not even mention " axis of evil " countries seriously ...
it is obvious that russia , and some other countries would be left with no choice , but develop new systems to overcome the ams .
not that they do n't do already , but as imbalance increases they would have to speed up the process .
you can say honestly -lrb- as putin did -rrb- or not talk about it openly , but there is no doubt that ams bases , radars , missiles bases , etc -lrb- russian or american -rrb- are the first targets of attack in an escalating conflict .
all that would not make any country more secured .
alex , uk president putin takes a very sensible stance on the proposed us military expansion into eastern europe .
the ams becomes an integral part of the us nuclear arsenal .
do the europeans really need american nukes in their back yard ?
russia is already surrounded by a ring of american military bases in the former eastern block states and soviet republics .
she also now shares borders with several new quazi-tyrannical states that the us keeps on a short leash and sets them off to bite russia when expedient .
the ams is another affront that does not achieve any useful purpose , but makes things globally much worse .
yuri zharikov , odessa , ukraine putin is right : the us anti-missile system is an existential threat to russia 's existance .
10 missiles now will become 1000 missiles in ten years time .
and who will guarantee the us would n't tip these alleged " anti-missile missiles " with nuke warheads ?
the defunct abm-treaty recognized that , if country 1 could nuke country 2 with impunity , because it could shoot down incoming missiles of country 2 , the only logical course of action for country 2 was to pre-emptively fire its missiles at country 1 , before country 1 had brought this anti-missile system online .
in short : " use ' em , or lose ' em " ...
roel , leuven , belgium is it any surprise that the us would want to maintain its global dominance and provide every option available , especially when we know that we can not rely on other nations to solve our problems ?
those in the eu need to realize that this is n't being unwillingly imposed on your governments .
the eu should grow a spine and prove that it can independently act without the us military / economy , otherwise nothing is going to change- get real !
additionally , it really does n't help that the russians and the chinese consistently undermine the us 's position in dealing with rouge states .
what the hell are we supposed to do ?
if those " powerful " states want to play with the big boys then so be it .
certainly there are always more diplomatic options , but the truth is every nation is out for its own interest and if there is room to expand and flex muscle , someone will always fill that vacuum .
andrew , chicago , usa quote : " many of the people i have talked to in private have told me they believe the anti-missile system is a us tactic to prevent the eu from becoming an independent player in foreign policy " .
a fantastic point which is rarely articulated - us foreign policy & particularly it 's ' special relationship with britain ' always seems divisive & geared to weaken the eu , maintaining their superior position as the world 's only superpower .
coincidence ?
iain , bristol , uk -lsb- putin 's -rsb- country is skid row , and he 's worrying about u.s. missiles ? !
john kluver bbc news website reader , tucson , usa hmm , let 's see - putin has botched the ukraine -lrb- remember he called to congratulate yanukovich -rrb- , and he 's botched georgia , the baltics and poland .
he 's killed off the free press , in particular tv , in his country .
remember that no matter what he says or does he is always portrayed as a winner on tv in russia .
russia is far less free today , for example , than it was even in 1988 in the ussr ! !
and the u.s. is supposed to listen to him ? ? ?
his country is weak and poor , and old ladies beg everywhere on the streets of moscow .
his country is skid row , and he 's worrying about u.s. missiles ? !
geez , maybe solve your domestic problems first .
should n't he worry more about russia 's shrinking population ? ?
he 's a loser leader of a loser country and he should be ignored .
john kluver , tucson , usa rogue nations .
who 's to decide which nation is a ' rogue ' one ? and what ' rogue ' exactly means ?
there are un rules and russia strictly abides with them as nuclear materials are concerned .
why the us did n't stop pakistan -lrb- israel -rrb- and bomb it into quarks after it acquired nuclear weapons ?
why iran is worse ?
pakistan is surely more unstable and unpredictable .
what if japan decides to go nuclear ?
there are no easy answers , it is better to wait and see .
a country may acquire a nuclear deterrent and behave .
you can always launch a nuclear war .
how can you stop iran ?
a military action may cause worse consequences than patient politics .
pavel , rostov , russia a pox upon both your houses .
the global economic and military dominionism of the usa government and the resurgent autocratism of putin 's government are the festering poison that is so revolting for the average citizen of the world who is trying to make a world that is livable for all it 's citizens .
the impudent arrogance of both governments is reprehensible .
harold l nicol , st paul usa ... ever since britain lost superpower status at the end of 19th century it has been thriving on balancing power dynamic between europe and the us ...
what is happening today is no different .
britain and the us are trying to keep the status quo in the regional and global distribution of power .
they are trying hard to preempt any meaningful change that can undermine their strategic positions .
they want to deny the continent any chance of emerging strong as a whole .
playing on anti-russian and pro-american sentiments in young states of eastern europe is a smart preventive tactic to weaken european unity and regional security and , thus , secure the status quo for long time to come ...
the only problems is , as mr. lukyanov put it " there are big players watching on the sidelines - china , india , and iran - that can emerge as winners " if the us gets stuck keeping european continent weak .
if , however , the us and britain jointly manage to drive another long-term wedge in europe -lrb- regional " cold war " -rrb- , it will be able to afford to get busy with weakening others .
now that will be the start of the new american century .
if that happens , britain will have to get busy making the us dependent on british as the irreplacable agents meddling in european affairs and keeping europe weak .
otherwise , britain risks being reduced to a mere lapdog of the americans .
although that will happen anyway if the us project of the new american century truly gets realized .
yevgeni , moscow , russia as a citizen of the country , ukraine , which mr lukanov calls former integral part of the soviet union , i would million times say " god bless america ! " , again , just in the case of deploying anti-missile defence shield in eastern europe , because this is completely correct and up-to-date decision , despite of my criticism of other actions of the bush 's administration .
i 'm surprised how blind sometimes western europeans are in terms of russia .
something i 've conceived of mr lukanov 's article as well as russian president 's behaviour is that this country has been planning to become new soviet union -lrb- even precursory look at modern putin 's russia displays that it had become so already -rrb- .
and i want to ask all people here so worried about global warming , why mrs merkel , if she is so worried about this issue , does not openly say that russia is major energetic terrorist ?
in the beginning of 2006 , when russia blackmailed my country by gas price , i heard words of support only from poland , baltic countries and the united states .
mrs. merkel instead called only for fast compromise between ukraine and russia , clearly understanding that the price of this compromise could be only shifting control over our main gas pipelines to russian gazprom ?
oh , of course , do german enterprises , which 40 % depend on russian gas supplies , causing pollution too , care about something like ukraine ?
oksana , kyiv , ukraine this should be discussed at the un to ratify the implications of such moves , this does n't just affect russia gerry mangan bbc news website reader , basingstoke , england this defense system tips the balance of power completely , creating a super power with the single most biggest nuclear arsenal .
what would a wannabe president with the same superiority complex as bush do with this power on nations opposed or making things difficult .
this should be discussed at the un to ratify the implications of such moves , this does n't just affect russia .
gerry mangan , basingstoke , england all russia has to do is stop providing uranium to iran , stop largely siding with them on their nuclear program and forth and stronger back the calls for north korea to disarm .
if russia was n't aiding these countries through it 's lack of will for tougher sanctions or tougher action against these nations then they would n't be a nuclear risk , hence the us would also have no excuse for needing a missile shield .
russia is as much at fault in helping give the us an excuse for a missile shield in the first place helping these rogue nations ...
ian , leeds i think that ' europe ' just need someone to be afraid of , and now i read so many anti-russian reviews and almost nothing that explains russian position without fear of ' big bad russia ' . its very pity igor , moscow , russian federation i have no brief to make for mr. putin , who seems to be more of an autocrat than a democrat .
but it is absurd to compare contemporary russia to the former soviet union .
u.s. presidents abraham lincoln , franklin d. roosevelt , and harry s. truman had the wisdom to understand that you do not treat a former foe like a convicted criminal , but rather like an errant friend whose friendship might be won again .
it was needlessly provocative to extend nato right up to the russian border , and it is needlessly provocative to attempt to put elements of an anti-missile defense in countries bordering on russia .
there are anti-ballistic missile radars and interceptor missiles that can be deployed aboard ships which can be stationed off of the coasts of north korea and iran .
this is where it is most feasable to detect and intercept ballistic missiles just after they are launched anyway .
george , somewhere in texas the onus is on russia to decide whether its imperial past or a potentially prosperous future is more important tomek bbc news website reader , londonderry , nh , us ... it is not the case that europe 's russia policy is filtered through poland ; only in the last few weeks has the eu finally recognized any of poland 's concerns about russia 's behaviors .
further , if the eu did base its policies towards russia on poland , that would still be a potentially advantageous situation for moscow , as , for all the historical hostility , most poles understand that their security and prosperity ultimately depend on finding some accommodation with russia .
poland will never be fully secure without russia also feeling secure , and an economically prosperous russia would benefit poland immensely - while an impoverished and politically unstable russia will always threaten poland 's own economic and political security .
we have no choice ; we are -lrb- relative -rrb- neighbors , like it or not , and most poles understand that just as renewed relations with germany had to be rebuilt , so too will someday a rapprochement with moscow be necessary .
that , however , will take two sides to achieve , and as i said , for now the onus is on russia to decide whether its imperial past or a potentially prosperous future is more important .
tomek , londonderry , nh usa the shield is " defensive . "
so calm down all of you america haters .
in fact , after listening to how much you hate us i think we need more defense sites .
i bet you wish you had a shield too .
well , if you 're nice we 'll put you under the umbrella .
if not , you can play with the trustworthy russians , the loving north koreans , and the ever so friendly iranians .
i 'm sorry that we 're not like them enough for you to like us .
alex turner , las vegas , us the analysis is mostly excellent .
russia , however , is not " sadly encouraging " the situation : it is all the us that is being obdurate because it can not begin to imagine life on a planet where it does not , in the manner of the most spoiled of brats , get its own way .
neither are britain & france " formerly " empires : that is just pap for the primary grades .
we all know that america , britain , france , spain & germany continue to command vast empires to this day , even if there is some self-government in their cultural or economic dependencies .
russia is not " asking to get something back " - i.e. ' superpower ' or even ' great power ' status .
russia was , and remains , a mighty nuclear power not to be taken lightly .
the idea that it was ever not powerful is as silly as the suggestion would be that american was not a global power during its global depression - or after 9/11 , or even now , when it remains on its knees in iraq & incapable of extricating itself from a small botched war .
let 's set aside the propaganda slogans & the politically correct cant , and look at simple , patent realities staring us in the face .
can the us afford to go to war with russia , for example over kosovo ?
of course not .
can europeans afford a revival of the decade of gore & agony that brought about the kosovo problem in the first place ?
not at all - much less a major or even minor conflict between the us & russia .
kindly simply turn off bush 's microphone ... & stop throwing petrol on a fire that is rapidly swelling out of control ...
maria amadei ashot , berkeley , california i 'm not sure i particularly believe / trust russia or the us , but i do envy russia 's ability and willingness to stand up to bush and say ' no ' .
nik , milton keynes why does america antagonize russia while pretending that unapologetically totalitarian regimes in p. r. of china and saudi arabia are ' friends ' ?
mike bbc news website reader , ancaster , ontario , canada the true question is why america is taking this course of action against russia at this time ?
its military is overstretched , its global popularity is at an all-time-low , and russia is one of the few world powers that is content to not challenge america if it is left alone .
why does america antagonize russia while pretending that unapologetically totalitarian regimes in p. r. of china and saudi arabia are ' friends ' ?
mike , ancaster , ontario , canada the fact of the matter is , the american have provided security to the world , can you imagine without american security ?
god bless america ...
alex , london great analysis !
when the ussr put nuclear missiles in cuba it did n't change anything strategically either , both the us and the su were capable of mutual destruction .
a few extra missiles fired from cuba would not have changed that .
yet , the americans made a huge fuss about it !
that 's exactly the situation here , anything that diminishes or degrades russia 's nuclear capability is clearly an act of aggression .
vladislav , moscow what a shame that no eu country leader has guts to accept that mr putin is right .
alan , amazing timing : did bush and putin agree in advance of the g8 meeting to have this missile issue overshadow ... global warming , so that they could avoid having to discuss it ?
colin mckenzie bbc news website reader , manchester , uk amazing timing : did bush and putin agree in advance of the g8 meeting to have this missile issue overshadow the very real threat to this planet , global warming , so that they could avoid having to discuss it ?
and by the way has bush ever stopped to think that rising sea levels caused by global warming triggered by us in-action could be just as devastating to coastal areas of nuclear armed india and pakistan as a direct attack on them and that at some point in many years time they may point their weapons at the us to save their own land ?
colin mckenzie , manchester , uk the article that is presented here has some validity in some respect about the protection of eastern european countries because neither the russian nor the western eurpean countries would come forward to protect them other than united states of america .
the eastern europeans feel much secure if the americans are there to save them and by virtue if and when their security interests are jeopardized by either western europe or the russians .
in this context , it is fair to point out that out of this tension about the missile defense system initiated by the u.s may have some validity to the protection of europe overall as we all know that western europe will not make such a defense plan that would serve up as a common goal for all europeans .
it is not only going to bankrupt them but also will not have a cohessive defense policy to safeguard european interest .
yes , putin may have a reason to be upset about but he may take it easy not worrying to much about russian security interest because he has asserted himself aligning with the the americans and the europeans in a common security interest of the global world that we live in .
he must realize that the old geopolitical game that had been fought early in the 20th century is not going to work and for that reason he must work jointly with the u.s to irradicate poverty , terrorism from the face of this earth .
azim , harrisburg , pa , united states yes we did drop the bomb ... and the entire planet was not destroyed .
as a matter of fact , the enemy did not care enough about therr own people so we had to drop a second one before they surrendered .
it 's tough being the only remaining super power .
it would be a lot tougher on the rest of you , if we were n't .
chuck d , us mil - deployed i think the bases could just be a wedge issue to put pressure on russia to deal with iran .
it 's the russians who are building the reactor for tehran .
i would n't be suprised if the state department says " russia , if you can help us make sure iran does n't get the bomb we wo n't humiliate you by putting these bases in your former sphere of influence . "
the same goes for the british and the russian spy case .
it might all be a way to put pressure on moscow .
tj , south dakota usa it 's obvious that the west is on the path of confrontation with anything it regards as ' incompatible ' with western interests and was encouraged , so to speak , by the unbalance in the unsc after the ussr and allies ceased to exist .
it was offered a finger and decided to go for the whole hand .
the russian government finds that the circling of its territory by us / nato -lrb- and belittling of slavs ? -rrb- has gone far enough - rightfully imo - and is determined to restore the balance .
we should get used to the idea that there ca n't be a yin without yang .
jj van kempen , den haag , netherlands why is everyone so quick to call the united states a bully ?
modern russia under putin is just the ussr by another name .
it is deeply unsettling .
have we forgotten their barbarousness in afghanistan and inside the iron curtain ?
putin is ... a despotic autocrat - just how accountable is he ?
is russia trustworthy ?
no.they use their new-found economic clout to strangle former cis countries .
is russia stable ?
no .
what happens when oil prices drop etc ?
why should we continue fearing a vast poverty stricken country with a declining population.why ca n't the us protect the west from nuclear attacks ?
russia only need to fear this if they plan on bombing the west otherwise they should relax .
why should we respond every time a decaying ex-superpower wants to flex its muscles ?
maybe the nuclear defence system might finally highlight the absurdity of nuclear missiles .
if not- at least we 're safe .
dexter galvin , dublin , ireland no-one needs to be a lap dog , and surely no-one will laugh if us does put the missiles shield .
takes one or the other radical view point to tip the balance , does n't it ?
actually , it might not happen -lrb- it 's expensive and military spend only helps sending us into a solid budget deficit -rrb- - some of the us objectives are already achieved 100 % anyway - divide and conquer that is .
it 's amazing how oblivious people remain : may i ask a simple question - to whose benefit the current situation is ? who exactly is provoking , dividing and conquering ; preventing us to benefit ?
has eu not learnt any lessons from history ? we have a great leverage of strong western economies and a willing growing strong market next door !
as well as an excellent collar for provision of peace .
let 's be honest - it 's a gold mine for the city ..
why in the world are we not pursuing it and entertaining someone else 's tactics and interests -lrb- who 's interests , by the way , do not include our wellbeing - wake up -rrb- ? ? , london mr lukyanov is absolutely right .
russia has every right to be aggressive in this case .
it is a cause of worry for india also and any other country with nuclear weapons if a global missile defence system comes into place .
it would give the us complete immunity in case of a war .
america is systematically trying to conquer the world .
they seem to be afraid of the fact that china , russia and india are growing stronger and want to stop this .
europe on the other hand should realise they are not going to benefit from this missile shield .
when it comes to a war , america would not care one bit what happens to europe .
europe should not alienate russia keeping old cold war memories in mind .
they have to realise the present situation with america having it selfish and dangerous objectives .
anand , bangalore i can see a few fair points in general however when talk about russia 's interest in economic growth and want to be in the club i think they should be prepare to play by the rules of the club .
can any of the developed nations see russia contributing anything to that extent other than playing cheap games with immaturity and aggressive outburst from kremlin instad of intelligent political and tactical manoeuvres to promote their genuine desire and comitment.what actualy went wrong to glasnost & perestroika one should wonder .
m thomas , london , uk europe needs what the us has to offer ! !
its not only rogue states like iran and north korea which we need to contend with , but russia as well .
the most feared would be russia , because when the chips are down , its the rogue states and russia who will join hands against the us and europe .
and believe me , its heading that way soon , unfortunately though !
juliana smith , croydon the various comments are quite enlightening .
but whatever the real reasons for this new chill in global nuclear politics , the most worrying thing may be the growing inability of u.s policy-makers to distinguish their own propaganda from real threats , and to systematically dismiss the protests of those who disagree like mr putin .
it would be excessive to claim that the world no longer cares for any thing that washington says , but people - powerless as they may be - are not idiots , and it is equally doubtful if a nation 's strategic interests can be durably ensured through browbeating and force .
the other serious reason for concern is the complacency of major nuclear stakeholders like china .
their fence sitting tactics , far from weakening the u.s or gaining them any strategic edge , has instead helped to reinforce the position of the u.s , thus enabling this latter to move its mile stones into central asia since the collapse of the ussr and its satelite states .
dominic lulu , c.d spain russia is right .
anyone who takes a detailed look at what the experts are saying and have been saying for the last decade or so -lrb- and not since last week -rrb- will know that the us , being in a unique position as the most militarily powerful nation on earth , will want to consolidate it 's position and keep ahead of the other rising powers while it can before the other world powers can catch up .
one of the ways the us will stay ahead of the others is by having a nuclear first strike option , where by the us military can destroy a rival nuclear power in a first strike without having to fear a devastating nuclear retaliatory response since what nuclear weapons the opposing military may launch -lrb- those that survived the first strike -rrb- will be intercepted by the global us abm system .
of course to set up such a system will take a few more decades -lrb- more or less -rrb- but for the us military , it will be worth it .
what we are seeing in poland and the czech republic is the first steps for such a system .
such systems will be able to track and intercept the older russian missiles that are in it 's radar coverage even if russia shoots them towards the north pole .
the us knows only they have the financial resources and technical know how to build a global abm network at this moment in time .
they are going ahead with it .
the us will not be able to impose itself on others using purely conventional means , but with wmds it can .
bablu rahman , haywards heath , u.k we polish do not want missiles on our soil , do not want to be a target but we know , we can not rely on europe which is depending on russia 's energy supplies more and more .
russia 's never been reliable partner !
you witness it on daily basis .
russia -lrb- soviet u -rrb- had destroyed our country for 50 years , plus between 1939 - 41 of wwii killed more poles then germans did .
i know us shields ai n't the best solution but at least something .
do n't get me wrong , i think that the usa is the bigest danger for peace on our globe but that 's why we need to stick with them .
this is business .
rob , krakow , poland reagan offered to make the original " star wars " systems available to other nations - " we 're not gonna give it away , they 're gonna have to pay for it ... "
if the us makes the current systems available to russia , surely that rebalances the equation ?
it could be useful for all concerned to have interceptors closer to the likely origins of hostile missile launches .
d wilson , london , uk yeah , i also agree with the article. lets agree on that us is the sole power and is trying very hard to protect its interests while undermining the others . be it the attacks on the middle east or the simplest thing like not accepting the co2 emission curbs set prior to the g8 meet .
it is doing the same thing in india by that nuclear agreement which will retard the nuclear capabilities of india while 2 nuclear countries namely china and pakistan sit next to it and mind you both are hostile to india .
devendra , new delhi , india its all about putin ...
just as russia was about to emerge from 1000 years of darkness , into the light of democratic freedom - putin and his kgb gang has plunged his people back into the abyss ...
the eu must go directly to the russian people and offer them a different vision of their future ¿ a future of a strong democratic russia - economically and politically .
the eu must explain to the russian people that because of the expansion of nato and the eu for the first time in a thousand years - russia is free from invasion from the west .
russian mothers no longer have to bury their sons by the millions due to invasion or leave their dead bodies on european battlefields due to their government alliances with western countries .
the expansion of the eu through the enlargement process and the creation of a special free trade zone including a privileged partnership with russia is the only way to guarantee freedom and democracy for russia and central asia and oil / gas supply security for europe .
larry houle , spring texas i think russia are right to object in this instance and can understand why putin has reacted in the way he has done .
i was infuriated when i heard of how the usa wanted to plant various defence systems across europe as though the continent belongs to them ...
it 's about time someone stood up to them and said ' no , this is unacceptable ' .
sarah , hereford , uk and what if russia , or venezuela , or some other party not in the freedom club , did a deal so they could place military bases in either canada or mexico -lrb- or cuba -rrb- to protect some intangible interests against unidentified parties ?
would the us stand idly by ?
also , given current us record with truth and integrity and -lrb- almost -rrb- unilateral interventionism , why should n't russia hyperventilate ? paolo , powell , usa in my opinion , we should fear not only russia , but also the us .
if russia 's and china 's nuclear capabilities are undermined , or even useless , then the us would be the only nuclear superpower capable of sending one of those missiles -lrb- of which they 've got thousands , by the way -rrb- to europe .
this situation is a double edged sword .
we , europe , should arm ourselves against both .
markus pihlström , helsingfors , finland i thought your article was another in a long list of ' pundits ' making their living by chewing up today 's news and regurgitating it to market to the masses .
until the ending statement about -lrb- russia -rrb- being " a young ... " .
it reminds me of us history in the 1800s , when today 's powerful families and organizations were first starting up , ie . ' the robber barons ' of the old west -lrb- trains and newspapers -rrb- .
i think i understand russia a bit better now - thanks .
bill , cedar rapids , iowa , usa under the current administration the moral compass of america has changed dramatically .
in a world of rapid technological advances and changes in warfare the us is pursuing an approach easily circumvented .
the us appears to becoming more out of step with the world at a time when friends and allies are most important .
combine this with the us habit of pursuing its interests at the expense of all others and we have a worrying scenario. bill wallace , perth , australia i think mr. lukyanov fails to mention the primary reason for the us missile defenses in europe : the inevitable attack by iran and north korea against poland .
as bush said , these defenses have nothing to do with russia .
russia really has no missiles to speak of .
and , even if it did , everyone in poland loves the russians .
it 's the north koreans that the polish are really concerned with .
hordes of starving north korean soldiers .
thus , every major kielbasa -lsb- polish sausage -rsb- factory must be protected .
veniamin nikolayev , philadelphia , usa take a look at the geography - if russia were to fire missiles at the usa , they would go over the north pole , not poland or the czech republic .
i would suggest , therefore , that they are next to useless as a defence against russian missiles .
now if they base any in northern canada that would be a different matter altogether .
mike , salisbury uk europe is pathetically spineless , divided and weak and the us and russia untrustworthy and childish .
with the enlargement of the eu , any possibility of a common foreign and defense policy is lost which is why it is necessary to retain the british nuclear deterrent , however russia itself poses little threat as long as we maintain independent energy supplies -lrb- i.e. nuclear -rrb- as at the moment the russian state does not have the money to throw at a huge increase in its military capability .
european incompetence on foreign policy is just staggering . , why do we always dodge the real issue - oil ?
the ongoing iraq war is about installing a u.s. friendly regime to secure oil for america 's future energy requirements .
the war in afghanistan is due to the taliban not allowing a gas-pipe to run through it from kazakhstan to the pakistan coast .
and now that iran has started negotiating oil sales to china , instead of america , the u.s. seems to be moving its pieces around the global chess-board in readiness to secure yet more oil , by force -lrb- again -rrb- if need be .
no wonder putin 's worried .
russia , with its own not inconsiderable oil and gas reserves , could be the next battleground - sandwiched between china one side , and america 's ams on the other .
robert hossack , st austell , uk all i see is american neo-cons forcing their world view agenda & russian fascists pushing theirs .
all it does is highlight europe 's weakness , even if you 're generous it 's obvious that economic " soft power " can only get you so far .
europe has common interests with both america and russia but without europe-wide co-ordinated miltary procurement , strategy and forces then europe will always be stepped on by one or the other or both .
until europe has the military muscle to push it 's viewpoint and command some respect then we 'll always be sidelined and at risk .
chas , manchester , uk we must do everything in our power not to become dependent on russian gas and oil .
back track on deals already done or in negotiations .
the americans are playing some long term strategy for their own benefit .
just keep out of it .
ray sparrow , woodley england i 'm an american engineer who earned my living designing missile defense systems for many years , and i agree with russia .
this is the start of a world-wide system of surveillance radars and interceptor missiles .
it is part of the neocon 's agenda to establish a lasting american hegemony .
countries who do not wish to live under such a new world order should oppose it now .
george works , st. eustatius , netherlands antilles in ascribing to the latest ' defensive ' missile plan a diabolically devious long-term plan to ensure us hegemony well into the 21st century is probably to credit us foreign policy planners with far more intelligence and foresight than history suggests they actually possess .
the problem for us all , including mr putin , is not that the us is too clever , too sophisticated in its understanding of the world and us global interests : the problem surely is the dangerously unsophisticated world view which permeates all levels of american society , including the higher echelons of the us administration .
shouting at mr bush et al from behind the barricades is counter-productive in-so-far as it only serves to further reinforce their simplistic perception of foreign affairs .
in school , in life and in the conduct of foreign policy understanding is more usually achieved through reasoned explanation , rather than polemics or confrontation .
mark , bristol do not think that everyone in america -lrb- usa -rrb- supports this " shield " for europe .
most of us in the us do not want this war in iraq , we do not want nato , we do not want our troops in europe , we do not support " free trade " or " globilization " .
do n't just judge us by cnn or " w " .
he does not speak for most of us .
give america some credit .
at least we try to pretend to care about others , we raise money for relief efforts , some of us are trying to be good world citizens ... so do n't give up on america .
please .
marc daniel , charleston , south carolina , usa excellent summary from fyodor lukyanov ...
what i wonder is whether mr lukyanov would agree that , from the usa 's point of view , the ams could be perceived as a mechanism for diverting global attention away from us failures / war crimes -lrb- depending on your point of view -rrb- in the middle east .
this dispute flared up a couple of months ago , when the 4-year anniversary of the iraq invasion had just been clocked , the democrat-led congress was fighting for withdrawal -lrb- which it seems to have given up , sadly -rrb- , and us military strategy was under intense scrutiny and criticism .
suddenly the front page focus is all on russia , and the eu and usa seem to have succesfully sidelined the issues of the middle east and other problem areas .
the middle east is no less volatile than before , with palestine , lebanon and turkey / kurdistan witnessing either mass violence or heightened tensions , guantanamo is in a legal shambles , israel 's brutal military occupation of palestine is reaching its landmark 40th anniversary , yet the top international stories have consistently been putin 's rhetoric on the west and the ams , the russia-estonia clashes , and so on .
president putin insists that the ams is an affront because there is no threat to the us from either iran or north korea - apparently iran have no icbms and will not do so for 5-8 years , and as for north korea - if they were to attack the usa , even in theory , surely they would go over the pacific , which is much shorter in distance ?
there are plenty of indicators that the threat countered by the ams is a fabrication , and recent history has shown that the us -lrb- and uk -rrb- governments under the present administrations are prepared to lie to the public to get what they want .
it is one thing to say that putin is electioneering , which is a perfectly reasonable theory , but given that both the current us and uk governments may well be on their way out within the next two years , this could be perceived as a last stand to ensure that their neo-conservative , ' new american century ' ways remain embedded in the global political framework .
-lrb- they really have nothing to fear , for , as zbigniew brzezinski shows in his latest book , the democrats ' way of thinking in foreign policy does n't differ hugely in its imperialist overtones -rrb- .
as for the czechs and poles and the east-west europe divide , it is the usa , still the global superpower despite upsurges from india , china , russia and others , which has the most to gain from exploiting these disagreements .
they continue to " divide and rule " , as they always have , all over the world .
putin 's russia is countering the usa 's power games by befriending the middle east -lrb- talk of a ' gas-opec ' or equivalent " forum " springs to mind straight away -rrb- and builiding diplomatic and economic relations with strategic countries including venezuela , kazakhstan , japan , and china .
simon lewis , london , uk well ...
i try to look @ it from both sides .
the whole plan is useless .
if someone wants to fire a nuke , they will .
if they do then ?
guess we are done as humans .
every single one of us know the consequences .
oh , wait a minute !
someone did drop the bomb , right ?
anyway ...
i hope peace will prevail as usual .
its only going to take all the righteous to bond together and defeat whatever evil that is out there !
jzen , sf , california russia only has to worry about the us anti-missile defence if she plans on firing her nuclear missiles .
does russia really anticipate doing this ?
if so then we need the protection of the shield and if not then russia can laugh as bush wasting billions .
peter , nottingham the idea of an unopposed and un-opposable us superpower , a power that need not fear anyone else and is able to obtain the ' full spectrum dominance ' it craves , is deeply scary .
the quiet birth of the kind of global dominance set out in the project for a new american century , must be noticed .
or else we may see a kind of global apartheid , where the us gets whatever it wants whenever it wants and howsoever it desires and the only way for any other nation to have its interests even nearly served is to be play lap dog .
just as the us thought it was its manifest destiny to control the continent of north america , at the expense of the natives , it now seems to think it is its manifest destiny to control the globe , at the expense of every other person on the planet .
at least the cold war brought balance .
james waldorf-nicol , kent , uk mr lukyanov said : " if the idea of a global anti-missile system becomes a reality , the nuclear capability of russia , china and other countries will be undermined . "
and why exactly is this a bad thing ?
surely we , in europe , would be safer if russia and china were unable to use their nuclear weapons against us ?
i find it very hard to sympathise with the russian viewpoint when their president is threatening to point nukes at us ... -lsb- no name supplied -rsb- " russia only has to worry about the us anti-missile defence if she plans on firing her nuclear missiles .
does russia really anticipate doing this ?
if so then we need the protection of the shield and if not then russia can laugh as bush wasting billions . "
you miss the point entirely .
a system like this can be used aggressively .
the us can launch a strike against another nation in full knowledge that that nation can not strike back .
it is the death of the concept of mutually assured destruction which is what prevented the cold war escalating .
the us can use the leverage of its ability to launch unanswered nuclear and conventional strikes to achieve whatever it demands .
james waldorf-nicol , kent , uk putin is totally right to be concerned .
the us hypocrisy on this is frightening .
why should russia 's reaction to us plans be described as aggressive and unhelpful when it is us plans for domination that give rise to this level of anxiety the globe over .
some are describing this as ' cold peace ' - i do n't think the us ever ended the cold war ... and are now threating a nuclear strike on iran to stop it developing a defence against us armed israel !
as a us general said long ago - " we fought ww1 in europe , we fought ww2 in europe and if you fools let us we 'll fight ww3 there too " . grahame , sheffield i 've thought from the start that this all seems like the us causing trouble , and reading more into the background just strengthens my views .
bush is n't trying to protect " the homeland " , he is sending out a message that the us is in charge , and in charge of a lot .
i 'm sorry , but it 's not russia that needs to be put in it 's place , it 's the united states .
miles hayler , warwickshire , uk wake up people , the us that people looked towards for inspiration is no longer there - it has n't been since bush came to power in the questionable elections of 2000 .
although russia is n't a better option , we need a bi-polar world in order to be free and safe - each side will think very carefully before launching wars to impose their wills on the peoples of the world .
nawaz the us under the bush administration invaded iraq under false pretences so why should the russian government trust them on anti-missile systems .
president putin is right to resist this plan and it says little for the east europeans who are allowing anti-missile systems on their territory .
kenneth clark , hemel hempstead uk putin is exactly right to be concerned as should we .
whats going on with the world ?
is the eu that useless ?
why ca n't we put our own missile defence system in ?
by relying on the americans we are removing any control in world affairs we thought we had .
its pathetic how weak europe is as a power .
so weak we do n't mind being used by america as a dumping ground for shot down nuclear missiles .
tony blair 's support for bush in this makes him more than a laptop dog , it makes him a traitor .

viewpoint : russia 's missile fears i am very glad to read these words by prominent russian analyst .
he gets right to the point and gives all pros and cons of the current freeze in the us-russia relationship .
as for me , united states use eastern europe , especially those states that suffered a lot from russian empire -lrb- poland and ukraine -rrb- as a small change .
those countries feel insulted and annoyed by long lasting russian dominance , and that is why their leading politicians exploit any trifle to pinch a bear -lrb- russia -rrb- .
from 1990s up until 2004-2005 the bear was in hibernation .
now it is awakened and strives to establish status quo .
i hope the bear would have enough wisdom not to race with an eagle -lrb- us -rrb- and they would leave in peace .
otherwise , catastrophe might happen , eventually , because bears can not fly ? .
ilshat , manchester , usa even though they talk a lot about n korea and iran , but in fact , us control them quite well and they have got a lot cheaper solutions to protect anyone from the " danger " .
the ams is not related to them at all , and done for completely different purposes .
it 's geopolitics , and anyone related to it would not even mention " axis of evil " countries seriously ...
it is obvious that russia , and some other countries would be left with no choice , but develop new systems to overcome the ams .
not that they do n't do already , but as imbalance increases they would have to speed up the process .
you can say honestly -lrb- as putin did -rrb- or not talk about it openly , but there is no doubt that ams bases , radars , missiles bases , etc -lrb- russian or american -rrb- are the first targets of attack in an escalating conflict .
all that would not make any country more secured .
alex , uk president putin takes a very sensible stance on the proposed us military expansion into eastern europe .
the ams becomes an integral part of the us nuclear arsenal .
do the europeans really need american nukes in their back yard ?
russia is already surrounded by a ring of american military bases in the former eastern block states and soviet republics .
she also now shares borders with several new quazi-tyrannical states that the us keeps on a short leash and sets them off to bite russia when expedient .
the ams is another affront that does not achieve any useful purpose , but makes things globally much worse .
yuri zharikov , odessa , ukraine putin is right : the us anti-missile system is an existential threat to russia 's existance .
10 missiles now will become 1000 missiles in ten years time .
and who will guarantee the us would n't tip these alleged " anti-missile missiles " with nuke warheads ?
the defunct abm-treaty recognized that , if country 1 could nuke country 2 with impunity , because it could shoot down incoming missiles of country 2 , the only logical course of action for country 2 was to pre-emptively fire its missiles at country 1 , before country 1 had brought this anti-missile system online .
in short : " use ' em , or lose ' em " ...
roel , leuven , belgium is it any surprise that the us would want to maintain its global dominance and provide every option available , especially when we know that we can not rely on other nations to solve our problems ?
those in the eu need to realize that this is n't being unwillingly imposed on your governments .
the eu should grow a spine and prove that it can independently act without the us military / economy , otherwise nothing is going to change- get real !
additionally , it really does n't help that the russians and the chinese consistently undermine the us 's position in dealing with rouge states .
what the hell are we supposed to do ?
if those " powerful " states want to play with the big boys then so be it .
certainly there are always more diplomatic options , but the truth is every nation is out for its own interest and if there is room to expand and flex muscle , someone will always fill that vacuum .
andrew , chicago , usa quote : " many of the people i have talked to in private have told me they believe the anti-missile system is a us tactic to prevent the eu from becoming an independent player in foreign policy " .
a fantastic point which is rarely articulated - us foreign policy & particularly it 's ' special relationship with britain ' always seems divisive & geared to weaken the eu , maintaining their superior position as the world 's only superpower .
coincidence ?
iain , bristol , uk -lsb- putin 's -rsb- country is skid row , and he 's worrying about u.s. missiles ? !
john kluver bbc news website reader , tucson , usa hmm , let 's see - putin has botched the ukraine -lrb- remember he called to congratulate yanukovich -rrb- , and he 's botched georgia , the baltics and poland .
he 's killed off the free press , in particular tv , in his country .
remember that no matter what he says or does he is always portrayed as a winner on tv in russia .
russia is far less free today , for example , than it was even in 1988 in the ussr ! !
and the u.s. is supposed to listen to him ? ? ?
his country is weak and poor , and old ladies beg everywhere on the streets of moscow .
his country is skid row , and he 's worrying about u.s. missiles ? !
geez , maybe solve your domestic problems first .
should n't he worry more about russia 's shrinking population ? ?
he 's a loser leader of a loser country and he should be ignored .
john kluver , tucson , usa rogue nations .
who 's to decide which nation is a ' rogue ' one ? and what ' rogue ' exactly means ?
there are un rules and russia strictly abides with them as nuclear materials are concerned .
why the us did n't stop pakistan -lrb- israel -rrb- and bomb it into quarks after it acquired nuclear weapons ?
why iran is worse ?
pakistan is surely more unstable and unpredictable .
what if japan decides to go nuclear ?
there are no easy answers , it is better to wait and see .
a country may acquire a nuclear deterrent and behave .
you can always launch a nuclear war .
how can you stop iran ?
a military action may cause worse consequences than patient politics .
pavel , rostov , russia a pox upon both your houses .
the global economic and military dominionism of the usa government and the resurgent autocratism of putin 's government are the festering poison that is so revolting for the average citizen of the world who is trying to make a world that is livable for all it 's citizens .
the impudent arrogance of both governments is reprehensible .
harold l nicol , st paul usa ... ever since britain lost superpower status at the end of 19th century it has been thriving on balancing power dynamic between europe and the us ...
what is happening today is no different .
britain and the us are trying to keep the status quo in the regional and global distribution of power .
they are trying hard to preempt any meaningful change that can undermine their strategic positions .
they want to deny the continent any chance of emerging strong as a whole .
playing on anti-russian and pro-american sentiments in young states of eastern europe is a smart preventive tactic to weaken european unity and regional security and , thus , secure the status quo for long time to come ...
the only problems is , as mr. lukyanov put it " there are big players watching on the sidelines - china , india , and iran - that can emerge as winners " if the us gets stuck keeping european continent weak .
if , however , the us and britain jointly manage to drive another long-term wedge in europe -lrb- regional " cold war " -rrb- , it will be able to afford to get busy with weakening others .
now that will be the start of the new american century .
if that happens , britain will have to get busy making the us dependent on british as the irreplacable agents meddling in european affairs and keeping europe weak .
otherwise , britain risks being reduced to a mere lapdog of the americans .
although that will happen anyway if the us project of the new american century truly gets realized .
yevgeni , moscow , russia as a citizen of the country , ukraine , which mr lukanov calls former integral part of the soviet union , i would million times say " god bless america ! " , again , just in the case of deploying anti-missile defence shield in eastern europe , because this is completely correct and up-to-date decision , despite of my criticism of other actions of the bush 's administration .
i 'm surprised how blind sometimes western europeans are in terms of russia .
something i 've conceived of mr lukanov 's article as well as russian president 's behaviour is that this country has been planning to become new soviet union -lrb- even precursory look at modern putin 's russia displays that it had become so already -rrb- .
and i want to ask all people here so worried about global warming , why mrs merkel , if she is so worried about this issue , does not openly say that russia is major energetic terrorist ?
in the beginning of 2006 , when russia blackmailed my country by gas price , i heard words of support only from poland , baltic countries and the united states .
mrs. merkel instead called only for fast compromise between ukraine and russia , clearly understanding that the price of this compromise could be only shifting control over our main gas pipelines to russian gazprom ?
oh , of course , do german enterprises , which 40 % depend on russian gas supplies , causing pollution too , care about something like ukraine ?
oksana , kyiv , ukraine this should be discussed at the un to ratify the implications of such moves , this does n't just affect russia gerry mangan bbc news website reader , basingstoke , england this defense system tips the balance of power completely , creating a super power with the single most biggest nuclear arsenal .
what would a wannabe president with the same superiority complex as bush do with this power on nations opposed or making things difficult .
this should be discussed at the un to ratify the implications of such moves , this does n't just affect russia .
gerry mangan , basingstoke , england all russia has to do is stop providing uranium to iran , stop largely siding with them on their nuclear program and forth and stronger back the calls for north korea to disarm .
if russia was n't aiding these countries through it 's lack of will for tougher sanctions or tougher action against these nations then they would n't be a nuclear risk , hence the us would also have no excuse for needing a missile shield .
russia is as much at fault in helping give the us an excuse for a missile shield in the first place helping these rogue nations ...
ian , leeds i think that ' europe ' just need someone to be afraid of , and now i read so many anti-russian reviews and almost nothing that explains russian position without fear of ' big bad russia ' . its very pity igor , moscow , russian federation i have no brief to make for mr. putin , who seems to be more of an autocrat than a democrat .
but it is absurd to compare contemporary russia to the former soviet union .
u.s. presidents abraham lincoln , franklin d. roosevelt , and harry s. truman had the wisdom to understand that you do not treat a former foe like a convicted criminal , but rather like an errant friend whose friendship might be won again .
it was needlessly provocative to extend nato right up to the russian border , and it is needlessly provocative to attempt to put elements of an anti-missile defense in countries bordering on russia .
there are anti-ballistic missile radars and interceptor missiles that can be deployed aboard ships which can be stationed off of the coasts of north korea and iran .
this is where it is most feasable to detect and intercept ballistic missiles just after they are launched anyway .
george , somewhere in texas the onus is on russia to decide whether its imperial past or a potentially prosperous future is more important tomek bbc news website reader , londonderry , nh , us ... it is not the case that europe 's russia policy is filtered through poland ; only in the last few weeks has the eu finally recognized any of poland 's concerns about russia 's behaviors .
further , if the eu did base its policies towards russia on poland , that would still be a potentially advantageous situation for moscow , as , for all the historical hostility , most poles understand that their security and prosperity ultimately depend on finding some accommodation with russia .
poland will never be fully secure without russia also feeling secure , and an economically prosperous russia would benefit poland immensely - while an impoverished and politically unstable russia will always threaten poland 's own economic and political security .
we have no choice ; we are -lrb- relative -rrb- neighbors , like it or not , and most poles understand that just as renewed relations with germany had to be rebuilt , so too will someday a rapprochement with moscow be necessary .
that , however , will take two sides to achieve , and as i said , for now the onus is on russia to decide whether its imperial past or a potentially prosperous future is more important .
tomek , londonderry , nh usa the shield is " defensive . "
so calm down all of you america haters .
in fact , after listening to how much you hate us i think we need more defense sites .
i bet you wish you had a shield too .
well , if you 're nice we 'll put you under the umbrella .
if not , you can play with the trustworthy russians , the loving north koreans , and the ever so friendly iranians .
i 'm sorry that we 're not like them enough for you to like us .
alex turner , las vegas , us the analysis is mostly excellent .
russia , however , is not " sadly encouraging " the situation : it is all the us that is being obdurate because it can not begin to imagine life on a planet where it does not , in the manner of the most spoiled of brats , get its own way .
neither are britain & france " formerly " empires : that is just pap for the primary grades .
we all know that america , britain , france , spain & germany continue to command vast empires to this day , even if there is some self-government in their cultural or economic dependencies .
russia is not " asking to get something back " - i.e. ' superpower ' or even ' great power ' status .
russia was , and remains , a mighty nuclear power not to be taken lightly .
the idea that it was ever not powerful is as silly as the suggestion would be that american was not a global power during its global depression - or after 9/11 , or even now , when it remains on its knees in iraq & incapable of extricating itself from a small botched war .
let 's set aside the propaganda slogans & the politically correct cant , and look at simple , patent realities staring us in the face .
can the us afford to go to war with russia , for example over kosovo ?
of course not .
can europeans afford a revival of the decade of gore & agony that brought about the kosovo problem in the first place ?
not at all - much less a major or even minor conflict between the us & russia .
kindly simply turn off bush 's microphone ... & stop throwing petrol on a fire that is rapidly swelling out of control ...
maria amadei ashot , berkeley , california i 'm not sure i particularly believe / trust russia or the us , but i do envy russia 's ability and willingness to stand up to bush and say ' no ' .
nik , milton keynes why does america antagonize russia while pretending that unapologetically totalitarian regimes in p. r. of china and saudi arabia are ' friends ' ?
mike bbc news website reader , ancaster , ontario , canada the true question is why america is taking this course of action against russia at this time ?
its military is overstretched , its global popularity is at an all-time-low , and russia is one of the few world powers that is content to not challenge america if it is left alone .
why does america antagonize russia while pretending that unapologetically totalitarian regimes in p. r. of china and saudi arabia are ' friends ' ?
mike , ancaster , ontario , canada the fact of the matter is , the american have provided security to the world , can you imagine without american security ?
god bless america ...
alex , london great analysis !
when the ussr put nuclear missiles in cuba it did n't change anything strategically either , both the us and the su were capable of mutual destruction .
a few extra missiles fired from cuba would not have changed that .
yet , the americans made a huge fuss about it !
that 's exactly the situation here , anything that diminishes or degrades russia 's nuclear capability is clearly an act of aggression .
vladislav , moscow what a shame that no eu country leader has guts to accept that mr putin is right .
alan , amazing timing : did bush and putin agree in advance of the g8 meeting to have this missile issue overshadow ... global warming , so that they could avoid having to discuss it ?
colin mckenzie bbc news website reader , manchester , uk amazing timing : did bush and putin agree in advance of the g8 meeting to have this missile issue overshadow the very real threat to this planet , global warming , so that they could avoid having to discuss it ?
and by the way has bush ever stopped to think that rising sea levels caused by global warming triggered by us in-action could be just as devastating to coastal areas of nuclear armed india and pakistan as a direct attack on them and that at some point in many years time they may point their weapons at the us to save their own land ?
colin mckenzie , manchester , uk the article that is presented here has some validity in some respect about the protection of eastern european countries because neither the russian nor the western eurpean countries would come forward to protect them other than united states of america .
the eastern europeans feel much secure if the americans are there to save them and by virtue if and when their security interests are jeopardized by either western europe or the russians .
in this context , it is fair to point out that out of this tension about the missile defense system initiated by the u.s may have some validity to the protection of europe overall as we all know that western europe will not make such a defense plan that would serve up as a common goal for all europeans .
it is not only going to bankrupt them but also will not have a cohessive defense policy to safeguard european interest .
yes , putin may have a reason to be upset about but he may take it easy not worrying to much about russian security interest because he has asserted himself aligning with the the americans and the europeans in a common security interest of the global world that we live in .
he must realize that the old geopolitical game that had been fought early in the 20th century is not going to work and for that reason he must work jointly with the u.s to irradicate poverty , terrorism from the face of this earth .
azim , harrisburg , pa , united states yes we did drop the bomb ... and the entire planet was not destroyed .
as a matter of fact , the enemy did not care enough about therr own people so we had to drop a second one before they surrendered .
it 's tough being the only remaining super power .
it would be a lot tougher on the rest of you , if we were n't .
chuck d , us mil - deployed i think the bases could just be a wedge issue to put pressure on russia to deal with iran .
it 's the russians who are building the reactor for tehran .
i would n't be suprised if the state department says " russia , if you can help us make sure iran does n't get the bomb we wo n't humiliate you by putting these bases in your former sphere of influence . "
the same goes for the british and the russian spy case .
it might all be a way to put pressure on moscow .
tj , south dakota usa it 's obvious that the west is on the path of confrontation with anything it regards as ' incompatible ' with western interests and was encouraged , so to speak , by the unbalance in the unsc after the ussr and allies ceased to exist .
it was offered a finger and decided to go for the whole hand .
the russian government finds that the circling of its territory by us / nato -lrb- and belittling of slavs ? -rrb- has gone far enough - rightfully imo - and is determined to restore the balance .
we should get used to the idea that there ca n't be a yin without yang .
jj van kempen , den haag , netherlands why is everyone so quick to call the united states a bully ?
modern russia under putin is just the ussr by another name .
it is deeply unsettling .
have we forgotten their barbarousness in afghanistan and inside the iron curtain ?
putin is ... a despotic autocrat - just how accountable is he ?
is russia trustworthy ?
no.they use their new-found economic clout to strangle former cis countries .
is russia stable ?
no .
what happens when oil prices drop etc ?
why should we continue fearing a vast poverty stricken country with a declining population.why ca n't the us protect the west from nuclear attacks ?
russia only need to fear this if they plan on bombing the west otherwise they should relax .
why should we respond every time a decaying ex-superpower wants to flex its muscles ?
maybe the nuclear defence system might finally highlight the absurdity of nuclear missiles .
if not- at least we 're safe .
dexter galvin , dublin , ireland no-one needs to be a lap dog , and surely no-one will laugh if us does put the missiles shield .
takes one or the other radical view point to tip the balance , does n't it ?
actually , it might not happen -lrb- it 's expensive and military spend only helps sending us into a solid budget deficit -rrb- - some of the us objectives are already achieved 100 % anyway - divide and conquer that is .
it 's amazing how oblivious people remain : may i ask a simple question - to whose benefit the current situation is ? who exactly is provoking , dividing and conquering ; preventing us to benefit ?
has eu not learnt any lessons from history ? we have a great leverage of strong western economies and a willing growing strong market next door !
as well as an excellent collar for provision of peace .
let 's be honest - it 's a gold mine for the city ..
why in the world are we not pursuing it and entertaining someone else 's tactics and interests -lrb- who 's interests , by the way , do not include our wellbeing - wake up -rrb- ? ? , london mr lukyanov is absolutely right .
russia has every right to be aggressive in this case .
it is a cause of worry for india also and any other country with nuclear weapons if a global missile defence system comes into place .
it would give the us complete immunity in case of a war .
america is systematically trying to conquer the world .
they seem to be afraid of the fact that china , russia and india are growing stronger and want to stop this .
europe on the other hand should realise they are not going to benefit from this missile shield .
when it comes to a war , america would not care one bit what happens to europe .
europe should not alienate russia keeping old cold war memories in mind .
they have to realise the present situation with america having it selfish and dangerous objectives .
anand , bangalore i can see a few fair points in general however when talk about russia 's interest in economic growth and want to be in the club i think they should be prepare to play by the rules of the club .
can any of the developed nations see russia contributing anything to that extent other than playing cheap games with immaturity and aggressive outburst from kremlin instad of intelligent political and tactical manoeuvres to promote their genuine desire and comitment.what actualy went wrong to glasnost & perestroika one should wonder .
m thomas , london , uk europe needs what the us has to offer ! !
its not only rogue states like iran and north korea which we need to contend with , but russia as well .
the most feared would be russia , because when the chips are down , its the rogue states and russia who will join hands against the us and europe .
and believe me , its heading that way soon , unfortunately though !
juliana smith , croydon the various comments are quite enlightening .
but whatever the real reasons for this new chill in global nuclear politics , the most worrying thing may be the growing inability of u.s policy-makers to distinguish their own propaganda from real threats , and to systematically dismiss the protests of those who disagree like mr putin .
it would be excessive to claim that the world no longer cares for any thing that washington says , but people - powerless as they may be - are not idiots , and it is equally doubtful if a nation 's strategic interests can be durably ensured through browbeating and force .
the other serious reason for concern is the complacency of major nuclear stakeholders like china .
their fence sitting tactics , far from weakening the u.s or gaining them any strategic edge , has instead helped to reinforce the position of the u.s , thus enabling this latter to move its mile stones into central asia since the collapse of the ussr and its satelite states .
dominic lulu , c.d spain russia is right .
anyone who takes a detailed look at what the experts are saying and have been saying for the last decade or so -lrb- and not since last week -rrb- will know that the us , being in a unique position as the most militarily powerful nation on earth , will want to consolidate it 's position and keep ahead of the other rising powers while it can before the other world powers can catch up .
one of the ways the us will stay ahead of the others is by having a nuclear first strike option , where by the us military can destroy a rival nuclear power in a first strike without having to fear a devastating nuclear retaliatory response since what nuclear weapons the opposing military may launch -lrb- those that survived the first strike -rrb- will be intercepted by the global us abm system .
of course to set up such a system will take a few more decades -lrb- more or less -rrb- but for the us military , it will be worth it .
what we are seeing in poland and the czech republic is the first steps for such a system .
such systems will be able to track and intercept the older russian missiles that are in it 's radar coverage even if russia shoots them towards the north pole .
the us knows only they have the financial resources and technical know how to build a global abm network at this moment in time .
they are going ahead with it .
the us will not be able to impose itself on others using purely conventional means , but with wmds it can .
bablu rahman , haywards heath , u.k we polish do not want missiles on our soil , do not want to be a target but we know , we can not rely on europe which is depending on russia 's energy supplies more and more .
russia 's never been reliable partner !
you witness it on daily basis .
russia -lrb- soviet u -rrb- had destroyed our country for 50 years , plus between 1939 - 41 of wwii killed more poles then germans did .
i know us shields ai n't the best solution but at least something .
do n't get me wrong , i think that the usa is the bigest danger for peace on our globe but that 's why we need to stick with them .
this is business .
rob , krakow , poland reagan offered to make the original " star wars " systems available to other nations - " we 're not gonna give it away , they 're gonna have to pay for it ... "
if the us makes the current systems available to russia , surely that rebalances the equation ?
it could be useful for all concerned to have interceptors closer to the likely origins of hostile missile launches .
d wilson , london , uk yeah , i also agree with the article. lets agree on that us is the sole power and is trying very hard to protect its interests while undermining the others . be it the attacks on the middle east or the simplest thing like not accepting the co2 emission curbs set prior to the g8 meet .
it is doing the same thing in india by that nuclear agreement which will retard the nuclear capabilities of india while 2 nuclear countries namely china and pakistan sit next to it and mind you both are hostile to india .
devendra , new delhi , india its all about putin ...
just as russia was about to emerge from 1000 years of darkness , into the light of democratic freedom - putin and his kgb gang has plunged his people back into the abyss ...
the eu must go directly to the russian people and offer them a different vision of their future ¿ a future of a strong democratic russia - economically and politically .
the eu must explain to the russian people that because of the expansion of nato and the eu for the first time in a thousand years - russia is free from invasion from the west .
russian mothers no longer have to bury their sons by the millions due to invasion or leave their dead bodies on european battlefields due to their government alliances with western countries .
the expansion of the eu through the enlargement process and the creation of a special free trade zone including a privileged partnership with russia is the only way to guarantee freedom and democracy for russia and central asia and oil / gas supply security for europe .
larry houle , spring texas i think russia are right to object in this instance and can understand why putin has reacted in the way he has done .
i was infuriated when i heard of how the usa wanted to plant various defence systems across europe as though the continent belongs to them ...
it 's about time someone stood up to them and said ' no , this is unacceptable ' .
sarah , hereford , uk and what if russia , or venezuela , or some other party not in the freedom club , did a deal so they could place military bases in either canada or mexico -lrb- or cuba -rrb- to protect some intangible interests against unidentified parties ?
would the us stand idly by ?
also , given current us record with truth and integrity and -lrb- almost -rrb- unilateral interventionism , why should n't russia hyperventilate ? paolo , powell , usa in my opinion , we should fear not only russia , but also the us .
if russia 's and china 's nuclear capabilities are undermined , or even useless , then the us would be the only nuclear superpower capable of sending one of those missiles -lrb- of which they 've got thousands , by the way -rrb- to europe .
this situation is a double edged sword .
we , europe , should arm ourselves against both .
markus pihlström , helsingfors , finland i thought your article was another in a long list of ' pundits ' making their living by chewing up today 's news and regurgitating it to market to the masses .
until the ending statement about -lrb- russia -rrb- being " a young ... " .
it reminds me of us history in the 1800s , when today 's powerful families and organizations were first starting up , ie . ' the robber barons ' of the old west -lrb- trains and newspapers -rrb- .
i think i understand russia a bit better now - thanks .
bill , cedar rapids , iowa , usa under the current administration the moral compass of america has changed dramatically .
in a world of rapid technological advances and changes in warfare the us is pursuing an approach easily circumvented .
the us appears to becoming more out of step with the world at a time when friends and allies are most important .
combine this with the us habit of pursuing its interests at the expense of all others and we have a worrying scenario. bill wallace , perth , australia i think mr. lukyanov fails to mention the primary reason for the us missile defenses in europe : the inevitable attack by iran and north korea against poland .
as bush said , these defenses have nothing to do with russia .
russia really has no missiles to speak of .
and , even if it did , everyone in poland loves the russians .
it 's the north koreans that the polish are really concerned with .
hordes of starving north korean soldiers .
thus , every major kielbasa -lsb- polish sausage -rsb- factory must be protected .
veniamin nikolayev , philadelphia , usa take a look at the geography - if russia were to fire missiles at the usa , they would go over the north pole , not poland or the czech republic .
i would suggest , therefore , that they are next to useless as a defence against russian missiles .
now if they base any in northern canada that would be a different matter altogether .
mike , salisbury uk europe is pathetically spineless , divided and weak and the us and russia untrustworthy and childish .
with the enlargement of the eu , any possibility of a common foreign and defense policy is lost which is why it is necessary to retain the british nuclear deterrent , however russia itself poses little threat as long as we maintain independent energy supplies -lrb- i.e. nuclear -rrb- as at the moment the russian state does not have the money to throw at a huge increase in its military capability .
european incompetence on foreign policy is just staggering . , why do we always dodge the real issue - oil ?
the ongoing iraq war is about installing a u.s. friendly regime to secure oil for america 's future energy requirements .
the war in afghanistan is due to the taliban not allowing a gas-pipe to run through it from kazakhstan to the pakistan coast .
and now that iran has started negotiating oil sales to china , instead of america , the u.s. seems to be moving its pieces around the global chess-board in readiness to secure yet more oil , by force -lrb- again -rrb- if need be .
no wonder putin 's worried .
russia , with its own not inconsiderable oil and gas reserves , could be the next battleground - sandwiched between china one side , and america 's ams on the other .
robert hossack , st austell , uk all i see is american neo-cons forcing their world view agenda & russian fascists pushing theirs .
all it does is highlight europe 's weakness , even if you 're generous it 's obvious that economic " soft power " can only get you so far .
europe has common interests with both america and russia but without europe-wide co-ordinated miltary procurement , strategy and forces then europe will always be stepped on by one or the other or both .
until europe has the military muscle to push it 's viewpoint and command some respect then we 'll always be sidelined and at risk .
chas , manchester , uk we must do everything in our power not to become dependent on russian gas and oil .
back track on deals already done or in negotiations .
the americans are playing some long term strategy for their own benefit .
just keep out of it .
ray sparrow , woodley england i 'm an american engineer who earned my living designing missile defense systems for many years , and i agree with russia .
this is the start of a world-wide system of surveillance radars and interceptor missiles .
it is part of the neocon 's agenda to establish a lasting american hegemony .
countries who do not wish to live under such a new world order should oppose it now .
george works , st. eustatius , netherlands antilles in ascribing to the latest ' defensive ' missile plan a diabolically devious long-term plan to ensure us hegemony well into the 21st century is probably to credit us foreign policy planners with far more intelligence and foresight than history suggests they actually possess .
the problem for us all , including mr putin , is not that the us is too clever , too sophisticated in its understanding of the world and us global interests : the problem surely is the dangerously unsophisticated world view which permeates all levels of american society , including the higher echelons of the us administration .
shouting at mr bush et al from behind the barricades is counter-productive in-so-far as it only serves to further reinforce their simplistic perception of foreign affairs .
in school , in life and in the conduct of foreign policy understanding is more usually achieved through reasoned explanation , rather than polemics or confrontation .
mark , bristol do not think that everyone in america -lrb- usa -rrb- supports this " shield " for europe .
most of us in the us do not want this war in iraq , we do not want nato , we do not want our troops in europe , we do not support " free trade " or " globilization " .
do n't just judge us by cnn or " w " .
he does not speak for most of us .
give america some credit .
at least we try to pretend to care about others , we raise money for relief efforts , some of us are trying to be good world citizens ... so do n't give up on america .
please .
marc daniel , charleston , south carolina , usa excellent summary from fyodor lukyanov ...
what i wonder is whether mr lukyanov would agree that , from the usa 's point of view , the ams could be perceived as a mechanism for diverting global attention away from us failures / war crimes -lrb- depending on your point of view -rrb- in the middle east .
this dispute flared up a couple of months ago , when the 4-year anniversary of the iraq invasion had just been clocked , the democrat-led congress was fighting for withdrawal -lrb- which it seems to have given up , sadly -rrb- , and us military strategy was under intense scrutiny and criticism .
suddenly the front page focus is all on russia , and the eu and usa seem to have succesfully sidelined the issues of the middle east and other problem areas .
the middle east is no less volatile than before , with palestine , lebanon and turkey / kurdistan witnessing either mass violence or heightened tensions , guantanamo is in a legal shambles , israel 's brutal military occupation of palestine is reaching its landmark 40th anniversary , yet the top international stories have consistently been putin 's rhetoric on the west and the ams , the russia-estonia clashes , and so on .
president putin insists that the ams is an affront because there is no threat to the us from either iran or north korea - apparently iran have no icbms and will not do so for 5-8 years , and as for north korea - if they were to attack the usa , even in theory , surely they would go over the pacific , which is much shorter in distance ?
there are plenty of indicators that the threat countered by the ams is a fabrication , and recent history has shown that the us -lrb- and uk -rrb- governments under the present administrations are prepared to lie to the public to get what they want .
it is one thing to say that putin is electioneering , which is a perfectly reasonable theory , but given that both the current us and uk governments may well be on their way out within the next two years , this could be perceived as a last stand to ensure that their neo-conservative , ' new american century ' ways remain embedded in the global political framework .
-lrb- they really have nothing to fear , for , as zbigniew brzezinski shows in his latest book , the democrats ' way of thinking in foreign policy does n't differ hugely in its imperialist overtones -rrb- .
as for the czechs and poles and the east-west europe divide , it is the usa , still the global superpower despite upsurges from india , china , russia and others , which has the most to gain from exploiting these disagreements .
they continue to " divide and rule " , as they always have , all over the world .
putin 's russia is countering the usa 's power games by befriending the middle east -lrb- talk of a ' gas-opec ' or equivalent " forum " springs to mind straight away -rrb- and builiding diplomatic and economic relations with strategic countries including venezuela , kazakhstan , japan , and china .
simon lewis , london , uk well ...
i try to look @ it from both sides .
the whole plan is useless .
if someone wants to fire a nuke , they will .
if they do then ?
guess we are done as humans .
every single one of us know the consequences .
oh , wait a minute !
someone did drop the bomb , right ?
anyway ...
i hope peace will prevail as usual .
its only going to take all the righteous to bond together and defeat whatever evil that is out there !
jzen , sf , california russia only has to worry about the us anti-missile defence if she plans on firing her nuclear missiles .
does russia really anticipate doing this ?
if so then we need the protection of the shield and if not then russia can laugh as bush wasting billions .
peter , nottingham the idea of an unopposed and un-opposable us superpower , a power that need not fear anyone else and is able to obtain the ' full spectrum dominance ' it craves , is deeply scary .
the quiet birth of the kind of global dominance set out in the project for a new american century , must be noticed .
or else we may see a kind of global apartheid , where the us gets whatever it wants whenever it wants and howsoever it desires and the only way for any other nation to have its interests even nearly served is to be play lap dog .
just as the us thought it was its manifest destiny to control the continent of north america , at the expense of the natives , it now seems to think it is its manifest destiny to control the globe , at the expense of every other person on the planet .
at least the cold war brought balance .
james waldorf-nicol , kent , uk mr lukyanov said : " if the idea of a global anti-missile system becomes a reality , the nuclear capability of russia , china and other countries will be undermined . "
and why exactly is this a bad thing ?
surely we , in europe , would be safer if russia and china were unable to use their nuclear weapons against us ?
i find it very hard to sympathise with the russian viewpoint when their president is threatening to point nukes at us ... -lsb- no name supplied -rsb- " russia only has to worry about the us anti-missile defence if she plans on firing her nuclear missiles .
does russia really anticipate doing this ?
if so then we need the protection of the shield and if not then russia can laugh as bush wasting billions . "
you miss the point entirely .
a system like this can be used aggressively .
the us can launch a strike against another nation in full knowledge that that nation can not strike back .
it is the death of the concept of mutually assured destruction which is what prevented the cold war escalating .
the us can use the leverage of its ability to launch unanswered nuclear and conventional strikes to achieve whatever it demands .
james waldorf-nicol , kent , uk putin is totally right to be concerned .
the us hypocrisy on this is frightening .
why should russia 's reaction to us plans be described as aggressive and unhelpful when it is us plans for domination that give rise to this level of anxiety the globe over .
some are describing this as ' cold peace ' - i do n't think the us ever ended the cold war ... and are now threating a nuclear strike on iran to stop it developing a defence against us armed israel !
as a us general said long ago - " we fought ww1 in europe , we fought ww2 in europe and if you fools let us we 'll fight ww3 there too " . grahame , sheffield i 've thought from the start that this all seems like the us causing trouble , and reading more into the background just strengthens my views .
bush is n't trying to protect " the homeland " , he is sending out a message that the us is in charge , and in charge of a lot .
i 'm sorry , but it 's not russia that needs to be put in it 's place , it 's the united states .
miles hayler , warwickshire , uk wake up people , the us that people looked towards for inspiration is no longer there - it has n't been since bush came to power in the questionable elections of 2000 .
although russia is n't a better option , we need a bi-polar world in order to be free and safe - each side will think very carefully before launching wars to impose their wills on the peoples of the world .
nawaz the us under the bush administration invaded iraq under false pretences so why should the russian government trust them on anti-missile systems .
president putin is right to resist this plan and it says little for the east europeans who are allowing anti-missile systems on their territory .
kenneth clark , hemel hempstead uk putin is exactly right to be concerned as should we .
whats going on with the world ?
is the eu that useless ?
why ca n't we put our own missile defence system in ?
by relying on the americans we are removing any control in world affairs we thought we had .
its pathetic how weak europe is as a power .
so weak we do n't mind being used by america as a dumping ground for shot down nuclear missiles .
tony blair 's support for bush in this makes him more than a laptop dog , it makes him a traitor .

viewpoint : russia 's missile fears i am very glad to read these words by prominent russian analyst .
he gets right to the point and gives all pros and cons of the current freeze in the us-russia relationship .
as for me , united states use eastern europe , especially those states that suffered a lot from russian empire -lrb- poland and ukraine -rrb- as a small change .
those countries feel insulted and annoyed by long lasting russian dominance , and that is why their leading politicians exploit any trifle to pinch a bear -lrb- russia -rrb- .
from 1990s up until 2004-2005 the bear was in hibernation .
now it is awakened and strives to establish status quo .
i hope the bear would have enough wisdom not to race with an eagle -lrb- us -rrb- and they would leave in peace .
otherwise , catastrophe might happen , eventually , because bears can not fly ? .
ilshat , manchester , usa even though they talk a lot about n korea and iran , but in fact , us control them quite well and they have got a lot cheaper solutions to protect anyone from the " danger " .
the ams is not related to them at all , and done for completely different purposes .
it 's geopolitics , and anyone related to it would not even mention " axis of evil " countries seriously ...
it is obvious that russia , and some other countries would be left with no choice , but develop new systems to overcome the ams .
not that they do n't do already , but as imbalance increases they would have to speed up the process .
you can say honestly -lrb- as putin did -rrb- or not talk about it openly , but there is no doubt that ams bases , radars , missiles bases , etc -lrb- russian or american -rrb- are the first targets of attack in an escalating conflict .
all that would not make any country more secured .
alex , uk president putin takes a very sensible stance on the proposed us military expansion into eastern europe .
the ams becomes an integral part of the us nuclear arsenal .
do the europeans really need american nukes in their back yard ?
russia is already surrounded by a ring of american military bases in the former eastern block states and soviet republics .
she also now shares borders with several new quazi-tyrannical states that the us keeps on a short leash and sets them off to bite russia when expedient .
the ams is another affront that does not achieve any useful purpose , but makes things globally much worse .
yuri zharikov , odessa , ukraine putin is right : the us anti-missile system is an existential threat to russia 's existance .
10 missiles now will become 1000 missiles in ten years time .
and who will guarantee the us would n't tip these alleged " anti-missile missiles " with nuke warheads ?
the defunct abm-treaty recognized that , if country 1 could nuke country 2 with impunity , because it could shoot down incoming missiles of country 2 , the only logical course of action for country 2 was to pre-emptively fire its missiles at country 1 , before country 1 had brought this anti-missile system online .
in short : " use ' em , or lose ' em " ...
roel , leuven , belgium is it any surprise that the us would want to maintain its global dominance and provide every option available , especially when we know that we can not rely on other nations to solve our problems ?
those in the eu need to realize that this is n't being unwillingly imposed on your governments .
the eu should grow a spine and prove that it can independently act without the us military / economy , otherwise nothing is going to change- get real !
additionally , it really does n't help that the russians and the chinese consistently undermine the us 's position in dealing with rouge states .
what the hell are we supposed to do ?
if those " powerful " states want to play with the big boys then so be it .
certainly there are always more diplomatic options , but the truth is every nation is out for its own interest and if there is room to expand and flex muscle , someone will always fill that vacuum .
andrew , chicago , usa quote : " many of the people i have talked to in private have told me they believe the anti-missile system is a us tactic to prevent the eu from becoming an independent player in foreign policy " .
a fantastic point which is rarely articulated - us foreign policy & particularly it 's ' special relationship with britain ' always seems divisive & geared to weaken the eu , maintaining their superior position as the world 's only superpower .
coincidence ?
iain , bristol , uk -lsb- putin 's -rsb- country is skid row , and he 's worrying about u.s. missiles ? !
john kluver bbc news website reader , tucson , usa hmm , let 's see - putin has botched the ukraine -lrb- remember he called to congratulate yanukovich -rrb- , and he 's botched georgia , the baltics and poland .
he 's killed off the free press , in particular tv , in his country .
remember that no matter what he says or does he is always portrayed as a winner on tv in russia .
russia is far less free today , for example , than it was even in 1988 in the ussr ! !
and the u.s. is supposed to listen to him ? ? ?
his country is weak and poor , and old ladies beg everywhere on the streets of moscow .
his country is skid row , and he 's worrying about u.s. missiles ? !
geez , maybe solve your domestic problems first .
should n't he worry more about russia 's shrinking population ? ?
he 's a loser leader of a loser country and he should be ignored .
john kluver , tucson , usa rogue nations .
who 's to decide which nation is a ' rogue ' one ? and what ' rogue ' exactly means ?
there are un rules and russia strictly abides with them as nuclear materials are concerned .
why the us did n't stop pakistan -lrb- israel -rrb- and bomb it into quarks after it acquired nuclear weapons ?
why iran is worse ?
pakistan is surely more unstable and unpredictable .
what if japan decides to go nuclear ?
there are no easy answers , it is better to wait and see .
a country may acquire a nuclear deterrent and behave .
you can always launch a nuclear war .
how can you stop iran ?
a military action may cause worse consequences than patient politics .
pavel , rostov , russia a pox upon both your houses .
the global economic and military dominionism of the usa government and the resurgent autocratism of putin 's government are the festering poison that is so revolting for the average citizen of the world who is trying to make a world that is livable for all it 's citizens .
the impudent arrogance of both governments is reprehensible .
harold l nicol , st paul usa ... ever since britain lost superpower status at the end of 19th century it has been thriving on balancing power dynamic between europe and the us ...
what is happening today is no different .
britain and the us are trying to keep the status quo in the regional and global distribution of power .
they are trying hard to preempt any meaningful change that can undermine their strategic positions .
they want to deny the continent any chance of emerging strong as a whole .
playing on anti-russian and pro-american sentiments in young states of eastern europe is a smart preventive tactic to weaken european unity and regional security and , thus , secure the status quo for long time to come ...
the only problems is , as mr. lukyanov put it " there are big players watching on the sidelines - china , india , and iran - that can emerge as winners " if the us gets stuck keeping european continent weak .
if , however , the us and britain jointly manage to drive another long-term wedge in europe -lrb- regional " cold war " -rrb- , it will be able to afford to get busy with weakening others .
now that will be the start of the new american century .
if that happens , britain will have to get busy making the us dependent on british as the irreplacable agents meddling in european affairs and keeping europe weak .
otherwise , britain risks being reduced to a mere lapdog of the americans .
although that will happen anyway if the us project of the new american century truly gets realized .
yevgeni , moscow , russia as a citizen of the country , ukraine , which mr lukanov calls former integral part of the soviet union , i would million times say " god bless america ! " , again , just in the case of deploying anti-missile defence shield in eastern europe , because this is completely correct and up-to-date decision , despite of my criticism of other actions of the bush 's administration .
i 'm surprised how blind sometimes western europeans are in terms of russia .
something i 've conceived of mr lukanov 's article as well as russian president 's behaviour is that this country has been planning to become new soviet union -lrb- even precursory look at modern putin 's russia displays that it had become so already -rrb- .
and i want to ask all people here so worried about global warming , why mrs merkel , if she is so worried about this issue , does not openly say that russia is major energetic terrorist ?
in the beginning of 2006 , when russia blackmailed my country by gas price , i heard words of support only from poland , baltic countries and the united states .
mrs. merkel instead called only for fast compromise between ukraine and russia , clearly understanding that the price of this compromise could be only shifting control over our main gas pipelines to russian gazprom ?
oh , of course , do german enterprises , which 40 % depend on russian gas supplies , causing pollution too , care about something like ukraine ?
oksana , kyiv , ukraine this should be discussed at the un to ratify the implications of such moves , this does n't just affect russia gerry mangan bbc news website reader , basingstoke , england this defense system tips the balance of power completely , creating a super power with the single most biggest nuclear arsenal .
what would a wannabe president with the same superiority complex as bush do with this power on nations opposed or making things difficult .
this should be discussed at the un to ratify the implications of such moves , this does n't just affect russia .
gerry mangan , basingstoke , england all russia has to do is stop providing uranium to iran , stop largely siding with them on their nuclear program and forth and stronger back the calls for north korea to disarm .
if russia was n't aiding these countries through it 's lack of will for tougher sanctions or tougher action against these nations then they would n't be a nuclear risk , hence the us would also have no excuse for needing a missile shield .
russia is as much at fault in helping give the us an excuse for a missile shield in the first place helping these rogue nations ...
ian , leeds i think that ' europe ' just need someone to be afraid of , and now i read so many anti-russian reviews and almost nothing that explains russian position without fear of ' big bad russia ' . its very pity igor , moscow , russian federation i have no brief to make for mr. putin , who seems to be more of an autocrat than a democrat .
but it is absurd to compare contemporary russia to the former soviet union .
u.s. presidents abraham lincoln , franklin d. roosevelt , and harry s. truman had the wisdom to understand that you do not treat a former foe like a convicted criminal , but rather like an errant friend whose friendship might be won again .
it was needlessly provocative to extend nato right up to the russian border , and it is needlessly provocative to attempt to put elements of an anti-missile defense in countries bordering on russia .
there are anti-ballistic missile radars and interceptor missiles that can be deployed aboard ships which can be stationed off of the coasts of north korea and iran .
this is where it is most feasable to detect and intercept ballistic missiles just after they are launched anyway .
george , somewhere in texas the onus is on russia to decide whether its imperial past or a potentially prosperous future is more important tomek bbc news website reader , londonderry , nh , us ... it is not the case that europe 's russia policy is filtered through poland ; only in the last few weeks has the eu finally recognized any of poland 's concerns about russia 's behaviors .
further , if the eu did base its policies towards russia on poland , that would still be a potentially advantageous situation for moscow , as , for all the historical hostility , most poles understand that their security and prosperity ultimately depend on finding some accommodation with russia .
poland will never be fully secure without russia also feeling secure , and an economically prosperous russia would benefit poland immensely - while an impoverished and politically unstable russia will always threaten poland 's own economic and political security .
we have no choice ; we are -lrb- relative -rrb- neighbors , like it or not , and most poles understand that just as renewed relations with germany had to be rebuilt , so too will someday a rapprochement with moscow be necessary .
that , however , will take two sides to achieve , and as i said , for now the onus is on russia to decide whether its imperial past or a potentially prosperous future is more important .
tomek , londonderry , nh usa the shield is " defensive . "
so calm down all of you america haters .
in fact , after listening to how much you hate us i think we need more defense sites .
i bet you wish you had a shield too .
well , if you 're nice we 'll put you under the umbrella .
if not , you can play with the trustworthy russians , the loving north koreans , and the ever so friendly iranians .
i 'm sorry that we 're not like them enough for you to like us .
alex turner , las vegas , us the analysis is mostly excellent .
russia , however , is not " sadly encouraging " the situation : it is all the us that is being obdurate because it can not begin to imagine life on a planet where it does not , in the manner of the most spoiled of brats , get its own way .
neither are britain & france " formerly " empires : that is just pap for the primary grades .
we all know that america , britain , france , spain & germany continue to command vast empires to this day , even if there is some self-government in their cultural or economic dependencies .
russia is not " asking to get something back " - i.e. ' superpower ' or even ' great power ' status .
russia was , and remains , a mighty nuclear power not to be taken lightly .
the idea that it was ever not powerful is as silly as the suggestion would be that american was not a global power during its global depression - or after 9/11 , or even now , when it remains on its knees in iraq & incapable of extricating itself from a small botched war .
let 's set aside the propaganda slogans & the politically correct cant , and look at simple , patent realities staring us in the face .
can the us afford to go to war with russia , for example over kosovo ?
of course not .
can europeans afford a revival of the decade of gore & agony that brought about the kosovo problem in the first place ?
not at all - much less a major or even minor conflict between the us & russia .
kindly simply turn off bush 's microphone ... & stop throwing petrol on a fire that is rapidly swelling out of control ...
maria amadei ashot , berkeley , california i 'm not sure i particularly believe / trust russia or the us , but i do envy russia 's ability and willingness to stand up to bush and say ' no ' .
nik , milton keynes why does america antagonize russia while pretending that unapologetically totalitarian regimes in p. r. of china and saudi arabia are ' friends ' ?
mike bbc news website reader , ancaster , ontario , canada the true question is why america is taking this course of action against russia at this time ?
its military is overstretched , its global popularity is at an all-time-low , and russia is one of the few world powers that is content to not challenge america if it is left alone .
why does america antagonize russia while pretending that unapologetically totalitarian regimes in p. r. of china and saudi arabia are ' friends ' ?
mike , ancaster , ontario , canada the fact of the matter is , the american have provided security to the world , can you imagine without american security ?
god bless america ...
alex , london great analysis !
when the ussr put nuclear missiles in cuba it did n't change anything strategically either , both the us and the su were capable of mutual destruction .
a few extra missiles fired from cuba would not have changed that .
yet , the americans made a huge fuss about it !
that 's exactly the situation here , anything that diminishes or degrades russia 's nuclear capability is clearly an act of aggression .
vladislav , moscow what a shame that no eu country leader has guts to accept that mr putin is right .
alan , amazing timing : did bush and putin agree in advance of the g8 meeting to have this missile issue overshadow ... global warming , so that they could avoid having to discuss it ?
colin mckenzie bbc news website reader , manchester , uk amazing timing : did bush and putin agree in advance of the g8 meeting to have this missile issue overshadow the very real threat to this planet , global warming , so that they could avoid having to discuss it ?
and by the way has bush ever stopped to think that rising sea levels caused by global warming triggered by us in-action could be just as devastating to coastal areas of nuclear armed india and pakistan as a direct attack on them and that at some point in many years time they may point their weapons at the us to save their own land ?
colin mckenzie , manchester , uk the article that is presented here has some validity in some respect about the protection of eastern european countries because neither the russian nor the western eurpean countries would come forward to protect them other than united states of america .
the eastern europeans feel much secure if the americans are there to save them and by virtue if and when their security interests are jeopardized by either western europe or the russians .
in this context , it is fair to point out that out of this tension about the missile defense system initiated by the u.s may have some validity to the protection of europe overall as we all know that western europe will not make such a defense plan that would serve up as a common goal for all europeans .
it is not only going to bankrupt them but also will not have a cohessive defense policy to safeguard european interest .
yes , putin may have a reason to be upset about but he may take it easy not worrying to much about russian security interest because he has asserted himself aligning with the the americans and the europeans in a common security interest of the global world that we live in .
he must realize that the old geopolitical game that had been fought early in the 20th century is not going to work and for that reason he must work jointly with the u.s to irradicate poverty , terrorism from the face of this earth .
azim , harrisburg , pa , united states yes we did drop the bomb ... and the entire planet was not destroyed .
as a matter of fact , the enemy did not care enough about therr own people so we had to drop a second one before they surrendered .
it 's tough being the only remaining super power .
it would be a lot tougher on the rest of you , if we were n't .
chuck d , us mil - deployed i think the bases could just be a wedge issue to put pressure on russia to deal with iran .
it 's the russians who are building the reactor for tehran .
i would n't be suprised if the state department says " russia , if you can help us make sure iran does n't get the bomb we wo n't humiliate you by putting these bases in your former sphere of influence . "
the same goes for the british and the russian spy case .
it might all be a way to put pressure on moscow .
tj , south dakota usa it 's obvious that the west is on the path of confrontation with anything it regards as ' incompatible ' with western interests and was encouraged , so to speak , by the unbalance in the unsc after the ussr and allies ceased to exist .
it was offered a finger and decided to go for the whole hand .
the russian government finds that the circling of its territory by us / nato -lrb- and belittling of slavs ? -rrb- has gone far enough - rightfully imo - and is determined to restore the balance .
we should get used to the idea that there ca n't be a yin without yang .
jj van kempen , den haag , netherlands why is everyone so quick to call the united states a bully ?
modern russia under putin is just the ussr by another name .
it is deeply unsettling .
have we forgotten their barbarousness in afghanistan and inside the iron curtain ?
putin is ... a despotic autocrat - just how accountable is he ?
is russia trustworthy ?
no.they use their new-found economic clout to strangle former cis countries .
is russia stable ?
no .
what happens when oil prices drop etc ?
why should we continue fearing a vast poverty stricken country with a declining population.why ca n't the us protect the west from nuclear attacks ?
russia only need to fear this if they plan on bombing the west otherwise they should relax .
why should we respond every time a decaying ex-superpower wants to flex its muscles ?
maybe the nuclear defence system might finally highlight the absurdity of nuclear missiles .
if not- at least we 're safe .
dexter galvin , dublin , ireland no-one needs to be a lap dog , and surely no-one will laugh if us does put the missiles shield .
takes one or the other radical view point to tip the balance , does n't it ?
actually , it might not happen -lrb- it 's expensive and military spend only helps sending us into a solid budget deficit -rrb- - some of the us objectives are already achieved 100 % anyway - divide and conquer that is .
it 's amazing how oblivious people remain : may i ask a simple question - to whose benefit the current situation is ? who exactly is provoking , dividing and conquering ; preventing us to benefit ?
has eu not learnt any lessons from history ? we have a great leverage of strong western economies and a willing growing strong market next door !
as well as an excellent collar for provision of peace .
let 's be honest - it 's a gold mine for the city ..
why in the world are we not pursuing it and entertaining someone else 's tactics and interests -lrb- who 's interests , by the way , do not include our wellbeing - wake up -rrb- ? ? , london mr lukyanov is absolutely right .
russia has every right to be aggressive in this case .
it is a cause of worry for india also and any other country with nuclear weapons if a global missile defence system comes into place .
it would give the us complete immunity in case of a war .
america is systematically trying to conquer the world .
they seem to be afraid of the fact that china , russia and india are growing stronger and want to stop this .
europe on the other hand should realise they are not going to benefit from this missile shield .
when it comes to a war , america would not care one bit what happens to europe .
europe should not alienate russia keeping old cold war memories in mind .
they have to realise the present situation with america having it selfish and dangerous objectives .
anand , bangalore i can see a few fair points in general however when talk about russia 's interest in economic growth and want to be in the club i think they should be prepare to play by the rules of the club .
can any of the developed nations see russia contributing anything to that extent other than playing cheap games with immaturity and aggressive outburst from kremlin instad of intelligent political and tactical manoeuvres to promote their genuine desire and comitment.what actualy went wrong to glasnost & perestroika one should wonder .
m thomas , london , uk europe needs what the us has to offer ! !
its not only rogue states like iran and north korea which we need to contend with , but russia as well .
the most feared would be russia , because when the chips are down , its the rogue states and russia who will join hands against the us and europe .
and believe me , its heading that way soon , unfortunately though !
juliana smith , croydon the various comments are quite enlightening .
but whatever the real reasons for this new chill in global nuclear politics , the most worrying thing may be the growing inability of u.s policy-makers to distinguish their own propaganda from real threats , and to systematically dismiss the protests of those who disagree like mr putin .
it would be excessive to claim that the world no longer cares for any thing that washington says , but people - powerless as they may be - are not idiots , and it is equally doubtful if a nation 's strategic interests can be durably ensured through browbeating and force .
the other serious reason for concern is the complacency of major nuclear stakeholders like china .
their fence sitting tactics , far from weakening the u.s or gaining them any strategic edge , has instead helped to reinforce the position of the u.s , thus enabling this latter to move its mile stones into central asia since the collapse of the ussr and its satelite states .
dominic lulu , c.d spain russia is right .
anyone who takes a detailed look at what the experts are saying and have been saying for the last decade or so -lrb- and not since last week -rrb- will know that the us , being in a unique position as the most militarily powerful nation on earth , will want to consolidate it 's position and keep ahead of the other rising powers while it can before the other world powers can catch up .
one of the ways the us will stay ahead of the others is by having a nuclear first strike option , where by the us military can destroy a rival nuclear power in a first strike without having to fear a devastating nuclear retaliatory response since what nuclear weapons the opposing military may launch -lrb- those that survived the first strike -rrb- will be intercepted by the global us abm system .
of course to set up such a system will take a few more decades -lrb- more or less -rrb- but for the us military , it will be worth it .
what we are seeing in poland and the czech republic is the first steps for such a system .
such systems will be able to track and intercept the older russian missiles that are in it 's radar coverage even if russia shoots them towards the north pole .
the us knows only they have the financial resources and technical know how to build a global abm network at this moment in time .
they are going ahead with it .
the us will not be able to impose itself on others using purely conventional means , but with wmds it can .
bablu rahman , haywards heath , u.k we polish do not want missiles on our soil , do not want to be a target but we know , we can not rely on europe which is depending on russia 's energy supplies more and more .
russia 's never been reliable partner !
you witness it on daily basis .
russia -lrb- soviet u -rrb- had destroyed our country for 50 years , plus between 1939 - 41 of wwii killed more poles then germans did .
i know us shields ai n't the best solution but at least something .
do n't get me wrong , i think that the usa is the bigest danger for peace on our globe but that 's why we need to stick with them .
this is business .
rob , krakow , poland reagan offered to make the original " star wars " systems available to other nations - " we 're not gonna give it away , they 're gonna have to pay for it ... "
if the us makes the current systems available to russia , surely that rebalances the equation ?
it could be useful for all concerned to have interceptors closer to the likely origins of hostile missile launches .
d wilson , london , uk yeah , i also agree with the article. lets agree on that us is the sole power and is trying very hard to protect its interests while undermining the others . be it the attacks on the middle east or the simplest thing like not accepting the co2 emission curbs set prior to the g8 meet .
it is doing the same thing in india by that nuclear agreement which will retard the nuclear capabilities of india while 2 nuclear countries namely china and pakistan sit next to it and mind you both are hostile to india .
devendra , new delhi , india its all about putin ...
just as russia was about to emerge from 1000 years of darkness , into the light of democratic freedom - putin and his kgb gang has plunged his people back into the abyss ...
the eu must go directly to the russian people and offer them a different vision of their future ¿ a future of a strong democratic russia - economically and politically .
the eu must explain to the russian people that because of the expansion of nato and the eu for the first time in a thousand years - russia is free from invasion from the west .
russian mothers no longer have to bury their sons by the millions due to invasion or leave their dead bodies on european battlefields due to their government alliances with western countries .
the expansion of the eu through the enlargement process and the creation of a special free trade zone including a privileged partnership with russia is the only way to guarantee freedom and democracy for russia and central asia and oil / gas supply security for europe .
larry houle , spring texas i think russia are right to object in this instance and can understand why putin has reacted in the way he has done .
i was infuriated when i heard of how the usa wanted to plant various defence systems across europe as though the continent belongs to them ...
it 's about time someone stood up to them and said ' no , this is unacceptable ' .
sarah , hereford , uk and what if russia , or venezuela , or some other party not in the freedom club , did a deal so they could place military bases in either canada or mexico -lrb- or cuba -rrb- to protect some intangible interests against unidentified parties ?
would the us stand idly by ?
also , given current us record with truth and integrity and -lrb- almost -rrb- unilateral interventionism , why should n't russia hyperventilate ? paolo , powell , usa in my opinion , we should fear not only russia , but also the us .
if russia 's and china 's nuclear capabilities are undermined , or even useless , then the us would be the only nuclear superpower capable of sending one of those missiles -lrb- of which they 've got thousands , by the way -rrb- to europe .
this situation is a double edged sword .
we , europe , should arm ourselves against both .
markus pihlström , helsingfors , finland i thought your article was another in a long list of ' pundits ' making their living by chewing up today 's news and regurgitating it to market to the masses .
until the ending statement about -lrb- russia -rrb- being " a young ... " .
it reminds me of us history in the 1800s , when today 's powerful families and organizations were first starting up , ie . ' the robber barons ' of the old west -lrb- trains and newspapers -rrb- .
i think i understand russia a bit better now - thanks .
bill , cedar rapids , iowa , usa under the current administration the moral compass of america has changed dramatically .
in a world of rapid technological advances and changes in warfare the us is pursuing an approach easily circumvented .
the us appears to becoming more out of step with the world at a time when friends and allies are most important .
combine this with the us habit of pursuing its interests at the expense of all others and we have a worrying scenario. bill wallace , perth , australia i think mr. lukyanov fails to mention the primary reason for the us missile defenses in europe : the inevitable attack by iran and north korea against poland .
as bush said , these defenses have nothing to do with russia .
russia really has no missiles to speak of .
and , even if it did , everyone in poland loves the russians .
it 's the north koreans that the polish are really concerned with .
hordes of starving north korean soldiers .
thus , every major kielbasa -lsb- polish sausage -rsb- factory must be protected .
veniamin nikolayev , philadelphia , usa take a look at the geography - if russia were to fire missiles at the usa , they would go over the north pole , not poland or the czech republic .
i would suggest , therefore , that they are next to useless as a defence against russian missiles .
now if they base any in northern canada that would be a different matter altogether .
mike , salisbury uk europe is pathetically spineless , divided and weak and the us and russia untrustworthy and childish .
with the enlargement of the eu , any possibility of a common foreign and defense policy is lost which is why it is necessary to retain the british nuclear deterrent , however russia itself poses little threat as long as we maintain independent energy supplies -lrb- i.e. nuclear -rrb- as at the moment the russian state does not have the money to throw at a huge increase in its military capability .
european incompetence on foreign policy is just staggering . , why do we always dodge the real issue - oil ?
the ongoing iraq war is about installing a u.s. friendly regime to secure oil for america 's future energy requirements .
the war in afghanistan is due to the taliban not allowing a gas-pipe to run through it from kazakhstan to the pakistan coast .
and now that iran has started negotiating oil sales to china , instead of america , the u.s. seems to be moving its pieces around the global chess-board in readiness to secure yet more oil , by force -lrb- again -rrb- if need be .
no wonder putin 's worried .
russia , with its own not inconsiderable oil and gas reserves , could be the next battleground - sandwiched between china one side , and america 's ams on the other .
robert hossack , st austell , uk all i see is american neo-cons forcing their world view agenda & russian fascists pushing theirs .
all it does is highlight europe 's weakness , even if you 're generous it 's obvious that economic " soft power " can only get you so far .
europe has common interests with both america and russia but without europe-wide co-ordinated miltary procurement , strategy and forces then europe will always be stepped on by one or the other or both .
until europe has the military muscle to push it 's viewpoint and command some respect then we 'll always be sidelined and at risk .
chas , manchester , uk we must do everything in our power not to become dependent on russian gas and oil .
back track on deals already done or in negotiations .
the americans are playing some long term strategy for their own benefit .
just keep out of it .
ray sparrow , woodley england i 'm an american engineer who earned my living designing missile defense systems for many years , and i agree with russia .
this is the start of a world-wide system of surveillance radars and interceptor missiles .
it is part of the neocon 's agenda to establish a lasting american hegemony .
countries who do not wish to live under such a new world order should oppose it now .
george works , st. eustatius , netherlands antilles in ascribing to the latest ' defensive ' missile plan a diabolically devious long-term plan to ensure us hegemony well into the 21st century is probably to credit us foreign policy planners with far more intelligence and foresight than history suggests they actually possess .
the problem for us all , including mr putin , is not that the us is too clever , too sophisticated in its understanding of the world and us global interests : the problem surely is the dangerously unsophisticated world view which permeates all levels of american society , including the higher echelons of the us administration .
shouting at mr bush et al from behind the barricades is counter-productive in-so-far as it only serves to further reinforce their simplistic perception of foreign affairs .
in school , in life and in the conduct of foreign policy understanding is more usually achieved through reasoned explanation , rather than polemics or confrontation .
mark , bristol do not think that everyone in america -lrb- usa -rrb- supports this " shield " for europe .
most of us in the us do not want this war in iraq , we do not want nato , we do not want our troops in europe , we do not support " free trade " or " globilization " .
do n't just judge us by cnn or " w " .
he does not speak for most of us .
give america some credit .
at least we try to pretend to care about others , we raise money for relief efforts , some of us are trying to be good world citizens ... so do n't give up on america .
please .
marc daniel , charleston , south carolina , usa excellent summary from fyodor lukyanov ...
what i wonder is whether mr lukyanov would agree that , from the usa 's point of view , the ams could be perceived as a mechanism for diverting global attention away from us failures / war crimes -lrb- depending on your point of view -rrb- in the middle east .
this dispute flared up a couple of months ago , when the 4-year anniversary of the iraq invasion had just been clocked , the democrat-led congress was fighting for withdrawal -lrb- which it seems to have given up , sadly -rrb- , and us military strategy was under intense scrutiny and criticism .
suddenly the front page focus is all on russia , and the eu and usa seem to have succesfully sidelined the issues of the middle east and other problem areas .
the middle east is no less volatile than before , with palestine , lebanon and turkey / kurdistan witnessing either mass violence or heightened tensions , guantanamo is in a legal shambles , israel 's brutal military occupation of palestine is reaching its landmark 40th anniversary , yet the top international stories have consistently been putin 's rhetoric on the west and the ams , the russia-estonia clashes , and so on .
president putin insists that the ams is an affront because there is no threat to the us from either iran or north korea - apparently iran have no icbms and will not do so for 5-8 years , and as for north korea - if they were to attack the usa , even in theory , surely they would go over the pacific , which is much shorter in distance ?
there are plenty of indicators that the threat countered by the ams is a fabrication , and recent history has shown that the us -lrb- and uk -rrb- governments under the present administrations are prepared to lie to the public to get what they want .
it is one thing to say that putin is electioneering , which is a perfectly reasonable theory , but given that both the current us and uk governments may well be on their way out within the next two years , this could be perceived as a last stand to ensure that their neo-conservative , ' new american century ' ways remain embedded in the global political framework .
-lrb- they really have nothing to fear , for , as zbigniew brzezinski shows in his latest book , the democrats ' way of thinking in foreign policy does n't differ hugely in its imperialist overtones -rrb- .
as for the czechs and poles and the east-west europe divide , it is the usa , still the global superpower despite upsurges from india , china , russia and others , which has the most to gain from exploiting these disagreements .
they continue to " divide and rule " , as they always have , all over the world .
putin 's russia is countering the usa 's power games by befriending the middle east -lrb- talk of a ' gas-opec ' or equivalent " forum " springs to mind straight away -rrb- and builiding diplomatic and economic relations with strategic countries including venezuela , kazakhstan , japan , and china .
simon lewis , london , uk well ...
i try to look @ it from both sides .
the whole plan is useless .
if someone wants to fire a nuke , they will .
if they do then ?
guess we are done as humans .
every single one of us know the consequences .
oh , wait a minute !
someone did drop the bomb , right ?
anyway ...
i hope peace will prevail as usual .
its only going to take all the righteous to bond together and defeat whatever evil that is out there !
jzen , sf , california russia only has to worry about the us anti-missile defence if she plans on firing her nuclear missiles .
does russia really anticipate doing this ?
if so then we need the protection of the shield and if not then russia can laugh as bush wasting billions .
peter , nottingham the idea of an unopposed and un-opposable us superpower , a power that need not fear anyone else and is able to obtain the ' full spectrum dominance ' it craves , is deeply scary .
the quiet birth of the kind of global dominance set out in the project for a new american century , must be noticed .
or else we may see a kind of global apartheid , where the us gets whatever it wants whenever it wants and howsoever it desires and the only way for any other nation to have its interests even nearly served is to be play lap dog .
just as the us thought it was its manifest destiny to control the continent of north america , at the expense of the natives , it now seems to think it is its manifest destiny to control the globe , at the expense of every other person on the planet .
at least the cold war brought balance .
james waldorf-nicol , kent , uk mr lukyanov said : " if the idea of a global anti-missile system becomes a reality , the nuclear capability of russia , china and other countries will be undermined . "
and why exactly is this a bad thing ?
surely we , in europe , would be safer if russia and china were unable to use their nuclear weapons against us ?
i find it very hard to sympathise with the russian viewpoint when their president is threatening to point nukes at us ... -lsb- no name supplied -rsb- " russia only has to worry about the us anti-missile defence if she plans on firing her nuclear missiles .
does russia really anticipate doing this ?
if so then we need the protection of the shield and if not then russia can laugh as bush wasting billions . "
you miss the point entirely .
a system like this can be used aggressively .
the us can launch a strike against another nation in full knowledge that that nation can not strike back .
it is the death of the concept of mutually assured destruction which is what prevented the cold war escalating .
the us can use the leverage of its ability to launch unanswered nuclear and conventional strikes to achieve whatever it demands .
james waldorf-nicol , kent , uk putin is totally right to be concerned .
the us hypocrisy on this is frightening .
why should russia 's reaction to us plans be described as aggressive and unhelpful when it is us plans for domination that give rise to this level of anxiety the globe over .
some are describing this as ' cold peace ' - i do n't think the us ever ended the cold war ... and are now threating a nuclear strike on iran to stop it developing a defence against us armed israel !
as a us general said long ago - " we fought ww1 in europe , we fought ww2 in europe and if you fools let us we 'll fight ww3 there too " . grahame , sheffield i 've thought from the start that this all seems like the us causing trouble , and reading more into the background just strengthens my views .
bush is n't trying to protect " the homeland " , he is sending out a message that the us is in charge , and in charge of a lot .
i 'm sorry , but it 's not russia that needs to be put in it 's place , it 's the united states .
miles hayler , warwickshire , uk wake up people , the us that people looked towards for inspiration is no longer there - it has n't been since bush came to power in the questionable elections of 2000 .
although russia is n't a better option , we need a bi-polar world in order to be free and safe - each side will think very carefully before launching wars to impose their wills on the peoples of the world .
nawaz the us under the bush administration invaded iraq under false pretences so why should the russian government trust them on anti-missile systems .
president putin is right to resist this plan and it says little for the east europeans who are allowing anti-missile systems on their territory .
kenneth clark , hemel hempstead uk putin is exactly right to be concerned as should we .
whats going on with the world ?
is the eu that useless ?
why ca n't we put our own missile defence system in ?
by relying on the americans we are removing any control in world affairs we thought we had .
its pathetic how weak europe is as a power .
so weak we do n't mind being used by america as a dumping ground for shot down nuclear missiles .
tony blair 's support for bush in this makes him more than a laptop dog , it makes him a traitor .

viewpoint : russia 's missile fears i am very glad to read these words by prominent russian analyst .
he gets right to the point and gives all pros and cons of the current freeze in the us-russia relationship .
as for me , united states use eastern europe , especially those states that suffered a lot from russian empire -lrb- poland and ukraine -rrb- as a small change .
those countries feel insulted and annoyed by long lasting russian dominance , and that is why their leading politicians exploit any trifle to pinch a bear -lrb- russia -rrb- .
from 1990s up until 2004-2005 the bear was in hibernation .
now it is awakened and strives to establish status quo .
i hope the bear would have enough wisdom not to race with an eagle -lrb- us -rrb- and they would leave in peace .
otherwise , catastrophe might happen , eventually , because bears can not fly ? .
ilshat , manchester , usa even though they talk a lot about n korea and iran , but in fact , us control them quite well and they have got a lot cheaper solutions to protect anyone from the " danger " .
the ams is not related to them at all , and done for completely different purposes .
it 's geopolitics , and anyone related to it would not even mention " axis of evil " countries seriously ...
it is obvious that russia , and some other countries would be left with no choice , but develop new systems to overcome the ams .
not that they do n't do already , but as imbalance increases they would have to speed up the process .
you can say honestly -lrb- as putin did -rrb- or not talk about it openly , but there is no doubt that ams bases , radars , missiles bases , etc -lrb- russian or american -rrb- are the first targets of attack in an escalating conflict .
all that would not make any country more secured .
alex , uk president putin takes a very sensible stance on the proposed us military expansion into eastern europe .
the ams becomes an integral part of the us nuclear arsenal .
do the europeans really need american nukes in their back yard ?
russia is already surrounded by a ring of american military bases in the former eastern block states and soviet republics .
she also now shares borders with several new quazi-tyrannical states that the us keeps on a short leash and sets them off to bite russia when expedient .
the ams is another affront that does not achieve any useful purpose , but makes things globally much worse .
yuri zharikov , odessa , ukraine putin is right : the us anti-missile system is an existential threat to russia 's existance .
10 missiles now will become 1000 missiles in ten years time .
and who will guarantee the us would n't tip these alleged " anti-missile missiles " with nuke warheads ?
the defunct abm-treaty recognized that , if country 1 could nuke country 2 with impunity , because it could shoot down incoming missiles of country 2 , the only logical course of action for country 2 was to pre-emptively fire its missiles at country 1 , before country 1 had brought this anti-missile system online .
in short : " use ' em , or lose ' em " ...
roel , leuven , belgium is it any surprise that the us would want to maintain its global dominance and provide every option available , especially when we know that we can not rely on other nations to solve our problems ?
those in the eu need to realize that this is n't being unwillingly imposed on your governments .
the eu should grow a spine and prove that it can independently act without the us military / economy , otherwise nothing is going to change- get real !
additionally , it really does n't help that the russians and the chinese consistently undermine the us 's position in dealing with rouge states .
what the hell are we supposed to do ?
if those " powerful " states want to play with the big boys then so be it .
certainly there are always more diplomatic options , but the truth is every nation is out for its own interest and if there is room to expand and flex muscle , someone will always fill that vacuum .
andrew , chicago , usa quote : " many of the people i have talked to in private have told me they believe the anti-missile system is a us tactic to prevent the eu from becoming an independent player in foreign policy " .
a fantastic point which is rarely articulated - us foreign policy & particularly it 's ' special relationship with britain ' always seems divisive & geared to weaken the eu , maintaining their superior position as the world 's only superpower .
coincidence ?
iain , bristol , uk -lsb- putin 's -rsb- country is skid row , and he 's worrying about u.s. missiles ? !
john kluver bbc news website reader , tucson , usa hmm , let 's see - putin has botched the ukraine -lrb- remember he called to congratulate yanukovich -rrb- , and he 's botched georgia , the baltics and poland .
he 's killed off the free press , in particular tv , in his country .
remember that no matter what he says or does he is always portrayed as a winner on tv in russia .
russia is far less free today , for example , than it was even in 1988 in the ussr ! !
and the u.s. is supposed to listen to him ? ? ?
his country is weak and poor , and old ladies beg everywhere on the streets of moscow .
his country is skid row , and he 's worrying about u.s. missiles ? !
geez , maybe solve your domestic problems first .
should n't he worry more about russia 's shrinking population ? ?
he 's a loser leader of a loser country and he should be ignored .
john kluver , tucson , usa rogue nations .
who 's to decide which nation is a ' rogue ' one ? and what ' rogue ' exactly means ?
there are un rules and russia strictly abides with them as nuclear materials are concerned .
why the us did n't stop pakistan -lrb- israel -rrb- and bomb it into quarks after it acquired nuclear weapons ?
why iran is worse ?
pakistan is surely more unstable and unpredictable .
what if japan decides to go nuclear ?
there are no easy answers , it is better to wait and see .
a country may acquire a nuclear deterrent and behave .
you can always launch a nuclear war .
how can you stop iran ?
a military action may cause worse consequences than patient politics .
pavel , rostov , russia a pox upon both your houses .
the global economic and military dominionism of the usa government and the resurgent autocratism of putin 's government are the festering poison that is so revolting for the average citizen of the world who is trying to make a world that is livable for all it 's citizens .
the impudent arrogance of both governments is reprehensible .
harold l nicol , st paul usa ... ever since britain lost superpower status at the end of 19th century it has been thriving on balancing power dynamic between europe and the us ...
what is happening today is no different .
britain and the us are trying to keep the status quo in the regional and global distribution of power .
they are trying hard to preempt any meaningful change that can undermine their strategic positions .
they want to deny the continent any chance of emerging strong as a whole .
playing on anti-russian and pro-american sentiments in young states of eastern europe is a smart preventive tactic to weaken european unity and regional security and , thus , secure the status quo for long time to come ...
the only problems is , as mr. lukyanov put it " there are big players watching on the sidelines - china , india , and iran - that can emerge as winners " if the us gets stuck keeping european continent weak .
if , however , the us and britain jointly manage to drive another long-term wedge in europe -lrb- regional " cold war " -rrb- , it will be able to afford to get busy with weakening others .
now that will be the start of the new american century .
if that happens , britain will have to get busy making the us dependent on british as the irreplacable agents meddling in european affairs and keeping europe weak .
otherwise , britain risks being reduced to a mere lapdog of the americans .
although that will happen anyway if the us project of the new american century truly gets realized .
yevgeni , moscow , russia as a citizen of the country , ukraine , which mr lukanov calls former integral part of the soviet union , i would million times say " god bless america ! " , again , just in the case of deploying anti-missile defence shield in eastern europe , because this is completely correct and up-to-date decision , despite of my criticism of other actions of the bush 's administration .
i 'm surprised how blind sometimes western europeans are in terms of russia .
something i 've conceived of mr lukanov 's article as well as russian president 's behaviour is that this country has been planning to become new soviet union -lrb- even precursory look at modern putin 's russia displays that it had become so already -rrb- .
and i want to ask all people here so worried about global warming , why mrs merkel , if she is so worried about this issue , does not openly say that russia is major energetic terrorist ?
in the beginning of 2006 , when russia blackmailed my country by gas price , i heard words of support only from poland , baltic countries and the united states .
mrs. merkel instead called only for fast compromise between ukraine and russia , clearly understanding that the price of this compromise could be only shifting control over our main gas pipelines to russian gazprom ?
oh , of course , do german enterprises , which 40 % depend on russian gas supplies , causing pollution too , care about something like ukraine ?
oksana , kyiv , ukraine this should be discussed at the un to ratify the implications of such moves , this does n't just affect russia gerry mangan bbc news website reader , basingstoke , england this defense system tips the balance of power completely , creating a super power with the single most biggest nuclear arsenal .
what would a wannabe president with the same superiority complex as bush do with this power on nations opposed or making things difficult .
this should be discussed at the un to ratify the implications of such moves , this does n't just affect russia .
gerry mangan , basingstoke , england all russia has to do is stop providing uranium to iran , stop largely siding with them on their nuclear program and forth and stronger back the calls for north korea to disarm .
if russia was n't aiding these countries through it 's lack of will for tougher sanctions or tougher action against these nations then they would n't be a nuclear risk , hence the us would also have no excuse for needing a missile shield .
russia is as much at fault in helping give the us an excuse for a missile shield in the first place helping these rogue nations ...
ian , leeds i think that ' europe ' just need someone to be afraid of , and now i read so many anti-russian reviews and almost nothing that explains russian position without fear of ' big bad russia ' . its very pity igor , moscow , russian federation i have no brief to make for mr. putin , who seems to be more of an autocrat than a democrat .
but it is absurd to compare contemporary russia to the former soviet union .
u.s. presidents abraham lincoln , franklin d. roosevelt , and harry s. truman had the wisdom to understand that you do not treat a former foe like a convicted criminal , but rather like an errant friend whose friendship might be won again .
it was needlessly provocative to extend nato right up to the russian border , and it is needlessly provocative to attempt to put elements of an anti-missile defense in countries bordering on russia .
there are anti-ballistic missile radars and interceptor missiles that can be deployed aboard ships which can be stationed off of the coasts of north korea and iran .
this is where it is most feasable to detect and intercept ballistic missiles just after they are launched anyway .
george , somewhere in texas the onus is on russia to decide whether its imperial past or a potentially prosperous future is more important tomek bbc news website reader , londonderry , nh , us ... it is not the case that europe 's russia policy is filtered through poland ; only in the last few weeks has the eu finally recognized any of poland 's concerns about russia 's behaviors .
further , if the eu did base its policies towards russia on poland , that would still be a potentially advantageous situation for moscow , as , for all the historical hostility , most poles understand that their security and prosperity ultimately depend on finding some accommodation with russia .
poland will never be fully secure without russia also feeling secure , and an economically prosperous russia would benefit poland immensely - while an impoverished and politically unstable russia will always threaten poland 's own economic and political security .
we have no choice ; we are -lrb- relative -rrb- neighbors , like it or not , and most poles understand that just as renewed relations with germany had to be rebuilt , so too will someday a rapprochement with moscow be necessary .
that , however , will take two sides to achieve , and as i said , for now the onus is on russia to decide whether its imperial past or a potentially prosperous future is more important .
tomek , londonderry , nh usa the shield is " defensive . "
so calm down all of you america haters .
in fact , after listening to how much you hate us i think we need more defense sites .
i bet you wish you had a shield too .
well , if you 're nice we 'll put you under the umbrella .
if not , you can play with the trustworthy russians , the loving north koreans , and the ever so friendly iranians .
i 'm sorry that we 're not like them enough for you to like us .
alex turner , las vegas , us the analysis is mostly excellent .
russia , however , is not " sadly encouraging " the situation : it is all the us that is being obdurate because it can not begin to imagine life on a planet where it does not , in the manner of the most spoiled of brats , get its own way .
neither are britain & france " formerly " empires : that is just pap for the primary grades .
we all know that america , britain , france , spain & germany continue to command vast empires to this day , even if there is some self-government in their cultural or economic dependencies .
russia is not " asking to get something back " - i.e. ' superpower ' or even ' great power ' status .
russia was , and remains , a mighty nuclear power not to be taken lightly .
the idea that it was ever not powerful is as silly as the suggestion would be that american was not a global power during its global depression - or after 9/11 , or even now , when it remains on its knees in iraq & incapable of extricating itself from a small botched war .
let 's set aside the propaganda slogans & the politically correct cant , and look at simple , patent realities staring us in the face .
can the us afford to go to war with russia , for example over kosovo ?
of course not .
can europeans afford a revival of the decade of gore & agony that brought about the kosovo problem in the first place ?
not at all - much less a major or even minor conflict between the us & russia .
kindly simply turn off bush 's microphone ... & stop throwing petrol on a fire that is rapidly swelling out of control ...
maria amadei ashot , berkeley , california i 'm not sure i particularly believe / trust russia or the us , but i do envy russia 's ability and willingness to stand up to bush and say ' no ' .
nik , milton keynes why does america antagonize russia while pretending that unapologetically totalitarian regimes in p. r. of china and saudi arabia are ' friends ' ?
mike bbc news website reader , ancaster , ontario , canada the true question is why america is taking this course of action against russia at this time ?
its military is overstretched , its global popularity is at an all-time-low , and russia is one of the few world powers that is content to not challenge america if it is left alone .
why does america antagonize russia while pretending that unapologetically totalitarian regimes in p. r. of china and saudi arabia are ' friends ' ?
mike , ancaster , ontario , canada the fact of the matter is , the american have provided security to the world , can you imagine without american security ?
god bless america ...
alex , london great analysis !
when the ussr put nuclear missiles in cuba it did n't change anything strategically either , both the us and the su were capable of mutual destruction .
a few extra missiles fired from cuba would not have changed that .
yet , the americans made a huge fuss about it !
that 's exactly the situation here , anything that diminishes or degrades russia 's nuclear capability is clearly an act of aggression .
vladislav , moscow what a shame that no eu country leader has guts to accept that mr putin is right .
alan , amazing timing : did bush and putin agree in advance of the g8 meeting to have this missile issue overshadow ... global warming , so that they could avoid having to discuss it ?
colin mckenzie bbc news website reader , manchester , uk amazing timing : did bush and putin agree in advance of the g8 meeting to have this missile issue overshadow the very real threat to this planet , global warming , so that they could avoid having to discuss it ?
and by the way has bush ever stopped to think that rising sea levels caused by global warming triggered by us in-action could be just as devastating to coastal areas of nuclear armed india and pakistan as a direct attack on them and that at some point in many years time they may point their weapons at the us to save their own land ?
colin mckenzie , manchester , uk the article that is presented here has some validity in some respect about the protection of eastern european countries because neither the russian nor the western eurpean countries would come forward to protect them other than united states of america .
the eastern europeans feel much secure if the americans are there to save them and by virtue if and when their security interests are jeopardized by either western europe or the russians .
in this context , it is fair to point out that out of this tension about the missile defense system initiated by the u.s may have some validity to the protection of europe overall as we all know that western europe will not make such a defense plan that would serve up as a common goal for all europeans .
it is not only going to bankrupt them but also will not have a cohessive defense policy to safeguard european interest .
yes , putin may have a reason to be upset about but he may take it easy not worrying to much about russian security interest because he has asserted himself aligning with the the americans and the europeans in a common security interest of the global world that we live in .
he must realize that the old geopolitical game that had been fought early in the 20th century is not going to work and for that reason he must work jointly with the u.s to irradicate poverty , terrorism from the face of this earth .
azim , harrisburg , pa , united states yes we did drop the bomb ... and the entire planet was not destroyed .
as a matter of fact , the enemy did not care enough about therr own people so we had to drop a second one before they surrendered .
it 's tough being the only remaining super power .
it would be a lot tougher on the rest of you , if we were n't .
chuck d , us mil - deployed i think the bases could just be a wedge issue to put pressure on russia to deal with iran .
it 's the russians who are building the reactor for tehran .
i would n't be suprised if the state department says " russia , if you can help us make sure iran does n't get the bomb we wo n't humiliate you by putting these bases in your former sphere of influence . "
the same goes for the british and the russian spy case .
it might all be a way to put pressure on moscow .
tj , south dakota usa it 's obvious that the west is on the path of confrontation with anything it regards as ' incompatible ' with western interests and was encouraged , so to speak , by the unbalance in the unsc after the ussr and allies ceased to exist .
it was offered a finger and decided to go for the whole hand .
the russian government finds that the circling of its territory by us / nato -lrb- and belittling of slavs ? -rrb- has gone far enough - rightfully imo - and is determined to restore the balance .
we should get used to the idea that there ca n't be a yin without yang .
jj van kempen , den haag , netherlands why is everyone so quick to call the united states a bully ?
modern russia under putin is just the ussr by another name .
it is deeply unsettling .
have we forgotten their barbarousness in afghanistan and inside the iron curtain ?
putin is ... a despotic autocrat - just how accountable is he ?
is russia trustworthy ?
no.they use their new-found economic clout to strangle former cis countries .
is russia stable ?
no .
what happens when oil prices drop etc ?
why should we continue fearing a vast poverty stricken country with a declining population.why ca n't the us protect the west from nuclear attacks ?
russia only need to fear this if they plan on bombing the west otherwise they should relax .
why should we respond every time a decaying ex-superpower wants to flex its muscles ?
maybe the nuclear defence system might finally highlight the absurdity of nuclear missiles .
if not- at least we 're safe .
dexter galvin , dublin , ireland no-one needs to be a lap dog , and surely no-one will laugh if us does put the missiles shield .
takes one or the other radical view point to tip the balance , does n't it ?
actually , it might not happen -lrb- it 's expensive and military spend only helps sending us into a solid budget deficit -rrb- - some of the us objectives are already achieved 100 % anyway - divide and conquer that is .
it 's amazing how oblivious people remain : may i ask a simple question - to whose benefit the current situation is ? who exactly is provoking , dividing and conquering ; preventing us to benefit ?
has eu not learnt any lessons from history ? we have a great leverage of strong western economies and a willing growing strong market next door !
as well as an excellent collar for provision of peace .
let 's be honest - it 's a gold mine for the city ..
why in the world are we not pursuing it and entertaining someone else 's tactics and interests -lrb- who 's interests , by the way , do not include our wellbeing - wake up -rrb- ? ? , london mr lukyanov is absolutely right .
russia has every right to be aggressive in this case .
it is a cause of worry for india also and any other country with nuclear weapons if a global missile defence system comes into place .
it would give the us complete immunity in case of a war .
america is systematically trying to conquer the world .
they seem to be afraid of the fact that china , russia and india are growing stronger and want to stop this .
europe on the other hand should realise they are not going to benefit from this missile shield .
when it comes to a war , america would not care one bit what happens to europe .
europe should not alienate russia keeping old cold war memories in mind .
they have to realise the present situation with america having it selfish and dangerous objectives .
anand , bangalore i can see a few fair points in general however when talk about russia 's interest in economic growth and want to be in the club i think they should be prepare to play by the rules of the club .
can any of the developed nations see russia contributing anything to that extent other than playing cheap games with immaturity and aggressive outburst from kremlin instad of intelligent political and tactical manoeuvres to promote their genuine desire and comitment.what actualy went wrong to glasnost & perestroika one should wonder .
m thomas , london , uk europe needs what the us has to offer ! !
its not only rogue states like iran and north korea which we need to contend with , but russia as well .
the most feared would be russia , because when the chips are down , its the rogue states and russia who will join hands against the us and europe .
and believe me , its heading that way soon , unfortunately though !
juliana smith , croydon the various comments are quite enlightening .
but whatever the real reasons for this new chill in global nuclear politics , the most worrying thing may be the growing inability of u.s policy-makers to distinguish their own propaganda from real threats , and to systematically dismiss the protests of those who disagree like mr putin .
it would be excessive to claim that the world no longer cares for any thing that washington says , but people - powerless as they may be - are not idiots , and it is equally doubtful if a nation 's strategic interests can be durably ensured through browbeating and force .
the other serious reason for concern is the complacency of major nuclear stakeholders like china .
their fence sitting tactics , far from weakening the u.s or gaining them any strategic edge , has instead helped to reinforce the position of the u.s , thus enabling this latter to move its mile stones into central asia since the collapse of the ussr and its satelite states .
dominic lulu , c.d spain russia is right .
anyone who takes a detailed look at what the experts are saying and have been saying for the last decade or so -lrb- and not since last week -rrb- will know that the us , being in a unique position as the most militarily powerful nation on earth , will want to consolidate it 's position and keep ahead of the other rising powers while it can before the other world powers can catch up .
one of the ways the us will stay ahead of the others is by having a nuclear first strike option , where by the us military can destroy a rival nuclear power in a first strike without having to fear a devastating nuclear retaliatory response since what nuclear weapons the opposing military may launch -lrb- those that survived the first strike -rrb- will be intercepted by the global us abm system .
of course to set up such a system will take a few more decades -lrb- more or less -rrb- but for the us military , it will be worth it .
what we are seeing in poland and the czech republic is the first steps for such a system .
such systems will be able to track and intercept the older russian missiles that are in it 's radar coverage even if russia shoots them towards the north pole .
the us knows only they have the financial resources and technical know how to build a global abm network at this moment in time .
they are going ahead with it .
the us will not be able to impose itself on others using purely conventional means , but with wmds it can .
bablu rahman , haywards heath , u.k we polish do not want missiles on our soil , do not want to be a target but we know , we can not rely on europe which is depending on russia 's energy supplies more and more .
russia 's never been reliable partner !
you witness it on daily basis .
russia -lrb- soviet u -rrb- had destroyed our country for 50 years , plus between 1939 - 41 of wwii killed more poles then germans did .
i know us shields ai n't the best solution but at least something .
do n't get me wrong , i think that the usa is the bigest danger for peace on our globe but that 's why we need to stick with them .
this is business .
rob , krakow , poland reagan offered to make the original " star wars " systems available to other nations - " we 're not gonna give it away , they 're gonna have to pay for it ... "
if the us makes the current systems available to russia , surely that rebalances the equation ?
it could be useful for all concerned to have interceptors closer to the likely origins of hostile missile launches .
d wilson , london , uk yeah , i also agree with the article. lets agree on that us is the sole power and is trying very hard to protect its interests while undermining the others . be it the attacks on the middle east or the simplest thing like not accepting the co2 emission curbs set prior to the g8 meet .
it is doing the same thing in india by that nuclear agreement which will retard the nuclear capabilities of india while 2 nuclear countries namely china and pakistan sit next to it and mind you both are hostile to india .
devendra , new delhi , india its all about putin ...
just as russia was about to emerge from 1000 years of darkness , into the light of democratic freedom - putin and his kgb gang has plunged his people back into the abyss ...
the eu must go directly to the russian people and offer them a different vision of their future ¿ a future of a strong democratic russia - economically and politically .
the eu must explain to the russian people that because of the expansion of nato and the eu for the first time in a thousand years - russia is free from invasion from the west .
russian mothers no longer have to bury their sons by the millions due to invasion or leave their dead bodies on european battlefields due to their government alliances with western countries .
the expansion of the eu through the enlargement process and the creation of a special free trade zone including a privileged partnership with russia is the only way to guarantee freedom and democracy for russia and central asia and oil / gas supply security for europe .
larry houle , spring texas i think russia are right to object in this instance and can understand why putin has reacted in the way he has done .
i was infuriated when i heard of how the usa wanted to plant various defence systems across europe as though the continent belongs to them ...
it 's about time someone stood up to them and said ' no , this is unacceptable ' .
sarah , hereford , uk and what if russia , or venezuela , or some other party not in the freedom club , did a deal so they could place military bases in either canada or mexico -lrb- or cuba -rrb- to protect some intangible interests against unidentified parties ?
would the us stand idly by ?
also , given current us record with truth and integrity and -lrb- almost -rrb- unilateral interventionism , why should n't russia hyperventilate ? paolo , powell , usa in my opinion , we should fear not only russia , but also the us .
if russia 's and china 's nuclear capabilities are undermined , or even useless , then the us would be the only nuclear superpower capable of sending one of those missiles -lrb- of which they 've got thousands , by the way -rrb- to europe .
this situation is a double edged sword .
we , europe , should arm ourselves against both .
markus pihlström , helsingfors , finland i thought your article was another in a long list of ' pundits ' making their living by chewing up today 's news and regurgitating it to market to the masses .
until the ending statement about -lrb- russia -rrb- being " a young ... " .
it reminds me of us history in the 1800s , when today 's powerful families and organizations were first starting up , ie . ' the robber barons ' of the old west -lrb- trains and newspapers -rrb- .
i think i understand russia a bit better now - thanks .
bill , cedar rapids , iowa , usa under the current administration the moral compass of america has changed dramatically .
in a world of rapid technological advances and changes in warfare the us is pursuing an approach easily circumvented .
the us appears to becoming more out of step with the world at a time when friends and allies are most important .
combine this with the us habit of pursuing its interests at the expense of all others and we have a worrying scenario. bill wallace , perth , australia i think mr. lukyanov fails to mention the primary reason for the us missile defenses in europe : the inevitable attack by iran and north korea against poland .
as bush said , these defenses have nothing to do with russia .
russia really has no missiles to speak of .
and , even if it did , everyone in poland loves the russians .
it 's the north koreans that the polish are really concerned with .
hordes of starving north korean soldiers .
thus , every major kielbasa -lsb- polish sausage -rsb- factory must be protected .
veniamin nikolayev , philadelphia , usa take a look at the geography - if russia were to fire missiles at the usa , they would go over the north pole , not poland or the czech republic .
i would suggest , therefore , that they are next to useless as a defence against russian missiles .
now if they base any in northern canada that would be a different matter altogether .
mike , salisbury uk europe is pathetically spineless , divided and weak and the us and russia untrustworthy and childish .
with the enlargement of the eu , any possibility of a common foreign and defense policy is lost which is why it is necessary to retain the british nuclear deterrent , however russia itself poses little threat as long as we maintain independent energy supplies -lrb- i.e. nuclear -rrb- as at the moment the russian state does not have the money to throw at a huge increase in its military capability .
european incompetence on foreign policy is just staggering . , why do we always dodge the real issue - oil ?
the ongoing iraq war is about installing a u.s. friendly regime to secure oil for america 's future energy requirements .
the war in afghanistan is due to the taliban not allowing a gas-pipe to run through it from kazakhstan to the pakistan coast .
and now that iran has started negotiating oil sales to china , instead of america , the u.s. seems to be moving its pieces around the global chess-board in readiness to secure yet more oil , by force -lrb- again -rrb- if need be .
no wonder putin 's worried .
russia , with its own not inconsiderable oil and gas reserves , could be the next battleground - sandwiched between china one side , and america 's ams on the other .
robert hossack , st austell , uk all i see is american neo-cons forcing their world view agenda & russian fascists pushing theirs .
all it does is highlight europe 's weakness , even if you 're generous it 's obvious that economic " soft power " can only get you so far .
europe has common interests with both america and russia but without europe-wide co-ordinated miltary procurement , strategy and forces then europe will always be stepped on by one or the other or both .
until europe has the military muscle to push it 's viewpoint and command some respect then we 'll always be sidelined and at risk .
chas , manchester , uk we must do everything in our power not to become dependent on russian gas and oil .
back track on deals already done or in negotiations .
the americans are playing some long term strategy for their own benefit .
just keep out of it .
ray sparrow , woodley england i 'm an american engineer who earned my living designing missile defense systems for many years , and i agree with russia .
this is the start of a world-wide system of surveillance radars and interceptor missiles .
it is part of the neocon 's agenda to establish a lasting american hegemony .
countries who do not wish to live under such a new world order should oppose it now .
george works , st. eustatius , netherlands antilles in ascribing to the latest ' defensive ' missile plan a diabolically devious long-term plan to ensure us hegemony well into the 21st century is probably to credit us foreign policy planners with far more intelligence and foresight than history suggests they actually possess .
the problem for us all , including mr putin , is not that the us is too clever , too sophisticated in its understanding of the world and us global interests : the problem surely is the dangerously unsophisticated world view which permeates all levels of american society , including the higher echelons of the us administration .
shouting at mr bush et al from behind the barricades is counter-productive in-so-far as it only serves to further reinforce their simplistic perception of foreign affairs .
in school , in life and in the conduct of foreign policy understanding is more usually achieved through reasoned explanation , rather than polemics or confrontation .
mark , bristol do not think that everyone in america -lrb- usa -rrb- supports this " shield " for europe .
most of us in the us do not want this war in iraq , we do not want nato , we do not want our troops in europe , we do not support " free trade " or " globilization " .
do n't just judge us by cnn or " w " .
he does not speak for most of us .
give america some credit .
at least we try to pretend to care about others , we raise money for relief efforts , some of us are trying to be good world citizens ... so do n't give up on america .
please .
marc daniel , charleston , south carolina , usa excellent summary from fyodor lukyanov ...
what i wonder is whether mr lukyanov would agree that , from the usa 's point of view , the ams could be perceived as a mechanism for diverting global attention away from us failures / war crimes -lrb- depending on your point of view -rrb- in the middle east .
this dispute flared up a couple of months ago , when the 4-year anniversary of the iraq invasion had just been clocked , the democrat-led congress was fighting for withdrawal -lrb- which it seems to have given up , sadly -rrb- , and us military strategy was under intense scrutiny and criticism .
suddenly the front page focus is all on russia , and the eu and usa seem to have succesfully sidelined the issues of the middle east and other problem areas .
the middle east is no less volatile than before , with palestine , lebanon and turkey / kurdistan witnessing either mass violence or heightened tensions , guantanamo is in a legal shambles , israel 's brutal military occupation of palestine is reaching its landmark 40th anniversary , yet the top international stories have consistently been putin 's rhetoric on the west and the ams , the russia-estonia clashes , and so on .
president putin insists that the ams is an affront because there is no threat to the us from either iran or north korea - apparently iran have no icbms and will not do so for 5-8 years , and as for north korea - if they were to attack the usa , even in theory , surely they would go over the pacific , which is much shorter in distance ?
there are plenty of indicators that the threat countered by the ams is a fabrication , and recent history has shown that the us -lrb- and uk -rrb- governments under the present administrations are prepared to lie to the public to get what they want .
it is one thing to say that putin is electioneering , which is a perfectly reasonable theory , but given that both the current us and uk governments may well be on their way out within the next two years , this could be perceived as a last stand to ensure that their neo-conservative , ' new american century ' ways remain embedded in the global political framework .
-lrb- they really have nothing to fear , for , as zbigniew brzezinski shows in his latest book , the democrats ' way of thinking in foreign policy does n't differ hugely in its imperialist overtones -rrb- .
as for the czechs and poles and the east-west europe divide , it is the usa , still the global superpower despite upsurges from india , china , russia and others , which has the most to gain from exploiting these disagreements .
they continue to " divide and rule " , as they always have , all over the world .
putin 's russia is countering the usa 's power games by befriending the middle east -lrb- talk of a ' gas-opec ' or equivalent " forum " springs to mind straight away -rrb- and builiding diplomatic and economic relations with strategic countries including venezuela , kazakhstan , japan , and china .
simon lewis , london , uk well ...
i try to look @ it from both sides .
the whole plan is useless .
if someone wants to fire a nuke , they will .
if they do then ?
guess we are done as humans .
every single one of us know the consequences .
oh , wait a minute !
someone did drop the bomb , right ?
anyway ...
i hope peace will prevail as usual .
its only going to take all the righteous to bond together and defeat whatever evil that is out there !
jzen , sf , california russia only has to worry about the us anti-missile defence if she plans on firing her nuclear missiles .
does russia really anticipate doing this ?
if so then we need the protection of the shield and if not then russia can laugh as bush wasting billions .
peter , nottingham the idea of an unopposed and un-opposable us superpower , a power that need not fear anyone else and is able to obtain the ' full spectrum dominance ' it craves , is deeply scary .
the quiet birth of the kind of global dominance set out in the project for a new american century , must be noticed .
or else we may see a kind of global apartheid , where the us gets whatever it wants whenever it wants and howsoever it desires and the only way for any other nation to have its interests even nearly served is to be play lap dog .
just as the us thought it was its manifest destiny to control the continent of north america , at the expense of the natives , it now seems to think it is its manifest destiny to control the globe , at the expense of every other person on the planet .
at least the cold war brought balance .
james waldorf-nicol , kent , uk mr lukyanov said : " if the idea of a global anti-missile system becomes a reality , the nuclear capability of russia , china and other countries will be undermined . "
and why exactly is this a bad thing ?
surely we , in europe , would be safer if russia and china were unable to use their nuclear weapons against us ?
i find it very hard to sympathise with the russian viewpoint when their president is threatening to point nukes at us ... -lsb- no name supplied -rsb- " russia only has to worry about the us anti-missile defence if she plans on firing her nuclear missiles .
does russia really anticipate doing this ?
if so then we need the protection of the shield and if not then russia can laugh as bush wasting billions . "
you miss the point entirely .
a system like this can be used aggressively .
the us can launch a strike against another nation in full knowledge that that nation can not strike back .
it is the death of the concept of mutually assured destruction which is what prevented the cold war escalating .
the us can use the leverage of its ability to launch unanswered nuclear and conventional strikes to achieve whatever it demands .
james waldorf-nicol , kent , uk putin is totally right to be concerned .
the us hypocrisy on this is frightening .
why should russia 's reaction to us plans be described as aggressive and unhelpful when it is us plans for domination that give rise to this level of anxiety the globe over .
some are describing this as ' cold peace ' - i do n't think the us ever ended the cold war ... and are now threating a nuclear strike on iran to stop it developing a defence against us armed israel !
as a us general said long ago - " we fought ww1 in europe , we fought ww2 in europe and if you fools let us we 'll fight ww3 there too " . grahame , sheffield i 've thought from the start that this all seems like the us causing trouble , and reading more into the background just strengthens my views .
bush is n't trying to protect " the homeland " , he is sending out a message that the us is in charge , and in charge of a lot .
i 'm sorry , but it 's not russia that needs to be put in it 's place , it 's the united states .
miles hayler , warwickshire , uk wake up people , the us that people looked towards for inspiration is no longer there - it has n't been since bush came to power in the questionable elections of 2000 .
although russia is n't a better option , we need a bi-polar world in order to be free and safe - each side will think very carefully before launching wars to impose their wills on the peoples of the world .
nawaz the us under the bush administration invaded iraq under false pretences so why should the russian government trust them on anti-missile systems .
president putin is right to resist this plan and it says little for the east europeans who are allowing anti-missile systems on their territory .
kenneth clark , hemel hempstead uk putin is exactly right to be concerned as should we .
whats going on with the world ?
is the eu that useless ?
why ca n't we put our own missile defence system in ?
by relying on the americans we are removing any control in world affairs we thought we had .
its pathetic how weak europe is as a power .
so weak we do n't mind being used by america as a dumping ground for shot down nuclear missiles .
tony blair 's support for bush in this makes him more than a laptop dog , it makes him a traitor .

viewpoint : russia 's missile fears i am very glad to read these words by prominent russian analyst .
he gets right to the point and gives all pros and cons of the current freeze in the us-russia relationship .
as for me , united states use eastern europe , especially those states that suffered a lot from russian empire -lrb- poland and ukraine -rrb- as a small change .
those countries feel insulted and annoyed by long lasting russian dominance , and that is why their leading politicians exploit any trifle to pinch a bear -lrb- russia -rrb- .
from 1990s up until 2004-2005 the bear was in hibernation .
now it is awakened and strives to establish status quo .
i hope the bear would have enough wisdom not to race with an eagle -lrb- us -rrb- and they would leave in peace .
otherwise , catastrophe might happen , eventually , because bears can not fly ? .
ilshat , manchester , usa even though they talk a lot about n korea and iran , but in fact , us control them quite well and they have got a lot cheaper solutions to protect anyone from the " danger " .
the ams is not related to them at all , and done for completely different purposes .
it 's geopolitics , and anyone related to it would not even mention " axis of evil " countries seriously ...
it is obvious that russia , and some other countries would be left with no choice , but develop new systems to overcome the ams .
not that they do n't do already , but as imbalance increases they would have to speed up the process .
you can say honestly -lrb- as putin did -rrb- or not talk about it openly , but there is no doubt that ams bases , radars , missiles bases , etc -lrb- russian or american -rrb- are the first targets of attack in an escalating conflict .
all that would not make any country more secured .
alex , uk president putin takes a very sensible stance on the proposed us military expansion into eastern europe .
the ams becomes an integral part of the us nuclear arsenal .
do the europeans really need american nukes in their back yard ?
russia is already surrounded by a ring of american military bases in the former eastern block states and soviet republics .
she also now shares borders with several new quazi-tyrannical states that the us keeps on a short leash and sets them off to bite russia when expedient .
the ams is another affront that does not achieve any useful purpose , but makes things globally much worse .
yuri zharikov , odessa , ukraine putin is right : the us anti-missile system is an existential threat to russia 's existance .
10 missiles now will become 1000 missiles in ten years time .
and who will guarantee the us would n't tip these alleged " anti-missile missiles " with nuke warheads ?
the defunct abm-treaty recognized that , if country 1 could nuke country 2 with impunity , because it could shoot down incoming missiles of country 2 , the only logical course of action for country 2 was to pre-emptively fire its missiles at country 1 , before country 1 had brought this anti-missile system online .
in short : " use ' em , or lose ' em " ...
roel , leuven , belgium is it any surprise that the us would want to maintain its global dominance and provide every option available , especially when we know that we can not rely on other nations to solve our problems ?
those in the eu need to realize that this is n't being unwillingly imposed on your governments .
the eu should grow a spine and prove that it can independently act without the us military / economy , otherwise nothing is going to change- get real !
additionally , it really does n't help that the russians and the chinese consistently undermine the us 's position in dealing with rouge states .
what the hell are we supposed to do ?
if those " powerful " states want to play with the big boys then so be it .
certainly there are always more diplomatic options , but the truth is every nation is out for its own interest and if there is room to expand and flex muscle , someone will always fill that vacuum .
andrew , chicago , usa quote : " many of the people i have talked to in private have told me they believe the anti-missile system is a us tactic to prevent the eu from becoming an independent player in foreign policy " .
a fantastic point which is rarely articulated - us foreign policy & particularly it 's ' special relationship with britain ' always seems divisive & geared to weaken the eu , maintaining their superior position as the world 's only superpower .
coincidence ?
iain , bristol , uk -lsb- putin 's -rsb- country is skid row , and he 's worrying about u.s. missiles ? !
john kluver bbc news website reader , tucson , usa hmm , let 's see - putin has botched the ukraine -lrb- remember he called to congratulate yanukovich -rrb- , and he 's botched georgia , the baltics and poland .
he 's killed off the free press , in particular tv , in his country .
remember that no matter what he says or does he is always portrayed as a winner on tv in russia .
russia is far less free today , for example , than it was even in 1988 in the ussr ! !
and the u.s. is supposed to listen to him ? ? ?
his country is weak and poor , and old ladies beg everywhere on the streets of moscow .
his country is skid row , and he 's worrying about u.s. missiles ? !
geez , maybe solve your domestic problems first .
should n't he worry more about russia 's shrinking population ? ?
he 's a loser leader of a loser country and he should be ignored .
john kluver , tucson , usa rogue nations .
who 's to decide which nation is a ' rogue ' one ? and what ' rogue ' exactly means ?
there are un rules and russia strictly abides with them as nuclear materials are concerned .
why the us did n't stop pakistan -lrb- israel -rrb- and bomb it into quarks after it acquired nuclear weapons ?
why iran is worse ?
pakistan is surely more unstable and unpredictable .
what if japan decides to go nuclear ?
there are no easy answers , it is better to wait and see .
a country may acquire a nuclear deterrent and behave .
you can always launch a nuclear war .
how can you stop iran ?
a military action may cause worse consequences than patient politics .
pavel , rostov , russia a pox upon both your houses .
the global economic and military dominionism of the usa government and the resurgent autocratism of putin 's government are the festering poison that is so revolting for the average citizen of the world who is trying to make a world that is livable for all it 's citizens .
the impudent arrogance of both governments is reprehensible .
harold l nicol , st paul usa ... ever since britain lost superpower status at the end of 19th century it has been thriving on balancing power dynamic between europe and the us ...
what is happening today is no different .
britain and the us are trying to keep the status quo in the regional and global distribution of power .
they are trying hard to preempt any meaningful change that can undermine their strategic positions .
they want to deny the continent any chance of emerging strong as a whole .
playing on anti-russian and pro-american sentiments in young states of eastern europe is a smart preventive tactic to weaken european unity and regional security and , thus , secure the status quo for long time to come ...
the only problems is , as mr. lukyanov put it " there are big players watching on the sidelines - china , india , and iran - that can emerge as winners " if the us gets stuck keeping european continent weak .
if , however , the us and britain jointly manage to drive another long-term wedge in europe -lrb- regional " cold war " -rrb- , it will be able to afford to get busy with weakening others .
now that will be the start of the new american century .
if that happens , britain will have to get busy making the us dependent on british as the irreplacable agents meddling in european affairs and keeping europe weak .
otherwise , britain risks being reduced to a mere lapdog of the americans .
although that will happen anyway if the us project of the new american century truly gets realized .
yevgeni , moscow , russia as a citizen of the country , ukraine , which mr lukanov calls former integral part of the soviet union , i would million times say " god bless america ! " , again , just in the case of deploying anti-missile defence shield in eastern europe , because this is completely correct and up-to-date decision , despite of my criticism of other actions of the bush 's administration .
i 'm surprised how blind sometimes western europeans are in terms of russia .
something i 've conceived of mr lukanov 's article as well as russian president 's behaviour is that this country has been planning to become new soviet union -lrb- even precursory look at modern putin 's russia displays that it had become so already -rrb- .
and i want to ask all people here so worried about global warming , why mrs merkel , if she is so worried about this issue , does not openly say that russia is major energetic terrorist ?
in the beginning of 2006 , when russia blackmailed my country by gas price , i heard words of support only from poland , baltic countries and the united states .
mrs. merkel instead called only for fast compromise between ukraine and russia , clearly understanding that the price of this compromise could be only shifting control over our main gas pipelines to russian gazprom ?
oh , of course , do german enterprises , which 40 % depend on russian gas supplies , causing pollution too , care about something like ukraine ?
oksana , kyiv , ukraine this should be discussed at the un to ratify the implications of such moves , this does n't just affect russia gerry mangan bbc news website reader , basingstoke , england this defense system tips the balance of power completely , creating a super power with the single most biggest nuclear arsenal .
what would a wannabe president with the same superiority complex as bush do with this power on nations opposed or making things difficult .
this should be discussed at the un to ratify the implications of such moves , this does n't just affect russia .
gerry mangan , basingstoke , england all russia has to do is stop providing uranium to iran , stop largely siding with them on their nuclear program and forth and stronger back the calls for north korea to disarm .
if russia was n't aiding these countries through it 's lack of will for tougher sanctions or tougher action against these nations then they would n't be a nuclear risk , hence the us would also have no excuse for needing a missile shield .
russia is as much at fault in helping give the us an excuse for a missile shield in the first place helping these rogue nations ...
ian , leeds i think that ' europe ' just need someone to be afraid of , and now i read so many anti-russian reviews and almost nothing that explains russian position without fear of ' big bad russia ' . its very pity igor , moscow , russian federation i have no brief to make for mr. putin , who seems to be more of an autocrat than a democrat .
but it is absurd to compare contemporary russia to the former soviet union .
u.s. presidents abraham lincoln , franklin d. roosevelt , and harry s. truman had the wisdom to understand that you do not treat a former foe like a convicted criminal , but rather like an errant friend whose friendship might be won again .
it was needlessly provocative to extend nato right up to the russian border , and it is needlessly provocative to attempt to put elements of an anti-missile defense in countries bordering on russia .
there are anti-ballistic missile radars and interceptor missiles that can be deployed aboard ships which can be stationed off of the coasts of north korea and iran .
this is where it is most feasable to detect and intercept ballistic missiles just after they are launched anyway .
george , somewhere in texas the onus is on russia to decide whether its imperial past or a potentially prosperous future is more important tomek bbc news website reader , londonderry , nh , us ... it is not the case that europe 's russia policy is filtered through poland ; only in the last few weeks has the eu finally recognized any of poland 's concerns about russia 's behaviors .
further , if the eu did base its policies towards russia on poland , that would still be a potentially advantageous situation for moscow , as , for all the historical hostility , most poles understand that their security and prosperity ultimately depend on finding some accommodation with russia .
poland will never be fully secure without russia also feeling secure , and an economically prosperous russia would benefit poland immensely - while an impoverished and politically unstable russia will always threaten poland 's own economic and political security .
we have no choice ; we are -lrb- relative -rrb- neighbors , like it or not , and most poles understand that just as renewed relations with germany had to be rebuilt , so too will someday a rapprochement with moscow be necessary .
that , however , will take two sides to achieve , and as i said , for now the onus is on russia to decide whether its imperial past or a potentially prosperous future is more important .
tomek , londonderry , nh usa the shield is " defensive . "
so calm down all of you america haters .
in fact , after listening to how much you hate us i think we need more defense sites .
i bet you wish you had a shield too .
well , if you 're nice we 'll put you under the umbrella .
if not , you can play with the trustworthy russians , the loving north koreans , and the ever so friendly iranians .
i 'm sorry that we 're not like them enough for you to like us .
alex turner , las vegas , us the analysis is mostly excellent .
russia , however , is not " sadly encouraging " the situation : it is all the us that is being obdurate because it can not begin to imagine life on a planet where it does not , in the manner of the most spoiled of brats , get its own way .
neither are britain & france " formerly " empires : that is just pap for the primary grades .
we all know that america , britain , france , spain & germany continue to command vast empires to this day , even if there is some self-government in their cultural or economic dependencies .
russia is not " asking to get something back " - i.e. ' superpower ' or even ' great power ' status .
russia was , and remains , a mighty nuclear power not to be taken lightly .
the idea that it was ever not powerful is as silly as the suggestion would be that american was not a global power during its global depression - or after 9/11 , or even now , when it remains on its knees in iraq & incapable of extricating itself from a small botched war .
let 's set aside the propaganda slogans & the politically correct cant , and look at simple , patent realities staring us in the face .
can the us afford to go to war with russia , for example over kosovo ?
of course not .
can europeans afford a revival of the decade of gore & agony that brought about the kosovo problem in the first place ?
not at all - much less a major or even minor conflict between the us & russia .
kindly simply turn off bush 's microphone ... & stop throwing petrol on a fire that is rapidly swelling out of control ...
maria amadei ashot , berkeley , california i 'm not sure i particularly believe / trust russia or the us , but i do envy russia 's ability and willingness to stand up to bush and say ' no ' .
nik , milton keynes why does america antagonize russia while pretending that unapologetically totalitarian regimes in p. r. of china and saudi arabia are ' friends ' ?
mike bbc news website reader , ancaster , ontario , canada the true question is why america is taking this course of action against russia at this time ?
its military is overstretched , its global popularity is at an all-time-low , and russia is one of the few world powers that is content to not challenge america if it is left alone .
why does america antagonize russia while pretending that unapologetically totalitarian regimes in p. r. of china and saudi arabia are ' friends ' ?
mike , ancaster , ontario , canada the fact of the matter is , the american have provided security to the world , can you imagine without american security ?
god bless america ...
alex , london great analysis !
when the ussr put nuclear missiles in cuba it did n't change anything strategically either , both the us and the su were capable of mutual destruction .
a few extra missiles fired from cuba would not have changed that .
yet , the americans made a huge fuss about it !
that 's exactly the situation here , anything that diminishes or degrades russia 's nuclear capability is clearly an act of aggression .
vladislav , moscow what a shame that no eu country leader has guts to accept that mr putin is right .
alan , amazing timing : did bush and putin agree in advance of the g8 meeting to have this missile issue overshadow ... global warming , so that they could avoid having to discuss it ?
colin mckenzie bbc news website reader , manchester , uk amazing timing : did bush and putin agree in advance of the g8 meeting to have this missile issue overshadow the very real threat to this planet , global warming , so that they could avoid having to discuss it ?
and by the way has bush ever stopped to think that rising sea levels caused by global warming triggered by us in-action could be just as devastating to coastal areas of nuclear armed india and pakistan as a direct attack on them and that at some point in many years time they may point their weapons at the us to save their own land ?
colin mckenzie , manchester , uk the article that is presented here has some validity in some respect about the protection of eastern european countries because neither the russian nor the western eurpean countries would come forward to protect them other than united states of america .
the eastern europeans feel much secure if the americans are there to save them and by virtue if and when their security interests are jeopardized by either western europe or the russians .
in this context , it is fair to point out that out of this tension about the missile defense system initiated by the u.s may have some validity to the protection of europe overall as we all know that western europe will not make such a defense plan that would serve up as a common goal for all europeans .
it is not only going to bankrupt them but also will not have a cohessive defense policy to safeguard european interest .
yes , putin may have a reason to be upset about but he may take it easy not worrying to much about russian security interest because he has asserted himself aligning with the the americans and the europeans in a common security interest of the global world that we live in .
he must realize that the old geopolitical game that had been fought early in the 20th century is not going to work and for that reason he must work jointly with the u.s to irradicate poverty , terrorism from the face of this earth .
azim , harrisburg , pa , united states yes we did drop the bomb ... and the entire planet was not destroyed .
as a matter of fact , the enemy did not care enough about therr own people so we had to drop a second one before they surrendered .
it 's tough being the only remaining super power .
it would be a lot tougher on the rest of you , if we were n't .
chuck d , us mil - deployed i think the bases could just be a wedge issue to put pressure on russia to deal with iran .
it 's the russians who are building the reactor for tehran .
i would n't be suprised if the state department says " russia , if you can help us make sure iran does n't get the bomb we wo n't humiliate you by putting these bases in your former sphere of influence . "
the same goes for the british and the russian spy case .
it might all be a way to put pressure on moscow .
tj , south dakota usa it 's obvious that the west is on the path of confrontation with anything it regards as ' incompatible ' with western interests and was encouraged , so to speak , by the unbalance in the unsc after the ussr and allies ceased to exist .
it was offered a finger and decided to go for the whole hand .
the russian government finds that the circling of its territory by us / nato -lrb- and belittling of slavs ? -rrb- has gone far enough - rightfully imo - and is determined to restore the balance .
we should get used to the idea that there ca n't be a yin without yang .
jj van kempen , den haag , netherlands why is everyone so quick to call the united states a bully ?
modern russia under putin is just the ussr by another name .
it is deeply unsettling .
have we forgotten their barbarousness in afghanistan and inside the iron curtain ?
putin is ... a despotic autocrat - just how accountable is he ?
is russia trustworthy ?
no.they use their new-found economic clout to strangle former cis countries .
is russia stable ?
no .
what happens when oil prices drop etc ?
why should we continue fearing a vast poverty stricken country with a declining population.why ca n't the us protect the west from nuclear attacks ?
russia only need to fear this if they plan on bombing the west otherwise they should relax .
why should we respond every time a decaying ex-superpower wants to flex its muscles ?
maybe the nuclear defence system might finally highlight the absurdity of nuclear missiles .
if not- at least we 're safe .
dexter galvin , dublin , ireland no-one needs to be a lap dog , and surely no-one will laugh if us does put the missiles shield .
takes one or the other radical view point to tip the balance , does n't it ?
actually , it might not happen -lrb- it 's expensive and military spend only helps sending us into a solid budget deficit -rrb- - some of the us objectives are already achieved 100 % anyway - divide and conquer that is .
it 's amazing how oblivious people remain : may i ask a simple question - to whose benefit the current situation is ? who exactly is provoking , dividing and conquering ; preventing us to benefit ?
has eu not learnt any lessons from history ? we have a great leverage of strong western economies and a willing growing strong market next door !
as well as an excellent collar for provision of peace .
let 's be honest - it 's a gold mine for the city ..
why in the world are we not pursuing it and entertaining someone else 's tactics and interests -lrb- who 's interests , by the way , do not include our wellbeing - wake up -rrb- ? ? , london mr lukyanov is absolutely right .
russia has every right to be aggressive in this case .
it is a cause of worry for india also and any other country with nuclear weapons if a global missile defence system comes into place .
it would give the us complete immunity in case of a war .
america is systematically trying to conquer the world .
they seem to be afraid of the fact that china , russia and india are growing stronger and want to stop this .
europe on the other hand should realise they are not going to benefit from this missile shield .
when it comes to a war , america would not care one bit what happens to europe .
europe should not alienate russia keeping old cold war memories in mind .
they have to realise the present situation with america having it selfish and dangerous objectives .
anand , bangalore i can see a few fair points in general however when talk about russia 's interest in economic growth and want to be in the club i think they should be prepare to play by the rules of the club .
can any of the developed nations see russia contributing anything to that extent other than playing cheap games with immaturity and aggressive outburst from kremlin instad of intelligent political and tactical manoeuvres to promote their genuine desire and comitment.what actualy went wrong to glasnost & perestroika one should wonder .
m thomas , london , uk europe needs what the us has to offer ! !
its not only rogue states like iran and north korea which we need to contend with , but russia as well .
the most feared would be russia , because when the chips are down , its the rogue states and russia who will join hands against the us and europe .
and believe me , its heading that way soon , unfortunately though !
juliana smith , croydon the various comments are quite enlightening .
but whatever the real reasons for this new chill in global nuclear politics , the most worrying thing may be the growing inability of u.s policy-makers to distinguish their own propaganda from real threats , and to systematically dismiss the protests of those who disagree like mr putin .
it would be excessive to claim that the world no longer cares for any thing that washington says , but people - powerless as they may be - are not idiots , and it is equally doubtful if a nation 's strategic interests can be durably ensured through browbeating and force .
the other serious reason for concern is the complacency of major nuclear stakeholders like china .
their fence sitting tactics , far from weakening the u.s or gaining them any strategic edge , has instead helped to reinforce the position of the u.s , thus enabling this latter to move its mile stones into central asia since the collapse of the ussr and its satelite states .
dominic lulu , c.d spain russia is right .
anyone who takes a detailed look at what the experts are saying and have been saying for the last decade or so -lrb- and not since last week -rrb- will know that the us , being in a unique position as the most militarily powerful nation on earth , will want to consolidate it 's position and keep ahead of the other rising powers while it can before the other world powers can catch up .
one of the ways the us will stay ahead of the others is by having a nuclear first strike option , where by the us military can destroy a rival nuclear power in a first strike without having to fear a devastating nuclear retaliatory response since what nuclear weapons the opposing military may launch -lrb- those that survived the first strike -rrb- will be intercepted by the global us abm system .
of course to set up such a system will take a few more decades -lrb- more or less -rrb- but for the us military , it will be worth it .
what we are seeing in poland and the czech republic is the first steps for such a system .
such systems will be able to track and intercept the older russian missiles that are in it 's radar coverage even if russia shoots them towards the north pole .
the us knows only they have the financial resources and technical know how to build a global abm network at this moment in time .
they are going ahead with it .
the us will not be able to impose itself on others using purely conventional means , but with wmds it can .
bablu rahman , haywards heath , u.k we polish do not want missiles on our soil , do not want to be a target but we know , we can not rely on europe which is depending on russia 's energy supplies more and more .
russia 's never been reliable partner !
you witness it on daily basis .
russia -lrb- soviet u -rrb- had destroyed our country for 50 years , plus between 1939 - 41 of wwii killed more poles then germans did .
i know us shields ai n't the best solution but at least something .
do n't get me wrong , i think that the usa is the bigest danger for peace on our globe but that 's why we need to stick with them .
this is business .
rob , krakow , poland reagan offered to make the original " star wars " systems available to other nations - " we 're not gonna give it away , they 're gonna have to pay for it ... "
if the us makes the current systems available to russia , surely that rebalances the equation ?
it could be useful for all concerned to have interceptors closer to the likely origins of hostile missile launches .
d wilson , london , uk yeah , i also agree with the article. lets agree on that us is the sole power and is trying very hard to protect its interests while undermining the others . be it the attacks on the middle east or the simplest thing like not accepting the co2 emission curbs set prior to the g8 meet .
it is doing the same thing in india by that nuclear agreement which will retard the nuclear capabilities of india while 2 nuclear countries namely china and pakistan sit next to it and mind you both are hostile to india .
devendra , new delhi , india its all about putin ...
just as russia was about to emerge from 1000 years of darkness , into the light of democratic freedom - putin and his kgb gang has plunged his people back into the abyss ...
the eu must go directly to the russian people and offer them a different vision of their future ¿ a future of a strong democratic russia - economically and politically .
the eu must explain to the russian people that because of the expansion of nato and the eu for the first time in a thousand years - russia is free from invasion from the west .
russian mothers no longer have to bury their sons by the millions due to invasion or leave their dead bodies on european battlefields due to their government alliances with western countries .
the expansion of the eu through the enlargement process and the creation of a special free trade zone including a privileged partnership with russia is the only way to guarantee freedom and democracy for russia and central asia and oil / gas supply security for europe .
larry houle , spring texas i think russia are right to object in this instance and can understand why putin has reacted in the way he has done .
i was infuriated when i heard of how the usa wanted to plant various defence systems across europe as though the continent belongs to them ...
it 's about time someone stood up to them and said ' no , this is unacceptable ' .
sarah , hereford , uk and what if russia , or venezuela , or some other party not in the freedom club , did a deal so they could place military bases in either canada or mexico -lrb- or cuba -rrb- to protect some intangible interests against unidentified parties ?
would the us stand idly by ?
also , given current us record with truth and integrity and -lrb- almost -rrb- unilateral interventionism , why should n't russia hyperventilate ? paolo , powell , usa in my opinion , we should fear not only russia , but also the us .
if russia 's and china 's nuclear capabilities are undermined , or even useless , then the us would be the only nuclear superpower capable of sending one of those missiles -lrb- of which they 've got thousands , by the way -rrb- to europe .
this situation is a double edged sword .
we , europe , should arm ourselves against both .
markus pihlström , helsingfors , finland i thought your article was another in a long list of ' pundits ' making their living by chewing up today 's news and regurgitating it to market to the masses .
until the ending statement about -lrb- russia -rrb- being " a young ... " .
it reminds me of us history in the 1800s , when today 's powerful families and organizations were first starting up , ie . ' the robber barons ' of the old west -lrb- trains and newspapers -rrb- .
i think i understand russia a bit better now - thanks .
bill , cedar rapids , iowa , usa under the current administration the moral compass of america has changed dramatically .
in a world of rapid technological advances and changes in warfare the us is pursuing an approach easily circumvented .
the us appears to becoming more out of step with the world at a time when friends and allies are most important .
combine this with the us habit of pursuing its interests at the expense of all others and we have a worrying scenario. bill wallace , perth , australia i think mr. lukyanov fails to mention the primary reason for the us missile defenses in europe : the inevitable attack by iran and north korea against poland .
as bush said , these defenses have nothing to do with russia .
russia really has no missiles to speak of .
and , even if it did , everyone in poland loves the russians .
it 's the north koreans that the polish are really concerned with .
hordes of starving north korean soldiers .
thus , every major kielbasa -lsb- polish sausage -rsb- factory must be protected .
veniamin nikolayev , philadelphia , usa take a look at the geography - if russia were to fire missiles at the usa , they would go over the north pole , not poland or the czech republic .
i would suggest , therefore , that they are next to useless as a defence against russian missiles .
now if they base any in northern canada that would be a different matter altogether .
mike , salisbury uk europe is pathetically spineless , divided and weak and the us and russia untrustworthy and childish .
with the enlargement of the eu , any possibility of a common foreign and defense policy is lost which is why it is necessary to retain the british nuclear deterrent , however russia itself poses little threat as long as we maintain independent energy supplies -lrb- i.e. nuclear -rrb- as at the moment the russian state does not have the money to throw at a huge increase in its military capability .
european incompetence on foreign policy is just staggering . , why do we always dodge the real issue - oil ?
the ongoing iraq war is about installing a u.s. friendly regime to secure oil for america 's future energy requirements .
the war in afghanistan is due to the taliban not allowing a gas-pipe to run through it from kazakhstan to the pakistan coast .
and now that iran has started negotiating oil sales to china , instead of america , the u.s. seems to be moving its pieces around the global chess-board in readiness to secure yet more oil , by force -lrb- again -rrb- if need be .
no wonder putin 's worried .
russia , with its own not inconsiderable oil and gas reserves , could be the next battleground - sandwiched between china one side , and america 's ams on the other .
robert hossack , st austell , uk all i see is american neo-cons forcing their world view agenda & russian fascists pushing theirs .
all it does is highlight europe 's weakness , even if you 're generous it 's obvious that economic " soft power " can only get you so far .
europe has common interests with both america and russia but without europe-wide co-ordinated miltary procurement , strategy and forces then europe will always be stepped on by one or the other or both .
until europe has the military muscle to push it 's viewpoint and command some respect then we 'll always be sidelined and at risk .
chas , manchester , uk we must do everything in our power not to become dependent on russian gas and oil .
back track on deals already done or in negotiations .
the americans are playing some long term strategy for their own benefit .
just keep out of it .
ray sparrow , woodley england i 'm an american engineer who earned my living designing missile defense systems for many years , and i agree with russia .
this is the start of a world-wide system of surveillance radars and interceptor missiles .
it is part of the neocon 's agenda to establish a lasting american hegemony .
countries who do not wish to live under such a new world order should oppose it now .
george works , st. eustatius , netherlands antilles in ascribing to the latest ' defensive ' missile plan a diabolically devious long-term plan to ensure us hegemony well into the 21st century is probably to credit us foreign policy planners with far more intelligence and foresight than history suggests they actually possess .
the problem for us all , including mr putin , is not that the us is too clever , too sophisticated in its understanding of the world and us global interests : the problem surely is the dangerously unsophisticated world view which permeates all levels of american society , including the higher echelons of the us administration .
shouting at mr bush et al from behind the barricades is counter-productive in-so-far as it only serves to further reinforce their simplistic perception of foreign affairs .
in school , in life and in the conduct of foreign policy understanding is more usually achieved through reasoned explanation , rather than polemics or confrontation .
mark , bristol do not think that everyone in america -lrb- usa -rrb- supports this " shield " for europe .
most of us in the us do not want this war in iraq , we do not want nato , we do not want our troops in europe , we do not support " free trade " or " globilization " .
do n't just judge us by cnn or " w " .
he does not speak for most of us .
give america some credit .
at least we try to pretend to care about others , we raise money for relief efforts , some of us are trying to be good world citizens ... so do n't give up on america .
please .
marc daniel , charleston , south carolina , usa excellent summary from fyodor lukyanov ...
what i wonder is whether mr lukyanov would agree that , from the usa 's point of view , the ams could be perceived as a mechanism for diverting global attention away from us failures / war crimes -lrb- depending on your point of view -rrb- in the middle east .
this dispute flared up a couple of months ago , when the 4-year anniversary of the iraq invasion had just been clocked , the democrat-led congress was fighting for withdrawal -lrb- which it seems to have given up , sadly -rrb- , and us military strategy was under intense scrutiny and criticism .
suddenly the front page focus is all on russia , and the eu and usa seem to have succesfully sidelined the issues of the middle east and other problem areas .
the middle east is no less volatile than before , with palestine , lebanon and turkey / kurdistan witnessing either mass violence or heightened tensions , guantanamo is in a legal shambles , israel 's brutal military occupation of palestine is reaching its landmark 40th anniversary , yet the top international stories have consistently been putin 's rhetoric on the west and the ams , the russia-estonia clashes , and so on .
president putin insists that the ams is an affront because there is no threat to the us from either iran or north korea - apparently iran have no icbms and will not do so for 5-8 years , and as for north korea - if they were to attack the usa , even in theory , surely they would go over the pacific , which is much shorter in distance ?
there are plenty of indicators that the threat countered by the ams is a fabrication , and recent history has shown that the us -lrb- and uk -rrb- governments under the present administrations are prepared to lie to the public to get what they want .
it is one thing to say that putin is electioneering , which is a perfectly reasonable theory , but given that both the current us and uk governments may well be on their way out within the next two years , this could be perceived as a last stand to ensure that their neo-conservative , ' new american century ' ways remain embedded in the global political framework .
-lrb- they really have nothing to fear , for , as zbigniew brzezinski shows in his latest book , the democrats ' way of thinking in foreign policy does n't differ hugely in its imperialist overtones -rrb- .
as for the czechs and poles and the east-west europe divide , it is the usa , still the global superpower despite upsurges from india , china , russia and others , which has the most to gain from exploiting these disagreements .
they continue to " divide and rule " , as they always have , all over the world .
putin 's russia is countering the usa 's power games by befriending the middle east -lrb- talk of a ' gas-opec ' or equivalent " forum " springs to mind straight away -rrb- and builiding diplomatic and economic relations with strategic countries including venezuela , kazakhstan , japan , and china .
simon lewis , london , uk well ...
i try to look @ it from both sides .
the whole plan is useless .
if someone wants to fire a nuke , they will .
if they do then ?
guess we are done as humans .
every single one of us know the consequences .
oh , wait a minute !
someone did drop the bomb , right ?
anyway ...
i hope peace will prevail as usual .
its only going to take all the righteous to bond together and defeat whatever evil that is out there !
jzen , sf , california russia only has to worry about the us anti-missile defence if she plans on firing her nuclear missiles .
does russia really anticipate doing this ?
if so then we need the protection of the shield and if not then russia can laugh as bush wasting billions .
peter , nottingham the idea of an unopposed and un-opposable us superpower , a power that need not fear anyone else and is able to obtain the ' full spectrum dominance ' it craves , is deeply scary .
the quiet birth of the kind of global dominance set out in the project for a new american century , must be noticed .
or else we may see a kind of global apartheid , where the us gets whatever it wants whenever it wants and howsoever it desires and the only way for any other nation to have its interests even nearly served is to be play lap dog .
just as the us thought it was its manifest destiny to control the continent of north america , at the expense of the natives , it now seems to think it is its manifest destiny to control the globe , at the expense of every other person on the planet .
at least the cold war brought balance .
james waldorf-nicol , kent , uk mr lukyanov said : " if the idea of a global anti-missile system becomes a reality , the nuclear capability of russia , china and other countries will be undermined . "
and why exactly is this a bad thing ?
surely we , in europe , would be safer if russia and china were unable to use their nuclear weapons against us ?
i find it very hard to sympathise with the russian viewpoint when their president is threatening to point nukes at us ... -lsb- no name supplied -rsb- " russia only has to worry about the us anti-missile defence if she plans on firing her nuclear missiles .
does russia really anticipate doing this ?
if so then we need the protection of the shield and if not then russia can laugh as bush wasting billions . "
you miss the point entirely .
a system like this can be used aggressively .
the us can launch a strike against another nation in full knowledge that that nation can not strike back .
it is the death of the concept of mutually assured destruction which is what prevented the cold war escalating .
the us can use the leverage of its ability to launch unanswered nuclear and conventional strikes to achieve whatever it demands .
james waldorf-nicol , kent , uk putin is totally right to be concerned .
the us hypocrisy on this is frightening .
why should russia 's reaction to us plans be described as aggressive and unhelpful when it is us plans for domination that give rise to this level of anxiety the globe over .
some are describing this as ' cold peace ' - i do n't think the us ever ended the cold war ... and are now threating a nuclear strike on iran to stop it developing a defence against us armed israel !
as a us general said long ago - " we fought ww1 in europe , we fought ww2 in europe and if you fools let us we 'll fight ww3 there too " . grahame , sheffield i 've thought from the start that this all seems like the us causing trouble , and reading more into the background just strengthens my views .
bush is n't trying to protect " the homeland " , he is sending out a message that the us is in charge , and in charge of a lot .
i 'm sorry , but it 's not russia that needs to be put in it 's place , it 's the united states .
miles hayler , warwickshire , uk wake up people , the us that people looked towards for inspiration is no longer there - it has n't been since bush came to power in the questionable elections of 2000 .
although russia is n't a better option , we need a bi-polar world in order to be free and safe - each side will think very carefully before launching wars to impose their wills on the peoples of the world .
nawaz the us under the bush administration invaded iraq under false pretences so why should the russian government trust them on anti-missile systems .
president putin is right to resist this plan and it says little for the east europeans who are allowing anti-missile systems on their territory .
kenneth clark , hemel hempstead uk putin is exactly right to be concerned as should we .
whats going on with the world ?
is the eu that useless ?
why ca n't we put our own missile defence system in ?
by relying on the americans we are removing any control in world affairs we thought we had .
its pathetic how weak europe is as a power .
so weak we do n't mind being used by america as a dumping ground for shot down nuclear missiles .
tony blair 's support for bush in this makes him more than a laptop dog , it makes him a traitor .

viewpoint : russia 's missile fears i am very glad to read these words by prominent russian analyst .
he gets right to the point and gives all pros and cons of the current freeze in the us-russia relationship .
as for me , united states use eastern europe , especially those states that suffered a lot from russian empire -lrb- poland and ukraine -rrb- as a small change .
those countries feel insulted and annoyed by long lasting russian dominance , and that is why their leading politicians exploit any trifle to pinch a bear -lrb- russia -rrb- .
from 1990s up until 2004-2005 the bear was in hibernation .
now it is awakened and strives to establish status quo .
i hope the bear would have enough wisdom not to race with an eagle -lrb- us -rrb- and they would leave in peace .
otherwise , catastrophe might happen , eventually , because bears can not fly ? .
ilshat , manchester , usa even though they talk a lot about n korea and iran , but in fact , us control them quite well and they have got a lot cheaper solutions to protect anyone from the " danger " .
the ams is not related to them at all , and done for completely different purposes .
it 's geopolitics , and anyone related to it would not even mention " axis of evil " countries seriously ...
it is obvious that russia , and some other countries would be left with no choice , but develop new systems to overcome the ams .
not that they do n't do already , but as imbalance increases they would have to speed up the process .
you can say honestly -lrb- as putin did -rrb- or not talk about it openly , but there is no doubt that ams bases , radars , missiles bases , etc -lrb- russian or american -rrb- are the first targets of attack in an escalating conflict .
all that would not make any country more secured .
alex , uk president putin takes a very sensible stance on the proposed us military expansion into eastern europe .
the ams becomes an integral part of the us nuclear arsenal .
do the europeans really need american nukes in their back yard ?
russia is already surrounded by a ring of american military bases in the former eastern block states and soviet republics .
she also now shares borders with several new quazi-tyrannical states that the us keeps on a short leash and sets them off to bite russia when expedient .
the ams is another affront that does not achieve any useful purpose , but makes things globally much worse .
yuri zharikov , odessa , ukraine putin is right : the us anti-missile system is an existential threat to russia 's existance .
10 missiles now will become 1000 missiles in ten years time .
and who will guarantee the us would n't tip these alleged " anti-missile missiles " with nuke warheads ?
the defunct abm-treaty recognized that , if country 1 could nuke country 2 with impunity , because it could shoot down incoming missiles of country 2 , the only logical course of action for country 2 was to pre-emptively fire its missiles at country 1 , before country 1 had brought this anti-missile system online .
in short : " use ' em , or lose ' em " ...
roel , leuven , belgium is it any surprise that the us would want to maintain its global dominance and provide every option available , especially when we know that we can not rely on other nations to solve our problems ?
those in the eu need to realize that this is n't being unwillingly imposed on your governments .
the eu should grow a spine and prove that it can independently act without the us military / economy , otherwise nothing is going to change- get real !
additionally , it really does n't help that the russians and the chinese consistently undermine the us 's position in dealing with rouge states .
what the hell are we supposed to do ?
if those " powerful " states want to play with the big boys then so be it .
certainly there are always more diplomatic options , but the truth is every nation is out for its own interest and if there is room to expand and flex muscle , someone will always fill that vacuum .
andrew , chicago , usa quote : " many of the people i have talked to in private have told me they believe the anti-missile system is a us tactic to prevent the eu from becoming an independent player in foreign policy " .
a fantastic point which is rarely articulated - us foreign policy & particularly it 's ' special relationship with britain ' always seems divisive & geared to weaken the eu , maintaining their superior position as the world 's only superpower .
coincidence ?
iain , bristol , uk -lsb- putin 's -rsb- country is skid row , and he 's worrying about u.s. missiles ? !
john kluver bbc news website reader , tucson , usa hmm , let 's see - putin has botched the ukraine -lrb- remember he called to congratulate yanukovich -rrb- , and he 's botched georgia , the baltics and poland .
he 's killed off the free press , in particular tv , in his country .
remember that no matter what he says or does he is always portrayed as a winner on tv in russia .
russia is far less free today , for example , than it was even in 1988 in the ussr ! !
and the u.s. is supposed to listen to him ? ? ?
his country is weak and poor , and old ladies beg everywhere on the streets of moscow .
his country is skid row , and he 's worrying about u.s. missiles ? !
geez , maybe solve your domestic problems first .
should n't he worry more about russia 's shrinking population ? ?
he 's a loser leader of a loser country and he should be ignored .
john kluver , tucson , usa rogue nations .
who 's to decide which nation is a ' rogue ' one ? and what ' rogue ' exactly means ?
there are un rules and russia strictly abides with them as nuclear materials are concerned .
why the us did n't stop pakistan -lrb- israel -rrb- and bomb it into quarks after it acquired nuclear weapons ?
why iran is worse ?
pakistan is surely more unstable and unpredictable .
what if japan decides to go nuclear ?
there are no easy answers , it is better to wait and see .
a country may acquire a nuclear deterrent and behave .
you can always launch a nuclear war .
how can you stop iran ?
a military action may cause worse consequences than patient politics .
pavel , rostov , russia a pox upon both your houses .
the global economic and military dominionism of the usa government and the resurgent autocratism of putin 's government are the festering poison that is so revolting for the average citizen of the world who is trying to make a world that is livable for all it 's citizens .
the impudent arrogance of both governments is reprehensible .
harold l nicol , st paul usa ... ever since britain lost superpower status at the end of 19th century it has been thriving on balancing power dynamic between europe and the us ...
what is happening today is no different .
britain and the us are trying to keep the status quo in the regional and global distribution of power .
they are trying hard to preempt any meaningful change that can undermine their strategic positions .
they want to deny the continent any chance of emerging strong as a whole .
playing on anti-russian and pro-american sentiments in young states of eastern europe is a smart preventive tactic to weaken european unity and regional security and , thus , secure the status quo for long time to come ...
the only problems is , as mr. lukyanov put it " there are big players watching on the sidelines - china , india , and iran - that can emerge as winners " if the us gets stuck keeping european continent weak .
if , however , the us and britain jointly manage to drive another long-term wedge in europe -lrb- regional " cold war " -rrb- , it will be able to afford to get busy with weakening others .
now that will be the start of the new american century .
if that happens , britain will have to get busy making the us dependent on british as the irreplacable agents meddling in european affairs and keeping europe weak .
otherwise , britain risks being reduced to a mere lapdog of the americans .
although that will happen anyway if the us project of the new american century truly gets realized .
yevgeni , moscow , russia as a citizen of the country , ukraine , which mr lukanov calls former integral part of the soviet union , i would million times say " god bless america ! " , again , just in the case of deploying anti-missile defence shield in eastern europe , because this is completely correct and up-to-date decision , despite of my criticism of other actions of the bush 's administration .
i 'm surprised how blind sometimes western europeans are in terms of russia .
something i 've conceived of mr lukanov 's article as well as russian president 's behaviour is that this country has been planning to become new soviet union -lrb- even precursory look at modern putin 's russia displays that it had become so already -rrb- .
and i want to ask all people here so worried about global warming , why mrs merkel , if she is so worried about this issue , does not openly say that russia is major energetic terrorist ?
in the beginning of 2006 , when russia blackmailed my country by gas price , i heard words of support only from poland , baltic countries and the united states .
mrs. merkel instead called only for fast compromise between ukraine and russia , clearly understanding that the price of this compromise could be only shifting control over our main gas pipelines to russian gazprom ?
oh , of course , do german enterprises , which 40 % depend on russian gas supplies , causing pollution too , care about something like ukraine ?
oksana , kyiv , ukraine this should be discussed at the un to ratify the implications of such moves , this does n't just affect russia gerry mangan bbc news website reader , basingstoke , england this defense system tips the balance of power completely , creating a super power with the single most biggest nuclear arsenal .
what would a wannabe president with the same superiority complex as bush do with this power on nations opposed or making things difficult .
this should be discussed at the un to ratify the implications of such moves , this does n't just affect russia .
gerry mangan , basingstoke , england all russia has to do is stop providing uranium to iran , stop largely siding with them on their nuclear program and forth and stronger back the calls for north korea to disarm .
if russia was n't aiding these countries through it 's lack of will for tougher sanctions or tougher action against these nations then they would n't be a nuclear risk , hence the us would also have no excuse for needing a missile shield .
russia is as much at fault in helping give the us an excuse for a missile shield in the first place helping these rogue nations ...
ian , leeds i think that ' europe ' just need someone to be afraid of , and now i read so many anti-russian reviews and almost nothing that explains russian position without fear of ' big bad russia ' . its very pity igor , moscow , russian federation i have no brief to make for mr. putin , who seems to be more of an autocrat than a democrat .
but it is absurd to compare contemporary russia to the former soviet union .
u.s. presidents abraham lincoln , franklin d. roosevelt , and harry s. truman had the wisdom to understand that you do not treat a former foe like a convicted criminal , but rather like an errant friend whose friendship might be won again .
it was needlessly provocative to extend nato right up to the russian border , and it is needlessly provocative to attempt to put elements of an anti-missile defense in countries bordering on russia .
there are anti-ballistic missile radars and interceptor missiles that can be deployed aboard ships which can be stationed off of the coasts of north korea and iran .
this is where it is most feasable to detect and intercept ballistic missiles just after they are launched anyway .
george , somewhere in texas the onus is on russia to decide whether its imperial past or a potentially prosperous future is more important tomek bbc news website reader , londonderry , nh , us ... it is not the case that europe 's russia policy is filtered through poland ; only in the last few weeks has the eu finally recognized any of poland 's concerns about russia 's behaviors .
further , if the eu did base its policies towards russia on poland , that would still be a potentially advantageous situation for moscow , as , for all the historical hostility , most poles understand that their security and prosperity ultimately depend on finding some accommodation with russia .
poland will never be fully secure without russia also feeling secure , and an economically prosperous russia would benefit poland immensely - while an impoverished and politically unstable russia will always threaten poland 's own economic and political security .
we have no choice ; we are -lrb- relative -rrb- neighbors , like it or not , and most poles understand that just as renewed relations with germany had to be rebuilt , so too will someday a rapprochement with moscow be necessary .
that , however , will take two sides to achieve , and as i said , for now the onus is on russia to decide whether its imperial past or a potentially prosperous future is more important .
tomek , londonderry , nh usa the shield is " defensive . "
so calm down all of you america haters .
in fact , after listening to how much you hate us i think we need more defense sites .
i bet you wish you had a shield too .
well , if you 're nice we 'll put you under the umbrella .
if not , you can play with the trustworthy russians , the loving north koreans , and the ever so friendly iranians .
i 'm sorry that we 're not like them enough for you to like us .
alex turner , las vegas , us the analysis is mostly excellent .
russia , however , is not " sadly encouraging " the situation : it is all the us that is being obdurate because it can not begin to imagine life on a planet where it does not , in the manner of the most spoiled of brats , get its own way .
neither are britain & france " formerly " empires : that is just pap for the primary grades .
we all know that america , britain , france , spain & germany continue to command vast empires to this day , even if there is some self-government in their cultural or economic dependencies .
russia is not " asking to get something back " - i.e. ' superpower ' or even ' great power ' status .
russia was , and remains , a mighty nuclear power not to be taken lightly .
the idea that it was ever not powerful is as silly as the suggestion would be that american was not a global power during its global depression - or after 9/11 , or even now , when it remains on its knees in iraq & incapable of extricating itself from a small botched war .
let 's set aside the propaganda slogans & the politically correct cant , and look at simple , patent realities staring us in the face .
can the us afford to go to war with russia , for example over kosovo ?
of course not .
can europeans afford a revival of the decade of gore & agony that brought about the kosovo problem in the first place ?
not at all - much less a major or even minor conflict between the us & russia .
kindly simply turn off bush 's microphone ... & stop throwing petrol on a fire that is rapidly swelling out of control ...
maria amadei ashot , berkeley , california i 'm not sure i particularly believe / trust russia or the us , but i do envy russia 's ability and willingness to stand up to bush and say ' no ' .
nik , milton keynes why does america antagonize russia while pretending that unapologetically totalitarian regimes in p. r. of china and saudi arabia are ' friends ' ?
mike bbc news website reader , ancaster , ontario , canada the true question is why america is taking this course of action against russia at this time ?
its military is overstretched , its global popularity is at an all-time-low , and russia is one of the few world powers that is content to not challenge america if it is left alone .
why does america antagonize russia while pretending that unapologetically totalitarian regimes in p. r. of china and saudi arabia are ' friends ' ?
mike , ancaster , ontario , canada the fact of the matter is , the american have provided security to the world , can you imagine without american security ?
god bless america ...
alex , london great analysis !
when the ussr put nuclear missiles in cuba it did n't change anything strategically either , both the us and the su were capable of mutual destruction .
a few extra missiles fired from cuba would not have changed that .
yet , the americans made a huge fuss about it !
that 's exactly the situation here , anything that diminishes or degrades russia 's nuclear capability is clearly an act of aggression .
vladislav , moscow what a shame that no eu country leader has guts to accept that mr putin is right .
alan , amazing timing : did bush and putin agree in advance of the g8 meeting to have this missile issue overshadow ... global warming , so that they could avoid having to discuss it ?
colin mckenzie bbc news website reader , manchester , uk amazing timing : did bush and putin agree in advance of the g8 meeting to have this missile issue overshadow the very real threat to this planet , global warming , so that they could avoid having to discuss it ?
and by the way has bush ever stopped to think that rising sea levels caused by global warming triggered by us in-action could be just as devastating to coastal areas of nuclear armed india and pakistan as a direct attack on them and that at some point in many years time they may point their weapons at the us to save their own land ?
colin mckenzie , manchester , uk the article that is presented here has some validity in some respect about the protection of eastern european countries because neither the russian nor the western eurpean countries would come forward to protect them other than united states of america .
the eastern europeans feel much secure if the americans are there to save them and by virtue if and when their security interests are jeopardized by either western europe or the russians .
in this context , it is fair to point out that out of this tension about the missile defense system initiated by the u.s may have some validity to the protection of europe overall as we all know that western europe will not make such a defense plan that would serve up as a common goal for all europeans .
it is not only going to bankrupt them but also will not have a cohessive defense policy to safeguard european interest .
yes , putin may have a reason to be upset about but he may take it easy not worrying to much about russian security interest because he has asserted himself aligning with the the americans and the europeans in a common security interest of the global world that we live in .
he must realize that the old geopolitical game that had been fought early in the 20th century is not going to work and for that reason he must work jointly with the u.s to irradicate poverty , terrorism from the face of this earth .
azim , harrisburg , pa , united states yes we did drop the bomb ... and the entire planet was not destroyed .
as a matter of fact , the enemy did not care enough about therr own people so we had to drop a second one before they surrendered .
it 's tough being the only remaining super power .
it would be a lot tougher on the rest of you , if we were n't .
chuck d , us mil - deployed i think the bases could just be a wedge issue to put pressure on russia to deal with iran .
it 's the russians who are building the reactor for tehran .
i would n't be suprised if the state department says " russia , if you can help us make sure iran does n't get the bomb we wo n't humiliate you by putting these bases in your former sphere of influence . "
the same goes for the british and the russian spy case .
it might all be a way to put pressure on moscow .
tj , south dakota usa it 's obvious that the west is on the path of confrontation with anything it regards as ' incompatible ' with western interests and was encouraged , so to speak , by the unbalance in the unsc after the ussr and allies ceased to exist .
it was offered a finger and decided to go for the whole hand .
the russian government finds that the circling of its territory by us / nato -lrb- and belittling of slavs ? -rrb- has gone far enough - rightfully imo - and is determined to restore the balance .
we should get used to the idea that there ca n't be a yin without yang .
jj van kempen , den haag , netherlands why is everyone so quick to call the united states a bully ?
modern russia under putin is just the ussr by another name .
it is deeply unsettling .
have we forgotten their barbarousness in afghanistan and inside the iron curtain ?
putin is ... a despotic autocrat - just how accountable is he ?
is russia trustworthy ?
no.they use their new-found economic clout to strangle former cis countries .
is russia stable ?
no .
what happens when oil prices drop etc ?
why should we continue fearing a vast poverty stricken country with a declining population.why ca n't the us protect the west from nuclear attacks ?
russia only need to fear this if they plan on bombing the west otherwise they should relax .
why should we respond every time a decaying ex-superpower wants to flex its muscles ?
maybe the nuclear defence system might finally highlight the absurdity of nuclear missiles .
if not- at least we 're safe .
dexter galvin , dublin , ireland no-one needs to be a lap dog , and surely no-one will laugh if us does put the missiles shield .
takes one or the other radical view point to tip the balance , does n't it ?
actually , it might not happen -lrb- it 's expensive and military spend only helps sending us into a solid budget deficit -rrb- - some of the us objectives are already achieved 100 % anyway - divide and conquer that is .
it 's amazing how oblivious people remain : may i ask a simple question - to whose benefit the current situation is ? who exactly is provoking , dividing and conquering ; preventing us to benefit ?
has eu not learnt any lessons from history ? we have a great leverage of strong western economies and a willing growing strong market next door !
as well as an excellent collar for provision of peace .
let 's be honest - it 's a gold mine for the city ..
why in the world are we not pursuing it and entertaining someone else 's tactics and interests -lrb- who 's interests , by the way , do not include our wellbeing - wake up -rrb- ? ? , london mr lukyanov is absolutely right .
russia has every right to be aggressive in this case .
it is a cause of worry for india also and any other country with nuclear weapons if a global missile defence system comes into place .
it would give the us complete immunity in case of a war .
america is systematically trying to conquer the world .
they seem to be afraid of the fact that china , russia and india are growing stronger and want to stop this .
europe on the other hand should realise they are not going to benefit from this missile shield .
when it comes to a war , america would not care one bit what happens to europe .
europe should not alienate russia keeping old cold war memories in mind .
they have to realise the present situation with america having it selfish and dangerous objectives .
anand , bangalore i can see a few fair points in general however when talk about russia 's interest in economic growth and want to be in the club i think they should be prepare to play by the rules of the club .
can any of the developed nations see russia contributing anything to that extent other than playing cheap games with immaturity and aggressive outburst from kremlin instad of intelligent political and tactical manoeuvres to promote their genuine desire and comitment.what actualy went wrong to glasnost & perestroika one should wonder .
m thomas , london , uk europe needs what the us has to offer ! !
its not only rogue states like iran and north korea which we need to contend with , but russia as well .
the most feared would be russia , because when the chips are down , its the rogue states and russia who will join hands against the us and europe .
and believe me , its heading that way soon , unfortunately though !
juliana smith , croydon the various comments are quite enlightening .
but whatever the real reasons for this new chill in global nuclear politics , the most worrying thing may be the growing inability of u.s policy-makers to distinguish their own propaganda from real threats , and to systematically dismiss the protests of those who disagree like mr putin .
it would be excessive to claim that the world no longer cares for any thing that washington says , but people - powerless as they may be - are not idiots , and it is equally doubtful if a nation 's strategic interests can be durably ensured through browbeating and force .
the other serious reason for concern is the complacency of major nuclear stakeholders like china .
their fence sitting tactics , far from weakening the u.s or gaining them any strategic edge , has instead helped to reinforce the position of the u.s , thus enabling this latter to move its mile stones into central asia since the collapse of the ussr and its satelite states .
dominic lulu , c.d spain russia is right .
anyone who takes a detailed look at what the experts are saying and have been saying for the last decade or so -lrb- and not since last week -rrb- will know that the us , being in a unique position as the most militarily powerful nation on earth , will want to consolidate it 's position and keep ahead of the other rising powers while it can before the other world powers can catch up .
one of the ways the us will stay ahead of the others is by having a nuclear first strike option , where by the us military can destroy a rival nuclear power in a first strike without having to fear a devastating nuclear retaliatory response since what nuclear weapons the opposing military may launch -lrb- those that survived the first strike -rrb- will be intercepted by the global us abm system .
of course to set up such a system will take a few more decades -lrb- more or less -rrb- but for the us military , it will be worth it .
what we are seeing in poland and the czech republic is the first steps for such a system .
such systems will be able to track and intercept the older russian missiles that are in it 's radar coverage even if russia shoots them towards the north pole .
the us knows only they have the financial resources and technical know how to build a global abm network at this moment in time .
they are going ahead with it .
the us will not be able to impose itself on others using purely conventional means , but with wmds it can .
bablu rahman , haywards heath , u.k we polish do not want missiles on our soil , do not want to be a target but we know , we can not rely on europe which is depending on russia 's energy supplies more and more .
russia 's never been reliable partner !
you witness it on daily basis .
russia -lrb- soviet u -rrb- had destroyed our country for 50 years , plus between 1939 - 41 of wwii killed more poles then germans did .
i know us shields ai n't the best solution but at least something .
do n't get me wrong , i think that the usa is the bigest danger for peace on our globe but that 's why we need to stick with them .
this is business .
rob , krakow , poland reagan offered to make the original " star wars " systems available to other nations - " we 're not gonna give it away , they 're gonna have to pay for it ... "
if the us makes the current systems available to russia , surely that rebalances the equation ?
it could be useful for all concerned to have interceptors closer to the likely origins of hostile missile launches .
d wilson , london , uk yeah , i also agree with the article. lets agree on that us is the sole power and is trying very hard to protect its interests while undermining the others . be it the attacks on the middle east or the simplest thing like not accepting the co2 emission curbs set prior to the g8 meet .
it is doing the same thing in india by that nuclear agreement which will retard the nuclear capabilities of india while 2 nuclear countries namely china and pakistan sit next to it and mind you both are hostile to india .
devendra , new delhi , india its all about putin ...
just as russia was about to emerge from 1000 years of darkness , into the light of democratic freedom - putin and his kgb gang has plunged his people back into the abyss ...
the eu must go directly to the russian people and offer them a different vision of their future ¿ a future of a strong democratic russia - economically and politically .
the eu must explain to the russian people that because of the expansion of nato and the eu for the first time in a thousand years - russia is free from invasion from the west .
russian mothers no longer have to bury their sons by the millions due to invasion or leave their dead bodies on european battlefields due to their government alliances with western countries .
the expansion of the eu through the enlargement process and the creation of a special free trade zone including a privileged partnership with russia is the only way to guarantee freedom and democracy for russia and central asia and oil / gas supply security for europe .
larry houle , spring texas i think russia are right to object in this instance and can understand why putin has reacted in the way he has done .
i was infuriated when i heard of how the usa wanted to plant various defence systems across europe as though the continent belongs to them ...
it 's about time someone stood up to them and said ' no , this is unacceptable ' .
sarah , hereford , uk and what if russia , or venezuela , or some other party not in the freedom club , did a deal so they could place military bases in either canada or mexico -lrb- or cuba -rrb- to protect some intangible interests against unidentified parties ?
would the us stand idly by ?
also , given current us record with truth and integrity and -lrb- almost -rrb- unilateral interventionism , why should n't russia hyperventilate ? paolo , powell , usa in my opinion , we should fear not only russia , but also the us .
if russia 's and china 's nuclear capabilities are undermined , or even useless , then the us would be the only nuclear superpower capable of sending one of those missiles -lrb- of which they 've got thousands , by the way -rrb- to europe .
this situation is a double edged sword .
we , europe , should arm ourselves against both .
markus pihlström , helsingfors , finland i thought your article was another in a long list of ' pundits ' making their living by chewing up today 's news and regurgitating it to market to the masses .
until the ending statement about -lrb- russia -rrb- being " a young ... " .
it reminds me of us history in the 1800s , when today 's powerful families and organizations were first starting up , ie . ' the robber barons ' of the old west -lrb- trains and newspapers -rrb- .
i think i understand russia a bit better now - thanks .
bill , cedar rapids , iowa , usa under the current administration the moral compass of america has changed dramatically .
in a world of rapid technological advances and changes in warfare the us is pursuing an approach easily circumvented .
the us appears to becoming more out of step with the world at a time when friends and allies are most important .
combine this with the us habit of pursuing its interests at the expense of all others and we have a worrying scenario. bill wallace , perth , australia i think mr. lukyanov fails to mention the primary reason for the us missile defenses in europe : the inevitable attack by iran and north korea against poland .
as bush said , these defenses have nothing to do with russia .
russia really has no missiles to speak of .
and , even if it did , everyone in poland loves the russians .
it 's the north koreans that the polish are really concerned with .
hordes of starving north korean soldiers .
thus , every major kielbasa -lsb- polish sausage -rsb- factory must be protected .
veniamin nikolayev , philadelphia , usa take a look at the geography - if russia were to fire missiles at the usa , they would go over the north pole , not poland or the czech republic .
i would suggest , therefore , that they are next to useless as a defence against russian missiles .
now if they base any in northern canada that would be a different matter altogether .
mike , salisbury uk europe is pathetically spineless , divided and weak and the us and russia untrustworthy and childish .
with the enlargement of the eu , any possibility of a common foreign and defense policy is lost which is why it is necessary to retain the british nuclear deterrent , however russia itself poses little threat as long as we maintain independent energy supplies -lrb- i.e. nuclear -rrb- as at the moment the russian state does not have the money to throw at a huge increase in its military capability .
european incompetence on foreign policy is just staggering . , why do we always dodge the real issue - oil ?
the ongoing iraq war is about installing a u.s. friendly regime to secure oil for america 's future energy requirements .
the war in afghanistan is due to the taliban not allowing a gas-pipe to run through it from kazakhstan to the pakistan coast .
and now that iran has started negotiating oil sales to china , instead of america , the u.s. seems to be moving its pieces around the global chess-board in readiness to secure yet more oil , by force -lrb- again -rrb- if need be .
no wonder putin 's worried .
russia , with its own not inconsiderable oil and gas reserves , could be the next battleground - sandwiched between china one side , and america 's ams on the other .
robert hossack , st austell , uk all i see is american neo-cons forcing their world view agenda & russian fascists pushing theirs .
all it does is highlight europe 's weakness , even if you 're generous it 's obvious that economic " soft power " can only get you so far .
europe has common interests with both america and russia but without europe-wide co-ordinated miltary procurement , strategy and forces then europe will always be stepped on by one or the other or both .
until europe has the military muscle to push it 's viewpoint and command some respect then we 'll always be sidelined and at risk .
chas , manchester , uk we must do everything in our power not to become dependent on russian gas and oil .
back track on deals already done or in negotiations .
the americans are playing some long term strategy for their own benefit .
just keep out of it .
ray sparrow , woodley england i 'm an american engineer who earned my living designing missile defense systems for many years , and i agree with russia .
this is the start of a world-wide system of surveillance radars and interceptor missiles .
it is part of the neocon 's agenda to establish a lasting american hegemony .
countries who do not wish to live under such a new world order should oppose it now .
george works , st. eustatius , netherlands antilles in ascribing to the latest ' defensive ' missile plan a diabolically devious long-term plan to ensure us hegemony well into the 21st century is probably to credit us foreign policy planners with far more intelligence and foresight than history suggests they actually possess .
the problem for us all , including mr putin , is not that the us is too clever , too sophisticated in its understanding of the world and us global interests : the problem surely is the dangerously unsophisticated world view which permeates all levels of american society , including the higher echelons of the us administration .
shouting at mr bush et al from behind the barricades is counter-productive in-so-far as it only serves to further reinforce their simplistic perception of foreign affairs .
in school , in life and in the conduct of foreign policy understanding is more usually achieved through reasoned explanation , rather than polemics or confrontation .
mark , bristol do not think that everyone in america -lrb- usa -rrb- supports this " shield " for europe .
most of us in the us do not want this war in iraq , we do not want nato , we do not want our troops in europe , we do not support " free trade " or " globilization " .
do n't just judge us by cnn or " w " .
he does not speak for most of us .
give america some credit .
at least we try to pretend to care about others , we raise money for relief efforts , some of us are trying to be good world citizens ... so do n't give up on america .
please .
marc daniel , charleston , south carolina , usa excellent summary from fyodor lukyanov ...
what i wonder is whether mr lukyanov would agree that , from the usa 's point of view , the ams could be perceived as a mechanism for diverting global attention away from us failures / war crimes -lrb- depending on your point of view -rrb- in the middle east .
this dispute flared up a couple of months ago , when the 4-year anniversary of the iraq invasion had just been clocked , the democrat-led congress was fighting for withdrawal -lrb- which it seems to have given up , sadly -rrb- , and us military strategy was under intense scrutiny and criticism .
suddenly the front page focus is all on russia , and the eu and usa seem to have succesfully sidelined the issues of the middle east and other problem areas .
the middle east is no less volatile than before , with palestine , lebanon and turkey / kurdistan witnessing either mass violence or heightened tensions , guantanamo is in a legal shambles , israel 's brutal military occupation of palestine is reaching its landmark 40th anniversary , yet the top international stories have consistently been putin 's rhetoric on the west and the ams , the russia-estonia clashes , and so on .
president putin insists that the ams is an affront because there is no threat to the us from either iran or north korea - apparently iran have no icbms and will not do so for 5-8 years , and as for north korea - if they were to attack the usa , even in theory , surely they would go over the pacific , which is much shorter in distance ?
there are plenty of indicators that the threat countered by the ams is a fabrication , and recent history has shown that the us -lrb- and uk -rrb- governments under the present administrations are prepared to lie to the public to get what they want .
it is one thing to say that putin is electioneering , which is a perfectly reasonable theory , but given that both the current us and uk governments may well be on their way out within the next two years , this could be perceived as a last stand to ensure that their neo-conservative , ' new american century ' ways remain embedded in the global political framework .
-lrb- they really have nothing to fear , for , as zbigniew brzezinski shows in his latest book , the democrats ' way of thinking in foreign policy does n't differ hugely in its imperialist overtones -rrb- .
as for the czechs and poles and the east-west europe divide , it is the usa , still the global superpower despite upsurges from india , china , russia and others , which has the most to gain from exploiting these disagreements .
they continue to " divide and rule " , as they always have , all over the world .
putin 's russia is countering the usa 's power games by befriending the middle east -lrb- talk of a ' gas-opec ' or equivalent " forum " springs to mind straight away -rrb- and builiding diplomatic and economic relations with strategic countries including venezuela , kazakhstan , japan , and china .
simon lewis , london , uk well ...
i try to look @ it from both sides .
the whole plan is useless .
if someone wants to fire a nuke , they will .
if they do then ?
guess we are done as humans .
every single one of us know the consequences .
oh , wait a minute !
someone did drop the bomb , right ?
anyway ...
i hope peace will prevail as usual .
its only going to take all the righteous to bond together and defeat whatever evil that is out there !
jzen , sf , california russia only has to worry about the us anti-missile defence if she plans on firing her nuclear missiles .
does russia really anticipate doing this ?
if so then we need the protection of the shield and if not then russia can laugh as bush wasting billions .
peter , nottingham the idea of an unopposed and un-opposable us superpower , a power that need not fear anyone else and is able to obtain the ' full spectrum dominance ' it craves , is deeply scary .
the quiet birth of the kind of global dominance set out in the project for a new american century , must be noticed .
or else we may see a kind of global apartheid , where the us gets whatever it wants whenever it wants and howsoever it desires and the only way for any other nation to have its interests even nearly served is to be play lap dog .
just as the us thought it was its manifest destiny to control the continent of north america , at the expense of the natives , it now seems to think it is its manifest destiny to control the globe , at the expense of every other person on the planet .
at least the cold war brought balance .
james waldorf-nicol , kent , uk mr lukyanov said : " if the idea of a global anti-missile system becomes a reality , the nuclear capability of russia , china and other countries will be undermined . "
and why exactly is this a bad thing ?
surely we , in europe , would be safer if russia and china were unable to use their nuclear weapons against us ?
i find it very hard to sympathise with the russian viewpoint when their president is threatening to point nukes at us ... -lsb- no name supplied -rsb- " russia only has to worry about the us anti-missile defence if she plans on firing her nuclear missiles .
does russia really anticipate doing this ?
if so then we need the protection of the shield and if not then russia can laugh as bush wasting billions . "
you miss the point entirely .
a system like this can be used aggressively .
the us can launch a strike against another nation in full knowledge that that nation can not strike back .
it is the death of the concept of mutually assured destruction which is what prevented the cold war escalating .
the us can use the leverage of its ability to launch unanswered nuclear and conventional strikes to achieve whatever it demands .
james waldorf-nicol , kent , uk putin is totally right to be concerned .
the us hypocrisy on this is frightening .
why should russia 's reaction to us plans be described as aggressive and unhelpful when it is us plans for domination that give rise to this level of anxiety the globe over .
some are describing this as ' cold peace ' - i do n't think the us ever ended the cold war ... and are now threating a nuclear strike on iran to stop it developing a defence against us armed israel !
as a us general said long ago - " we fought ww1 in europe , we fought ww2 in europe and if you fools let us we 'll fight ww3 there too " . grahame , sheffield i 've thought from the start that this all seems like the us causing trouble , and reading more into the background just strengthens my views .
bush is n't trying to protect " the homeland " , he is sending out a message that the us is in charge , and in charge of a lot .
i 'm sorry , but it 's not russia that needs to be put in it 's place , it 's the united states .
miles hayler , warwickshire , uk wake up people , the us that people looked towards for inspiration is no longer there - it has n't been since bush came to power in the questionable elections of 2000 .
although russia is n't a better option , we need a bi-polar world in order to be free and safe - each side will think very carefully before launching wars to impose their wills on the peoples of the world .
nawaz the us under the bush administration invaded iraq under false pretences so why should the russian government trust them on anti-missile systems .
president putin is right to resist this plan and it says little for the east europeans who are allowing anti-missile systems on their territory .
kenneth clark , hemel hempstead uk putin is exactly right to be concerned as should we .
whats going on with the world ?
is the eu that useless ?
why ca n't we put our own missile defence system in ?
by relying on the americans we are removing any control in world affairs we thought we had .
its pathetic how weak europe is as a power .
so weak we do n't mind being used by america as a dumping ground for shot down nuclear missiles .
tony blair 's support for bush in this makes him more than a laptop dog , it makes him a traitor .

viewpoint : russia 's missile fears i am very glad to read these words by prominent russian analyst .
he gets right to the point and gives all pros and cons of the current freeze in the us-russia relationship .
as for me , united states use eastern europe , especially those states that suffered a lot from russian empire -lrb- poland and ukraine -rrb- as a small change .
those countries feel insulted and annoyed by long lasting russian dominance , and that is why their leading politicians exploit any trifle to pinch a bear -lrb- russia -rrb- .
from 1990s up until 2004-2005 the bear was in hibernation .
now it is awakened and strives to establish status quo .
i hope the bear would have enough wisdom not to race with an eagle -lrb- us -rrb- and they would leave in peace .
otherwise , catastrophe might happen , eventually , because bears can not fly ? .
ilshat , manchester , usa even though they talk a lot about n korea and iran , but in fact , us control them quite well and they have got a lot cheaper solutions to protect anyone from the " danger " .
the ams is not related to them at all , and done for completely different purposes .
it 's geopolitics , and anyone related to it would not even mention " axis of evil " countries seriously ...
it is obvious that russia , and some other countries would be left with no choice , but develop new systems to overcome the ams .
not that they do n't do already , but as imbalance increases they would have to speed up the process .
you can say honestly -lrb- as putin did -rrb- or not talk about it openly , but there is no doubt that ams bases , radars , missiles bases , etc -lrb- russian or american -rrb- are the first targets of attack in an escalating conflict .
all that would not make any country more secured .
alex , uk president putin takes a very sensible stance on the proposed us military expansion into eastern europe .
the ams becomes an integral part of the us nuclear arsenal .
do the europeans really need american nukes in their back yard ?
russia is already surrounded by a ring of american military bases in the former eastern block states and soviet republics .
she also now shares borders with several new quazi-tyrannical states that the us keeps on a short leash and sets them off to bite russia when expedient .
the ams is another affront that does not achieve any useful purpose , but makes things globally much worse .
yuri zharikov , odessa , ukraine putin is right : the us anti-missile system is an existential threat to russia 's existance .
10 missiles now will become 1000 missiles in ten years time .
and who will guarantee the us would n't tip these alleged " anti-missile missiles " with nuke warheads ?
the defunct abm-treaty recognized that , if country 1 could nuke country 2 with impunity , because it could shoot down incoming missiles of country 2 , the only logical course of action for country 2 was to pre-emptively fire its missiles at country 1 , before country 1 had brought this anti-missile system online .
in short : " use ' em , or lose ' em " ...
roel , leuven , belgium is it any surprise that the us would want to maintain its global dominance and provide every option available , especially when we know that we can not rely on other nations to solve our problems ?
those in the eu need to realize that this is n't being unwillingly imposed on your governments .
the eu should grow a spine and prove that it can independently act without the us military / economy , otherwise nothing is going to change- get real !
additionally , it really does n't help that the russians and the chinese consistently undermine the us 's position in dealing with rouge states .
what the hell are we supposed to do ?
if those " powerful " states want to play with the big boys then so be it .
certainly there are always more diplomatic options , but the truth is every nation is out for its own interest and if there is room to expand and flex muscle , someone will always fill that vacuum .
andrew , chicago , usa quote : " many of the people i have talked to in private have told me they believe the anti-missile system is a us tactic to prevent the eu from becoming an independent player in foreign policy " .
a fantastic point which is rarely articulated - us foreign policy & particularly it 's ' special relationship with britain ' always seems divisive & geared to weaken the eu , maintaining their superior position as the world 's only superpower .
coincidence ?
iain , bristol , uk -lsb- putin 's -rsb- country is skid row , and he 's worrying about u.s. missiles ? !
john kluver bbc news website reader , tucson , usa hmm , let 's see - putin has botched the ukraine -lrb- remember he called to congratulate yanukovich -rrb- , and he 's botched georgia , the baltics and poland .
he 's killed off the free press , in particular tv , in his country .
remember that no matter what he says or does he is always portrayed as a winner on tv in russia .
russia is far less free today , for example , than it was even in 1988 in the ussr ! !
and the u.s. is supposed to listen to him ? ? ?
his country is weak and poor , and old ladies beg everywhere on the streets of moscow .
his country is skid row , and he 's worrying about u.s. missiles ? !
geez , maybe solve your domestic problems first .
should n't he worry more about russia 's shrinking population ? ?
he 's a loser leader of a loser country and he should be ignored .
john kluver , tucson , usa rogue nations .
who 's to decide which nation is a ' rogue ' one ? and what ' rogue ' exactly means ?
there are un rules and russia strictly abides with them as nuclear materials are concerned .
why the us did n't stop pakistan -lrb- israel -rrb- and bomb it into quarks after it acquired nuclear weapons ?
why iran is worse ?
pakistan is surely more unstable and unpredictable .
what if japan decides to go nuclear ?
there are no easy answers , it is better to wait and see .
a country may acquire a nuclear deterrent and behave .
you can always launch a nuclear war .
how can you stop iran ?
a military action may cause worse consequences than patient politics .
pavel , rostov , russia a pox upon both your houses .
the global economic and military dominionism of the usa government and the resurgent autocratism of putin 's government are the festering poison that is so revolting for the average citizen of the world who is trying to make a world that is livable for all it 's citizens .
the impudent arrogance of both governments is reprehensible .
harold l nicol , st paul usa ... ever since britain lost superpower status at the end of 19th century it has been thriving on balancing power dynamic between europe and the us ...
what is happening today is no different .
britain and the us are trying to keep the status quo in the regional and global distribution of power .
they are trying hard to preempt any meaningful change that can undermine their strategic positions .
they want to deny the continent any chance of emerging strong as a whole .
playing on anti-russian and pro-american sentiments in young states of eastern europe is a smart preventive tactic to weaken european unity and regional security and , thus , secure the status quo for long time to come ...
the only problems is , as mr. lukyanov put it " there are big players watching on the sidelines - china , india , and iran - that can emerge as winners " if the us gets stuck keeping european continent weak .
if , however , the us and britain jointly manage to drive another long-term wedge in europe -lrb- regional " cold war " -rrb- , it will be able to afford to get busy with weakening others .
now that will be the start of the new american century .
if that happens , britain will have to get busy making the us dependent on british as the irreplacable agents meddling in european affairs and keeping europe weak .
otherwise , britain risks being reduced to a mere lapdog of the americans .
although that will happen anyway if the us project of the new american century truly gets realized .
yevgeni , moscow , russia as a citizen of the country , ukraine , which mr lukanov calls former integral part of the soviet union , i would million times say " god bless america ! " , again , just in the case of deploying anti-missile defence shield in eastern europe , because this is completely correct and up-to-date decision , despite of my criticism of other actions of the bush 's administration .
i 'm surprised how blind sometimes western europeans are in terms of russia .
something i 've conceived of mr lukanov 's article as well as russian president 's behaviour is that this country has been planning to become new soviet union -lrb- even precursory look at modern putin 's russia displays that it had become so already -rrb- .
and i want to ask all people here so worried about global warming , why mrs merkel , if she is so worried about this issue , does not openly say that russia is major energetic terrorist ?
in the beginning of 2006 , when russia blackmailed my country by gas price , i heard words of support only from poland , baltic countries and the united states .
mrs. merkel instead called only for fast compromise between ukraine and russia , clearly understanding that the price of this compromise could be only shifting control over our main gas pipelines to russian gazprom ?
oh , of course , do german enterprises , which 40 % depend on russian gas supplies , causing pollution too , care about something like ukraine ?
oksana , kyiv , ukraine this should be discussed at the un to ratify the implications of such moves , this does n't just affect russia gerry mangan bbc news website reader , basingstoke , england this defense system tips the balance of power completely , creating a super power with the single most biggest nuclear arsenal .
what would a wannabe president with the same superiority complex as bush do with this power on nations opposed or making things difficult .
this should be discussed at the un to ratify the implications of such moves , this does n't just affect russia .
gerry mangan , basingstoke , england all russia has to do is stop providing uranium to iran , stop largely siding with them on their nuclear program and forth and stronger back the calls for north korea to disarm .
if russia was n't aiding these countries through it 's lack of will for tougher sanctions or tougher action against these nations then they would n't be a nuclear risk , hence the us would also have no excuse for needing a missile shield .
russia is as much at fault in helping give the us an excuse for a missile shield in the first place helping these rogue nations ...
ian , leeds i think that ' europe ' just need someone to be afraid of , and now i read so many anti-russian reviews and almost nothing that explains russian position without fear of ' big bad russia ' . its very pity igor , moscow , russian federation i have no brief to make for mr. putin , who seems to be more of an autocrat than a democrat .
but it is absurd to compare contemporary russia to the former soviet union .
u.s. presidents abraham lincoln , franklin d. roosevelt , and harry s. truman had the wisdom to understand that you do not treat a former foe like a convicted criminal , but rather like an errant friend whose friendship might be won again .
it was needlessly provocative to extend nato right up to the russian border , and it is needlessly provocative to attempt to put elements of an anti-missile defense in countries bordering on russia .
there are anti-ballistic missile radars and interceptor missiles that can be deployed aboard ships which can be stationed off of the coasts of north korea and iran .
this is where it is most feasable to detect and intercept ballistic missiles just after they are launched anyway .
george , somewhere in texas the onus is on russia to decide whether its imperial past or a potentially prosperous future is more important tomek bbc news website reader , londonderry , nh , us ... it is not the case that europe 's russia policy is filtered through poland ; only in the last few weeks has the eu finally recognized any of poland 's concerns about russia 's behaviors .
further , if the eu did base its policies towards russia on poland , that would still be a potentially advantageous situation for moscow , as , for all the historical hostility , most poles understand that their security and prosperity ultimately depend on finding some accommodation with russia .
poland will never be fully secure without russia also feeling secure , and an economically prosperous russia would benefit poland immensely - while an impoverished and politically unstable russia will always threaten poland 's own economic and political security .
we have no choice ; we are -lrb- relative -rrb- neighbors , like it or not , and most poles understand that just as renewed relations with germany had to be rebuilt , so too will someday a rapprochement with moscow be necessary .
that , however , will take two sides to achieve , and as i said , for now the onus is on russia to decide whether its imperial past or a potentially prosperous future is more important .
tomek , londonderry , nh usa the shield is " defensive . "
so calm down all of you america haters .
in fact , after listening to how much you hate us i think we need more defense sites .
i bet you wish you had a shield too .
well , if you 're nice we 'll put you under the umbrella .
if not , you can play with the trustworthy russians , the loving north koreans , and the ever so friendly iranians .
i 'm sorry that we 're not like them enough for you to like us .
alex turner , las vegas , us the analysis is mostly excellent .
russia , however , is not " sadly encouraging " the situation : it is all the us that is being obdurate because it can not begin to imagine life on a planet where it does not , in the manner of the most spoiled of brats , get its own way .
neither are britain & france " formerly " empires : that is just pap for the primary grades .
we all know that america , britain , france , spain & germany continue to command vast empires to this day , even if there is some self-government in their cultural or economic dependencies .
russia is not " asking to get something back " - i.e. ' superpower ' or even ' great power ' status .
russia was , and remains , a mighty nuclear power not to be taken lightly .
the idea that it was ever not powerful is as silly as the suggestion would be that american was not a global power during its global depression - or after 9/11 , or even now , when it remains on its knees in iraq & incapable of extricating itself from a small botched war .
let 's set aside the propaganda slogans & the politically correct cant , and look at simple , patent realities staring us in the face .
can the us afford to go to war with russia , for example over kosovo ?
of course not .
can europeans afford a revival of the decade of gore & agony that brought about the kosovo problem in the first place ?
not at all - much less a major or even minor conflict between the us & russia .
kindly simply turn off bush 's microphone ... & stop throwing petrol on a fire that is rapidly swelling out of control ...
maria amadei ashot , berkeley , california i 'm not sure i particularly believe / trust russia or the us , but i do envy russia 's ability and willingness to stand up to bush and say ' no ' .
nik , milton keynes why does america antagonize russia while pretending that unapologetically totalitarian regimes in p. r. of china and saudi arabia are ' friends ' ?
mike bbc news website reader , ancaster , ontario , canada the true question is why america is taking this course of action against russia at this time ?
its military is overstretched , its global popularity is at an all-time-low , and russia is one of the few world powers that is content to not challenge america if it is left alone .
why does america antagonize russia while pretending that unapologetically totalitarian regimes in p. r. of china and saudi arabia are ' friends ' ?
mike , ancaster , ontario , canada the fact of the matter is , the american have provided security to the world , can you imagine without american security ?
god bless america ...
alex , london great analysis !
when the ussr put nuclear missiles in cuba it did n't change anything strategically either , both the us and the su were capable of mutual destruction .
a few extra missiles fired from cuba would not have changed that .
yet , the americans made a huge fuss about it !
that 's exactly the situation here , anything that diminishes or degrades russia 's nuclear capability is clearly an act of aggression .
vladislav , moscow what a shame that no eu country leader has guts to accept that mr putin is right .
alan , amazing timing : did bush and putin agree in advance of the g8 meeting to have this missile issue overshadow ... global warming , so that they could avoid having to discuss it ?
colin mckenzie bbc news website reader , manchester , uk amazing timing : did bush and putin agree in advance of the g8 meeting to have this missile issue overshadow the very real threat to this planet , global warming , so that they could avoid having to discuss it ?
and by the way has bush ever stopped to think that rising sea levels caused by global warming triggered by us in-action could be just as devastating to coastal areas of nuclear armed india and pakistan as a direct attack on them and that at some point in many years time they may point their weapons at the us to save their own land ?
colin mckenzie , manchester , uk the article that is presented here has some validity in some respect about the protection of eastern european countries because neither the russian nor the western eurpean countries would come forward to protect them other than united states of america .
the eastern europeans feel much secure if the americans are there to save them and by virtue if and when their security interests are jeopardized by either western europe or the russians .
in this context , it is fair to point out that out of this tension about the missile defense system initiated by the u.s may have some validity to the protection of europe overall as we all know that western europe will not make such a defense plan that would serve up as a common goal for all europeans .
it is not only going to bankrupt them but also will not have a cohessive defense policy to safeguard european interest .
yes , putin may have a reason to be upset about but he may take it easy not worrying to much about russian security interest because he has asserted himself aligning with the the americans and the europeans in a common security interest of the global world that we live in .
he must realize that the old geopolitical game that had been fought early in the 20th century is not going to work and for that reason he must work jointly with the u.s to irradicate poverty , terrorism from the face of this earth .
azim , harrisburg , pa , united states yes we did drop the bomb ... and the entire planet was not destroyed .
as a matter of fact , the enemy did not care enough about therr own people so we had to drop a second one before they surrendered .
it 's tough being the only remaining super power .
it would be a lot tougher on the rest of you , if we were n't .
chuck d , us mil - deployed i think the bases could just be a wedge issue to put pressure on russia to deal with iran .
it 's the russians who are building the reactor for tehran .
i would n't be suprised if the state department says " russia , if you can help us make sure iran does n't get the bomb we wo n't humiliate you by putting these bases in your former sphere of influence . "
the same goes for the british and the russian spy case .
it might all be a way to put pressure on moscow .
tj , south dakota usa it 's obvious that the west is on the path of confrontation with anything it regards as ' incompatible ' with western interests and was encouraged , so to speak , by the unbalance in the unsc after the ussr and allies ceased to exist .
it was offered a finger and decided to go for the whole hand .
the russian government finds that the circling of its territory by us / nato -lrb- and belittling of slavs ? -rrb- has gone far enough - rightfully imo - and is determined to restore the balance .
we should get used to the idea that there ca n't be a yin without yang .
jj van kempen , den haag , netherlands why is everyone so quick to call the united states a bully ?
modern russia under putin is just the ussr by another name .
it is deeply unsettling .
have we forgotten their barbarousness in afghanistan and inside the iron curtain ?
putin is ... a despotic autocrat - just how accountable is he ?
is russia trustworthy ?
no.they use their new-found economic clout to strangle former cis countries .
is russia stable ?
no .
what happens when oil prices drop etc ?
why should we continue fearing a vast poverty stricken country with a declining population.why ca n't the us protect the west from nuclear attacks ?
russia only need to fear this if they plan on bombing the west otherwise they should relax .
why should we respond every time a decaying ex-superpower wants to flex its muscles ?
maybe the nuclear defence system might finally highlight the absurdity of nuclear missiles .
if not- at least we 're safe .
dexter galvin , dublin , ireland no-one needs to be a lap dog , and surely no-one will laugh if us does put the missiles shield .
takes one or the other radical view point to tip the balance , does n't it ?
actually , it might not happen -lrb- it 's expensive and military spend only helps sending us into a solid budget deficit -rrb- - some of the us objectives are already achieved 100 % anyway - divide and conquer that is .
it 's amazing how oblivious people remain : may i ask a simple question - to whose benefit the current situation is ? who exactly is provoking , dividing and conquering ; preventing us to benefit ?
has eu not learnt any lessons from history ? we have a great leverage of strong western economies and a willing growing strong market next door !
as well as an excellent collar for provision of peace .
let 's be honest - it 's a gold mine for the city ..
why in the world are we not pursuing it and entertaining someone else 's tactics and interests -lrb- who 's interests , by the way , do not include our wellbeing - wake up -rrb- ? ? , london mr lukyanov is absolutely right .
russia has every right to be aggressive in this case .
it is a cause of worry for india also and any other country with nuclear weapons if a global missile defence system comes into place .
it would give the us complete immunity in case of a war .
america is systematically trying to conquer the world .
they seem to be afraid of the fact that china , russia and india are growing stronger and want to stop this .
europe on the other hand should realise they are not going to benefit from this missile shield .
when it comes to a war , america would not care one bit what happens to europe .
europe should not alienate russia keeping old cold war memories in mind .
they have to realise the present situation with america having it selfish and dangerous objectives .
anand , bangalore i can see a few fair points in general however when talk about russia 's interest in economic growth and want to be in the club i think they should be prepare to play by the rules of the club .
can any of the developed nations see russia contributing anything to that extent other than playing cheap games with immaturity and aggressive outburst from kremlin instad of intelligent political and tactical manoeuvres to promote their genuine desire and comitment.what actualy went wrong to glasnost & perestroika one should wonder .
m thomas , london , uk europe needs what the us has to offer ! !
its not only rogue states like iran and north korea which we need to contend with , but russia as well .
the most feared would be russia , because when the chips are down , its the rogue states and russia who will join hands against the us and europe .
and believe me , its heading that way soon , unfortunately though !
juliana smith , croydon the various comments are quite enlightening .
but whatever the real reasons for this new chill in global nuclear politics , the most worrying thing may be the growing inability of u.s policy-makers to distinguish their own propaganda from real threats , and to systematically dismiss the protests of those who disagree like mr putin .
it would be excessive to claim that the world no longer cares for any thing that washington says , but people - powerless as they may be - are not idiots , and it is equally doubtful if a nation 's strategic interests can be durably ensured through browbeating and force .
the other serious reason for concern is the complacency of major nuclear stakeholders like china .
their fence sitting tactics , far from weakening the u.s or gaining them any strategic edge , has instead helped to reinforce the position of the u.s , thus enabling this latter to move its mile stones into central asia since the collapse of the ussr and its satelite states .
dominic lulu , c.d spain russia is right .
anyone who takes a detailed look at what the experts are saying and have been saying for the last decade or so -lrb- and not since last week -rrb- will know that the us , being in a unique position as the most militarily powerful nation on earth , will want to consolidate it 's position and keep ahead of the other rising powers while it can before the other world powers can catch up .
one of the ways the us will stay ahead of the others is by having a nuclear first strike option , where by the us military can destroy a rival nuclear power in a first strike without having to fear a devastating nuclear retaliatory response since what nuclear weapons the opposing military may launch -lrb- those that survived the first strike -rrb- will be intercepted by the global us abm system .
of course to set up such a system will take a few more decades -lrb- more or less -rrb- but for the us military , it will be worth it .
what we are seeing in poland and the czech republic is the first steps for such a system .
such systems will be able to track and intercept the older russian missiles that are in it 's radar coverage even if russia shoots them towards the north pole .
the us knows only they have the financial resources and technical know how to build a global abm network at this moment in time .
they are going ahead with it .
the us will not be able to impose itself on others using purely conventional means , but with wmds it can .
bablu rahman , haywards heath , u.k we polish do not want missiles on our soil , do not want to be a target but we know , we can not rely on europe which is depending on russia 's energy supplies more and more .
russia 's never been reliable partner !
you witness it on daily basis .
russia -lrb- soviet u -rrb- had destroyed our country for 50 years , plus between 1939 - 41 of wwii killed more poles then germans did .
i know us shields ai n't the best solution but at least something .
do n't get me wrong , i think that the usa is the bigest danger for peace on our globe but that 's why we need to stick with them .
this is business .
rob , krakow , poland reagan offered to make the original " star wars " systems available to other nations - " we 're not gonna give it away , they 're gonna have to pay for it ... "
if the us makes the current systems available to russia , surely that rebalances the equation ?
it could be useful for all concerned to have interceptors closer to the likely origins of hostile missile launches .
d wilson , london , uk yeah , i also agree with the article. lets agree on that us is the sole power and is trying very hard to protect its interests while undermining the others . be it the attacks on the middle east or the simplest thing like not accepting the co2 emission curbs set prior to the g8 meet .
it is doing the same thing in india by that nuclear agreement which will retard the nuclear capabilities of india while 2 nuclear countries namely china and pakistan sit next to it and mind you both are hostile to india .
devendra , new delhi , india its all about putin ...
just as russia was about to emerge from 1000 years of darkness , into the light of democratic freedom - putin and his kgb gang has plunged his people back into the abyss ...
the eu must go directly to the russian people and offer them a different vision of their future ¿ a future of a strong democratic russia - economically and politically .
the eu must explain to the russian people that because of the expansion of nato and the eu for the first time in a thousand years - russia is free from invasion from the west .
russian mothers no longer have to bury their sons by the millions due to invasion or leave their dead bodies on european battlefields due to their government alliances with western countries .
the expansion of the eu through the enlargement process and the creation of a special free trade zone including a privileged partnership with russia is the only way to guarantee freedom and democracy for russia and central asia and oil / gas supply security for europe .
larry houle , spring texas i think russia are right to object in this instance and can understand why putin has reacted in the way he has done .
i was infuriated when i heard of how the usa wanted to plant various defence systems across europe as though the continent belongs to them ...
it 's about time someone stood up to them and said ' no , this is unacceptable ' .
sarah , hereford , uk and what if russia , or venezuela , or some other party not in the freedom club , did a deal so they could place military bases in either canada or mexico -lrb- or cuba -rrb- to protect some intangible interests against unidentified parties ?
would the us stand idly by ?
also , given current us record with truth and integrity and -lrb- almost -rrb- unilateral interventionism , why should n't russia hyperventilate ? paolo , powell , usa in my opinion , we should fear not only russia , but also the us .
if russia 's and china 's nuclear capabilities are undermined , or even useless , then the us would be the only nuclear superpower capable of sending one of those missiles -lrb- of which they 've got thousands , by the way -rrb- to europe .
this situation is a double edged sword .
we , europe , should arm ourselves against both .
markus pihlström , helsingfors , finland i thought your article was another in a long list of ' pundits ' making their living by chewing up today 's news and regurgitating it to market to the masses .
until the ending statement about -lrb- russia -rrb- being " a young ... " .
it reminds me of us history in the 1800s , when today 's powerful families and organizations were first starting up , ie . ' the robber barons ' of the old west -lrb- trains and newspapers -rrb- .
i think i understand russia a bit better now - thanks .
bill , cedar rapids , iowa , usa under the current administration the moral compass of america has changed dramatically .
in a world of rapid technological advances and changes in warfare the us is pursuing an approach easily circumvented .
the us appears to becoming more out of step with the world at a time when friends and allies are most important .
combine this with the us habit of pursuing its interests at the expense of all others and we have a worrying scenario. bill wallace , perth , australia i think mr. lukyanov fails to mention the primary reason for the us missile defenses in europe : the inevitable attack by iran and north korea against poland .
as bush said , these defenses have nothing to do with russia .
russia really has no missiles to speak of .
and , even if it did , everyone in poland loves the russians .
it 's the north koreans that the polish are really concerned with .
hordes of starving north korean soldiers .
thus , every major kielbasa -lsb- polish sausage -rsb- factory must be protected .
veniamin nikolayev , philadelphia , usa take a look at the geography - if russia were to fire missiles at the usa , they would go over the north pole , not poland or the czech republic .
i would suggest , therefore , that they are next to useless as a defence against russian missiles .
now if they base any in northern canada that would be a different matter altogether .
mike , salisbury uk europe is pathetically spineless , divided and weak and the us and russia untrustworthy and childish .
with the enlargement of the eu , any possibility of a common foreign and defense policy is lost which is why it is necessary to retain the british nuclear deterrent , however russia itself poses little threat as long as we maintain independent energy supplies -lrb- i.e. nuclear -rrb- as at the moment the russian state does not have the money to throw at a huge increase in its military capability .
european incompetence on foreign policy is just staggering . , why do we always dodge the real issue - oil ?
the ongoing iraq war is about installing a u.s. friendly regime to secure oil for america 's future energy requirements .
the war in afghanistan is due to the taliban not allowing a gas-pipe to run through it from kazakhstan to the pakistan coast .
and now that iran has started negotiating oil sales to china , instead of america , the u.s. seems to be moving its pieces around the global chess-board in readiness to secure yet more oil , by force -lrb- again -rrb- if need be .
no wonder putin 's worried .
russia , with its own not inconsiderable oil and gas reserves , could be the next battleground - sandwiched between china one side , and america 's ams on the other .
robert hossack , st austell , uk all i see is american neo-cons forcing their world view agenda & russian fascists pushing theirs .
all it does is highlight europe 's weakness , even if you 're generous it 's obvious that economic " soft power " can only get you so far .
europe has common interests with both america and russia but without europe-wide co-ordinated miltary procurement , strategy and forces then europe will always be stepped on by one or the other or both .
until europe has the military muscle to push it 's viewpoint and command some respect then we 'll always be sidelined and at risk .
chas , manchester , uk we must do everything in our power not to become dependent on russian gas and oil .
back track on deals already done or in negotiations .
the americans are playing some long term strategy for their own benefit .
just keep out of it .
ray sparrow , woodley england i 'm an american engineer who earned my living designing missile defense systems for many years , and i agree with russia .
this is the start of a world-wide system of surveillance radars and interceptor missiles .
it is part of the neocon 's agenda to establish a lasting american hegemony .
countries who do not wish to live under such a new world order should oppose it now .
george works , st. eustatius , netherlands antilles in ascribing to the latest ' defensive ' missile plan a diabolically devious long-term plan to ensure us hegemony well into the 21st century is probably to credit us foreign policy planners with far more intelligence and foresight than history suggests they actually possess .
the problem for us all , including mr putin , is not that the us is too clever , too sophisticated in its understanding of the world and us global interests : the problem surely is the dangerously unsophisticated world view which permeates all levels of american society , including the higher echelons of the us administration .
shouting at mr bush et al from behind the barricades is counter-productive in-so-far as it only serves to further reinforce their simplistic perception of foreign affairs .
in school , in life and in the conduct of foreign policy understanding is more usually achieved through reasoned explanation , rather than polemics or confrontation .
mark , bristol do not think that everyone in america -lrb- usa -rrb- supports this " shield " for europe .
most of us in the us do not want this war in iraq , we do not want nato , we do not want our troops in europe , we do not support " free trade " or " globilization " .
do n't just judge us by cnn or " w " .
he does not speak for most of us .
give america some credit .
at least we try to pretend to care about others , we raise money for relief efforts , some of us are trying to be good world citizens ... so do n't give up on america .
please .
marc daniel , charleston , south carolina , usa excellent summary from fyodor lukyanov ...
what i wonder is whether mr lukyanov would agree that , from the usa 's point of view , the ams could be perceived as a mechanism for diverting global attention away from us failures / war crimes -lrb- depending on your point of view -rrb- in the middle east .
this dispute flared up a couple of months ago , when the 4-year anniversary of the iraq invasion had just been clocked , the democrat-led congress was fighting for withdrawal -lrb- which it seems to have given up , sadly -rrb- , and us military strategy was under intense scrutiny and criticism .
suddenly the front page focus is all on russia , and the eu and usa seem to have succesfully sidelined the issues of the middle east and other problem areas .
the middle east is no less volatile than before , with palestine , lebanon and turkey / kurdistan witnessing either mass violence or heightened tensions , guantanamo is in a legal shambles , israel 's brutal military occupation of palestine is reaching its landmark 40th anniversary , yet the top international stories have consistently been putin 's rhetoric on the west and the ams , the russia-estonia clashes , and so on .
president putin insists that the ams is an affront because there is no threat to the us from either iran or north korea - apparently iran have no icbms and will not do so for 5-8 years , and as for north korea - if they were to attack the usa , even in theory , surely they would go over the pacific , which is much shorter in distance ?
there are plenty of indicators that the threat countered by the ams is a fabrication , and recent history has shown that the us -lrb- and uk -rrb- governments under the present administrations are prepared to lie to the public to get what they want .
it is one thing to say that putin is electioneering , which is a perfectly reasonable theory , but given that both the current us and uk governments may well be on their way out within the next two years , this could be perceived as a last stand to ensure that their neo-conservative , ' new american century ' ways remain embedded in the global political framework .
-lrb- they really have nothing to fear , for , as zbigniew brzezinski shows in his latest book , the democrats ' way of thinking in foreign policy does n't differ hugely in its imperialist overtones -rrb- .
as for the czechs and poles and the east-west europe divide , it is the usa , still the global superpower despite upsurges from india , china , russia and others , which has the most to gain from exploiting these disagreements .
they continue to " divide and rule " , as they always have , all over the world .
putin 's russia is countering the usa 's power games by befriending the middle east -lrb- talk of a ' gas-opec ' or equivalent " forum " springs to mind straight away -rrb- and builiding diplomatic and economic relations with strategic countries including venezuela , kazakhstan , japan , and china .
simon lewis , london , uk well ...
i try to look @ it from both sides .
the whole plan is useless .
if someone wants to fire a nuke , they will .
if they do then ?
guess we are done as humans .
every single one of us know the consequences .
oh , wait a minute !
someone did drop the bomb , right ?
anyway ...
i hope peace will prevail as usual .
its only going to take all the righteous to bond together and defeat whatever evil that is out there !
jzen , sf , california russia only has to worry about the us anti-missile defence if she plans on firing her nuclear missiles .
does russia really anticipate doing this ?
if so then we need the protection of the shield and if not then russia can laugh as bush wasting billions .
peter , nottingham the idea of an unopposed and un-opposable us superpower , a power that need not fear anyone else and is able to obtain the ' full spectrum dominance ' it craves , is deeply scary .
the quiet birth of the kind of global dominance set out in the project for a new american century , must be noticed .
or else we may see a kind of global apartheid , where the us gets whatever it wants whenever it wants and howsoever it desires and the only way for any other nation to have its interests even nearly served is to be play lap dog .
just as the us thought it was its manifest destiny to control the continent of north america , at the expense of the natives , it now seems to think it is its manifest destiny to control the globe , at the expense of every other person on the planet .
at least the cold war brought balance .
james waldorf-nicol , kent , uk mr lukyanov said : " if the idea of a global anti-missile system becomes a reality , the nuclear capability of russia , china and other countries will be undermined . "
and why exactly is this a bad thing ?
surely we , in europe , would be safer if russia and china were unable to use their nuclear weapons against us ?
i find it very hard to sympathise with the russian viewpoint when their president is threatening to point nukes at us ... -lsb- no name supplied -rsb- " russia only has to worry about the us anti-missile defence if she plans on firing her nuclear missiles .
does russia really anticipate doing this ?
if so then we need the protection of the shield and if not then russia can laugh as bush wasting billions . "
you miss the point entirely .
a system like this can be used aggressively .
the us can launch a strike against another nation in full knowledge that that nation can not strike back .
it is the death of the concept of mutually assured destruction which is what prevented the cold war escalating .
the us can use the leverage of its ability to launch unanswered nuclear and conventional strikes to achieve whatever it demands .
james waldorf-nicol , kent , uk putin is totally right to be concerned .
the us hypocrisy on this is frightening .
why should russia 's reaction to us plans be described as aggressive and unhelpful when it is us plans for domination that give rise to this level of anxiety the globe over .
some are describing this as ' cold peace ' - i do n't think the us ever ended the cold war ... and are now threating a nuclear strike on iran to stop it developing a defence against us armed israel !
as a us general said long ago - " we fought ww1 in europe , we fought ww2 in europe and if you fools let us we 'll fight ww3 there too " . grahame , sheffield i 've thought from the start that this all seems like the us causing trouble , and reading more into the background just strengthens my views .
bush is n't trying to protect " the homeland " , he is sending out a message that the us is in charge , and in charge of a lot .
i 'm sorry , but it 's not russia that needs to be put in it 's place , it 's the united states .
miles hayler , warwickshire , uk wake up people , the us that people looked towards for inspiration is no longer there - it has n't been since bush came to power in the questionable elections of 2000 .
although russia is n't a better option , we need a bi-polar world in order to be free and safe - each side will think very carefully before launching wars to impose their wills on the peoples of the world .
nawaz the us under the bush administration invaded iraq under false pretences so why should the russian government trust them on anti-missile systems .
president putin is right to resist this plan and it says little for the east europeans who are allowing anti-missile systems on their territory .
kenneth clark , hemel hempstead uk putin is exactly right to be concerned as should we .
whats going on with the world ?
is the eu that useless ?
why ca n't we put our own missile defence system in ?
by relying on the americans we are removing any control in world affairs we thought we had .
its pathetic how weak europe is as a power .
so weak we do n't mind being used by america as a dumping ground for shot down nuclear missiles .
tony blair 's support for bush in this makes him more than a laptop dog , it makes him a traitor .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- ask emin : your questions answered home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment arts & culture also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : friday , 8 june 2007 , 08:17 gmt 09:17 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version ask emin : your questions answered emin is only the second female solo artist to represent britain artist tracey emin is representing britain at the prestigious venice biennale art show , which opens on sunday .
the controversial artist , perhaps best known for my bed - a stained , unmade bed - and naked self-portraits , has produced a show of new work for the british pavilion .
and , for the first time , she 's showing a series of drawings she made about being sexually abused when she was nine - as well as 27 watercolours about her abortion in 1990 .
as emin prepared to set off for venice , she answered some of your questions about her career , ideas on art and what she had planned for the venice audience .
did you always know that you were going to be an artist ?
was is something you dreamt of becoming as a child ?
sandra fraser , leeds uk no , it was in 1997 at the opening of my south london gallery show , i need art like i need god , that it really hit home that i was going to be an artist .
what is your favourite topic of conversation and how is this reflected in the work you are bringing to venice ?
paul , london love and relationships are my favourite topic of conversation at the moment .
i think a lot of this will be seen in venice .
traditional artists used paint on canvas so my question is this , why do you feel that writing conquests inside a tent or not making your bed are improvements on this and how does that make art more accessible to the public ?
jimmy , gb i think that 's a really silly question .
they are both seminal pieces of art and have earned their little place in the map of art history .
it 's my understanding of painting and drawing and traditional forms of art that gives me the confidence to express myself in other mediums .
why is the art world so obsessed with the artist and not the art they make ?
knowing that a particular work is by a " noted " artist rather than a " lesser " one can hike up its value massively , but the actual work has n't changed in the slightest .
ollie glidewell that 's not true .
picasso is picasso .
damien hirst is damien hirst .
frida kahlo is frida kahlo .
they created their own language in the world of art and that is what gives their work more value .
it may be impossible to define " art " but how would you define " good art " ?
jenny southan , hastings , england for me , good art is something that has integrity .
so it 's not necessarily the thing that is the most polished and well executed .
that 's what i adhere to .
if you had not become an artist , what do you think you would have done as a job instead ?
katy womersley , southampton , hampshire i seriously think i might have died .
i think art has given me lots of strength and given me a purpose .
on a more humble note , i think i would have gone into retail shop work , as the only education i 've had is art and i have always liked clothes and fashion .
my hobby would have been writing - which it still is .
what do you think was the defining moment in your life that made you want to pursue a career in art ?
-lrb- ps - your oystercard wallet is ace -rrb- .
sharon irvine , london , uk those feelings come and go .
the day i heard i got into the royal college of art was a great moment of ambition .
but two years later , through a personal turn of events , i felt i never wanted to make art again .
it 's like a love affair - it blows hot and cold .
as only the second female solo artist at the venice biennale , do you think there is a lack of international recognition for british female artists today ?
abigail shapiro , durham , county durham no , on the contrary , it is fantastic being a female artist today .
a damn site better than it was 50 years ago .
do you aim to be controversial with your work ?
jo armstrong , warrington , cheshire no , i 've never aimed to be controversial and if anything the controversiality gets in the way .
do you think it 's necessary for someone wishing to exhibit and " make " art to have an academic qualification and to have experienced life at an accredited art college or do you think art is " open to all " ?
rosie , glasgow i think that you should go to art college if you can because it 's a fantastic experience .
and if you ca n't get into art school for whatever reason , you should try and go to evening classes - life drawing , photography - there are all sorts of classes and it 's really good to get some experience from others .
art school was the best thing that ever happened to me .
although you state that neither you nor your work is feminist , can you see why people might label it as such ?
satdeep grewal , london , england i have n't said that my work is n't feminist .
i believe my work to be extremely feminine and i am a strong woman who makes the work .
i think people often think that 's feminist .
does it bother you when people do n't " get " your art ?
do you think you are broadening what is considered art ?
speaking for myself , i love your work .
you 've invested so much of your self , conscious and unconsciously .
that 's why it is so good .
es holmans it bothers me when they are nasty to me .
often people attack me personally because my work is very personal .
and sometimes that really hurts , like for example when people take the piss out of my accent .
i would like to be tougher about it but i 'm not .
do you believe that modern conceptual art has a worth in society compared to say architecture or the work of the old masters of fine art ?
do you think your work is worth saving for posterity ?
martyn brown , warrington , cheshire no one can say they think something is worth saving .
it 's just if it is saved .
i think conceptual art has a really good place in art history .
it runs parallel in terms of invention with , say , renaissance art .
it shows us a totally different way of seeing things .
as you were going through education pre university , did your teachers support and predict your success ?
alice jones , durban , south africa i did a cse in art and i got a grade 3 .
a cse is a certificate of secondary education .
at school my drama teacher and my art teacher were extremely encouraging .
but at that time in the 70s you could only do o-levels if you went to grammar school and i lost all interest in going to school when i was 13 .
but i 'm very happy to say the school i went to , king ethelbert 's in kent , is now a special school for the arts .
your book stangeland was published in turkey this week .
what is the importance of this book for you ?
how does it correlate with your artistic career ?
cem erciyes , istanbul , turkey that book was compiled from writings of mine , some of which are 25 years old .
i really love my book .
for me , instead of having a really big exhibition , i wrote that book .
my turkish is really terrible so i will never be able to read the turkish translation myself , but i hope it 's good .
what is the secret of success in the art world today ?
do you need to do a lot of schmoozing in the right circles , or to be lucky enough to have a patron ?
most artists seem to have come from a well-to-do background , which ensures them success but you seem to be different .
dave willis , sandy , uk that 's quite an interesting question because 20 years ago i would have agreed with you .
but now successful people from the art world come from very mixed and varied backgrounds .
it 's no longer a debutante 's day out .
and the old-fashioned answer is : a lot of hard work , a bit of luck and a lot of perseverance .
it was 10 years before i made any money .
you have to have a phenomenal amount of faith to keep going .
what do you think of gilbert & george 's art work ?
collette , croydon i recently watched the world according to gilbert & george .
i was totally taken aback at how poetic and romantic it was .
often when we think about gilbert & george 's work we just think about hard lines , strong graphics and bright colours .
but behind that there is a nostalgia and touching sentimentality that i like very much .
what plans do you have to down-grade your association with the yba -lrb- young british artist -rrb- label ?
i assume you want to be remembered for who you are as an artist instead of who you are associated with .
brian sherwin , usa the ybas was a term that was invented by the media because in the 90s there was a phenomenon - there were a lot of young british artists who seemed to be riding the crest of a wave .
a lot of us still are , except we are not young anymore .
personally i never want to disassociate myself from my friends .
my influences have always been expressionism and 19th-century art .
at the time when the frieze show was on i was in turkey painting watercolours .
it was years later before i became friends with that group of people , the ybas .
are you going to produce any more christmas cards ?
i really loved your christmas robin from a couple of years ago .
good luck in the future .
sarah heron , glasgow , uk no , i 'm not going to , but if it still proves popular the tate will keep printing it .
i will be doing a christmas card next year of my local church , christchurch spitalfields , to raise money for further renovations .

the controversial artist , perhaps best known for my bed - a stained , unmade bed - and naked self-portraits , has produced a show of new work for the british pavilion .
and , for the first time , she 's showing a series of drawings she made about being sexually abused when she was nine - as well as 27 watercolours about her abortion in 1990 .
as emin prepared to set off for venice , she answered some of your questions about her career , ideas on art and what she had planned for the venice audience .
did you always know that you were going to be an artist ?
was is something you dreamt of becoming as a child ?
sandra fraser , leeds uk no , it was in 1997 at the opening of my south london gallery show , i need art like i need god , that it really hit home that i was going to be an artist .
what is your favourite topic of conversation and how is this reflected in the work you are bringing to venice ?
paul , london love and relationships are my favourite topic of conversation at the moment .
i think a lot of this will be seen in venice .
traditional artists used paint on canvas so my question is this , why do you feel that writing conquests inside a tent or not making your bed are improvements on this and how does that make art more accessible to the public ?
jimmy , gb i think that 's a really silly question .
they are both seminal pieces of art and have earned their little place in the map of art history .
it 's my understanding of painting and drawing and traditional forms of art that gives me the confidence to express myself in other mediums .
why is the art world so obsessed with the artist and not the art they make ?
knowing that a particular work is by a " noted " artist rather than a " lesser " one can hike up its value massively , but the actual work has n't changed in the slightest .
ollie glidewell that 's not true .
picasso is picasso .
damien hirst is damien hirst .
frida kahlo is frida kahlo .
they created their own language in the world of art and that is what gives their work more value .
it may be impossible to define " art " but how would you define " good art " ?
jenny southan , hastings , england for me , good art is something that has integrity .
so it 's not necessarily the thing that is the most polished and well executed .
that 's what i adhere to .
if you had not become an artist , what do you think you would have done as a job instead ?
katy womersley , southampton , hampshire i seriously think i might have died .
i think art has given me lots of strength and given me a purpose .
on a more humble note , i think i would have gone into retail shop work , as the only education i 've had is art and i have always liked clothes and fashion .
my hobby would have been writing - which it still is .
what do you think was the defining moment in your life that made you want to pursue a career in art ?
-lrb- ps - your oystercard wallet is ace -rrb- .
sharon irvine , london , uk those feelings come and go .
the day i heard i got into the royal college of art was a great moment of ambition .
but two years later , through a personal turn of events , i felt i never wanted to make art again .
it 's like a love affair - it blows hot and cold .
as only the second female solo artist at the venice biennale , do you think there is a lack of international recognition for british female artists today ?
abigail shapiro , durham , county durham no , on the contrary , it is fantastic being a female artist today .
a damn site better than it was 50 years ago .
do you aim to be controversial with your work ?
jo armstrong , warrington , cheshire no , i 've never aimed to be controversial and if anything the controversiality gets in the way .
do you think it 's necessary for someone wishing to exhibit and " make " art to have an academic qualification and to have experienced life at an accredited art college or do you think art is " open to all " ?
rosie , glasgow i think that you should go to art college if you can because it 's a fantastic experience .
and if you ca n't get into art school for whatever reason , you should try and go to evening classes - life drawing , photography - there are all sorts of classes and it 's really good to get some experience from others .
art school was the best thing that ever happened to me .
although you state that neither you nor your work is feminist , can you see why people might label it as such ?
satdeep grewal , london , england i have n't said that my work is n't feminist .
i believe my work to be extremely feminine and i am a strong woman who makes the work .
i think people often think that 's feminist .
does it bother you when people do n't " get " your art ?
do you think you are broadening what is considered art ?
speaking for myself , i love your work .
you 've invested so much of your self , conscious and unconsciously .
that 's why it is so good .
es holmans it bothers me when they are nasty to me .
often people attack me personally because my work is very personal .
and sometimes that really hurts , like for example when people take the piss out of my accent .
i would like to be tougher about it but i 'm not .
do you believe that modern conceptual art has a worth in society compared to say architecture or the work of the old masters of fine art ?
do you think your work is worth saving for posterity ?
martyn brown , warrington , cheshire no one can say they think something is worth saving .
it 's just if it is saved .
i think conceptual art has a really good place in art history .
it runs parallel in terms of invention with , say , renaissance art .
it shows us a totally different way of seeing things .
as you were going through education pre university , did your teachers support and predict your success ?
alice jones , durban , south africa i did a cse in art and i got a grade 3 .
a cse is a certificate of secondary education .
at school my drama teacher and my art teacher were extremely encouraging .
but at that time in the 70s you could only do o-levels if you went to grammar school and i lost all interest in going to school when i was 13 .
but i 'm very happy to say the school i went to , king ethelbert 's in kent , is now a special school for the arts .
your book stangeland was published in turkey this week .
what is the importance of this book for you ?
how does it correlate with your artistic career ?
cem erciyes , istanbul , turkey that book was compiled from writings of mine , some of which are 25 years old .
i really love my book .
for me , instead of having a really big exhibition , i wrote that book .
my turkish is really terrible so i will never be able to read the turkish translation myself , but i hope it 's good .
what is the secret of success in the art world today ?
do you need to do a lot of schmoozing in the right circles , or to be lucky enough to have a patron ?
most artists seem to have come from a well-to-do background , which ensures them success but you seem to be different .
dave willis , sandy , uk that 's quite an interesting question because 20 years ago i would have agreed with you .
but now successful people from the art world come from very mixed and varied backgrounds .
it 's no longer a debutante 's day out .
and the old-fashioned answer is : a lot of hard work , a bit of luck and a lot of perseverance .
it was 10 years before i made any money .
you have to have a phenomenal amount of faith to keep going .
what do you think of gilbert & george 's art work ?
collette , croydon i recently watched the world according to gilbert & george .
i was totally taken aback at how poetic and romantic it was .
often when we think about gilbert & george 's work we just think about hard lines , strong graphics and bright colours .
but behind that there is a nostalgia and touching sentimentality that i like very much .
what plans do you have to down-grade your association with the yba -lrb- young british artist -rrb- label ?
i assume you want to be remembered for who you are as an artist instead of who you are associated with .
brian sherwin , usa the ybas was a term that was invented by the media because in the 90s there was a phenomenon - there were a lot of young british artists who seemed to be riding the crest of a wave .
a lot of us still are , except we are not young anymore .
personally i never want to disassociate myself from my friends .
my influences have always been expressionism and 19th-century art .
at the time when the frieze show was on i was in turkey painting watercolours .
it was years later before i became friends with that group of people , the ybas .
are you going to produce any more christmas cards ?
i really loved your christmas robin from a couple of years ago .
good luck in the future .
sarah heron , glasgow , uk no , i 'm not going to , but if it still proves popular the tate will keep printing it .
i will be doing a christmas card next year of my local church , christchurch spitalfields , to raise money for further renovations .

the controversial artist , perhaps best known for my bed - a stained , unmade bed - and naked self-portraits , has produced a show of new work for the british pavilion .
and , for the first time , she 's showing a series of drawings she made about being sexually abused when she was nine - as well as 27 watercolours about her abortion in 1990 .
as emin prepared to set off for venice , she answered some of your questions about her career , ideas on art and what she had planned for the venice audience .
did you always know that you were going to be an artist ?
was is something you dreamt of becoming as a child ?
sandra fraser , leeds uk no , it was in 1997 at the opening of my south london gallery show , i need art like i need god , that it really hit home that i was going to be an artist .
what is your favourite topic of conversation and how is this reflected in the work you are bringing to venice ?
paul , london love and relationships are my favourite topic of conversation at the moment .
i think a lot of this will be seen in venice .
traditional artists used paint on canvas so my question is this , why do you feel that writing conquests inside a tent or not making your bed are improvements on this and how does that make art more accessible to the public ?
jimmy , gb i think that 's a really silly question .
they are both seminal pieces of art and have earned their little place in the map of art history .
it 's my understanding of painting and drawing and traditional forms of art that gives me the confidence to express myself in other mediums .
why is the art world so obsessed with the artist and not the art they make ?
knowing that a particular work is by a " noted " artist rather than a " lesser " one can hike up its value massively , but the actual work has n't changed in the slightest .
ollie glidewell that 's not true .
picasso is picasso .
damien hirst is damien hirst .
frida kahlo is frida kahlo .
they created their own language in the world of art and that is what gives their work more value .
it may be impossible to define " art " but how would you define " good art " ?
jenny southan , hastings , england for me , good art is something that has integrity .
so it 's not necessarily the thing that is the most polished and well executed .
that 's what i adhere to .
if you had not become an artist , what do you think you would have done as a job instead ?
katy womersley , southampton , hampshire i seriously think i might have died .
i think art has given me lots of strength and given me a purpose .
on a more humble note , i think i would have gone into retail shop work , as the only education i 've had is art and i have always liked clothes and fashion .
my hobby would have been writing - which it still is .
what do you think was the defining moment in your life that made you want to pursue a career in art ?
-lrb- ps - your oystercard wallet is ace -rrb- .
sharon irvine , london , uk those feelings come and go .
the day i heard i got into the royal college of art was a great moment of ambition .
but two years later , through a personal turn of events , i felt i never wanted to make art again .
it 's like a love affair - it blows hot and cold .
as only the second female solo artist at the venice biennale , do you think there is a lack of international recognition for british female artists today ?
abigail shapiro , durham , county durham no , on the contrary , it is fantastic being a female artist today .
a damn site better than it was 50 years ago .
do you aim to be controversial with your work ?
jo armstrong , warrington , cheshire no , i 've never aimed to be controversial and if anything the controversiality gets in the way .
do you think it 's necessary for someone wishing to exhibit and " make " art to have an academic qualification and to have experienced life at an accredited art college or do you think art is " open to all " ?
rosie , glasgow i think that you should go to art college if you can because it 's a fantastic experience .
and if you ca n't get into art school for whatever reason , you should try and go to evening classes - life drawing , photography - there are all sorts of classes and it 's really good to get some experience from others .
art school was the best thing that ever happened to me .
although you state that neither you nor your work is feminist , can you see why people might label it as such ?
satdeep grewal , london , england i have n't said that my work is n't feminist .
i believe my work to be extremely feminine and i am a strong woman who makes the work .
i think people often think that 's feminist .
does it bother you when people do n't " get " your art ?
do you think you are broadening what is considered art ?
speaking for myself , i love your work .
you 've invested so much of your self , conscious and unconsciously .
that 's why it is so good .
es holmans it bothers me when they are nasty to me .
often people attack me personally because my work is very personal .
and sometimes that really hurts , like for example when people take the piss out of my accent .
i would like to be tougher about it but i 'm not .
do you believe that modern conceptual art has a worth in society compared to say architecture or the work of the old masters of fine art ?
do you think your work is worth saving for posterity ?
martyn brown , warrington , cheshire no one can say they think something is worth saving .
it 's just if it is saved .
i think conceptual art has a really good place in art history .
it runs parallel in terms of invention with , say , renaissance art .
it shows us a totally different way of seeing things .
as you were going through education pre university , did your teachers support and predict your success ?
alice jones , durban , south africa i did a cse in art and i got a grade 3 .
a cse is a certificate of secondary education .
at school my drama teacher and my art teacher were extremely encouraging .
but at that time in the 70s you could only do o-levels if you went to grammar school and i lost all interest in going to school when i was 13 .
but i 'm very happy to say the school i went to , king ethelbert 's in kent , is now a special school for the arts .
your book stangeland was published in turkey this week .
what is the importance of this book for you ?
how does it correlate with your artistic career ?
cem erciyes , istanbul , turkey that book was compiled from writings of mine , some of which are 25 years old .
i really love my book .
for me , instead of having a really big exhibition , i wrote that book .
my turkish is really terrible so i will never be able to read the turkish translation myself , but i hope it 's good .
what is the secret of success in the art world today ?
do you need to do a lot of schmoozing in the right circles , or to be lucky enough to have a patron ?
most artists seem to have come from a well-to-do background , which ensures them success but you seem to be different .
dave willis , sandy , uk that 's quite an interesting question because 20 years ago i would have agreed with you .
but now successful people from the art world come from very mixed and varied backgrounds .
it 's no longer a debutante 's day out .
and the old-fashioned answer is : a lot of hard work , a bit of luck and a lot of perseverance .
it was 10 years before i made any money .
you have to have a phenomenal amount of faith to keep going .
what do you think of gilbert & george 's art work ?
collette , croydon i recently watched the world according to gilbert & george .
i was totally taken aback at how poetic and romantic it was .
often when we think about gilbert & george 's work we just think about hard lines , strong graphics and bright colours .
but behind that there is a nostalgia and touching sentimentality that i like very much .
what plans do you have to down-grade your association with the yba -lrb- young british artist -rrb- label ?
i assume you want to be remembered for who you are as an artist instead of who you are associated with .
brian sherwin , usa the ybas was a term that was invented by the media because in the 90s there was a phenomenon - there were a lot of young british artists who seemed to be riding the crest of a wave .
a lot of us still are , except we are not young anymore .
personally i never want to disassociate myself from my friends .
my influences have always been expressionism and 19th-century art .
at the time when the frieze show was on i was in turkey painting watercolours .
it was years later before i became friends with that group of people , the ybas .
are you going to produce any more christmas cards ?
i really loved your christmas robin from a couple of years ago .
good luck in the future .
sarah heron , glasgow , uk no , i 'm not going to , but if it still proves popular the tate will keep printing it .
i will be doing a christmas card next year of my local church , christchurch spitalfields , to raise money for further renovations .

but behind that there is a nostalgia and touching sentimentality that i like very much .
what plans do you have to down-grade your association with the yba -lrb- young british artist -rrb- label ?
i assume you want to be remembered for who you are as an artist instead of who you are associated with .
brian sherwin , usa the ybas was a term that was invented by the media because in the 90s there was a phenomenon - there were a lot of young british artists who seemed to be riding the crest of a wave .
a lot of us still are , except we are not young anymore .
personally i never want to disassociate myself from my friends .
my influences have always been expressionism and 19th-century art .
at the time when the frieze show was on i was in turkey painting watercolours .
it was years later before i became friends with that group of people , the ybas .
are you going to produce any more christmas cards ?
i really loved your christmas robin from a couple of years ago .
good luck in the future .
sarah heron , glasgow , uk no , i 'm not going to , but if it still proves popular the tate will keep printing it .
i will be doing a christmas card next year of my local church , christchurch spitalfields , to raise money for further renovations .

the controversial artist , perhaps best known for my bed - a stained , unmade bed - and naked self-portraits , has produced a show of new work for the british pavilion .
and , for the first time , she 's showing a series of drawings she made about being sexually abused when she was nine - as well as 27 watercolours about her abortion in 1990 .
as emin prepared to set off for venice , she answered some of your questions about her career , ideas on art and what she had planned for the venice audience .
did you always know that you were going to be an artist ?
was is something you dreamt of becoming as a child ?
sandra fraser , leeds uk no , it was in 1997 at the opening of my south london gallery show , i need art like i need god , that it really hit home that i was going to be an artist .
what is your favourite topic of conversation and how is this reflected in the work you are bringing to venice ?
paul , london love and relationships are my favourite topic of conversation at the moment .
i think a lot of this will be seen in venice .
traditional artists used paint on canvas so my question is this , why do you feel that writing conquests inside a tent or not making your bed are improvements on this and how does that make art more accessible to the public ?
jimmy , gb i think that 's a really silly question .
they are both seminal pieces of art and have earned their little place in the map of art history .
it 's my understanding of painting and drawing and traditional forms of art that gives me the confidence to express myself in other mediums .
why is the art world so obsessed with the artist and not the art they make ?
knowing that a particular work is by a " noted " artist rather than a " lesser " one can hike up its value massively , but the actual work has n't changed in the slightest .
ollie glidewell that 's not true .
picasso is picasso .
damien hirst is damien hirst .
frida kahlo is frida kahlo .
they created their own language in the world of art and that is what gives their work more value .
it may be impossible to define " art " but how would you define " good art " ?
jenny southan , hastings , england for me , good art is something that has integrity .
so it 's not necessarily the thing that is the most polished and well executed .
that 's what i adhere to .
if you had not become an artist , what do you think you would have done as a job instead ?
katy womersley , southampton , hampshire i seriously think i might have died .
i think art has given me lots of strength and given me a purpose .
on a more humble note , i think i would have gone into retail shop work , as the only education i 've had is art and i have always liked clothes and fashion .
my hobby would have been writing - which it still is .
what do you think was the defining moment in your life that made you want to pursue a career in art ?
-lrb- ps - your oystercard wallet is ace -rrb- .
sharon irvine , london , uk those feelings come and go .
the day i heard i got into the royal college of art was a great moment of ambition .
but two years later , through a personal turn of events , i felt i never wanted to make art again .
it 's like a love affair - it blows hot and cold .
as only the second female solo artist at the venice biennale , do you think there is a lack of international recognition for british female artists today ?
abigail shapiro , durham , county durham no , on the contrary , it is fantastic being a female artist today .
a damn site better than it was 50 years ago .
do you aim to be controversial with your work ?
jo armstrong , warrington , cheshire no , i 've never aimed to be controversial and if anything the controversiality gets in the way .
do you think it 's necessary for someone wishing to exhibit and " make " art to have an academic qualification and to have experienced life at an accredited art college or do you think art is " open to all " ?
rosie , glasgow i think that you should go to art college if you can because it 's a fantastic experience .
and if you ca n't get into art school for whatever reason , you should try and go to evening classes - life drawing , photography - there are all sorts of classes and it 's really good to get some experience from others .
art school was the best thing that ever happened to me .
although you state that neither you nor your work is feminist , can you see why people might label it as such ?
satdeep grewal , london , england i have n't said that my work is n't feminist .
i believe my work to be extremely feminine and i am a strong woman who makes the work .
i think people often think that 's feminist .
does it bother you when people do n't " get " your art ?
do you think you are broadening what is considered art ?
speaking for myself , i love your work .
you 've invested so much of your self , conscious and unconsciously .
that 's why it is so good .
es holmans it bothers me when they are nasty to me .
often people attack me personally because my work is very personal .
and sometimes that really hurts , like for example when people take the piss out of my accent .
i would like to be tougher about it but i 'm not .
do you believe that modern conceptual art has a worth in society compared to say architecture or the work of the old masters of fine art ?
do you think your work is worth saving for posterity ?
martyn brown , warrington , cheshire no one can say they think something is worth saving .
it 's just if it is saved .
i think conceptual art has a really good place in art history .
it runs parallel in terms of invention with , say , renaissance art .
it shows us a totally different way of seeing things .
as you were going through education pre university , did your teachers support and predict your success ?
alice jones , durban , south africa i did a cse in art and i got a grade 3 .
a cse is a certificate of secondary education .
at school my drama teacher and my art teacher were extremely encouraging .
but at that time in the 70s you could only do o-levels if you went to grammar school and i lost all interest in going to school when i was 13 .
but i 'm very happy to say the school i went to , king ethelbert 's in kent , is now a special school for the arts .
your book stangeland was published in turkey this week .
what is the importance of this book for you ?
how does it correlate with your artistic career ?
cem erciyes , istanbul , turkey that book was compiled from writings of mine , some of which are 25 years old .
i really love my book .
for me , instead of having a really big exhibition , i wrote that book .
my turkish is really terrible so i will never be able to read the turkish translation myself , but i hope it 's good .
what is the secret of success in the art world today ?
do you need to do a lot of schmoozing in the right circles , or to be lucky enough to have a patron ?
most artists seem to have come from a well-to-do background , which ensures them success but you seem to be different .
dave willis , sandy , uk that 's quite an interesting question because 20 years ago i would have agreed with you .
but now successful people from the art world come from very mixed and varied backgrounds .
it 's no longer a debutante 's day out .
and the old-fashioned answer is : a lot of hard work , a bit of luck and a lot of perseverance .
it was 10 years before i made any money .
you have to have a phenomenal amount of faith to keep going .
what do you think of gilbert & george 's art work ?
collette , croydon i recently watched the world according to gilbert & george .
i was totally taken aback at how poetic and romantic it was .
often when we think about gilbert & george 's work we just think about hard lines , strong graphics and bright colours .
but behind that there is a nostalgia and touching sentimentality that i like very much .
what plans do you have to down-grade your association with the yba -lrb- young british artist -rrb- label ?

brian sherwin , usa the ybas was a term that was invented by the media because in the 90s there was a phenomenon - there were a lot of young british artists who seemed to be riding the crest of a wave .

this followed a series of amendments to the proposed bill , which undermined a fragile bipartisan compromise .
the bill would have tightened border controls , but given 12 million illegal immigrants already in the us a way to legal status and citizenship .
illegal immigration is among voters ' top concerns and is set to be a key issue in the 2008 presidential poll .
president george w bush has made immigration reform one of his priorities and has previously said he wants to see new legislation in place by the end of the year .
party leaders have promised they will work to try to bring a bill back to the senate for a new attempt to make progress within the next few weeks .

the bill also set out a " points system " that emphasises immigrants ' education , language and job skills over family connections in awarding green cards .

this followed a series of amendments to the proposed bill , which undermined a fragile bipartisan compromise .
the bill would have tightened border controls , but given 12 million illegal immigrants already in the us a way to legal status and citizenship .
illegal immigration is among voters ' top concerns and is set to be a key issue in the 2008 presidential poll .
president george w bush has made immigration reform one of his priorities and has previously said he wants to see new legislation in place by the end of the year .
party leaders have promised they will work to try to bring a bill back to the senate for a new attempt to make progress within the next few weeks .
but the vote is a serious blow to the president 's chances of achieving comprehensive immigration reform before he leaves office , correspondents say .
and unless the measure is reconsidered soon , it may get caught up in the upcoming election cycle as politicians turn their attention to the 2008 presidential vote .
the house of representatives , where views on immigration reform are even more polarised , has still to consider its version of the legislation .
guest workers the bipartisan bill had elements which were hard for both democrats and republicans to accept .
some critics called it an " amnesty " for those who had illegally entered the us , while other opponents argued its guest worker programme threatened american workers .
i simply do not understand why some of my colleagues want to jam this legislation through congress sen john cornyn after two weeks of debate , the bill finally stalled late on thursday , when only 45 senators voted in favour of bringing debate to an end and moving the bill to its final passage .
sixty votes were required for the motion to pass .
senate majority leader harry reid removed the bill from the business schedule and proceeded to other matters .
" " i , even though disappointed , look forward to passing this bill , " he said .
however , republicans - many of whom believe the bill should be tougher on illegal immigrants - had sought more time for debate .
" i simply do not understand why some of my colleagues want to jam this legislation through congress without a serious and thorough examination of its consequences , " said republican senator john cornyn of texas .
border security under the proposed senate bill , illegal immigrants could seek a renewable " z visa " after paying a $ 5,000 -lrb- £ 2,530 -rrb- fine .
they could ultimately be placed on the path to permanent residency - a process that could take several years .
the bill also set out a " points system " that emphasises immigrants ' education , language and job skills over family connections in awarding green cards .
but these measures would not come into force until 18,000 new border guards are deployed , the fence with mexico reinforced and hi-tech surveillance in place .

the bumper remuneration package followed a resurgent 12 months for the firm , whose annual profits grew 28.5 % .
mr rose saw his salary rise from £ 975,000 to £ 1.05m - and was given a £ 2.6m cash and shares bonus .

advertising success mr rose is widely credited for turning around the company 's fortunes when he took over in 2004 , saving m & s from a takeover by millionaire entrepreneur and arcadia owner sir philip green .
m & s made £ 965.2m in the year to the end of march 2007 , up from £ 751.4m the previous year .
the improved performance was driven by stronger demand for m & s food and clothing , which was supported by an advertising campaign featuring 1960s model twiggy , singers myleene klass and bryan ferry , and other celebrities .

the small town square , the neat little church , the narrow streets .
quiet during a weekday morning , with just a handful of locals out for a walk , or running errands .
messines was the first time the irish and ulster divisions fought together but this week messines has been thrust into the spotlight .
on 7 june 1917 , the british second army , under the command of general herbert plummer , launched the battle of messines .
it was one of the bloodiest battles of the first world war .
the battle had been months in the planning , and centred around the strategically important messines ridge .
it 's said that the sound of the mine explosions launched during the battle of messines could be heard as far away as dublin .
more than 40,000 men lost their lives during the fighting .
this weekend messines plays host to the president of ireland as a week of commemoration ceremonies draws to a close .
thursday saw the new zealanders who lost their lives in that terrible battle remembered at a simple ceremony just outside the town centre .
the beautiful , haunting sound of a maori song echoed through the cemetery as hundreds gathered to honour the young men who gave their lives , so far from home .
the events in messines 90 years ago have special resonance in the political landscape in northern ireland today .
side-by-side ninety years ago , the 16th irish and 36th ulster divisions fought side-by-side to capture the small town of wystenchaete .
it was the first time the two divisions had fought together .
ninety years on , a conflict resolution centre stands just outside messines .
it has played host to former paramilitary prisoners from republican and loyalist traditions in the past .
the driving force behind the messines concept , glenn barr , speaks passionately about the work that 's gone into the building .
he points to the divided history of europe , and the reconciliation that 's been achieved since the end of the second world war .
the messines project has also given birth to a peace centre outside the village .
a grey tower stands , reaching up to the sky .
stone slabs are laid into the earth , bearing lines of poetry from those who served in the first world war , or simply lines from a letter written from the trenches to a loved one at home .
the centre is strangely calming and peaceful .
the graves of unknown irish soldiers the tall , thin peace tower dominates the flat landscape all around it .
you think of the ancient round towers of ireland , part of that country 's architectural heritage .
it 's odd , but strangely appropriate , to see this structure in the middle of these fields .
as you walk around , you ca n't help wondering , what must it have been like all those years ago ?
when the quiet countryside was turned into the most awful of killing fields ; when thousands of young men - the heart of a generation - were slaughtered in their thousands .
for many who fell , there is n't even a marked grave .
just the words ; " known only to god " carved into a simple headstone .
but many in messines hope the town will become a symbol of peace , not war , in years to come .
the peace village is now integral to the town .

messines was the first time the irish and ulster divisions fought together but this week messines has been thrust into the spotlight .
on 7 june 1917 , the british second army , under the command of general herbert plummer , launched the battle of messines .
it was one of the bloodiest battles of the first world war .
the battle had been months in the planning , and centred around the strategically important messines ridge .
it 's said that the sound of the mine explosions launched during the battle of messines could be heard as far away as dublin .
more than 40,000 men lost their lives during the fighting .
this weekend messines plays host to the president of ireland as a week of commemoration ceremonies draws to a close .
thursday saw the new zealanders who lost their lives in that terrible battle remembered at a simple ceremony just outside the town centre .
the beautiful , haunting sound of a maori song echoed through the cemetery as hundreds gathered to honour the young men who gave their lives , so far from home .

side-by-side ninety years ago , the 16th irish and 36th ulster divisions fought side-by-side to capture the small town of wystenchaete .
it was the first time the two divisions had fought together .
ninety years on , a conflict resolution centre stands just outside messines .
it has played host to former paramilitary prisoners from republican and loyalist traditions in the past .
the driving force behind the messines concept , glenn barr , speaks passionately about the work that 's gone into the building .
he points to the divided history of europe , and the reconciliation that 's been achieved since the end of the second world war .
the messines project has also given birth to a peace centre outside the village .
a grey tower stands , reaching up to the sky .
stone slabs are laid into the earth , bearing lines of poetry from those who served in the first world war , or simply lines from a letter written from the trenches to a loved one at home .
the centre is strangely calming and peaceful .
the graves of unknown irish soldiers the tall , thin peace tower dominates the flat landscape all around it .
you think of the ancient round towers of ireland , part of that country 's architectural heritage .
it 's odd , but strangely appropriate , to see this structure in the middle of these fields .
as you walk around , you ca n't help wondering , what must it have been like all those years ago ?
when the quiet countryside was turned into the most awful of killing fields ; when thousands of young men - the heart of a generation - were slaughtered in their thousands .
for many who fell , there is n't even a marked grave .
just the words ; " known only to god " carved into a simple headstone .

the number of death penalties meted out in beijing courts this year dropped by 10 % from the same time last year , the china daily newspaper said .
last november the law was changed so that only china 's top court now has the power to review and ratify sentences handed down by lower courts .
china is believed to carry out more executions than any other country .
there had been repeated claims of miscarriages of justice since lower courts were given the right to approve the death sentence in the 1980s .
new trends ni shouming of the supreme court said that figures from beijing 's lower courts showed that in the first five months of this year , death sentences had dropped by 10 % .
he told the china daily that this trend was evident across the country .
china 's death penalty china is believed to execute more people than rest of the world combined non-violent crimes such as tax fraud and embezzlement carry death penalty other crimes include murder , rape , robbery and drug offences china does not publish official figures on executions many cases are based on confessions and trials often take less than a day , observers say " the lower courts have to be more prudent now , " he was quoted as saying .
" if a case is sent back for a retrial by the highest court , it not only means the first judgement is wrong , but also a matter of shame for the lower court . "
criminal law expert , chen weidong , was quoted by the newspaper as saying that he expected to see executions drop by 20 % in 2007 .
" leniency and more judicious use of capital punishment is the trend of the time , " he said .
wrongful convictions the change in the law came into effect on 1 january 2007 , and meant that any death sentence handed out by a lower court must be given final approval by the supreme court .
china 's official state news agency , xinhua , said at the time that it was one of the most important reforms of capital punishment in more than two decades .
capital punishment has a long history in china .
in 2005 , an estimated 1,770 executions were carried out and nearly 4,000 people were sentenced to death , human rights group amnesty international says .
but recent cases of wrongful convictions had received widespread publicity both at home and abroad , putting the chinese authorities under pressure over the issue .

enlarge image some pictures may speak a thousand words , but this speaks just two : " cuddle me ! "
the slow loris , native to large swathes of asia , must be one of the most appealing creatures on the planet .
" the pet shops advertise them , and they 're very popular to japanese ladies , " says masayuki sakamoto from the japan wildlife conservation society .
" they 're easy to keep , they do n't cry , they 're small , and just very cute . "
in japan , a slow loris will cost you between $ 1,500 and $ 4,500 ; but that conceals the real cost of the pet trade , measured in ripped fingers , bloody mouths , and babies unable to clean up their own defecation .
" they 'll pull out its teeth so the vendor can say it 's a baby , " recounts anna nekaris , a loris specialist based at oxford brookes university in the uk .
" they 're kept in wire cages ; and because of the special network of blood vessels they have , when they 're pulled out of the cages it cuts their hands and feet . "
domestic trade is prevented under law in all the range states , yet it 's widespread and carried out in an open manner which points to a need for better domestic enforcement chris shepherd , traffic babies separated from their parents are unable to clean themselves .
their fur becomes caked with urine , faeces and oily skin secretions ; a large proportion -lrb- between 30 % and 90 % -rrb- die in transit .
the cambodian government has just pushed through a ban on the international trade in the slow loris ; in technical terms , uplisting these primates from appendix 2 to appendix 1 within the convention on international trade in endangered species -lrb- cites -rrb- .
the bid sailed through the cites meeting by consensus .
but not all conservation groups backed it , the implication being that sentiment may be obstructing rational analysis of the problem .
the big unknown it used to be assumed that the slow loris was a single species , its range stretching from northern india down through burma , thailand , and peninsular malaysia , across into vietnam , cambodia and laos and into the islands of indonesia and the philippines .
campaigners say hands and feet are damaged in cages dr nekaris is one of the researchers who have repainted the loris picture , and five species are now recognised , though that may still be an underestimate .
the scale of the threat is also unclear .
population estimates are often based on small surveys , and the official red list of threatened species notes a lack of data from many areas , although a more recent specialist workshop categorised all five species as either endangered or vulnerable to extinction .
nobody knows the scale of the international loris trade either .
between 1998 and 2006 , japanese authorities seized 363 animals , while thai , indonesian and singaporean officials uncovered 358 specimens bound for japan .
wildlife trade experts work on the basis that about 10 % of shipments are found , but that might be an underestimate in the case of the slow loris , whose survival instinct is to curl up and do nothing , making them easy to hide in a suitcase .
cites explained threatened organisms listed on three appendices depending on level of risk appendix 1 - all international trade banned appendix 2 - international trade monitored and regulated appendix 3 - trade bans by individual governments , others asked to assist " uplisting " - moving organism to a more protective appendix , " downlisting " - the reverse conferences of the parties -lrb- cops -rrb- held every three years cites administered by un environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- the animals are also traded to the middle east , europe , china and the us ; even so , trade may not be the biggest issue .
" the species are in international trade , but current information indicates that the extent of that trade is relatively limited and its impact likely to be insignificant compared with other factors , " notes the expert assessment from the world conservation union -lrb- iucn -rrb- prepared for the cites meeting .
iucn suggests that habitat loss may be a more important factor in their decline .
but this sober assessment did not find favour with cites delegates .
the brief debate acknowledged the reality of ongoing forest destruction in south-east asia , but nobody spoke against cambodia 's resolution .
perhaps the loris ' emotional appeal won the day .
painful birth in southeast asia , cuteness is not all the slow loris has to offer .
a traditional cambodian medicine to alleviate childbirth pain is loris wine , each bottle made from the bodies of three animals mixed with rice wine .
carcasses are dried and smoked for use in other traditional remedies .
there is trade here , often from rural areas into cities , but it rarely crosses international borders .
the babies are unable to clean their own bodies " i think domestic trade is by far the most urgent issue we should be looking at , " says chris shepherd of the wildlife trade monitoring organisation traffic .
" we 'd like to urge enforcement agencies in range states and consumer countries , which are often the same , to close down the domestic markets " domestic trade is prevented under law in all the range states , yet it 's widespread and carried out in an open manner which points to a need for better domestic enforcement . "
the irony is that the cites proposal was supported by many of the governments which chris shepherd fingers as lacking the will to enforce domestic laws .
anna nekaris , though , believes uplisting will increase awareness of the loris ' plight among the public , and within enforcement agencies .
" at the moment they 're seen as just a little brown animal , and most cites officials probably would n't distinguish it from a lemur , " she says .
" an appendix 1 listing would bring more education for these officers , and would help them realise that this is something they should be looking out for . "
the cambodian bid was backed by animal welfare groups .
pictures of these cutest of creatures apparently shivering in terror in market cages have tremendous emotional appeal .
but cites is supposed to work on sound science , not emotion .

the slow loris , native to large swathes of asia , must be one of the most appealing creatures on the planet .
" the pet shops advertise them , and they 're very popular to japanese ladies , " says masayuki sakamoto from the japan wildlife conservation society .
" they 're easy to keep , they do n't cry , they 're small , and just very cute . "
in japan , a slow loris will cost you between $ 1,500 and $ 4,500 ; but that conceals the real cost of the pet trade , measured in ripped fingers , bloody mouths , and babies unable to clean up their own defecation .
" they 'll pull out its teeth so the vendor can say it 's a baby , " recounts anna nekaris , a loris specialist based at oxford brookes university in the uk .
" they 're kept in wire cages ; and because of the special network of blood vessels they have , when they 're pulled out of the cages it cuts their hands and feet . "
domestic trade is prevented under law in all the range states , yet it 's widespread and carried out in an open manner which points to a need for better domestic enforcement chris shepherd , traffic babies separated from their parents are unable to clean themselves .
their fur becomes caked with urine , faeces and oily skin secretions ; a large proportion -lrb- between 30 % and 90 % -rrb- die in transit .
the cambodian government has just pushed through a ban on the international trade in the slow loris ; in technical terms , uplisting these primates from appendix 2 to appendix 1 within the convention on international trade in endangered species -lrb- cites -rrb- .
the bid sailed through the cites meeting by consensus .
but not all conservation groups backed it , the implication being that sentiment may be obstructing rational analysis of the problem .
the big unknown it used to be assumed that the slow loris was a single species , its range stretching from northern india down through burma , thailand , and peninsular malaysia , across into vietnam , cambodia and laos and into the islands of indonesia and the philippines .
campaigners say hands and feet are damaged in cages dr nekaris is one of the researchers who have repainted the loris picture , and five species are now recognised , though that may still be an underestimate .
the scale of the threat is also unclear .
population estimates are often based on small surveys , and the official red list of threatened species notes a lack of data from many areas , although a more recent specialist workshop categorised all five species as either endangered or vulnerable to extinction .
nobody knows the scale of the international loris trade either .
between 1998 and 2006 , japanese authorities seized 363 animals , while thai , indonesian and singaporean officials uncovered 358 specimens bound for japan .
wildlife trade experts work on the basis that about 10 % of shipments are found , but that might be an underestimate in the case of the slow loris , whose survival instinct is to curl up and do nothing , making them easy to hide in a suitcase .
cites explained threatened organisms listed on three appendices depending on level of risk appendix 1 - all international trade banned appendix 2 - international trade monitored and regulated appendix 3 - trade bans by individual governments , others asked to assist " uplisting " - moving organism to a more protective appendix , " downlisting " - the reverse conferences of the parties -lrb- cops -rrb- held every three years cites administered by un environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- the animals are also traded to the middle east , europe , china and the us ; even so , trade may not be the biggest issue .
" the species are in international trade , but current information indicates that the extent of that trade is relatively limited and its impact likely to be insignificant compared with other factors , " notes the expert assessment from the world conservation union -lrb- iucn -rrb- prepared for the cites meeting .
iucn suggests that habitat loss may be a more important factor in their decline .
but this sober assessment did not find favour with cites delegates .
the brief debate acknowledged the reality of ongoing forest destruction in south-east asia , but nobody spoke against cambodia 's resolution .
perhaps the loris ' emotional appeal won the day .
painful birth in southeast asia , cuteness is not all the slow loris has to offer .
a traditional cambodian medicine to alleviate childbirth pain is loris wine , each bottle made from the bodies of three animals mixed with rice wine .
carcasses are dried and smoked for use in other traditional remedies .
there is trade here , often from rural areas into cities , but it rarely crosses international borders .
the babies are unable to clean their own bodies " i think domestic trade is by far the most urgent issue we should be looking at , " says chris shepherd of the wildlife trade monitoring organisation traffic .
" we 'd like to urge enforcement agencies in range states and consumer countries , which are often the same , to close down the domestic markets " domestic trade is prevented under law in all the range states , yet it 's widespread and carried out in an open manner which points to a need for better domestic enforcement . "
the irony is that the cites proposal was supported by many of the governments which chris shepherd fingers as lacking the will to enforce domestic laws .
anna nekaris , though , believes uplisting will increase awareness of the loris ' plight among the public , and within enforcement agencies .
" at the moment they 're seen as just a little brown animal , and most cites officials probably would n't distinguish it from a lemur , " she says .
" an appendix 1 listing would bring more education for these officers , and would help them realise that this is something they should be looking out for . "
the cambodian bid was backed by animal welfare groups .
pictures of these cutest of creatures apparently shivering in terror in market cages have tremendous emotional appeal .
but cites is supposed to work on sound science , not emotion .
the appendix 1 listing will not do any harm - it can hardly make prospects for the loris worse .
without increased domestic action , it may not do much good either .

"
the slow loris , native to large swathes of asia , must be one of the most appealing creatures on the planet .
" the pet shops advertise them , and they 're very popular to japanese ladies , " says masayuki sakamoto from the japan wildlife conservation society .
" they 're easy to keep , they do n't cry , they 're small , and just very cute . "
in japan , a slow loris will cost you between $ 1,500 and $ 4,500 ; but that conceals the real cost of the pet trade , measured in ripped fingers , bloody mouths , and babies unable to clean up their own defecation .
" they 'll pull out its teeth so the vendor can say it 's a baby , " recounts anna nekaris , a loris specialist based at oxford brookes university in the uk .
" they 're kept in wire cages ; and because of the special network of blood vessels they have , when they 're pulled out of the cages it cuts their hands and feet . "
" domestic trade is prevented under law in all the range states , yet it 's widespread and carried out in an open manner which points to a need for better domestic enforcement " chris shepherd , traffic babies separated from their parents are unable to clean themselves .
their fur becomes caked with urine , faeces and oily skin secretions ; a large proportion -lrb- between 30 % and 90 % -rrb- die in transit .
the cambodian government has just pushed through a ban on the international trade in the slow loris ; in technical terms , uplisting these primates from appendix 2 to appendix 1 within the convention on international trade in endangered species -lrb- cites -rrb- .
the bid sailed through the cites meeting by consensus .
but not all conservation groups backed it , the implication being that sentiment may be obstructing rational analysis of the problem .
the big unknown it used to be assumed that the slow loris was a single species , its range stretching from northern india down through burma , thailand , and peninsular malaysia , across into vietnam , cambodia and laos and into the islands of indonesia and the philippines .
dr nekaris is one of the researchers who have repainted the loris picture , and five species are now recognised , though that may still be an underestimate .
the scale of the threat is also unclear .
population estimates are often based on small surveys , and the official red list of threatened species notes a lack of data from many areas , although a more recent specialist workshop categorised all five species as either endangered or vulnerable to extinction .
nobody knows the scale of the international loris trade either .
between 1998 and 2006 , japanese authorities seized 363 animals , while thai , indonesian and singaporean officials uncovered 358 specimens bound for japan .
wildlife trade experts work on the basis that about 10 % of shipments are found , but that might be an underestimate in the case of the slow loris , whose survival instinct is to curl up and do nothing , making them easy to hide in a suitcase .
cites explained threatened organisms listed on three appendices depending on level of risk appendix 1 - all international trade banned appendix 2 - international trade monitored and regulated appendix 3 - trade bans by individual governments , others asked to assist " uplisting " - moving organism to a more protective appendix , " downlisting " - the reverse conferences of the parties -lrb- cops -rrb- held every three years cites administered by un environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- the animals are also traded to the middle east , europe , china and the us ; even so , trade may not be the biggest issue .
" the species are in international trade , but current information indicates that the extent of that trade is relatively limited and its impact likely to be insignificant compared with other factors , " notes the expert assessment from the world conservation union -lrb- iucn -rrb- prepared for the cites meeting .
iucn suggests that habitat loss may be a more important factor in their decline .
but this sober assessment did not find favour with cites delegates .
the brief debate acknowledged the reality of ongoing forest destruction in south-east asia , but nobody spoke against cambodia 's resolution .
perhaps the loris ' emotional appeal won the day .
painful birth in southeast asia , cuteness is not all the slow loris has to offer .
a traditional cambodian medicine to alleviate childbirth pain is loris wine , each bottle made from the bodies of three animals mixed with rice wine .
carcasses are dried and smoked for use in other traditional remedies .
there is trade here , often from rural areas into cities , but it rarely crosses international borders .
" i think domestic trade is by far the most urgent issue we should be looking at , " says chris shepherd of the wildlife trade monitoring organisation traffic .
" we 'd like to urge enforcement agencies in range states and consumer countries , which are often the same , to close down the domestic markets " domestic trade is prevented under law in all the range states , yet it 's widespread and carried out in an open manner which points to a need for better domestic enforcement . "
the irony is that the cites proposal was supported by many of the governments which chris shepherd fingers as lacking the will to enforce domestic laws .
anna nekaris , though , believes uplisting will increase awareness of the loris ' plight among the public , and within enforcement agencies .
" at the moment they 're seen as just a little brown animal , and most cites officials probably would n't distinguish it from a lemur , " she says .
" an appendix 1 listing would bring more education for these officers , and would help them realise that this is something they should be looking out for . "
the cambodian bid was backed by animal welfare groups .
pictures of these cutest of creatures apparently shivering in terror in market cages have tremendous emotional appeal .
but cites is supposed to work on sound science , not emotion .
the appendix 1 listing will not do any harm - it can hardly make prospects for the loris worse .
without increased domestic action , it may not do much good either .

taking out a personal loan is the standard way of borrowing money from a bank , building society or specialist loan company .
you can usually borrow up to £ 15,000 for anywhere between six months and 10 years depending on the health of your finances .
loans can be secured or unsecured .

taking out a personal loan is the standard way of borrowing money from a bank , building society or specialist loan company .
you can usually borrow up to £ 15,000 for anywhere between six months and 10 years depending on the health of your finances .
loans can be secured or unsecured .
a secured loan is one that is tied to your house - which means you might have to sell your home if you ca n't keep up with repayments .
unsecured loans are not tied into anything , but if you default on your repayments you could end up being credit blacklisted .
this could prevent you taking out new credit cards , a mortgage or even taking advantage of an interest-free deal in a shop .
making comparisons to get the best deal , shop around .
in general , the more you borrow , the lower the interest rate will be , but rates vary from around 7 % up to 20 % .
finding the best loan shorter loans = less interest only apply for one at a time check the small print for penalties consider loan insurance in case you fall ill you do n't have to go to a traditional bank or building society , many good deals are offered through supermarkets , so shop around .
be careful when comparing products as lenders calculate the annual percentage rate -lrb- apr -rrb- in different ways .
loans for specific items such as new cars are also available , often with lower interest rates .
when comparing aprs , make sure that you 're comparing like with like .
do n't pay attention to the monthly interest rates advertised by shops - these are always lower than the annual rate and can mislead you into thinking you 've got a better deal than you really have .
repayments if you are refused credit you could check your credit history to make sure no mistakes have been made how lenders decide whether or not to make a loan loans are repaid in monthly instalments over an agreed period .
this amount of time is usually fixed and if you want to pay off the loan earlier you might have to pay a penalty .
the longer the repayment period , the more interest you will pay , so go for the shortest one you can manage .
flexible loans , which let you pay back the money whenever you want , are becoming more common but the interest rate charged is often higher .
the most important thing is to make sure you know exactly what the monthly payments will be , and how much you will pay back in total .
remember that if your bank or building society does turn down your loan application , it is obliged to explain the main reasons for doing so .

the internet communications industry is probably the most disruptive industry in terms of technology development today .
the industry has grown , for the most part , in line with what people want to do online .
and its growth is driven by a combination of innovation from the companies that are creating the software , and from user experience .
innovation tends to be the catalyst .
however , what people like doing online tells us a lot about how they like communicating and accessing and sharing information with one another .
one of the common denominating factors behind usage is what the technology gives the individual in return for their endeavours .
a technology platform that is based on a solid , intellectual , r & d driven culture has the opportunity to thrive among a hungry community that wants life made easier .
for me , a disruptive technology is only worthwhile if it gives people something they did n't have or could n't do before i 've spent most of my professional life working in the communications industry .
i 've seen many technologies come and go .
the ones that fail tend to be too hard to use and impenetrable to the average consumer .
and they fail because the benefit is often overshadowed by the hype .
many potentially great technologies disappear because , quite simply , they do not give people what they want .
never-ending quest that 's the key to it really .
i am passionate about technology but it is not the never-ending quest to make things smaller , faster , lighter or cheaper that gets me motivated .
the sort of new technology that i think about is n't usually born in a boardroom , a technology campus , the back of a garage or as a result of thousands of marketing focus groups .
it tends to originate from a simple idea that can be easily explained to anyone who is n't interested in how you make the technology work but more importantly , interested in what it does .
skype was first launched in april 2003 what intrigues me in particular , are disruptive technologies .
disruption can come in many guises .
it is at its most powerful when it comes in the form of a software platform that genuinely alters the status quo for the better .
disruptive technologies are designed to change the way people interact , work and spend their leisure time .
and disruption - if it 's working - makes it even easier and more valuable .
so when you 're using skype to make a free or very cheap voice call , letting you see the person you are talking to is an additional benefit .
simply put , a disruptive technology gives you what you want and at the same time , a better experience .
it sounds so straightforward .
however , the exciting part is when you try and build a business on the back of this disruption .
it 's not always as easy as it sounds .
as an active entrepreneur in the internet communications industry , you might assume what i am most passionate about is the core technology itself .
i am sure that some people find it easy to picture me in a laboratory swapping lines of code with teams of developers or re-designing the internet on the back of an envelope when sitting in the back of a cab .
but the truth is that i am incredibly attracted to disruptive technology as a whole , where the innovation behind it strips away social hierarchies or monopolies and helps to make the world a smaller place .
you ca n't ignore it , you have to embrace it .
for me , a disruptive technology is only worthwhile if it gives people something they did n't have or could n't do before .
take mobile phones , for example .
the ability to make a phone call on the move , no matter where you happen to be , was a simple but revolutionary step forward in the way we keep in touch with one another .
single out if i was to single out where the next big idea is going to come from , from what i 've seen so far , it will be driven by what consumers want .
and that 's why the internet has been such a fantastic stimulus for many new and disruptive technologies .
and those that have been the most successful are the ones which are fun and easy to use .
my instincts tell me that sharing knowledge is a catalyst behind adoption of a new technology the internet is a great platform for collaboration .
it lets people and businesses all over the world communicate and trade with one another .
it is a wholly liberating medium .
the internet has been incredibly disruptive across many industries - from retail to manufacturing to finance to entertainment .
today , for example , over one million people now make their living on ebay , which is astounding .
real disruption ripples out across the market and spawns new businesses .
for me , it 's about taking a new leap forward .
and a leap forward in technological and economic terms .
and this leap forward can achieve so many things when it reaches momentum .
however , it 's important not to confuse disruption in an industry with destruction .
average consumer true disruption prompts an evolution in itself - and one which gives more choice to the average consumer .
for example , when henry ford invented the mass production car , it did n't mean that other ways of travelling would disappear .
it simply meant that people could choose how they wished to travel .
and disruption is not about anarchy either .
setting up a business that gives people something for free is not enough to succeed in the long term .
the free proposition is obviously compelling but it 's actually all about doing something differently .
and doing that ' something ' to alter the status quo and take the industry to a new dimension .
disruption brings forward the process of economic evolution .
the technology platform has to develop alongside this .
and this is what the internet has done and continues to do .
it 's easy to get carried away however .
we need to keep what disruption is capable of in context .
people continue to get excited about new things such as web 2.0 but to me , this is no more than a label .
it 's almost impossible to predict how we will use the internet to communicate with one another in the next five to 10 years and i do n't have a crystal ball .
but my instincts tell me that sharing knowledge is a catalyst behind adoption of a new technology .
the more we can do on the internet and the more it helps us to stay in touch or progress a business idea , the more attractive and useful it will be .

it tends to originate from a simple idea that can be easily explained to anyone who is n't interested in how you make the technology work but more importantly , interested in what it does .
skype was first launched in april 2003 what intrigues me in particular , are disruptive technologies .
disruption can come in many guises .
it is at its most powerful when it comes in the form of a software platform that genuinely alters the status quo for the better .
disruptive technologies are designed to change the way people interact , work and spend their leisure time .
and disruption - if it 's working - makes it even easier and more valuable .
so when you 're using skype to make a free or very cheap voice call , letting you see the person you are talking to is an additional benefit .
simply put , a disruptive technology gives you what you want and at the same time , a better experience .
it sounds so straightforward .
however , the exciting part is when you try and build a business on the back of this disruption .
it 's not always as easy as it sounds .
as an active entrepreneur in the internet communications industry , you might assume what i am most passionate about is the core technology itself .
i am sure that some people find it easy to picture me in a laboratory swapping lines of code with teams of developers or re-designing the internet on the back of an envelope when sitting in the back of a cab .
but the truth is that i am incredibly attracted to disruptive technology as a whole , where the innovation behind it strips away social hierarchies or monopolies and helps to make the world a smaller place .
you ca n't ignore it , you have to embrace it .
for me , a disruptive technology is only worthwhile if it gives people something they did n't have or could n't do before .
take mobile phones , for example .
the ability to make a phone call on the move , no matter where you happen to be , was a simple but revolutionary step forward in the way we keep in touch with one another .
single out if i was to single out where the next big idea is going to come from , from what i 've seen so far , it will be driven by what consumers want .
and that 's why the internet has been such a fantastic stimulus for many new and disruptive technologies .
and those that have been the most successful are the ones which are fun and easy to use .
my instincts tell me that sharing knowledge is a catalyst behind adoption of a new technology the internet is a great platform for collaboration .
it lets people and businesses all over the world communicate and trade with one another .
it is a wholly liberating medium .
the internet has been incredibly disruptive across many industries - from retail to manufacturing to finance to entertainment .
today , for example , over one million people now make their living on ebay , which is astounding .
real disruption ripples out across the market and spawns new businesses .
for me , it 's about taking a new leap forward .
and a leap forward in technological and economic terms .
and this leap forward can achieve so many things when it reaches momentum .
however , it 's important not to confuse disruption in an industry with destruction .
average consumer true disruption prompts an evolution in itself - and one which gives more choice to the average consumer .
for example , when henry ford invented the mass production car , it did n't mean that other ways of travelling would disappear .
it simply meant that people could choose how they wished to travel .
and disruption is not about anarchy either .
setting up a business that gives people something for free is not enough to succeed in the long term .
the free proposition is obviously compelling but it 's actually all about doing something differently .
and doing that ' something ' to alter the status quo and take the industry to a new dimension .
disruption brings forward the process of economic evolution .
the technology platform has to develop alongside this .
and this is what the internet has done and continues to do .
it 's easy to get carried away however .
we need to keep what disruption is capable of in context .
people continue to get excited about new things such as web 2.0 but to me , this is no more than a label .
it 's almost impossible to predict how we will use the internet to communicate with one another in the next five to 10 years and i do n't have a crystal ball .
but my instincts tell me that sharing knowledge is a catalyst behind adoption of a new technology .
the more we can do on the internet and the more it helps us to stay in touch or progress a business idea , the more attractive and useful it will be .

the internet communications industry is probably the most disruptive industry in terms of technology development today .
the industry has grown , for the most part , in line with what people want to do online .
and its growth is driven by a combination of innovation from the companies that are creating the software , and from user experience .
innovation tends to be the catalyst .
however , what people like doing online tells us a lot about how they like communicating and accessing and sharing information with one another .
one of the common denominating factors behind usage is what the technology gives the individual in return for their endeavours .
a technology platform that is based on a solid , intellectual , r & d driven culture has the opportunity to thrive among a hungry community that wants life made easier .
for me , a disruptive technology is only worthwhile if it gives people something they did n't have or could n't do before i 've spent most of my professional life working in the communications industry .
i 've seen many technologies come and go .
the ones that fail tend to be too hard to use and impenetrable to the average consumer .
and they fail because the benefit is often overshadowed by the hype .
many potentially great technologies disappear because , quite simply , they do not give people what they want .

so when you 're using skype to make a free or very cheap voice call , letting you see the person you are talking to is an additional benefit .
simply put , a disruptive technology gives you what you want and at the same time , a better experience .
it sounds so straightforward .
however , the exciting part is when you try and build a business on the back of this disruption .
it 's not always as easy as it sounds .
as an active entrepreneur in the internet communications industry , you might assume what i am most passionate about is the core technology itself .
i am sure that some people find it easy to picture me in a laboratory swapping lines of code with teams of developers or re-designing the internet on the back of an envelope when sitting in the back of a cab .
but the truth is that i am incredibly attracted to disruptive technology as a whole , where the innovation behind it strips away social hierarchies or monopolies and helps to make the world a smaller place .
you ca n't ignore it , you have to embrace it .
for me , a disruptive technology is only worthwhile if it gives people something they did n't have or could n't do before .
take mobile phones , for example .
the ability to make a phone call on the move , no matter where you happen to be , was a simple but revolutionary step forward in the way we keep in touch with one another .
single out if i was to single out where the next big idea is going to come from , from what i 've seen so far , it will be driven by what consumers want .
and that 's why the internet has been such a fantastic stimulus for many new and disruptive technologies .
and those that have been the most successful are the ones which are fun and easy to use .
my instincts tell me that sharing knowledge is a catalyst behind adoption of a new technology the internet is a great platform for collaboration .
it lets people and businesses all over the world communicate and trade with one another .
it is a wholly liberating medium .
the internet has been incredibly disruptive across many industries - from retail to manufacturing to finance to entertainment .
today , for example , over one million people now make their living on ebay , which is astounding .
real disruption ripples out across the market and spawns new businesses .
for me , it 's about taking a new leap forward .
and a leap forward in technological and economic terms .
and this leap forward can achieve so many things when it reaches momentum .
however , it 's important not to confuse disruption in an industry with destruction .
average consumer true disruption prompts an evolution in itself - and one which gives more choice to the average consumer .
for example , when henry ford invented the mass production car , it did n't mean that other ways of travelling would disappear .
it simply meant that people could choose how they wished to travel .
and disruption is not about anarchy either .
setting up a business that gives people something for free is not enough to succeed in the long term .
the free proposition is obviously compelling but it 's actually all about doing something differently .
and doing that ' something ' to alter the status quo and take the industry to a new dimension .
disruption brings forward the process of economic evolution .
the technology platform has to develop alongside this .
and this is what the internet has done and continues to do .
it 's easy to get carried away however .
we need to keep what disruption is capable of in context .
people continue to get excited about new things such as web 2.0 but to me , this is no more than a label .
it 's almost impossible to predict how we will use the internet to communicate with one another in the next five to 10 years and i do n't have a crystal ball .
but my instincts tell me that sharing knowledge is a catalyst behind adoption of a new technology .
the more we can do on the internet and the more it helps us to stay in touch or progress a business idea , the more attractive and useful it will be .

the internet communications industry is probably the most disruptive industry in terms of technology development today .
the industry has grown , for the most part , in line with what people want to do online .
and its growth is driven by a combination of innovation from the companies that are creating the software , and from user experience .
innovation tends to be the catalyst .
however , what people like doing online tells us a lot about how they like communicating and accessing and sharing information with one another .
one of the common denominating factors behind usage is what the technology gives the individual in return for their endeavours .
a technology platform that is based on a solid , intellectual , r & d driven culture has the opportunity to thrive among a hungry community that wants life made easier .
for me , a disruptive technology is only worthwhile if it gives people something they did n't have or could n't do before i 've spent most of my professional life working in the communications industry .
i 've seen many technologies come and go .
the ones that fail tend to be too hard to use and impenetrable to the average consumer .
and they fail because the benefit is often overshadowed by the hype .
many potentially great technologies disappear because , quite simply , they do not give people what they want .
never-ending quest that 's the key to it really .
i am passionate about technology but it is not the never-ending quest to make things smaller , faster , lighter or cheaper that gets me motivated .
the sort of new technology that i think about is n't usually born in a boardroom , a technology campus , the back of a garage or as a result of thousands of marketing focus groups .
it tends to originate from a simple idea that can be easily explained to anyone who is n't interested in how you make the technology work but more importantly , interested in what it does .
skype was first launched in april 2003 what intrigues me in particular , are disruptive technologies .
disruption can come in many guises .
it is at its most powerful when it comes in the form of a software platform that genuinely alters the status quo for the better .
