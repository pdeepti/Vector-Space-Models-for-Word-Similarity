the case has become a thorn in german-turkish relations . turkey 's antalya coast is enormously popular among german and british tourists for its pristine beaches , sporting activities and nightlife . a 17-year-old high school student from the small northern german town of ülzen , identified as marco w. in german media reports , had spent the easter break with his parents at a five-star hotel resort in side . but on april 12 , marco 's holiday turned into a nightmare . turkish police officers arrested him for having sex with a 13-year-old briton , known in german media as charlotte m. the mother of the manchester girl had accused marco of sexually abusing her daughter after he had been invited up to the girl 's hotel room . marco claims charlotte told him she was fifteen and what has emerged in the german media is a portrait of a manipulative 13-year-old deceiving a youth four years her senior . turkey has also been lambasted by the tabloids , commentators and politicians for its treatment of a juvenile .
much has been made of marco 's psychological state and the decrepit conditions of the detention cell , which he has been sharing with 30 other inmates for the past four months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- left -rrb- talked to turkey 's gül about marco german politicians have intervened on marco 's behalf at the highest levels .
chancellor angela merkel made public assurances that she would help marco and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke privately to his turkish counterpart , abdullah gül , who is likely to be elected turkey 's next president at the end of this month .
gül said that he could not interfere with turkey 's independent judiciary . different stories marco claims the two only kissed and engaged in " heavy petting , " consensually .
no sexual intercourse took place , he has said . on aug .
8 , a gynecologist who had examined charlotte said that there was no evidence of assault and the girl was still a virgin .
but there was sexual penetration , insisted charlotte 's lawyer ömer aycan , who told his client 's side of the story in a telephone interview with dw-world.de from antalya . charlotte has claimed that she was asleep in the double room when marco and another boy knocked on the door after midnight .
she asked marco to leave , but he refused and proceeded to force himself on her .
charlotte screamed , alerting other teenagers in the room , and marco fled . " charlotte refused to have sex with marco , so i can use the word rape .
he raped a 13-year-old girl , " said aycan , who added that charlotte 's age was known to the german youth . sexual contact without the use of force is criminal under turkish law when one of the individuals involved is under 15 .
aycan is seeking the maximum conviction , a sentence of fifteen years , although that penalty would be reduced by a third since marco is also a minor . statutory rape laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco is awaiting trial in an antalya prison the case has thrust turkey 's judicial system in the spotlight and reinforced the german perception that the predominantly muslim country is backward in its sexual attitudes , and therefore does not belong in the european union . but legal experts say that turkey has made tremendous strides in bringing its laws in line with eu norms , and the case would have been handled no differently in germany , england or the us . " the mother of the girl charged a young man with child abuse .
the prosecutors had no choice but to arrest marco , " said christian rumpf , an attorney in stuttgart who is an expert on turkish law . in turkey as in germany , any foreigner charged with a crime must remain in detention until cleared of the charges , said rumpf , who does not believe that marco will be easily acquitted . the law governing sex with underage minors , or " statutory rape , " is taken seriously in turkey and other countries .
the legal " age of consent " for sex can range from 14 to 18 years , depending on country or even different regions of the same country .
the law is meant to protect children and adolescents from being coerced by an older individual into having sex , but also applies to sexual activity between teens of similar ages . " where do you draw the line between the normal sexuality of teenagers and protecting a child from sexual abuse ? " asked rumpf . germany would have prosecuted too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kissing is not a felony at any age , but sex is in germany , that line is drawn at age 14 . " kissing is not a felony in germany at any age , if that is all they did .
but sexual contact is illegal in germany when one of them is under 14 , " said heribert ostendorf , a former federal prosecutor who heads the program for juvenile law and crime prevention at the university of kiel . " most people just do n't know the specifics of child-abuse laws in germany and that marco would have also been prosecuted in his own country , " he said , adding that the burden is on marco to prove that he did not know that charlotte was only 13 . " ignorance of the law is no protection from being punished by it , " he said . " there are only victims in this case " the case has resulted in a media circus and charlotte 's family has been hounded by german reporters in manchester .
the girl did not show up for the last hearing because of the publicity glare , according to aycan . " there are only victims in this case - marco , charlotte , and even the turkish justice system , which is facing intense scrutiny from germany , britain and the eu .
the turkish judges are under tremendous pressure and can not afford to make mistakes , " said lale akgün , a turkish-born social democratic parliamentarian in the german bundestag who served for many years as a family and youth counselor for the city of cologne . akgün also believes the case has been damaging for german-turkish relations .
news commentators in turkey were outraged that german politicians tried to influence a matter that belongs in the courts . " the intervention of steinmeier has put even more pressure on the turkish judiciary to prove that it is capable of making independent decisions without being swayed by politics , " she said . parallels in the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's antalya coast is popular among german tourists in the united states , former president jimmy carter and democratic presidential hopeful barack obama unsuccessfully lobbied georgia 's high court to overturn the conviction of genarlow wilson , who is serving a ten-year jail sentence for having oral sex with his girlfriend . the girl never filed charges , but the act was caught on videotape at a new year 's eve party in 2003 , and wound up in the hands of georgia state prosecutors .
in georgia , the age of consent is 16 years of age .
wilson was 17 at the time , but his girlfriend was only 15 .
he was charged and convicted of child molestation . the wilson case has gotten wide publicity in the united states , and many americans are now questioning whether the statutory rape laws that are meant to protect minors go too far . in june , an appeal courts judge called wilson 's prison term " a grave miscarriage of justice , " but the former star athlete still remains behind bars . meanwhile marco 's next trial date in antalya is on september 6 .
the judicial process in this instanced is not unusually long , considering the backlog of cases in turkish courts and the time required to depose witnesses in three different countries , according to christian rumpf . " we need to let the turkish courts do their job and do it right , " said lale akgün .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 25.08.2007 as germany struggles with extremism , calls for new party ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a previous failed attempt , new calls are going out to ban the far-right npd party calls to ban the far-right npd party have resurfaced in germany following a mob attack which left eight indians injured .
in a separate incident , that party 's leader has been charged with incitement of racial hatred . the racially motivated attack on eight indians in the eastern town of mügeln continues to resonate in germany and the leader of the co-ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , spoke out in favor of a starting the process that would ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
but other political leaders and the interior ministry have voiced skepticism .
the npd is an anti-immigrant party that has close links to neo-nazis and is represented in the parliaments of two states in the former communist east germany .
eastern germany has seen disproportionate rates of violence against foreigners since german reunification in 1990 , although incidents have also occurred in western germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the indians injured in the attack in mügeln one of the states is saxony , where the indians were attacked and chased through the town of mügeln by a mob of about 50 germans , following a local festival on august 18 .
a crowd of onlookers did not intervene and it took about 70 police to gain control of the situation .
in another incident last weekend in the western state of rhineland-palatinate , two african men were attacked by a group of right-wing extremists , german media reported on friday .
both men were injured , one seriously .
police had kept the news from the media due to their investigation , officials said .
although the npd was not specifically blamed for the attacks , the party and other extreme-right groups are known to be active in the state and other parts of eastern germany .
racist party the npd has been branded as an ideological breeding ground for neo-nazi aggression , and germany 's domestic security agency says it foments racist violence .
it is also considered anti-semitic .
an attempt by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to ban the npd faltered in 2003 after the federal constitutional court refused to hear the case because the government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer stands guard in mügeln near the pizza parlor where the attack took place the interior ministry said friday that although the party met all the requirements to be outlawed , the intelligence service would have to drop surveillance of it if a new attempt were to be made to ban it .
the ministry did not want to see this happen , a spokesman said .
hans-peter uhl , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said he would be happy to see the party banned .
" but i fear that such an attempt would fail and that would be a disaster , " he said .
green party parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele said the previous failed attempt to ban the npd ended in a propaganda victory for the party , and he feared the same could happen if a new attempt were made .
government inactivity ?
some critics have blamed inactivity by the major political parties for the spread of right-wing activity in the eastern states , where unemployment and dissatisfaction are much higher than in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen has promised to do more to combat right-wing extremism the latest violence has prodded the government into action .
family affairs minister ursula von der leyen announced increased assistance to projects aimed at combating right-wing extremism .
" we do n't want to leave the field open to right-wing extremists , " she said friday after a two-day cabinet conclave in the village of meseberg , 70 kilometers north of berlin .
but the government , and particularly her ministry which is responsible for programs to curb extremism , have come under criticism in the press for allegedly not doing enough .
in an editorial in the daily financial times deutschland , the author wrote : " let me tell you one thing , my dear politicians : when some areas of germany are no longer safe for foreigners , and when you no longer see the state 's duty to protect people from other people as part of your jobs , then i wo n't accept that .
do you understand ?
you are responsible for security in this country . "
during campaigning before their election to the state parliament in mecklenburg-western pomerania last september , npd activists set up youth clubs in neglected rural areas and distributed 15,000 cds with songs by right-wing rock bands in a bid to woo younger voters .
charges filed on friday , police in the eastern city of jena said they had filed charges against udo voigt , the npd 's national leader , for inciting racial hatred .
in a speech last weekend , he had proposed the late rudolf hess , adolf hitler 's former deputy , be awarded the nobel peace prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt -lrb- left -rrb- and the head of another far-right party , the dvu , gerhard frey if convicted , voigt could face up to three years in jail or a fine , police said .
founded in 1964 , the npd had its heyday in the late 60s when it was represented in seven state parliaments and narrowly missed clearing the five-percent threshold for representation in the bundestag , the national parliament .
on a national level , the npd plays an insignificant role .
it won only 1.6 per cent of the vote in the last general election in 2005 .
its current membership is put at around 6,000 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case has become a thorn in german-turkish relations . turkey 's antalya coast is enormously popular among german and british tourists for its pristine beaches , sporting activities and nightlife . a 17-year-old high school student from the small northern german town of ülzen , identified as marco w. in german media reports , had spent the easter break with his parents at a five-star hotel resort in side . but on april 12 , marco 's holiday turned into a nightmare . turkish police officers arrested him for having sex with a 13-year-old briton , known in german media as charlotte m. the mother of the manchester girl had accused marco of sexually abusing her daughter after he had been invited up to the girl 's hotel room . marco claims charlotte told him she was fifteen and what has emerged in the german media is a portrait of a manipulative 13-year-old deceiving a youth four years her senior . turkey has also been lambasted by the tabloids , commentators and politicians for its treatment of a juvenile .
much has been made of marco 's psychological state and the decrepit conditions of the detention cell , which he has been sharing with 30 other inmates for the past four months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- left -rrb- talked to turkey 's gül about marco german politicians have intervened on marco 's behalf at the highest levels .
chancellor angela merkel made public assurances that she would help marco and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke privately to his turkish counterpart , abdullah gül , who is likely to be elected turkey 's next president at the end of this month .
gül said that he could not interfere with turkey 's independent judiciary . different stories marco claims the two only kissed and engaged in " heavy petting , " consensually .
no sexual intercourse took place , he has said . on aug .
8 , a gynecologist who had examined charlotte said that there was no evidence of assault and the girl was still a virgin .
but there was sexual penetration , insisted charlotte 's lawyer ömer aycan , who told his client 's side of the story in a telephone interview with dw-world.de from antalya . charlotte has claimed that she was asleep in the double room when marco and another boy knocked on the door after midnight .
she asked marco to leave , but he refused and proceeded to force himself on her .
charlotte screamed , alerting other teenagers in the room , and marco fled . " charlotte refused to have sex with marco , so i can use the word rape .
he raped a 13-year-old girl , " said aycan , who added that charlotte 's age was known to the german youth . sexual contact without the use of force is criminal under turkish law when one of the individuals involved is under 15 .
aycan is seeking the maximum conviction , a sentence of fifteen years , although that penalty would be reduced by a third since marco is also a minor . statutory rape laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco is awaiting trial in an antalya prison the case has thrust turkey 's judicial system in the spotlight and reinforced the german perception that the predominantly muslim country is backward in its sexual attitudes , and therefore does not belong in the european union . but legal experts say that turkey has made tremendous strides in bringing its laws in line with eu norms , and the case would have been handled no differently in germany , england or the us . " the mother of the girl charged a young man with child abuse .
the prosecutors had no choice but to arrest marco , " said christian rumpf , an attorney in stuttgart who is an expert on turkish law . in turkey as in germany , any foreigner charged with a crime must remain in detention until cleared of the charges , said rumpf , who does not believe that marco will be easily acquitted . the law governing sex with underage minors , or " statutory rape , " is taken seriously in turkey and other countries .
the legal " age of consent " for sex can range from 14 to 18 years , depending on country or even different regions of the same country .
the law is meant to protect children and adolescents from being coerced by an older individual into having sex , but also applies to sexual activity between teens of similar ages . " where do you draw the line between the normal sexuality of teenagers and protecting a child from sexual abuse ? " asked rumpf . germany would have prosecuted too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kissing is not a felony at any age , but sex is in germany , that line is drawn at age 14 . " kissing is not a felony in germany at any age , if that is all they did .
but sexual contact is illegal in germany when one of them is under 14 , " said heribert ostendorf , a former federal prosecutor who heads the program for juvenile law and crime prevention at the university of kiel . " most people just do n't know the specifics of child-abuse laws in germany and that marco would have also been prosecuted in his own country , " he said , adding that the burden is on marco to prove that he did not know that charlotte was only 13 . " ignorance of the law is no protection from being punished by it , " he said . " there are only victims in this case " the case has resulted in a media circus and charlotte 's family has been hounded by german reporters in manchester .
the girl did not show up for the last hearing because of the publicity glare , according to aycan . " there are only victims in this case - marco , charlotte , and even the turkish justice system , which is facing intense scrutiny from germany , britain and the eu .
the turkish judges are under tremendous pressure and can not afford to make mistakes , " said lale akgün , a turkish-born social democratic parliamentarian in the german bundestag who served for many years as a family and youth counselor for the city of cologne . akgün also believes the case has been damaging for german-turkish relations .
news commentators in turkey were outraged that german politicians tried to influence a matter that belongs in the courts .

the judicial process in this instanced is not unusually long , considering the backlog of cases in turkish courts and the time required to depose witnesses in three different countries , according to christian rumpf .

the case has become a thorn in german-turkish relations . turkey 's antalya coast is enormously popular among german and british tourists for its pristine beaches , sporting activities and nightlife . a 17-year-old high school student from the small northern german town of ülzen , identified as marco w. in german media reports , had spent the easter break with his parents at a five-star hotel resort in side . but on april 12 , marco 's holiday turned into a nightmare . turkish police officers arrested him for having sex with a 13-year-old briton , known in german media as charlotte m. the mother of the manchester girl had accused marco of sexually abusing her daughter after he had been invited up to the girl 's hotel room . marco claims charlotte told him she was fifteen and what has emerged in the german media is a portrait of a manipulative 13-year-old deceiving a youth four years her senior . turkey has also been lambasted by the tabloids , commentators and politicians for its treatment of a juvenile .
much has been made of marco 's psychological state and the decrepit conditions of the detention cell , which he has been sharing with 30 other inmates for the past four months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- left -rrb- talked to turkey 's gül about marco german politicians have intervened on marco 's behalf at the highest levels .
chancellor angela merkel made public assurances that she would help marco and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke privately to his turkish counterpart , abdullah gül , who is likely to be elected turkey 's next president at the end of this month .
gül said that he could not interfere with turkey 's independent judiciary . different stories marco claims the two only kissed and engaged in " heavy petting , " consensually .
no sexual intercourse took place , he has said . on aug .
8 , a gynecologist who had examined charlotte said that there was no evidence of assault and the girl was still a virgin .
but there was sexual penetration , insisted charlotte 's lawyer ömer aycan , who told his client 's side of the story in a telephone interview with dw-world.de from antalya . charlotte has claimed that she was asleep in the double room when marco and another boy knocked on the door after midnight .
she asked marco to leave , but he refused and proceeded to force himself on her .
charlotte screamed , alerting other teenagers in the room , and marco fled . " charlotte refused to have sex with marco , so i can use the word rape .
he raped a 13-year-old girl , " said aycan , who added that charlotte 's age was known to the german youth . sexual contact without the use of force is criminal under turkish law when one of the individuals involved is under 15 .
aycan is seeking the maximum conviction , a sentence of fifteen years , although that penalty would be reduced by a third since marco is also a minor . statutory rape laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco is awaiting trial in an antalya prison the case has thrust turkey 's judicial system in the spotlight and reinforced the german perception that the predominantly muslim country is backward in its sexual attitudes , and therefore does not belong in the european union . but legal experts say that turkey has made tremendous strides in bringing its laws in line with eu norms , and the case would have been handled no differently in germany , england or the us . " the mother of the girl charged a young man with child abuse .
the prosecutors had no choice but to arrest marco , " said christian rumpf , an attorney in stuttgart who is an expert on turkish law . in turkey as in germany , any foreigner charged with a crime must remain in detention until cleared of the charges , said rumpf , who does not believe that marco will be easily acquitted . the law governing sex with underage minors , or " statutory rape , " is taken seriously in turkey and other countries .
the legal " age of consent " for sex can range from 14 to 18 years , depending on country or even different regions of the same country .
the law is meant to protect children and adolescents from being coerced by an older individual into having sex , but also applies to sexual activity between teens of similar ages . " where do you draw the line between the normal sexuality of teenagers and protecting a child from sexual abuse ? " asked rumpf . germany would have prosecuted too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kissing is not a felony at any age , but sex is in germany , that line is drawn at age 14 . " kissing is not a felony in germany at any age , if that is all they did .
but sexual contact is illegal in germany when one of them is under 14 , " said heribert ostendorf , a former federal prosecutor who heads the program for juvenile law and crime prevention at the university of kiel . " most people just do n't know the specifics of child-abuse laws in germany and that marco would have also been prosecuted in his own country , " he said , adding that the burden is on marco to prove that he did not know that charlotte was only 13 . " ignorance of the law is no protection from being punished by it , " he said . " there are only victims in this case " the case has resulted in a media circus and charlotte 's family has been hounded by german reporters in manchester .
the girl did not show up for the last hearing because of the publicity glare , according to aycan . " there are only victims in this case - marco , charlotte , and even the turkish justice system , which is facing intense scrutiny from germany , britain and the eu .
the turkish judges are under tremendous pressure and can not afford to make mistakes , " said lale akgün , a turkish-born social democratic parliamentarian in the german bundestag who served for many years as a family and youth counselor for the city of cologne . akgün also believes the case has been damaging for german-turkish relations .
news commentators in turkey were outraged that german politicians tried to influence a matter that belongs in the courts . " the intervention of steinmeier has put even more pressure on the turkish judiciary to prove that it is capable of making independent decisions without being swayed by politics , " she said . parallels in the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's antalya coast is popular among german tourists in the united states , former president jimmy carter and democratic presidential hopeful barack obama unsuccessfully lobbied georgia 's high court to overturn the conviction of genarlow wilson , who is serving a ten-year jail sentence for having oral sex with his girlfriend . the girl never filed charges , but the act was caught on videotape at a new year 's eve party in 2003 , and wound up in the hands of georgia state prosecutors .
in georgia , the age of consent is 16 years of age .
wilson was 17 at the time , but his girlfriend was only 15 .
he was charged and convicted of child molestation . the wilson case has gotten wide publicity in the united states , and many americans are now questioning whether the statutory rape laws that are meant to protect minors go too far . in june , an appeal courts judge called wilson 's prison term " a grave miscarriage of justice , " but the former star athlete still remains behind bars . meanwhile marco 's next trial date in antalya is on september 6 .
the judicial process in this instanced is not unusually long , considering the backlog of cases in turkish courts and the time required to depose witnesses in three different countries , according to christian rumpf .

in a separate incident , that party 's leader has been charged with incitement of racial hatred . the racially motivated attack on eight indians in the eastern town of mügeln continues to resonate in germany and the leader of the co-ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , spoke out in favor of a starting the process that would ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
but other political leaders and the interior ministry have voiced skepticism .
the npd is an anti-immigrant party that has close links to neo-nazis and is represented in the parliaments of two states in the former communist east germany .
eastern germany has seen disproportionate rates of violence against foreigners since german reunification in 1990 , although incidents have also occurred in western germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the indians injured in the attack in mügeln one of the states is saxony , where the indians were attacked and chased through the town of mügeln by a mob of about 50 germans , following a local festival on august 18 .
a crowd of onlookers did not intervene and it took about 70 police to gain control of the situation .
in another incident last weekend in the western state of rhineland-palatinate , two african men were attacked by a group of right-wing extremists , german media reported on friday .
both men were injured , one seriously .
police had kept the news from the media due to their investigation , officials said .
although the npd was not specifically blamed for the attacks , the party and other extreme-right groups are known to be active in the state and other parts of eastern germany .
racist party the npd has been branded as an ideological breeding ground for neo-nazi aggression , and germany 's domestic security agency says it foments racist violence .
it is also considered anti-semitic .
an attempt by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to ban the npd faltered in 2003 after the federal constitutional court refused to hear the case because the government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer stands guard in mügeln near the pizza parlor where the attack took place the interior ministry said friday that although the party met all the requirements to be outlawed , the intelligence service would have to drop surveillance of it if a new attempt were to be made to ban it .
the ministry did not want to see this happen , a spokesman said .
hans-peter uhl , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said he would be happy to see the party banned .
" but i fear that such an attempt would fail and that would be a disaster , " he said .
green party parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele said the previous failed attempt to ban the npd ended in a propaganda victory for the party , and he feared the same could happen if a new attempt were made .
government inactivity ?
some critics have blamed inactivity by the major political parties for the spread of right-wing activity in the eastern states , where unemployment and dissatisfaction are much higher than in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen has promised to do more to combat right-wing extremism the latest violence has prodded the government into action .
family affairs minister ursula von der leyen announced increased assistance to projects aimed at combating right-wing extremism .
" we do n't want to leave the field open to right-wing extremists , " she said friday after a two-day cabinet conclave in the village of meseberg , 70 kilometers north of berlin .
but the government , and particularly her ministry which is responsible for programs to curb extremism , have come under criticism in the press for allegedly not doing enough .
in an editorial in the daily financial times deutschland , the author wrote : " let me tell you one thing , my dear politicians : when some areas of germany are no longer safe for foreigners , and when you no longer see the state 's duty to protect people from other people as part of your jobs , then i wo n't accept that .
do you understand ?
you are responsible for security in this country . "
during campaigning before their election to the state parliament in mecklenburg-western pomerania last september , npd activists set up youth clubs in neglected rural areas and distributed 15,000 cds with songs by right-wing rock bands in a bid to woo younger voters .
charges filed on friday , police in the eastern city of jena said they had filed charges against udo voigt , the npd 's national leader , for inciting racial hatred .
in a speech last weekend , he had proposed the late rudolf hess , adolf hitler 's former deputy , be awarded the nobel peace prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt -lrb- left -rrb- and the head of another far-right party , the dvu , gerhard frey if convicted , voigt could face up to three years in jail or a fine , police said .
founded in 1964 , the npd had its heyday in the late 60s when it was represented in seven state parliaments and narrowly missed clearing the five-percent threshold for representation in the bundestag , the national parliament .
on a national level , the npd plays an insignificant role .
it won only 1.6 per cent of the vote in the last general election in 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 25.08.2007 as germany struggles with extremism , calls for new party ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a previous failed attempt , new calls are going out to ban the far-right npd party calls to ban the far-right npd party have resurfaced in germany following a mob attack which left eight indians injured .
in a separate incident , that party 's leader has been charged with incitement of racial hatred . the racially motivated attack on eight indians in the eastern town of mügeln continues to resonate in germany and the leader of the co-ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , spoke out in favor of a starting the process that would ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
but other political leaders and the interior ministry have voiced skepticism .
the npd is an anti-immigrant party that has close links to neo-nazis and is represented in the parliaments of two states in the former communist east germany .
eastern germany has seen disproportionate rates of violence against foreigners since german reunification in 1990 , although incidents have also occurred in western germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the indians injured in the attack in mügeln one of the states is saxony , where the indians were attacked and chased through the town of mügeln by a mob of about 50 germans , following a local festival on august 18 .
a crowd of onlookers did not intervene and it took about 70 police to gain control of the situation .
in another incident last weekend in the western state of rhineland-palatinate , two african men were attacked by a group of right-wing extremists , german media reported on friday .
both men were injured , one seriously .
police had kept the news from the media due to their investigation , officials said .
although the npd was not specifically blamed for the attacks , the party and other extreme-right groups are known to be active in the state and other parts of eastern germany .
racist party the npd has been branded as an ideological breeding ground for neo-nazi aggression , and germany 's domestic security agency says it foments racist violence .
it is also considered anti-semitic .
an attempt by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to ban the npd faltered in 2003 after the federal constitutional court refused to hear the case because the government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer stands guard in mügeln near the pizza parlor where the attack took place the interior ministry said friday that although the party met all the requirements to be outlawed , the intelligence service would have to drop surveillance of it if a new attempt were to be made to ban it .
the ministry did not want to see this happen , a spokesman said .
hans-peter uhl , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said he would be happy to see the party banned .
" but i fear that such an attempt would fail and that would be a disaster , " he said .
green party parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele said the previous failed attempt to ban the npd ended in a propaganda victory for the party , and he feared the same could happen if a new attempt were made .
government inactivity ?
some critics have blamed inactivity by the major political parties for the spread of right-wing activity in the eastern states , where unemployment and dissatisfaction are much higher than in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen has promised to do more to combat right-wing extremism the latest violence has prodded the government into action .
family affairs minister ursula von der leyen announced increased assistance to projects aimed at combating right-wing extremism .
" we do n't want to leave the field open to right-wing extremists , " she said friday after a two-day cabinet conclave in the village of meseberg , 70 kilometers north of berlin .
but the government , and particularly her ministry which is responsible for programs to curb extremism , have come under criticism in the press for allegedly not doing enough .
in an editorial in the daily financial times deutschland , the author wrote : " let me tell you one thing , my dear politicians : when some areas of germany are no longer safe for foreigners , and when you no longer see the state 's duty to protect people from other people as part of your jobs , then i wo n't accept that .
do you understand ?
you are responsible for security in this country . "
during campaigning before their election to the state parliament in mecklenburg-western pomerania last september , npd activists set up youth clubs in neglected rural areas and distributed 15,000 cds with songs by right-wing rock bands in a bid to woo younger voters .
charges filed on friday , police in the eastern city of jena said they had filed charges against udo voigt , the npd 's national leader , for inciting racial hatred .
in a speech last weekend , he had proposed the late rudolf hess , adolf hitler 's former deputy , be awarded the nobel peace prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt -lrb- left -rrb- and the head of another far-right party , the dvu , gerhard frey if convicted , voigt could face up to three years in jail or a fine , police said .
founded in 1964 , the npd had its heyday in the late 60s when it was represented in seven state parliaments and narrowly missed clearing the five-percent threshold for representation in the bundestag , the national parliament .

but the 67 year-old berliner has no problem defending herself . she 's well armed and has a whole host of magic tricks she can fall back on . " two worlds " is her favorite computer game .
she plays for about two hours every day and says computer and online games are now her main hobby .

these two women of a certain age have been playing against each other for a year but have only just met in person for the first time . market woos silver surfers inge and karin are just two members of the newly discovered market known as " silver surfers . " younger visitors to this year 's games convention are finding they 're increasingly having to share the consoles with grey-haired figures also eager to check out what 's new .
the oldest convention visitor is 86 and the market for interactive games software now has the new consumer group squarely in its sights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surfing is n't just for kids according to the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin , people over 65 make up 16 percent of the population in germany and account for 30 percent of purchasing power . in a special report on the silver surfers , the european interactive advertising agency reveals that a quarter of the 55 plus generation surf the internet regularly . on average they 're online seven hours a week . the oldies are also turning to the world of virtual games in increasing numbers . " the market 's booming , " said eva steinhorst of gameduell , germany 's biggest internet games portal , which has with five million registered players . " in the last 12 months alone , we 've registered an increase of more than 100 percent among the 50-plus group , " she said . whereas for younger players entertainment is the main attraction , silver surfers are often more interested in games that can provide memory training or keep their manual skills and reflexes up to speed .
the results of a gameduell user poll in july 2007 show that " women are more interested in games using logic , while men prefer action or general knowledge games , " said steinhorst . little interest in shoot- ' em-up games what 's important for this market is that " the games should be easy to learn or players should already be familiar with them , like solitaire , " steinhorst said .
" otherwise elderly users are put off . " prices are often considered too high .
hardly anyone 's prepared to spend 30 to 50 euros -lrb- $ 40 to $ 67 -rrb- on a single cd-rom .

" we 've tested history games like the napoleonic wars " says bewilogua . " older users were delighted . " but there 's no market for war games or shoot- ' em-ups .
" they bring back bad memories for the war and post-war generations " bewilogua explains . but " galilea03 , " alias karin martin , disagrees .
she 's an ace at shooting down moorhens and sinking pirate ships , and she 's come to leipzig to see what else is on offer . together with her silver-haired friend inge , alias " mecki , " she 'll be spending nearly the whole time till the fair closes on sunday at the consoles . and their husbands ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 25.08.2007 teen sex case puts turkey 's judicial system in spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco thought the british girl was 15 teenagers are rarely prosecuted for having sex , but a 13-year-old british girl has managed to put a 17-year old-german boy behind bars in turkey .
the case has become a thorn in german-turkish relations . turkey 's antalya coast is enormously popular among german and british tourists for its pristine beaches , sporting activities and nightlife . a 17-year-old high school student from the small northern german town of ülzen , identified as marco w. in german media reports , had spent the easter break with his parents at a five-star hotel resort in side . but on april 12 , marco 's holiday turned into a nightmare . turkish police officers arrested him for having sex with a 13-year-old briton , known in german media as charlotte m. the mother of the manchester girl had accused marco of sexually abusing her daughter after he had been invited up to the girl 's hotel room . marco claims charlotte told him she was fifteen and what has emerged in the german media is a portrait of a manipulative 13-year-old deceiving a youth four years her senior . turkey has also been lambasted by the tabloids , commentators and politicians for its treatment of a juvenile .
much has been made of marco 's psychological state and the decrepit conditions of the detention cell , which he has been sharing with 30 other inmates for the past four months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- left -rrb- talked to turkey 's gül about marco german politicians have intervened on marco 's behalf at the highest levels .
chancellor angela merkel made public assurances that she would help marco and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke privately to his turkish counterpart , abdullah gül , who is likely to be elected turkey 's next president at the end of this month .
gül said that he could not interfere with turkey 's independent judiciary . different stories marco claims the two only kissed and engaged in " heavy petting , " consensually .
no sexual intercourse took place , he has said . on aug .
8 , a gynecologist who had examined charlotte said that there was no evidence of assault and the girl was still a virgin .
but there was sexual penetration , insisted charlotte 's lawyer ömer aycan , who told his client 's side of the story in a telephone interview with dw-world.de from antalya . charlotte has claimed that she was asleep in the double room when marco and another boy knocked on the door after midnight .
she asked marco to leave , but he refused and proceeded to force himself on her .
charlotte screamed , alerting other teenagers in the room , and marco fled . " charlotte refused to have sex with marco , so i can use the word rape .
he raped a 13-year-old girl , " said aycan , who added that charlotte 's age was known to the german youth . sexual contact without the use of force is criminal under turkish law when one of the individuals involved is under 15 .
aycan is seeking the maximum conviction , a sentence of fifteen years , although that penalty would be reduced by a third since marco is also a minor . statutory rape laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco is awaiting trial in an antalya prison the case has thrust turkey 's judicial system in the spotlight and reinforced the german perception that the predominantly muslim country is backward in its sexual attitudes , and therefore does not belong in the european union . but legal experts say that turkey has made tremendous strides in bringing its laws in line with eu norms , and the case would have been handled no differently in germany , england or the us . " the mother of the girl charged a young man with child abuse .
the prosecutors had no choice but to arrest marco , " said christian rumpf , an attorney in stuttgart who is an expert on turkish law . in turkey as in germany , any foreigner charged with a crime must remain in detention until cleared of the charges , said rumpf , who does not believe that marco will be easily acquitted . the law governing sex with underage minors , or " statutory rape , " is taken seriously in turkey and other countries .
the legal " age of consent " for sex can range from 14 to 18 years , depending on country or even different regions of the same country .
the law is meant to protect children and adolescents from being coerced by an older individual into having sex , but also applies to sexual activity between teens of similar ages . " where do you draw the line between the normal sexuality of teenagers and protecting a child from sexual abuse ? " asked rumpf . germany would have prosecuted too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kissing is not a felony at any age , but sex is in germany , that line is drawn at age 14 . " kissing is not a felony in germany at any age , if that is all they did .
but sexual contact is illegal in germany when one of them is under 14 , " said heribert ostendorf , a former federal prosecutor who heads the program for juvenile law and crime prevention at the university of kiel . " most people just do n't know the specifics of child-abuse laws in germany and that marco would have also been prosecuted in his own country , " he said , adding that the burden is on marco to prove that he did not know that charlotte was only 13 . " ignorance of the law is no protection from being punished by it , " he said . " there are only victims in this case " the case has resulted in a media circus and charlotte 's family has been hounded by german reporters in manchester .
the girl did not show up for the last hearing because of the publicity glare , according to aycan . " there are only victims in this case - marco , charlotte , and even the turkish justice system , which is facing intense scrutiny from germany , britain and the eu .

the case has become a thorn in german-turkish relations . turkey 's antalya coast is enormously popular among german and british tourists for its pristine beaches , sporting activities and nightlife . a 17-year-old high school student from the small northern german town of ülzen , identified as marco w. in german media reports , had spent the easter break with his parents at a five-star hotel resort in side . but on april 12 , marco 's holiday turned into a nightmare . turkish police officers arrested him for having sex with a 13-year-old briton , known in german media as charlotte m. the mother of the manchester girl had accused marco of sexually abusing her daughter after he had been invited up to the girl 's hotel room . marco claims charlotte told him she was fifteen and what has emerged in the german media is a portrait of a manipulative 13-year-old deceiving a youth four years her senior . turkey has also been lambasted by the tabloids , commentators and politicians for its treatment of a juvenile .
much has been made of marco 's psychological state and the decrepit conditions of the detention cell , which he has been sharing with 30 other inmates for the past four months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- left -rrb- talked to turkey 's gül about marco german politicians have intervened on marco 's behalf at the highest levels .
chancellor angela merkel made public assurances that she would help marco and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke privately to his turkish counterpart , abdullah gül , who is likely to be elected turkey 's next president at the end of this month .
gül said that he could not interfere with turkey 's independent judiciary . different stories marco claims the two only kissed and engaged in " heavy petting , " consensually .
no sexual intercourse took place , he has said . on aug .
8 , a gynecologist who had examined charlotte said that there was no evidence of assault and the girl was still a virgin .
but there was sexual penetration , insisted charlotte 's lawyer ömer aycan , who told his client 's side of the story in a telephone interview with dw-world.de from antalya . charlotte has claimed that she was asleep in the double room when marco and another boy knocked on the door after midnight .
she asked marco to leave , but he refused and proceeded to force himself on her .
charlotte screamed , alerting other teenagers in the room , and marco fled . " charlotte refused to have sex with marco , so i can use the word rape .
he raped a 13-year-old girl , " said aycan , who added that charlotte 's age was known to the german youth . sexual contact without the use of force is criminal under turkish law when one of the individuals involved is under 15 .
aycan is seeking the maximum conviction , a sentence of fifteen years , although that penalty would be reduced by a third since marco is also a minor . statutory rape laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco is awaiting trial in an antalya prison the case has thrust turkey 's judicial system in the spotlight and reinforced the german perception that the predominantly muslim country is backward in its sexual attitudes , and therefore does not belong in the european union . but legal experts say that turkey has made tremendous strides in bringing its laws in line with eu norms , and the case would have been handled no differently in germany , england or the us . " the mother of the girl charged a young man with child abuse .
the prosecutors had no choice but to arrest marco , " said christian rumpf , an attorney in stuttgart who is an expert on turkish law . in turkey as in germany , any foreigner charged with a crime must remain in detention until cleared of the charges , said rumpf , who does not believe that marco will be easily acquitted . the law governing sex with underage minors , or " statutory rape , " is taken seriously in turkey and other countries .
the legal " age of consent " for sex can range from 14 to 18 years , depending on country or even different regions of the same country .
the law is meant to protect children and adolescents from being coerced by an older individual into having sex , but also applies to sexual activity between teens of similar ages . " where do you draw the line between the normal sexuality of teenagers and protecting a child from sexual abuse ? " asked rumpf . germany would have prosecuted too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kissing is not a felony at any age , but sex is in germany , that line is drawn at age 14 . " kissing is not a felony in germany at any age , if that is all they did .
but sexual contact is illegal in germany when one of them is under 14 , " said heribert ostendorf , a former federal prosecutor who heads the program for juvenile law and crime prevention at the university of kiel . " most people just do n't know the specifics of child-abuse laws in germany and that marco would have also been prosecuted in his own country , " he said , adding that the burden is on marco to prove that he did not know that charlotte was only 13 . " ignorance of the law is no protection from being punished by it , " he said . " there are only victims in this case " the case has resulted in a media circus and charlotte 's family has been hounded by german reporters in manchester .
the girl did not show up for the last hearing because of the publicity glare , according to aycan . " there are only victims in this case - marco , charlotte , and even the turkish justice system , which is facing intense scrutiny from germany , britain and the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 25.08.2007 as germany struggles with extremism , calls for new party ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a previous failed attempt , new calls are going out to ban the far-right npd party calls to ban the far-right npd party have resurfaced in germany following a mob attack which left eight indians injured .
in a separate incident , that party 's leader has been charged with incitement of racial hatred . the racially motivated attack on eight indians in the eastern town of mügeln continues to resonate in germany and the leader of the co-ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , spoke out in favor of a starting the process that would ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
but other political leaders and the interior ministry have voiced skepticism .
the npd is an anti-immigrant party that has close links to neo-nazis and is represented in the parliaments of two states in the former communist east germany .
eastern germany has seen disproportionate rates of violence against foreigners since german reunification in 1990 , although incidents have also occurred in western germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the indians injured in the attack in mügeln one of the states is saxony , where the indians were attacked and chased through the town of mügeln by a mob of about 50 germans , following a local festival on august 18 .
a crowd of onlookers did not intervene and it took about 70 police to gain control of the situation .
in another incident last weekend in the western state of rhineland-palatinate , two african men were attacked by a group of right-wing extremists , german media reported on friday .
both men were injured , one seriously .
police had kept the news from the media due to their investigation , officials said .
although the npd was not specifically blamed for the attacks , the party and other extreme-right groups are known to be active in the state and other parts of eastern germany .
racist party the npd has been branded as an ideological breeding ground for neo-nazi aggression , and germany 's domestic security agency says it foments racist violence .
it is also considered anti-semitic .
an attempt by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to ban the npd faltered in 2003 after the federal constitutional court refused to hear the case because the government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer stands guard in mügeln near the pizza parlor where the attack took place the interior ministry said friday that although the party met all the requirements to be outlawed , the intelligence service would have to drop surveillance of it if a new attempt were to be made to ban it .
the ministry did not want to see this happen , a spokesman said .
hans-peter uhl , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said he would be happy to see the party banned .
" but i fear that such an attempt would fail and that would be a disaster , " he said .
green party parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele said the previous failed attempt to ban the npd ended in a propaganda victory for the party , and he feared the same could happen if a new attempt were made .
government inactivity ?
some critics have blamed inactivity by the major political parties for the spread of right-wing activity in the eastern states , where unemployment and dissatisfaction are much higher than in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen has promised to do more to combat right-wing extremism the latest violence has prodded the government into action .
family affairs minister ursula von der leyen announced increased assistance to projects aimed at combating right-wing extremism .
" we do n't want to leave the field open to right-wing extremists , " she said friday after a two-day cabinet conclave in the village of meseberg , 70 kilometers north of berlin .
but the government , and particularly her ministry which is responsible for programs to curb extremism , have come under criticism in the press for allegedly not doing enough .
in an editorial in the daily financial times deutschland , the author wrote : " let me tell you one thing , my dear politicians : when some areas of germany are no longer safe for foreigners , and when you no longer see the state 's duty to protect people from other people as part of your jobs , then i wo n't accept that .
do you understand ?
you are responsible for security in this country . "
during campaigning before their election to the state parliament in mecklenburg-western pomerania last september , npd activists set up youth clubs in neglected rural areas and distributed 15,000 cds with songs by right-wing rock bands in a bid to woo younger voters .
charges filed on friday , police in the eastern city of jena said they had filed charges against udo voigt , the npd 's national leader , for inciting racial hatred .
in a speech last weekend , he had proposed the late rudolf hess , adolf hitler 's former deputy , be awarded the nobel peace prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt -lrb- left -rrb- and the head of another far-right party , the dvu , gerhard frey if convicted , voigt could face up to three years in jail or a fine , police said .
founded in 1964 , the npd had its heyday in the late 60s when it was represented in seven state parliaments and narrowly missed clearing the five-percent threshold for representation in the bundestag , the national parliament .
on a national level , the npd plays an insignificant role .
it won only 1.6 per cent of the vote in the last general election in 2005 .
its current membership is put at around 6,000 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case has become a thorn in german-turkish relations . turkey 's antalya coast is enormously popular among german and british tourists for its pristine beaches , sporting activities and nightlife . a 17-year-old high school student from the small northern german town of ülzen , identified as marco w. in german media reports , had spent the easter break with his parents at a five-star hotel resort in side . but on april 12 , marco 's holiday turned into a nightmare . turkish police officers arrested him for having sex with a 13-year-old briton , known in german media as charlotte m. the mother of the manchester girl had accused marco of sexually abusing her daughter after he had been invited up to the girl 's hotel room . marco claims charlotte told him she was fifteen and what has emerged in the german media is a portrait of a manipulative 13-year-old deceiving a youth four years her senior . turkey has also been lambasted by the tabloids , commentators and politicians for its treatment of a juvenile .
much has been made of marco 's psychological state and the decrepit conditions of the detention cell , which he has been sharing with 30 other inmates for the past four months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- left -rrb- talked to turkey 's gül about marco german politicians have intervened on marco 's behalf at the highest levels .
chancellor angela merkel made public assurances that she would help marco and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke privately to his turkish counterpart , abdullah gül , who is likely to be elected turkey 's next president at the end of this month .
gül said that he could not interfere with turkey 's independent judiciary . different stories marco claims the two only kissed and engaged in " heavy petting , " consensually .
no sexual intercourse took place , he has said . on aug .
8 , a gynecologist who had examined charlotte said that there was no evidence of assault and the girl was still a virgin .
but there was sexual penetration , insisted charlotte 's lawyer ömer aycan , who told his client 's side of the story in a telephone interview with dw-world.de from antalya . charlotte has claimed that she was asleep in the double room when marco and another boy knocked on the door after midnight .
she asked marco to leave , but he refused and proceeded to force himself on her .
charlotte screamed , alerting other teenagers in the room , and marco fled . " charlotte refused to have sex with marco , so i can use the word rape .
he raped a 13-year-old girl , " said aycan , who added that charlotte 's age was known to the german youth . sexual contact without the use of force is criminal under turkish law when one of the individuals involved is under 15 .
aycan is seeking the maximum conviction , a sentence of fifteen years , although that penalty would be reduced by a third since marco is also a minor . statutory rape laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco is awaiting trial in an antalya prison the case has thrust turkey 's judicial system in the spotlight and reinforced the german perception that the predominantly muslim country is backward in its sexual attitudes , and therefore does not belong in the european union . but legal experts say that turkey has made tremendous strides in bringing its laws in line with eu norms , and the case would have been handled no differently in germany , england or the us . " the mother of the girl charged a young man with child abuse .
the prosecutors had no choice but to arrest marco , " said christian rumpf , an attorney in stuttgart who is an expert on turkish law . in turkey as in germany , any foreigner charged with a crime must remain in detention until cleared of the charges , said rumpf , who does not believe that marco will be easily acquitted . the law governing sex with underage minors , or " statutory rape , " is taken seriously in turkey and other countries .
the legal " age of consent " for sex can range from 14 to 18 years , depending on country or even different regions of the same country .
the law is meant to protect children and adolescents from being coerced by an older individual into having sex , but also applies to sexual activity between teens of similar ages . " where do you draw the line between the normal sexuality of teenagers and protecting a child from sexual abuse ? " asked rumpf . germany would have prosecuted too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kissing is not a felony at any age , but sex is in germany , that line is drawn at age 14 . " kissing is not a felony in germany at any age , if that is all they did .
but sexual contact is illegal in germany when one of them is under 14 , " said heribert ostendorf , a former federal prosecutor who heads the program for juvenile law and crime prevention at the university of kiel . " most people just do n't know the specifics of child-abuse laws in germany and that marco would have also been prosecuted in his own country , " he said , adding that the burden is on marco to prove that he did not know that charlotte was only 13 . " ignorance of the law is no protection from being punished by it , " he said . " there are only victims in this case " the case has resulted in a media circus and charlotte 's family has been hounded by german reporters in manchester .
the girl did not show up for the last hearing because of the publicity glare , according to aycan . " there are only victims in this case - marco , charlotte , and even the turkish justice system , which is facing intense scrutiny from germany , britain and the eu .
the turkish judges are under tremendous pressure and can not afford to make mistakes , " said lale akgün , a turkish-born social democratic parliamentarian in the german bundestag who served for many years as a family and youth counselor for the city of cologne . akgün also believes the case has been damaging for german-turkish relations .
news commentators in turkey were outraged that german politicians tried to influence a matter that belongs in the courts . " the intervention of steinmeier has put even more pressure on the turkish judiciary to prove that it is capable of making independent decisions without being swayed by politics , " she said . parallels in the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's antalya coast is popular among german tourists in the united states , former president jimmy carter and democratic presidential hopeful barack obama unsuccessfully lobbied georgia 's high court to overturn the conviction of genarlow wilson , who is serving a ten-year jail sentence for having oral sex with his girlfriend . the girl never filed charges , but the act was caught on videotape at a new year 's eve party in 2003 , and wound up in the hands of georgia state prosecutors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 25.08.2007 as germany struggles with extremism , calls for new party ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a previous failed attempt , new calls are going out to ban the far-right npd party calls to ban the far-right npd party have resurfaced in germany following a mob attack which left eight indians injured .
in a separate incident , that party 's leader has been charged with incitement of racial hatred . the racially motivated attack on eight indians in the eastern town of mügeln continues to resonate in germany and the leader of the co-ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , spoke out in favor of a starting the process that would ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
but other political leaders and the interior ministry have voiced skepticism .
the npd is an anti-immigrant party that has close links to neo-nazis and is represented in the parliaments of two states in the former communist east germany .
eastern germany has seen disproportionate rates of violence against foreigners since german reunification in 1990 , although incidents have also occurred in western germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the indians injured in the attack in mügeln one of the states is saxony , where the indians were attacked and chased through the town of mügeln by a mob of about 50 germans , following a local festival on august 18 .
a crowd of onlookers did not intervene and it took about 70 police to gain control of the situation .
in another incident last weekend in the western state of rhineland-palatinate , two african men were attacked by a group of right-wing extremists , german media reported on friday .
both men were injured , one seriously .
police had kept the news from the media due to their investigation , officials said .
although the npd was not specifically blamed for the attacks , the party and other extreme-right groups are known to be active in the state and other parts of eastern germany .
racist party the npd has been branded as an ideological breeding ground for neo-nazi aggression , and germany 's domestic security agency says it foments racist violence .
it is also considered anti-semitic .
an attempt by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to ban the npd faltered in 2003 after the federal constitutional court refused to hear the case because the government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer stands guard in mügeln near the pizza parlor where the attack took place the interior ministry said friday that although the party met all the requirements to be outlawed , the intelligence service would have to drop surveillance of it if a new attempt were to be made to ban it .
the ministry did not want to see this happen , a spokesman said .
hans-peter uhl , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said he would be happy to see the party banned .
" but i fear that such an attempt would fail and that would be a disaster , " he said .
green party parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele said the previous failed attempt to ban the npd ended in a propaganda victory for the party , and he feared the same could happen if a new attempt were made .
government inactivity ?
some critics have blamed inactivity by the major political parties for the spread of right-wing activity in the eastern states , where unemployment and dissatisfaction are much higher than in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen has promised to do more to combat right-wing extremism the latest violence has prodded the government into action .
family affairs minister ursula von der leyen announced increased assistance to projects aimed at combating right-wing extremism .
" we do n't want to leave the field open to right-wing extremists , " she said friday after a two-day cabinet conclave in the village of meseberg , 70 kilometers north of berlin .
but the government , and particularly her ministry which is responsible for programs to curb extremism , have come under criticism in the press for allegedly not doing enough .
in an editorial in the daily financial times deutschland , the author wrote : " let me tell you one thing , my dear politicians : when some areas of germany are no longer safe for foreigners , and when you no longer see the state 's duty to protect people from other people as part of your jobs , then i wo n't accept that .
do you understand ?
you are responsible for security in this country . "
during campaigning before their election to the state parliament in mecklenburg-western pomerania last september , npd activists set up youth clubs in neglected rural areas and distributed 15,000 cds with songs by right-wing rock bands in a bid to woo younger voters .
charges filed on friday , police in the eastern city of jena said they had filed charges against udo voigt , the npd 's national leader , for inciting racial hatred .
in a speech last weekend , he had proposed the late rudolf hess , adolf hitler 's former deputy , be awarded the nobel peace prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt -lrb- left -rrb- and the head of another far-right party , the dvu , gerhard frey if convicted , voigt could face up to three years in jail or a fine , police said .
founded in 1964 , the npd had its heyday in the late 60s when it was represented in seven state parliaments and narrowly missed clearing the five-percent threshold for representation in the bundestag , the national parliament .
on a national level , the npd plays an insignificant role .
it won only 1.6 per cent of the vote in the last general election in 2005 .
its current membership is put at around 6,000 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 25.08.2007 as germany struggles with extremism , calls for new party ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a previous failed attempt , new calls are going out to ban the far-right npd party calls to ban the far-right npd party have resurfaced in germany following a mob attack which left eight indians injured .
in a separate incident , that party 's leader has been charged with incitement of racial hatred . the racially motivated attack on eight indians in the eastern town of mügeln continues to resonate in germany and the leader of the co-ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , spoke out in favor of a starting the process that would ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
but other political leaders and the interior ministry have voiced skepticism .
the npd is an anti-immigrant party that has close links to neo-nazis and is represented in the parliaments of two states in the former communist east germany .
eastern germany has seen disproportionate rates of violence against foreigners since german reunification in 1990 , although incidents have also occurred in western germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the indians injured in the attack in mügeln one of the states is saxony , where the indians were attacked and chased through the town of mügeln by a mob of about 50 germans , following a local festival on august 18 .
a crowd of onlookers did not intervene and it took about 70 police to gain control of the situation .
in another incident last weekend in the western state of rhineland-palatinate , two african men were attacked by a group of right-wing extremists , german media reported on friday .
both men were injured , one seriously .
police had kept the news from the media due to their investigation , officials said .
although the npd was not specifically blamed for the attacks , the party and other extreme-right groups are known to be active in the state and other parts of eastern germany .
racist party the npd has been branded as an ideological breeding ground for neo-nazi aggression , and germany 's domestic security agency says it foments racist violence .
it is also considered anti-semitic .
an attempt by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to ban the npd faltered in 2003 after the federal constitutional court refused to hear the case because the government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer stands guard in mügeln near the pizza parlor where the attack took place the interior ministry said friday that although the party met all the requirements to be outlawed , the intelligence service would have to drop surveillance of it if a new attempt were to be made to ban it .
the ministry did not want to see this happen , a spokesman said .
hans-peter uhl , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said he would be happy to see the party banned .
" but i fear that such an attempt would fail and that would be a disaster , " he said .
green party parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele said the previous failed attempt to ban the npd ended in a propaganda victory for the party , and he feared the same could happen if a new attempt were made .
government inactivity ?
some critics have blamed inactivity by the major political parties for the spread of right-wing activity in the eastern states , where unemployment and dissatisfaction are much higher than in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen has promised to do more to combat right-wing extremism the latest violence has prodded the government into action .
family affairs minister ursula von der leyen announced increased assistance to projects aimed at combating right-wing extremism .
" we do n't want to leave the field open to right-wing extremists , " she said friday after a two-day cabinet conclave in the village of meseberg , 70 kilometers north of berlin .
but the government , and particularly her ministry which is responsible for programs to curb extremism , have come under criticism in the press for allegedly not doing enough .
in an editorial in the daily financial times deutschland , the author wrote : " let me tell you one thing , my dear politicians : when some areas of germany are no longer safe for foreigners , and when you no longer see the state 's duty to protect people from other people as part of your jobs , then i wo n't accept that .
do you understand ?
you are responsible for security in this country . "
during campaigning before their election to the state parliament in mecklenburg-western pomerania last september , npd activists set up youth clubs in neglected rural areas and distributed 15,000 cds with songs by right-wing rock bands in a bid to woo younger voters .
charges filed on friday , police in the eastern city of jena said they had filed charges against udo voigt , the npd 's national leader , for inciting racial hatred .
in a speech last weekend , he had proposed the late rudolf hess , adolf hitler 's former deputy , be awarded the nobel peace prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt -lrb- left -rrb- and the head of another far-right party , the dvu , gerhard frey if convicted , voigt could face up to three years in jail or a fine , police said .
founded in 1964 , the npd had its heyday in the late 60s when it was represented in seven state parliaments and narrowly missed clearing the five-percent threshold for representation in the bundestag , the national parliament .
on a national level , the npd plays an insignificant role .
it won only 1.6 per cent of the vote in the last general election in 2005 .
its current membership is put at around 6,000 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the 67 year-old berliner has no problem defending herself . she 's well armed and has a whole host of magic tricks she can fall back on . " two worlds " is her favorite computer game .
she plays for about two hours every day and says computer and online games are now her main hobby . " the graphics are excellent and it 's great to be able to make the figures do what i want , " she enthuses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " silver surfer " karin martin has her own webcam too karin is visiting the games convention in leipzig with her friend , 64-year-old inge rappold , whom she got to know through the internet while playing solitaire .
these two women of a certain age have been playing against each other for a year but have only just met in person for the first time . market woos silver surfers inge and karin are just two members of the newly discovered market known as " silver surfers . " younger visitors to this year 's games convention are finding they 're increasingly having to share the consoles with grey-haired figures also eager to check out what 's new .
the oldest convention visitor is 86 and the market for interactive games software now has the new consumer group squarely in its sights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surfing is n't just for kids according to the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin , people over 65 make up 16 percent of the population in germany and account for 30 percent of purchasing power . in a special report on the silver surfers , the european interactive advertising agency reveals that a quarter of the 55 plus generation surf the internet regularly . on average they 're online seven hours a week . the oldies are also turning to the world of virtual games in increasing numbers . " the market 's booming , " said eva steinhorst of gameduell , germany 's biggest internet games portal , which has with five million registered players . " in the last 12 months alone , we 've registered an increase of more than 100 percent among the 50-plus group , " she said . whereas for younger players entertainment is the main attraction , silver surfers are often more interested in games that can provide memory training or keep their manual skills and reflexes up to speed .
the results of a gameduell user poll in july 2007 show that " women are more interested in games using logic , while men prefer action or general knowledge games , " said steinhorst . little interest in shoot- ' em-up games what 's important for this market is that " the games should be easy to learn or players should already be familiar with them , like solitaire , " steinhorst said .
" otherwise elderly users are put off . " prices are often considered too high .
hardly anyone 's prepared to spend 30 to 50 euros -lrb- $ 40 to $ 67 -rrb- on a single cd-rom . " glitzy packaging with not much inside does n't attract elderly users either " said jürgen bewilogua from the " elderly in the net " project in leipzig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lara croft still has more young fans he carried out a study into how senior citizens benefit from computer games . " motor skills can be trained with a mouse and there are many strategy and role-playing games which are good for mental fitness , " he says . so-called edutainment software is also interesting for older users .
" we 've tested history games like the napoleonic wars " says bewilogua . " older users were delighted . " but there 's no market for war games or shoot- ' em-ups .
" they bring back bad memories for the war and post-war generations " bewilogua explains . but " galilea03 , " alias karin martin , disagrees .
she 's an ace at shooting down moorhens and sinking pirate ships , and she 's come to leipzig to see what else is on offer . together with her silver-haired friend inge , alias " mecki , " she 'll be spending nearly the whole time till the fair closes on sunday at the consoles . and their husbands ? " they 've stayed at home " says karin " they 'll find something to do together but it wo n't be playing computer games .

but the 67 year-old berliner has no problem defending herself . she 's well armed and has a whole host of magic tricks she can fall back on . " two worlds " is her favorite computer game .
she plays for about two hours every day and says computer and online games are now her main hobby .

these two women of a certain age have been playing against each other for a year but have only just met in person for the first time . market woos silver surfers inge and karin are just two members of the newly discovered market known as " silver surfers . " younger visitors to this year 's games convention are finding they 're increasingly having to share the consoles with grey-haired figures also eager to check out what 's new .
the oldest convention visitor is 86 and the market for interactive games software now has the new consumer group squarely in its sights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surfing is n't just for kids according to the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin , people over 65 make up 16 percent of the population in germany and account for 30 percent of purchasing power . in a special report on the silver surfers , the european interactive advertising agency reveals that a quarter of the 55 plus generation surf the internet regularly . on average they 're online seven hours a week . the oldies are also turning to the world of virtual games in increasing numbers . " the market 's booming , " said eva steinhorst of gameduell , germany 's biggest internet games portal , which has with five million registered players . " in the last 12 months alone , we 've registered an increase of more than 100 percent among the 50-plus group , " she said . whereas for younger players entertainment is the main attraction , silver surfers are often more interested in games that can provide memory training or keep their manual skills and reflexes up to speed .
the results of a gameduell user poll in july 2007 show that " women are more interested in games using logic , while men prefer action or general knowledge games , " said steinhorst . little interest in shoot- ' em-up games what 's important for this market is that " the games should be easy to learn or players should already be familiar with them , like solitaire , " steinhorst said .
" otherwise elderly users are put off . " prices are often considered too high .
hardly anyone 's prepared to spend 30 to 50 euros -lrb- $ 40 to $ 67 -rrb- on a single cd-rom .

" motor skills can be trained with a mouse and there are many strategy and role-playing games which are good for mental fitness , " he says . so-called edutainment software is also interesting for older users .
" we 've tested history games like the napoleonic wars " says bewilogua . " older users were delighted . " but there 's no market for war games or shoot- ' em-ups .
" they bring back bad memories for the war and post-war generations " bewilogua explains . but " galilea03 , " alias karin martin , disagrees .
she 's an ace at shooting down moorhens and sinking pirate ships , and she 's come to leipzig to see what else is on offer . together with her silver-haired friend inge , alias " mecki , " she 'll be spending nearly the whole time till the fair closes on sunday at the consoles . and their husbands ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 25.08.2007 teen sex case puts turkey 's judicial system in spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco thought the british girl was 15 teenagers are rarely prosecuted for having sex , but a 13-year-old british girl has managed to put a 17-year old-german boy behind bars in turkey .
the case has become a thorn in german-turkish relations . turkey 's antalya coast is enormously popular among german and british tourists for its pristine beaches , sporting activities and nightlife . a 17-year-old high school student from the small northern german town of ülzen , identified as marco w. in german media reports , had spent the easter break with his parents at a five-star hotel resort in side . but on april 12 , marco 's holiday turned into a nightmare . turkish police officers arrested him for having sex with a 13-year-old briton , known in german media as charlotte m. the mother of the manchester girl had accused marco of sexually abusing her daughter after he had been invited up to the girl 's hotel room . marco claims charlotte told him she was fifteen and what has emerged in the german media is a portrait of a manipulative 13-year-old deceiving a youth four years her senior . turkey has also been lambasted by the tabloids , commentators and politicians for its treatment of a juvenile .
much has been made of marco 's psychological state and the decrepit conditions of the detention cell , which he has been sharing with 30 other inmates for the past four months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- left -rrb- talked to turkey 's gül about marco german politicians have intervened on marco 's behalf at the highest levels .
chancellor angela merkel made public assurances that she would help marco and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke privately to his turkish counterpart , abdullah gül , who is likely to be elected turkey 's next president at the end of this month .
gül said that he could not interfere with turkey 's independent judiciary . different stories marco claims the two only kissed and engaged in " heavy petting , " consensually .
no sexual intercourse took place , he has said . on aug .
8 , a gynecologist who had examined charlotte said that there was no evidence of assault and the girl was still a virgin .
but there was sexual penetration , insisted charlotte 's lawyer ömer aycan , who told his client 's side of the story in a telephone interview with dw-world.de from antalya . charlotte has claimed that she was asleep in the double room when marco and another boy knocked on the door after midnight .
she asked marco to leave , but he refused and proceeded to force himself on her .
charlotte screamed , alerting other teenagers in the room , and marco fled . " charlotte refused to have sex with marco , so i can use the word rape .
he raped a 13-year-old girl , " said aycan , who added that charlotte 's age was known to the german youth . sexual contact without the use of force is criminal under turkish law when one of the individuals involved is under 15 .
aycan is seeking the maximum conviction , a sentence of fifteen years , although that penalty would be reduced by a third since marco is also a minor . statutory rape laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco is awaiting trial in an antalya prison the case has thrust turkey 's judicial system in the spotlight and reinforced the german perception that the predominantly muslim country is backward in its sexual attitudes , and therefore does not belong in the european union . but legal experts say that turkey has made tremendous strides in bringing its laws in line with eu norms , and the case would have been handled no differently in germany , england or the us . " the mother of the girl charged a young man with child abuse .
the prosecutors had no choice but to arrest marco , " said christian rumpf , an attorney in stuttgart who is an expert on turkish law . in turkey as in germany , any foreigner charged with a crime must remain in detention until cleared of the charges , said rumpf , who does not believe that marco will be easily acquitted . the law governing sex with underage minors , or " statutory rape , " is taken seriously in turkey and other countries .
the legal " age of consent " for sex can range from 14 to 18 years , depending on country or even different regions of the same country .
the law is meant to protect children and adolescents from being coerced by an older individual into having sex , but also applies to sexual activity between teens of similar ages . " where do you draw the line between the normal sexuality of teenagers and protecting a child from sexual abuse ? " asked rumpf . germany would have prosecuted too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kissing is not a felony at any age , but sex is in germany , that line is drawn at age 14 . " kissing is not a felony in germany at any age , if that is all they did .
but sexual contact is illegal in germany when one of them is under 14 , " said heribert ostendorf , a former federal prosecutor who heads the program for juvenile law and crime prevention at the university of kiel . " most people just do n't know the specifics of child-abuse laws in germany and that marco would have also been prosecuted in his own country , " he said , adding that the burden is on marco to prove that he did not know that charlotte was only 13 . " ignorance of the law is no protection from being punished by it , " he said . " there are only victims in this case " the case has resulted in a media circus and charlotte 's family has been hounded by german reporters in manchester .
the girl did not show up for the last hearing because of the publicity glare , according to aycan . " there are only victims in this case - marco , charlotte , and even the turkish justice system , which is facing intense scrutiny from germany , britain and the eu .
the turkish judges are under tremendous pressure and can not afford to make mistakes , " said lale akgün , a turkish-born social democratic parliamentarian in the german bundestag who served for many years as a family and youth counselor for the city of cologne . akgün also believes the case has been damaging for german-turkish relations .
news commentators in turkey were outraged that german politicians tried to influence a matter that belongs in the courts . " the intervention of steinmeier has put even more pressure on the turkish judiciary to prove that it is capable of making independent decisions without being swayed by politics , " she said . parallels in the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's antalya coast is popular among german tourists in the united states , former president jimmy carter and democratic presidential hopeful barack obama unsuccessfully lobbied georgia 's high court to overturn the conviction of genarlow wilson , who is serving a ten-year jail sentence for having oral sex with his girlfriend . the girl never filed charges , but the act was caught on videotape at a new year 's eve party in 2003 , and wound up in the hands of georgia state prosecutors .
in georgia , the age of consent is 16 years of age .
wilson was 17 at the time , but his girlfriend was only 15 .
he was charged and convicted of child molestation . the wilson case has gotten wide publicity in the united states , and many americans are now questioning whether the statutory rape laws that are meant to protect minors go too far . in june , an appeal courts judge called wilson 's prison term " a grave miscarriage of justice , " but the former star athlete still remains behind bars . meanwhile marco 's next trial date in antalya is on september 6 .
the judicial process in this instanced is not unusually long , considering the backlog of cases in turkish courts and the time required to depose witnesses in three different countries , according to christian rumpf . " we need to let the turkish courts do their job and do it right , " said lale akgün .

but the 67 year-old berliner has no problem defending herself . she 's well armed and has a whole host of magic tricks she can fall back on . " two worlds " is her favorite computer game .
she plays for about two hours every day and says computer and online games are now her main hobby . " the graphics are excellent and it 's great to be able to make the figures do what i want , " she enthuses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " silver surfer " karin martin has her own webcam too karin is visiting the games convention in leipzig with her friend , 64-year-old inge rappold , whom she got to know through the internet while playing solitaire .
these two women of a certain age have been playing against each other for a year but have only just met in person for the first time . market woos silver surfers inge and karin are just two members of the newly discovered market known as " silver surfers . " younger visitors to this year 's games convention are finding they 're increasingly having to share the consoles with grey-haired figures also eager to check out what 's new .
the oldest convention visitor is 86 and the market for interactive games software now has the new consumer group squarely in its sights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surfing is n't just for kids according to the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin , people over 65 make up 16 percent of the population in germany and account for 30 percent of purchasing power . in a special report on the silver surfers , the european interactive advertising agency reveals that a quarter of the 55 plus generation surf the internet regularly . on average they 're online seven hours a week . the oldies are also turning to the world of virtual games in increasing numbers . " the market 's booming , " said eva steinhorst of gameduell , germany 's biggest internet games portal , which has with five million registered players . " in the last 12 months alone , we 've registered an increase of more than 100 percent among the 50-plus group , " she said . whereas for younger players entertainment is the main attraction , silver surfers are often more interested in games that can provide memory training or keep their manual skills and reflexes up to speed .
the results of a gameduell user poll in july 2007 show that " women are more interested in games using logic , while men prefer action or general knowledge games , " said steinhorst . little interest in shoot- ' em-up games what 's important for this market is that " the games should be easy to learn or players should already be familiar with them , like solitaire , " steinhorst said .
" otherwise elderly users are put off . " prices are often considered too high .
hardly anyone 's prepared to spend 30 to 50 euros -lrb- $ 40 to $ 67 -rrb- on a single cd-rom . " glitzy packaging with not much inside does n't attract elderly users either " said jürgen bewilogua from the " elderly in the net " project in leipzig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lara croft still has more young fans he carried out a study into how senior citizens benefit from computer games . " motor skills can be trained with a mouse and there are many strategy and role-playing games which are good for mental fitness , " he says . so-called edutainment software is also interesting for older users .
" we 've tested history games like the napoleonic wars " says bewilogua . " older users were delighted . " but there 's no market for war games or shoot- ' em-ups .
" they bring back bad memories for the war and post-war generations " bewilogua explains . but " galilea03 , " alias karin martin , disagrees .
she 's an ace at shooting down moorhens and sinking pirate ships , and she 's come to leipzig to see what else is on offer . together with her silver-haired friend inge , alias " mecki , " she 'll be spending nearly the whole time till the fair closes on sunday at the consoles . and their husbands ? " they 've stayed at home " says karin " they 'll find something to do together but it wo n't be playing computer games .

the case has become a thorn in german-turkish relations . turkey 's antalya coast is enormously popular among german and british tourists for its pristine beaches , sporting activities and nightlife . a 17-year-old high school student from the small northern german town of ülzen , identified as marco w. in german media reports , had spent the easter break with his parents at a five-star hotel resort in side . but on april 12 , marco 's holiday turned into a nightmare . turkish police officers arrested him for having sex with a 13-year-old briton , known in german media as charlotte m. the mother of the manchester girl had accused marco of sexually abusing her daughter after he had been invited up to the girl 's hotel room . marco claims charlotte told him she was fifteen and what has emerged in the german media is a portrait of a manipulative 13-year-old deceiving a youth four years her senior . turkey has also been lambasted by the tabloids , commentators and politicians for its treatment of a juvenile .
much has been made of marco 's psychological state and the decrepit conditions of the detention cell , which he has been sharing with 30 other inmates for the past four months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- left -rrb- talked to turkey 's gül about marco german politicians have intervened on marco 's behalf at the highest levels .
chancellor angela merkel made public assurances that she would help marco and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke privately to his turkish counterpart , abdullah gül , who is likely to be elected turkey 's next president at the end of this month .
gül said that he could not interfere with turkey 's independent judiciary . different stories marco claims the two only kissed and engaged in " heavy petting , " consensually .
no sexual intercourse took place , he has said . on aug .
8 , a gynecologist who had examined charlotte said that there was no evidence of assault and the girl was still a virgin .
but there was sexual penetration , insisted charlotte 's lawyer ömer aycan , who told his client 's side of the story in a telephone interview with dw-world.de from antalya . charlotte has claimed that she was asleep in the double room when marco and another boy knocked on the door after midnight .
she asked marco to leave , but he refused and proceeded to force himself on her .
charlotte screamed , alerting other teenagers in the room , and marco fled . " charlotte refused to have sex with marco , so i can use the word rape .
he raped a 13-year-old girl , " said aycan , who added that charlotte 's age was known to the german youth . sexual contact without the use of force is criminal under turkish law when one of the individuals involved is under 15 .
aycan is seeking the maximum conviction , a sentence of fifteen years , although that penalty would be reduced by a third since marco is also a minor . statutory rape laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco is awaiting trial in an antalya prison the case has thrust turkey 's judicial system in the spotlight and reinforced the german perception that the predominantly muslim country is backward in its sexual attitudes , and therefore does not belong in the european union . but legal experts say that turkey has made tremendous strides in bringing its laws in line with eu norms , and the case would have been handled no differently in germany , england or the us . " the mother of the girl charged a young man with child abuse .
the prosecutors had no choice but to arrest marco , " said christian rumpf , an attorney in stuttgart who is an expert on turkish law . in turkey as in germany , any foreigner charged with a crime must remain in detention until cleared of the charges , said rumpf , who does not believe that marco will be easily acquitted . the law governing sex with underage minors , or " statutory rape , " is taken seriously in turkey and other countries .
the legal " age of consent " for sex can range from 14 to 18 years , depending on country or even different regions of the same country .
the law is meant to protect children and adolescents from being coerced by an older individual into having sex , but also applies to sexual activity between teens of similar ages . " where do you draw the line between the normal sexuality of teenagers and protecting a child from sexual abuse ? " asked rumpf . germany would have prosecuted too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kissing is not a felony at any age , but sex is in germany , that line is drawn at age 14 . " kissing is not a felony in germany at any age , if that is all they did .
but sexual contact is illegal in germany when one of them is under 14 , " said heribert ostendorf , a former federal prosecutor who heads the program for juvenile law and crime prevention at the university of kiel . " most people just do n't know the specifics of child-abuse laws in germany and that marco would have also been prosecuted in his own country , " he said , adding that the burden is on marco to prove that he did not know that charlotte was only 13 . " ignorance of the law is no protection from being punished by it , " he said . " there are only victims in this case " the case has resulted in a media circus and charlotte 's family has been hounded by german reporters in manchester .
the girl did not show up for the last hearing because of the publicity glare , according to aycan . " there are only victims in this case - marco , charlotte , and even the turkish justice system , which is facing intense scrutiny from germany , britain and the eu .
the turkish judges are under tremendous pressure and can not afford to make mistakes , " said lale akgün , a turkish-born social democratic parliamentarian in the german bundestag who served for many years as a family and youth counselor for the city of cologne . akgün also believes the case has been damaging for german-turkish relations .
news commentators in turkey were outraged that german politicians tried to influence a matter that belongs in the courts .

the prosecutors had no choice but to arrest marco , " said christian rumpf , an attorney in stuttgart who is an expert on turkish law . in turkey as in germany , any foreigner charged with a crime must remain in detention until cleared of the charges , said rumpf , who does not believe that marco will be easily acquitted . the law governing sex with underage minors , or " statutory rape , " is taken seriously in turkey and other countries .
the legal " age of consent " for sex can range from 14 to 18 years , depending on country or even different regions of the same country .
the law is meant to protect children and adolescents from being coerced by an older individual into having sex , but also applies to sexual activity between teens of similar ages . " where do you draw the line between the normal sexuality of teenagers and protecting a child from sexual abuse ? " asked rumpf . germany would have prosecuted too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kissing is not a felony at any age , but sex is in germany , that line is drawn at age 14 . " kissing is not a felony in germany at any age , if that is all they did .
but sexual contact is illegal in germany when one of them is under 14 , " said heribert ostendorf , a former federal prosecutor who heads the program for juvenile law and crime prevention at the university of kiel . " most people just do n't know the specifics of child-abuse laws in germany and that marco would have also been prosecuted in his own country , " he said , adding that the burden is on marco to prove that he did not know that charlotte was only 13 . " ignorance of the law is no protection from being punished by it , " he said . " there are only victims in this case " the case has resulted in a media circus and charlotte 's family has been hounded by german reporters in manchester .
the girl did not show up for the last hearing because of the publicity glare , according to aycan . " there are only victims in this case - marco , charlotte , and even the turkish justice system , which is facing intense scrutiny from germany , britain and the eu .
the turkish judges are under tremendous pressure and can not afford to make mistakes , " said lale akgün , a turkish-born social democratic parliamentarian in the german bundestag who served for many years as a family and youth counselor for the city of cologne . akgün also believes the case has been damaging for german-turkish relations .

the love parade decamped to the industrial ruhr region after plans to keep it in germany 's capital fell through .
essen will be the first host . the love parade turns 18 this year .
and like a self-respecting adult , it 's moving away from home .
it will look for a new start in the ruhr region , germany 's industrial center in the western state of north rhine-westphalia .
the saturday parade in essen is the centerpiece of a four-day " love weekend " that includes more than 1,000 hours of music , 700 performers and 100 parties .
last year 's parade in berlin attracted one million visitors who grooved to the music of 230 djs from 17 countries .
ravers gyrate to electronic dance music booming from sound trucks and fixed stages manned by internationally known djs .
leaving berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelin ' the love in berlin organizers of this year 's show would n't say how many fans they expect to turn up in essen .
but the party will go on , with a parade of 27 floats planned .
the love parade will remain in the ruhr region for five years , but will lead a nomadic existence .
essen will be followed by the cities of dortmund , bochum , duisburg and gelsenkirchen .
the company that operates the event decided to move from berlin after failing to agree on terms with the capital 's administrators on a future concept for the parade .
the love parade was first held in 1989 as a private business venture .
in the subsequent years , it 's been exported all over the world , taking place in cities such as tel aviv , san francisco , sydney and mexico city .
yet the german parade has faced problems finding sponsors and was cancelled in 2004 and 2005 .

the love parade decamped to the industrial ruhr region after plans to keep it in germany 's capital fell through .
essen will be the first host . the love parade turns 18 this year .
and like a self-respecting adult , it 's moving away from home .
it will look for a new start in the ruhr region , germany 's industrial center in the western state of north rhine-westphalia .
the saturday parade in essen is the centerpiece of a four-day " love weekend " that includes more than 1,000 hours of music , 700 performers and 100 parties .
last year 's parade in berlin attracted one million visitors who grooved to the music of 230 djs from 17 countries .
ravers gyrate to electronic dance music booming from sound trucks and fixed stages manned by internationally known djs .
leaving berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelin ' the love in berlin organizers of this year 's show would n't say how many fans they expect to turn up in essen .
but the party will go on , with a parade of 27 floats planned .
the love parade will remain in the ruhr region for five years , but will lead a nomadic existence .
essen will be followed by the cities of dortmund , bochum , duisburg and gelsenkirchen .
the company that operates the event decided to move from berlin after failing to agree on terms with the capital 's administrators on a future concept for the parade .
the love parade was first held in 1989 as a private business venture .
in the subsequent years , it 's been exported all over the world , taking place in cities such as tel aviv , san francisco , sydney and mexico city .
yet the german parade has faced problems finding sponsors and was cancelled in 2004 and 2005 .
the events ' trademarks are scantily clad dancers , intoxication and summer sun .
its appeal extends far beyond fans of techno music .
" we will beat berlin in a number of factors , " said rainer schaller , managing director of loveparade gmbh , the company which operates the event .
the parade must go on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-flung love in tel aviv schaller said the love weekend from august 23-26 will be the " longest love parade in history " in terms of duration .

but the 67 year-old berliner has no problem defending herself . she 's well armed and has a whole host of magic tricks she can fall back on . " two worlds " is her favorite computer game .
she plays for about two hours every day and says computer and online games are now her main hobby . " the graphics are excellent and it 's great to be able to make the figures do what i want , " she enthuses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " silver surfer " karin martin has her own webcam too karin is visiting the games convention in leipzig with her friend , 64-year-old inge rappold , whom she got to know through the internet while playing solitaire .
these two women of a certain age have been playing against each other for a year but have only just met in person for the first time . market woos silver surfers inge and karin are just two members of the newly discovered market known as " silver surfers . " younger visitors to this year 's games convention are finding they 're increasingly having to share the consoles with grey-haired figures also eager to check out what 's new .
the oldest convention visitor is 86 and the market for interactive games software now has the new consumer group squarely in its sights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surfing is n't just for kids according to the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin , people over 65 make up 16 percent of the population in germany and account for 30 percent of purchasing power . in a special report on the silver surfers , the european interactive advertising agency reveals that a quarter of the 55 plus generation surf the internet regularly . on average they 're online seven hours a week . the oldies are also turning to the world of virtual games in increasing numbers . " the market 's booming , " said eva steinhorst of gameduell , germany 's biggest internet games portal , which has with five million registered players . " in the last 12 months alone , we 've registered an increase of more than 100 percent among the 50-plus group , " she said . whereas for younger players entertainment is the main attraction , silver surfers are often more interested in games that can provide memory training or keep their manual skills and reflexes up to speed .
the results of a gameduell user poll in july 2007 show that " women are more interested in games using logic , while men prefer action or general knowledge games , " said steinhorst . little interest in shoot- ' em-up games what 's important for this market is that " the games should be easy to learn or players should already be familiar with them , like solitaire , " steinhorst said .
" otherwise elderly users are put off . " prices are often considered too high .
hardly anyone 's prepared to spend 30 to 50 euros -lrb- $ 40 to $ 67 -rrb- on a single cd-rom . " glitzy packaging with not much inside does n't attract elderly users either " said jürgen bewilogua from the " elderly in the net " project in leipzig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lara croft still has more young fans he carried out a study into how senior citizens benefit from computer games . " motor skills can be trained with a mouse and there are many strategy and role-playing games which are good for mental fitness , " he says . so-called edutainment software is also interesting for older users .
" we 've tested history games like the napoleonic wars " says bewilogua . " older users were delighted . " but there 's no market for war games or shoot- ' em-ups .
" they bring back bad memories for the war and post-war generations " bewilogua explains . but " galilea03 , " alias karin martin , disagrees .
she 's an ace at shooting down moorhens and sinking pirate ships , and she 's come to leipzig to see what else is on offer . together with her silver-haired friend inge , alias " mecki , " she 'll be spending nearly the whole time till the fair closes on sunday at the consoles . and their husbands ? " they 've stayed at home " says karin " they 'll find something to do together but it wo n't be playing computer games .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 25.08.2007 as germany struggles with extremism , calls for new party ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a previous failed attempt , new calls are going out to ban the far-right npd party calls to ban the far-right npd party have resurfaced in germany following a mob attack which left eight indians injured .
in a separate incident , that party 's leader has been charged with incitement of racial hatred . the racially motivated attack on eight indians in the eastern town of mügeln continues to resonate in germany and the leader of the co-ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , spoke out in favor of a starting the process that would ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
but other political leaders and the interior ministry have voiced skepticism .
the npd is an anti-immigrant party that has close links to neo-nazis and is represented in the parliaments of two states in the former communist east germany .
eastern germany has seen disproportionate rates of violence against foreigners since german reunification in 1990 , although incidents have also occurred in western germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the indians injured in the attack in mügeln one of the states is saxony , where the indians were attacked and chased through the town of mügeln by a mob of about 50 germans , following a local festival on august 18 .
a crowd of onlookers did not intervene and it took about 70 police to gain control of the situation .
in another incident last weekend in the western state of rhineland-palatinate , two african men were attacked by a group of right-wing extremists , german media reported on friday .
both men were injured , one seriously .
police had kept the news from the media due to their investigation , officials said .
although the npd was not specifically blamed for the attacks , the party and other extreme-right groups are known to be active in the state and other parts of eastern germany .
racist party the npd has been branded as an ideological breeding ground for neo-nazi aggression , and germany 's domestic security agency says it foments racist violence .
it is also considered anti-semitic .
an attempt by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to ban the npd faltered in 2003 after the federal constitutional court refused to hear the case because the government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer stands guard in mügeln near the pizza parlor where the attack took place the interior ministry said friday that although the party met all the requirements to be outlawed , the intelligence service would have to drop surveillance of it if a new attempt were to be made to ban it .
the ministry did not want to see this happen , a spokesman said .
hans-peter uhl , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said he would be happy to see the party banned .
" but i fear that such an attempt would fail and that would be a disaster , " he said .
green party parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele said the previous failed attempt to ban the npd ended in a propaganda victory for the party , and he feared the same could happen if a new attempt were made .
government inactivity ?
some critics have blamed inactivity by the major political parties for the spread of right-wing activity in the eastern states , where unemployment and dissatisfaction are much higher than in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen has promised to do more to combat right-wing extremism the latest violence has prodded the government into action .
family affairs minister ursula von der leyen announced increased assistance to projects aimed at combating right-wing extremism .
" we do n't want to leave the field open to right-wing extremists , " she said friday after a two-day cabinet conclave in the village of meseberg , 70 kilometers north of berlin .
but the government , and particularly her ministry which is responsible for programs to curb extremism , have come under criticism in the press for allegedly not doing enough .
in an editorial in the daily financial times deutschland , the author wrote : " let me tell you one thing , my dear politicians : when some areas of germany are no longer safe for foreigners , and when you no longer see the state 's duty to protect people from other people as part of your jobs , then i wo n't accept that .
do you understand ?
you are responsible for security in this country . "
during campaigning before their election to the state parliament in mecklenburg-western pomerania last september , npd activists set up youth clubs in neglected rural areas and distributed 15,000 cds with songs by right-wing rock bands in a bid to woo younger voters .
charges filed on friday , police in the eastern city of jena said they had filed charges against udo voigt , the npd 's national leader , for inciting racial hatred .
in a speech last weekend , he had proposed the late rudolf hess , adolf hitler 's former deputy , be awarded the nobel peace prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt -lrb- left -rrb- and the head of another far-right party , the dvu , gerhard frey if convicted , voigt could face up to three years in jail or a fine , police said .
founded in 1964 , the npd had its heyday in the late 60s when it was represented in seven state parliaments and narrowly missed clearing the five-percent threshold for representation in the bundestag , the national parliament .
on a national level , the npd plays an insignificant role .
it won only 1.6 per cent of the vote in the last general election in 2005 .
its current membership is put at around 6,000 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a separate incident , that party 's leader has been charged with incitement of racial hatred . the racially motivated attack on eight indians in the eastern town of mügeln continues to resonate in germany and the leader of the co-ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , spoke out in favor of a starting the process that would ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
but other political leaders and the interior ministry have voiced skepticism .
the npd is an anti-immigrant party that has close links to neo-nazis and is represented in the parliaments of two states in the former communist east germany .
eastern germany has seen disproportionate rates of violence against foreigners since german reunification in 1990 , although incidents have also occurred in western germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the indians injured in the attack in mügeln one of the states is saxony , where the indians were attacked and chased through the town of mügeln by a mob of about 50 germans , following a local festival on august 18 .
a crowd of onlookers did not intervene and it took about 70 police to gain control of the situation .
in another incident last weekend in the western state of rhineland-palatinate , two african men were attacked by a group of right-wing extremists , german media reported on friday .
both men were injured , one seriously .
police had kept the news from the media due to their investigation , officials said .
although the npd was not specifically blamed for the attacks , the party and other extreme-right groups are known to be active in the state and other parts of eastern germany .
racist party the npd has been branded as an ideological breeding ground for neo-nazi aggression , and germany 's domestic security agency says it foments racist violence .
it is also considered anti-semitic .
an attempt by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to ban the npd faltered in 2003 after the federal constitutional court refused to hear the case because the government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer stands guard in mügeln near the pizza parlor where the attack took place the interior ministry said friday that although the party met all the requirements to be outlawed , the intelligence service would have to drop surveillance of it if a new attempt were to be made to ban it .
the ministry did not want to see this happen , a spokesman said .
hans-peter uhl , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said he would be happy to see the party banned .
" but i fear that such an attempt would fail and that would be a disaster , " he said .
green party parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele said the previous failed attempt to ban the npd ended in a propaganda victory for the party , and he feared the same could happen if a new attempt were made .
government inactivity ?
some critics have blamed inactivity by the major political parties for the spread of right-wing activity in the eastern states , where unemployment and dissatisfaction are much higher than in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen has promised to do more to combat right-wing extremism the latest violence has prodded the government into action .
family affairs minister ursula von der leyen announced increased assistance to projects aimed at combating right-wing extremism .
" we do n't want to leave the field open to right-wing extremists , " she said friday after a two-day cabinet conclave in the village of meseberg , 70 kilometers north of berlin .
but the government , and particularly her ministry which is responsible for programs to curb extremism , have come under criticism in the press for allegedly not doing enough .
in an editorial in the daily financial times deutschland , the author wrote : " let me tell you one thing , my dear politicians : when some areas of germany are no longer safe for foreigners , and when you no longer see the state 's duty to protect people from other people as part of your jobs , then i wo n't accept that .
do you understand ?
you are responsible for security in this country . "
during campaigning before their election to the state parliament in mecklenburg-western pomerania last september , npd activists set up youth clubs in neglected rural areas and distributed 15,000 cds with songs by right-wing rock bands in a bid to woo younger voters .
charges filed on friday , police in the eastern city of jena said they had filed charges against udo voigt , the npd 's national leader , for inciting racial hatred .
in a speech last weekend , he had proposed the late rudolf hess , adolf hitler 's former deputy , be awarded the nobel peace prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt -lrb- left -rrb- and the head of another far-right party , the dvu , gerhard frey if convicted , voigt could face up to three years in jail or a fine , police said .
founded in 1964 , the npd had its heyday in the late 60s when it was represented in seven state parliaments and narrowly missed clearing the five-percent threshold for representation in the bundestag , the national parliament .
on a national level , the npd plays an insignificant role .
it won only 1.6 per cent of the vote in the last general election in 2005 .
its current membership is put at around 6,000 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 25.08.2007 as germany struggles with extremism , calls for new party ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a previous failed attempt , new calls are going out to ban the far-right npd party calls to ban the far-right npd party have resurfaced in germany following a mob attack which left eight indians injured .
in a separate incident , that party 's leader has been charged with incitement of racial hatred . the racially motivated attack on eight indians in the eastern town of mügeln continues to resonate in germany and the leader of the co-ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , spoke out in favor of a starting the process that would ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
but other political leaders and the interior ministry have voiced skepticism .
the npd is an anti-immigrant party that has close links to neo-nazis and is represented in the parliaments of two states in the former communist east germany .
eastern germany has seen disproportionate rates of violence against foreigners since german reunification in 1990 , although incidents have also occurred in western germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the indians injured in the attack in mügeln one of the states is saxony , where the indians were attacked and chased through the town of mügeln by a mob of about 50 germans , following a local festival on august 18 .
a crowd of onlookers did not intervene and it took about 70 police to gain control of the situation .
in another incident last weekend in the western state of rhineland-palatinate , two african men were attacked by a group of right-wing extremists , german media reported on friday .
both men were injured , one seriously .
police had kept the news from the media due to their investigation , officials said .
although the npd was not specifically blamed for the attacks , the party and other extreme-right groups are known to be active in the state and other parts of eastern germany .
racist party the npd has been branded as an ideological breeding ground for neo-nazi aggression , and germany 's domestic security agency says it foments racist violence .
it is also considered anti-semitic .
an attempt by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to ban the npd faltered in 2003 after the federal constitutional court refused to hear the case because the government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer stands guard in mügeln near the pizza parlor where the attack took place the interior ministry said friday that although the party met all the requirements to be outlawed , the intelligence service would have to drop surveillance of it if a new attempt were to be made to ban it .
the ministry did not want to see this happen , a spokesman said .
hans-peter uhl , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said he would be happy to see the party banned .
" but i fear that such an attempt would fail and that would be a disaster , " he said .
green party parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele said the previous failed attempt to ban the npd ended in a propaganda victory for the party , and he feared the same could happen if a new attempt were made .
government inactivity ?
some critics have blamed inactivity by the major political parties for the spread of right-wing activity in the eastern states , where unemployment and dissatisfaction are much higher than in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen has promised to do more to combat right-wing extremism the latest violence has prodded the government into action .
family affairs minister ursula von der leyen announced increased assistance to projects aimed at combating right-wing extremism .
" we do n't want to leave the field open to right-wing extremists , " she said friday after a two-day cabinet conclave in the village of meseberg , 70 kilometers north of berlin .
but the government , and particularly her ministry which is responsible for programs to curb extremism , have come under criticism in the press for allegedly not doing enough .
in an editorial in the daily financial times deutschland , the author wrote : " let me tell you one thing , my dear politicians : when some areas of germany are no longer safe for foreigners , and when you no longer see the state 's duty to protect people from other people as part of your jobs , then i wo n't accept that .
do you understand ?
you are responsible for security in this country . "
during campaigning before their election to the state parliament in mecklenburg-western pomerania last september , npd activists set up youth clubs in neglected rural areas and distributed 15,000 cds with songs by right-wing rock bands in a bid to woo younger voters .
charges filed on friday , police in the eastern city of jena said they had filed charges against udo voigt , the npd 's national leader , for inciting racial hatred .
in a speech last weekend , he had proposed the late rudolf hess , adolf hitler 's former deputy , be awarded the nobel peace prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt -lrb- left -rrb- and the head of another far-right party , the dvu , gerhard frey if convicted , voigt could face up to three years in jail or a fine , police said .
founded in 1964 , the npd had its heyday in the late 60s when it was represented in seven state parliaments and narrowly missed clearing the five-percent threshold for representation in the bundestag , the national parliament .
on a national level , the npd plays an insignificant role .
it won only 1.6 per cent of the vote in the last general election in 2005 .
its current membership is put at around 6,000 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a separate incident , that party 's leader has been charged with incitement of racial hatred . the racially motivated attack on eight indians in the eastern town of mügeln continues to resonate in germany and the leader of the co-ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , spoke out in favor of a starting the process that would ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
but other political leaders and the interior ministry have voiced skepticism .
the npd is an anti-immigrant party that has close links to neo-nazis and is represented in the parliaments of two states in the former communist east germany .
eastern germany has seen disproportionate rates of violence against foreigners since german reunification in 1990 , although incidents have also occurred in western germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the indians injured in the attack in mügeln one of the states is saxony , where the indians were attacked and chased through the town of mügeln by a mob of about 50 germans , following a local festival on august 18 .
a crowd of onlookers did not intervene and it took about 70 police to gain control of the situation .
in another incident last weekend in the western state of rhineland-palatinate , two african men were attacked by a group of right-wing extremists , german media reported on friday .
both men were injured , one seriously .
police had kept the news from the media due to their investigation , officials said .
although the npd was not specifically blamed for the attacks , the party and other extreme-right groups are known to be active in the state and other parts of eastern germany .
racist party the npd has been branded as an ideological breeding ground for neo-nazi aggression , and germany 's domestic security agency says it foments racist violence .
it is also considered anti-semitic .
an attempt by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to ban the npd faltered in 2003 after the federal constitutional court refused to hear the case because the government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer stands guard in mügeln near the pizza parlor where the attack took place the interior ministry said friday that although the party met all the requirements to be outlawed , the intelligence service would have to drop surveillance of it if a new attempt were to be made to ban it .
the ministry did not want to see this happen , a spokesman said .
hans-peter uhl , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said he would be happy to see the party banned .
" but i fear that such an attempt would fail and that would be a disaster , " he said .
green party parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele said the previous failed attempt to ban the npd ended in a propaganda victory for the party , and he feared the same could happen if a new attempt were made .
government inactivity ?
some critics have blamed inactivity by the major political parties for the spread of right-wing activity in the eastern states , where unemployment and dissatisfaction are much higher than in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen has promised to do more to combat right-wing extremism the latest violence has prodded the government into action .
family affairs minister ursula von der leyen announced increased assistance to projects aimed at combating right-wing extremism .
" we do n't want to leave the field open to right-wing extremists , " she said friday after a two-day cabinet conclave in the village of meseberg , 70 kilometers north of berlin .
but the government , and particularly her ministry which is responsible for programs to curb extremism , have come under criticism in the press for allegedly not doing enough .
in an editorial in the daily financial times deutschland , the author wrote : " let me tell you one thing , my dear politicians : when some areas of germany are no longer safe for foreigners , and when you no longer see the state 's duty to protect people from other people as part of your jobs , then i wo n't accept that .
do you understand ?
you are responsible for security in this country . "
during campaigning before their election to the state parliament in mecklenburg-western pomerania last september , npd activists set up youth clubs in neglected rural areas and distributed 15,000 cds with songs by right-wing rock bands in a bid to woo younger voters .
charges filed on friday , police in the eastern city of jena said they had filed charges against udo voigt , the npd 's national leader , for inciting racial hatred .
in a speech last weekend , he had proposed the late rudolf hess , adolf hitler 's former deputy , be awarded the nobel peace prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt -lrb- left -rrb- and the head of another far-right party , the dvu , gerhard frey if convicted , voigt could face up to three years in jail or a fine , police said .
founded in 1964 , the npd had its heyday in the late 60s when it was represented in seven state parliaments and narrowly missed clearing the five-percent threshold for representation in the bundestag , the national parliament .
on a national level , the npd plays an insignificant role .

" merkel arrives in china on monday and will meet president hu jintao , premier wen jiabao as well as cultural and civil rights groups .
she heads to japan on wednesday where she will talk to leaders there about climate change and economic issues . sudan , which has had a tense relationship with the west for some time now , expelled the european union and canadian envoys earlier this week after accusing them of " interfering " in the country 's internal affairs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western pressure has done little to improve darfur 's suffering however , eu envoy kent degerfelt has been given a reprieve by sudan .
khartoum will allow to remain until his tenure expires next month , following an eu apology , according to a presidential adviser who spoke on saturday . china has substantial economic interests in the african nation and has been under pressure to do more to quell the violence there , which is estimated to have cost 200,000 lives and displaced around 2.5 million people . urged to be tough on china on saturday , amnesty international called on merkel to also address the top of human rights in china itself when she meets the country 's leaders . " we hope that chancellor merkel will speak forcefully about the disastrous human rights situation in china , " said barbara lochbihler , secretary general of the human rights group 's german section . " the continued human rights violations in china are in strong contrast to the official pledges to improve the human rights situation , " she told the dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups say abuses continue in china in the lead-up to the 2008 olympics she said she expected chinese authorities to " continue their harassment of human rights campaigners " ahead of the olympic games that will take place in beijing next year .
there were also fears that journalists would be subjected to increased pressure before the games begin , she said . the chancellor raised the issue of human rights and appealed for more democracy when she met chinese leaders during a previous visit to the world 's most populous nation . officials in berlin say merkel will not shy away from difficult areas this time and will bring up the topics of human rights and press freedom in her official talks in the chinese capital .
she is scheduled to meet chinese journalists , but it is not clear which ones and whether these have been put under pressure by chinese authorities . calling the human rights situation in china " catastrophic , " lochbihler pointed out that the death sentence can be imposed for around 70 different crimes , including drug possession and tax evasion . even the right of citizens to freedom of information is severely restricted , she said . " if you key in the words human rights , democracy or amnesty international in an internet search engine in china you wo n't get a single response , " lochbihler said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 25.08.2007 teen sex case puts turkey 's judicial system in spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco thought the british girl was 15 teenagers are rarely prosecuted for having sex , but a 13-year-old british girl has managed to put a 17-year old-german boy behind bars in turkey .
the case has become a thorn in german-turkish relations . turkey 's antalya coast is enormously popular among german and british tourists for its pristine beaches , sporting activities and nightlife . a 17-year-old high school student from the small northern german town of ülzen , identified as marco w. in german media reports , had spent the easter break with his parents at a five-star hotel resort in side . but on april 12 , marco 's holiday turned into a nightmare . turkish police officers arrested him for having sex with a 13-year-old briton , known in german media as charlotte m. the mother of the manchester girl had accused marco of sexually abusing her daughter after he had been invited up to the girl 's hotel room . marco claims charlotte told him she was fifteen and what has emerged in the german media is a portrait of a manipulative 13-year-old deceiving a youth four years her senior . turkey has also been lambasted by the tabloids , commentators and politicians for its treatment of a juvenile .
much has been made of marco 's psychological state and the decrepit conditions of the detention cell , which he has been sharing with 30 other inmates for the past four months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- left -rrb- talked to turkey 's gül about marco german politicians have intervened on marco 's behalf at the highest levels .
chancellor angela merkel made public assurances that she would help marco and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke privately to his turkish counterpart , abdullah gül , who is likely to be elected turkey 's next president at the end of this month .
gül said that he could not interfere with turkey 's independent judiciary . different stories marco claims the two only kissed and engaged in " heavy petting , " consensually .
no sexual intercourse took place , he has said . on aug .
8 , a gynecologist who had examined charlotte said that there was no evidence of assault and the girl was still a virgin .
but there was sexual penetration , insisted charlotte 's lawyer ömer aycan , who told his client 's side of the story in a telephone interview with dw-world.de from antalya . charlotte has claimed that she was asleep in the double room when marco and another boy knocked on the door after midnight .
she asked marco to leave , but he refused and proceeded to force himself on her .
charlotte screamed , alerting other teenagers in the room , and marco fled . " charlotte refused to have sex with marco , so i can use the word rape .
he raped a 13-year-old girl , " said aycan , who added that charlotte 's age was known to the german youth . sexual contact without the use of force is criminal under turkish law when one of the individuals involved is under 15 .
aycan is seeking the maximum conviction , a sentence of fifteen years , although that penalty would be reduced by a third since marco is also a minor . statutory rape laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco is awaiting trial in an antalya prison the case has thrust turkey 's judicial system in the spotlight and reinforced the german perception that the predominantly muslim country is backward in its sexual attitudes , and therefore does not belong in the european union . but legal experts say that turkey has made tremendous strides in bringing its laws in line with eu norms , and the case would have been handled no differently in germany , england or the us . " the mother of the girl charged a young man with child abuse .
the prosecutors had no choice but to arrest marco , " said christian rumpf , an attorney in stuttgart who is an expert on turkish law . in turkey as in germany , any foreigner charged with a crime must remain in detention until cleared of the charges , said rumpf , who does not believe that marco will be easily acquitted . the law governing sex with underage minors , or " statutory rape , " is taken seriously in turkey and other countries .
the legal " age of consent " for sex can range from 14 to 18 years , depending on country or even different regions of the same country .
the law is meant to protect children and adolescents from being coerced by an older individual into having sex , but also applies to sexual activity between teens of similar ages . " where do you draw the line between the normal sexuality of teenagers and protecting a child from sexual abuse ? " asked rumpf . germany would have prosecuted too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kissing is not a felony at any age , but sex is in germany , that line is drawn at age 14 . " kissing is not a felony in germany at any age , if that is all they did .
but sexual contact is illegal in germany when one of them is under 14 , " said heribert ostendorf , a former federal prosecutor who heads the program for juvenile law and crime prevention at the university of kiel . " most people just do n't know the specifics of child-abuse laws in germany and that marco would have also been prosecuted in his own country , " he said , adding that the burden is on marco to prove that he did not know that charlotte was only 13 . " ignorance of the law is no protection from being punished by it , " he said . " there are only victims in this case " the case has resulted in a media circus and charlotte 's family has been hounded by german reporters in manchester .
the girl did not show up for the last hearing because of the publicity glare , according to aycan . " there are only victims in this case - marco , charlotte , and even the turkish justice system , which is facing intense scrutiny from germany , britain and the eu .
the turkish judges are under tremendous pressure and can not afford to make mistakes , " said lale akgün , a turkish-born social democratic parliamentarian in the german bundestag who served for many years as a family and youth counselor for the city of cologne . akgün also believes the case has been damaging for german-turkish relations .
news commentators in turkey were outraged that german politicians tried to influence a matter that belongs in the courts . " the intervention of steinmeier has put even more pressure on the turkish judiciary to prove that it is capable of making independent decisions without being swayed by politics , " she said . parallels in the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's antalya coast is popular among german tourists in the united states , former president jimmy carter and democratic presidential hopeful barack obama unsuccessfully lobbied georgia 's high court to overturn the conviction of genarlow wilson , who is serving a ten-year jail sentence for having oral sex with his girlfriend . the girl never filed charges , but the act was caught on videotape at a new year 's eve party in 2003 , and wound up in the hands of georgia state prosecutors .
in georgia , the age of consent is 16 years of age .
wilson was 17 at the time , but his girlfriend was only 15 .
he was charged and convicted of child molestation . the wilson case has gotten wide publicity in the united states , and many americans are now questioning whether the statutory rape laws that are meant to protect minors go too far . in june , an appeal courts judge called wilson 's prison term " a grave miscarriage of justice , " but the former star athlete still remains behind bars . meanwhile marco 's next trial date in antalya is on september 6 .
the judicial process in this instanced is not unusually long , considering the backlog of cases in turkish courts and the time required to depose witnesses in three different countries , according to christian rumpf . " we need to let the turkish courts do their job and do it right , " said lale akgün .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 25.08.2007 as germany struggles with extremism , calls for new party ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a previous failed attempt , new calls are going out to ban the far-right npd party calls to ban the far-right npd party have resurfaced in germany following a mob attack which left eight indians injured .
in a separate incident , that party 's leader has been charged with incitement of racial hatred . the racially motivated attack on eight indians in the eastern town of mügeln continues to resonate in germany and the leader of the co-ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , spoke out in favor of a starting the process that would ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
but other political leaders and the interior ministry have voiced skepticism .
the npd is an anti-immigrant party that has close links to neo-nazis and is represented in the parliaments of two states in the former communist east germany .
eastern germany has seen disproportionate rates of violence against foreigners since german reunification in 1990 , although incidents have also occurred in western germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the indians injured in the attack in mügeln one of the states is saxony , where the indians were attacked and chased through the town of mügeln by a mob of about 50 germans , following a local festival on august 18 .
a crowd of onlookers did not intervene and it took about 70 police to gain control of the situation .
in another incident last weekend in the western state of rhineland-palatinate , two african men were attacked by a group of right-wing extremists , german media reported on friday .
both men were injured , one seriously .
police had kept the news from the media due to their investigation , officials said .
although the npd was not specifically blamed for the attacks , the party and other extreme-right groups are known to be active in the state and other parts of eastern germany .
racist party the npd has been branded as an ideological breeding ground for neo-nazi aggression , and germany 's domestic security agency says it foments racist violence .
it is also considered anti-semitic .
an attempt by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to ban the npd faltered in 2003 after the federal constitutional court refused to hear the case because the government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer stands guard in mügeln near the pizza parlor where the attack took place the interior ministry said friday that although the party met all the requirements to be outlawed , the intelligence service would have to drop surveillance of it if a new attempt were to be made to ban it .
the ministry did not want to see this happen , a spokesman said .
hans-peter uhl , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said he would be happy to see the party banned .
" but i fear that such an attempt would fail and that would be a disaster , " he said .
green party parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele said the previous failed attempt to ban the npd ended in a propaganda victory for the party , and he feared the same could happen if a new attempt were made .
government inactivity ?
some critics have blamed inactivity by the major political parties for the spread of right-wing activity in the eastern states , where unemployment and dissatisfaction are much higher than in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen has promised to do more to combat right-wing extremism the latest violence has prodded the government into action .
family affairs minister ursula von der leyen announced increased assistance to projects aimed at combating right-wing extremism .
" we do n't want to leave the field open to right-wing extremists , " she said friday after a two-day cabinet conclave in the village of meseberg , 70 kilometers north of berlin .
but the government , and particularly her ministry which is responsible for programs to curb extremism , have come under criticism in the press for allegedly not doing enough .
in an editorial in the daily financial times deutschland , the author wrote : " let me tell you one thing , my dear politicians : when some areas of germany are no longer safe for foreigners , and when you no longer see the state 's duty to protect people from other people as part of your jobs , then i wo n't accept that .
do you understand ?
you are responsible for security in this country . "
during campaigning before their election to the state parliament in mecklenburg-western pomerania last september , npd activists set up youth clubs in neglected rural areas and distributed 15,000 cds with songs by right-wing rock bands in a bid to woo younger voters .
charges filed on friday , police in the eastern city of jena said they had filed charges against udo voigt , the npd 's national leader , for inciting racial hatred .
in a speech last weekend , he had proposed the late rudolf hess , adolf hitler 's former deputy , be awarded the nobel peace prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt -lrb- left -rrb- and the head of another far-right party , the dvu , gerhard frey if convicted , voigt could face up to three years in jail or a fine , police said .
founded in 1964 , the npd had its heyday in the late 60s when it was represented in seven state parliaments and narrowly missed clearing the five-percent threshold for representation in the bundestag , the national parliament .

in a separate incident , that party 's leader has been charged with incitement of racial hatred . the racially motivated attack on eight indians in the eastern town of mügeln continues to resonate in germany and the leader of the co-ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , spoke out in favor of a starting the process that would ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
but other political leaders and the interior ministry have voiced skepticism .
the npd is an anti-immigrant party that has close links to neo-nazis and is represented in the parliaments of two states in the former communist east germany .
eastern germany has seen disproportionate rates of violence against foreigners since german reunification in 1990 , although incidents have also occurred in western germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the indians injured in the attack in mügeln one of the states is saxony , where the indians were attacked and chased through the town of mügeln by a mob of about 50 germans , following a local festival on august 18 .
a crowd of onlookers did not intervene and it took about 70 police to gain control of the situation .
in another incident last weekend in the western state of rhineland-palatinate , two african men were attacked by a group of right-wing extremists , german media reported on friday .
both men were injured , one seriously .
police had kept the news from the media due to their investigation , officials said .
although the npd was not specifically blamed for the attacks , the party and other extreme-right groups are known to be active in the state and other parts of eastern germany .
racist party the npd has been branded as an ideological breeding ground for neo-nazi aggression , and germany 's domestic security agency says it foments racist violence .
it is also considered anti-semitic .
an attempt by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to ban the npd faltered in 2003 after the federal constitutional court refused to hear the case because the government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer stands guard in mügeln near the pizza parlor where the attack took place the interior ministry said friday that although the party met all the requirements to be outlawed , the intelligence service would have to drop surveillance of it if a new attempt were to be made to ban it .
the ministry did not want to see this happen , a spokesman said .
hans-peter uhl , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said he would be happy to see the party banned .
" but i fear that such an attempt would fail and that would be a disaster , " he said .
green party parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele said the previous failed attempt to ban the npd ended in a propaganda victory for the party , and he feared the same could happen if a new attempt were made .
government inactivity ?
some critics have blamed inactivity by the major political parties for the spread of right-wing activity in the eastern states , where unemployment and dissatisfaction are much higher than in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen has promised to do more to combat right-wing extremism the latest violence has prodded the government into action .
family affairs minister ursula von der leyen announced increased assistance to projects aimed at combating right-wing extremism .
" we do n't want to leave the field open to right-wing extremists , " she said friday after a two-day cabinet conclave in the village of meseberg , 70 kilometers north of berlin .
but the government , and particularly her ministry which is responsible for programs to curb extremism , have come under criticism in the press for allegedly not doing enough .
in an editorial in the daily financial times deutschland , the author wrote : " let me tell you one thing , my dear politicians : when some areas of germany are no longer safe for foreigners , and when you no longer see the state 's duty to protect people from other people as part of your jobs , then i wo n't accept that .
do you understand ?
you are responsible for security in this country . "
during campaigning before their election to the state parliament in mecklenburg-western pomerania last september , npd activists set up youth clubs in neglected rural areas and distributed 15,000 cds with songs by right-wing rock bands in a bid to woo younger voters .
charges filed on friday , police in the eastern city of jena said they had filed charges against udo voigt , the npd 's national leader , for inciting racial hatred .
in a speech last weekend , he had proposed the late rudolf hess , adolf hitler 's former deputy , be awarded the nobel peace prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt -lrb- left -rrb- and the head of another far-right party , the dvu , gerhard frey if convicted , voigt could face up to three years in jail or a fine , police said .
founded in 1964 , the npd had its heyday in the late 60s when it was represented in seven state parliaments and narrowly missed clearing the five-percent threshold for representation in the bundestag , the national parliament .
on a national level , the npd plays an insignificant role .

but the 67 year-old berliner has no problem defending herself . she 's well armed and has a whole host of magic tricks she can fall back on . " two worlds " is her favorite computer game .
she plays for about two hours every day and says computer and online games are now her main hobby . " the graphics are excellent and it 's great to be able to make the figures do what i want , " she enthuses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " silver surfer " karin martin has her own webcam too karin is visiting the games convention in leipzig with her friend , 64-year-old inge rappold , whom she got to know through the internet while playing solitaire .
these two women of a certain age have been playing against each other for a year but have only just met in person for the first time . market woos silver surfers inge and karin are just two members of the newly discovered market known as " silver surfers . " younger visitors to this year 's games convention are finding they 're increasingly having to share the consoles with grey-haired figures also eager to check out what 's new .
the oldest convention visitor is 86 and the market for interactive games software now has the new consumer group squarely in its sights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surfing is n't just for kids according to the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin , people over 65 make up 16 percent of the population in germany and account for 30 percent of purchasing power . in a special report on the silver surfers , the european interactive advertising agency reveals that a quarter of the 55 plus generation surf the internet regularly . on average they 're online seven hours a week . the oldies are also turning to the world of virtual games in increasing numbers . " the market 's booming , " said eva steinhorst of gameduell , germany 's biggest internet games portal , which has with five million registered players . " in the last 12 months alone , we 've registered an increase of more than 100 percent among the 50-plus group , " she said . whereas for younger players entertainment is the main attraction , silver surfers are often more interested in games that can provide memory training or keep their manual skills and reflexes up to speed .
the results of a gameduell user poll in july 2007 show that " women are more interested in games using logic , while men prefer action or general knowledge games , " said steinhorst . little interest in shoot- ' em-up games what 's important for this market is that " the games should be easy to learn or players should already be familiar with them , like solitaire , " steinhorst said .
" otherwise elderly users are put off . " prices are often considered too high .
hardly anyone 's prepared to spend 30 to 50 euros -lrb- $ 40 to $ 67 -rrb- on a single cd-rom . " glitzy packaging with not much inside does n't attract elderly users either " said jürgen bewilogua from the " elderly in the net " project in leipzig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lara croft still has more young fans he carried out a study into how senior citizens benefit from computer games . " motor skills can be trained with a mouse and there are many strategy and role-playing games which are good for mental fitness , " he says . so-called edutainment software is also interesting for older users .
" we 've tested history games like the napoleonic wars " says bewilogua . " older users were delighted . " but there 's no market for war games or shoot- ' em-ups .
" they bring back bad memories for the war and post-war generations " bewilogua explains . but " galilea03 , " alias karin martin , disagrees .
she 's an ace at shooting down moorhens and sinking pirate ships , and she 's come to leipzig to see what else is on offer . together with her silver-haired friend inge , alias " mecki , " she 'll be spending nearly the whole time till the fair closes on sunday at the consoles . and their husbands ?

" merkel arrives in china on monday and will meet president hu jintao , premier wen jiabao as well as cultural and civil rights groups .
she heads to japan on wednesday where she will talk to leaders there about climate change and economic issues . sudan , which has had a tense relationship with the west for some time now , expelled the european union and canadian envoys earlier this week after accusing them of " interfering " in the country 's internal affairs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western pressure has done little to improve darfur 's suffering however , eu envoy kent degerfelt has been given a reprieve by sudan .
khartoum will allow to remain until his tenure expires next month , following an eu apology , according to a presidential adviser who spoke on saturday . china has substantial economic interests in the african nation and has been under pressure to do more to quell the violence there , which is estimated to have cost 200,000 lives and displaced around 2.5 million people . urged to be tough on china on saturday , amnesty international called on merkel to also address the top of human rights in china itself when she meets the country 's leaders . " we hope that chancellor merkel will speak forcefully about the disastrous human rights situation in china , " said barbara lochbihler , secretary general of the human rights group 's german section . " the continued human rights violations in china are in strong contrast to the official pledges to improve the human rights situation , " she told the dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups say abuses continue in china in the lead-up to the 2008 olympics she said she expected chinese authorities to " continue their harassment of human rights campaigners " ahead of the olympic games that will take place in beijing next year .
there were also fears that journalists would be subjected to increased pressure before the games begin , she said . the chancellor raised the issue of human rights and appealed for more democracy when she met chinese leaders during a previous visit to the world 's most populous nation . officials in berlin say merkel will not shy away from difficult areas this time and will bring up the topics of human rights and press freedom in her official talks in the chinese capital .
she is scheduled to meet chinese journalists , but it is not clear which ones and whether these have been put under pressure by chinese authorities . calling the human rights situation in china " catastrophic , " lochbihler pointed out that the death sentence can be imposed for around 70 different crimes , including drug possession and tax evasion . even the right of citizens to freedom of information is severely restricted , she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 25.08.2007 as germany struggles with extremism , calls for new party ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a previous failed attempt , new calls are going out to ban the far-right npd party calls to ban the far-right npd party have resurfaced in germany following a mob attack which left eight indians injured .
in a separate incident , that party 's leader has been charged with incitement of racial hatred . the racially motivated attack on eight indians in the eastern town of mügeln continues to resonate in germany and the leader of the co-ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , spoke out in favor of a starting the process that would ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
but other political leaders and the interior ministry have voiced skepticism .
the npd is an anti-immigrant party that has close links to neo-nazis and is represented in the parliaments of two states in the former communist east germany .
eastern germany has seen disproportionate rates of violence against foreigners since german reunification in 1990 , although incidents have also occurred in western germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the indians injured in the attack in mügeln one of the states is saxony , where the indians were attacked and chased through the town of mügeln by a mob of about 50 germans , following a local festival on august 18 .
a crowd of onlookers did not intervene and it took about 70 police to gain control of the situation .
in another incident last weekend in the western state of rhineland-palatinate , two african men were attacked by a group of right-wing extremists , german media reported on friday .
both men were injured , one seriously .
police had kept the news from the media due to their investigation , officials said .
although the npd was not specifically blamed for the attacks , the party and other extreme-right groups are known to be active in the state and other parts of eastern germany .
racist party the npd has been branded as an ideological breeding ground for neo-nazi aggression , and germany 's domestic security agency says it foments racist violence .
it is also considered anti-semitic .
an attempt by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to ban the npd faltered in 2003 after the federal constitutional court refused to hear the case because the government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer stands guard in mügeln near the pizza parlor where the attack took place the interior ministry said friday that although the party met all the requirements to be outlawed , the intelligence service would have to drop surveillance of it if a new attempt were to be made to ban it .
the ministry did not want to see this happen , a spokesman said .
hans-peter uhl , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said he would be happy to see the party banned .
" but i fear that such an attempt would fail and that would be a disaster , " he said .
green party parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele said the previous failed attempt to ban the npd ended in a propaganda victory for the party , and he feared the same could happen if a new attempt were made .
government inactivity ?
some critics have blamed inactivity by the major political parties for the spread of right-wing activity in the eastern states , where unemployment and dissatisfaction are much higher than in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen has promised to do more to combat right-wing extremism the latest violence has prodded the government into action .
family affairs minister ursula von der leyen announced increased assistance to projects aimed at combating right-wing extremism .
" we do n't want to leave the field open to right-wing extremists , " she said friday after a two-day cabinet conclave in the village of meseberg , 70 kilometers north of berlin .
but the government , and particularly her ministry which is responsible for programs to curb extremism , have come under criticism in the press for allegedly not doing enough .
in an editorial in the daily financial times deutschland , the author wrote : " let me tell you one thing , my dear politicians : when some areas of germany are no longer safe for foreigners , and when you no longer see the state 's duty to protect people from other people as part of your jobs , then i wo n't accept that .
do you understand ?
you are responsible for security in this country . "
during campaigning before their election to the state parliament in mecklenburg-western pomerania last september , npd activists set up youth clubs in neglected rural areas and distributed 15,000 cds with songs by right-wing rock bands in a bid to woo younger voters .
charges filed on friday , police in the eastern city of jena said they had filed charges against udo voigt , the npd 's national leader , for inciting racial hatred .
in a speech last weekend , he had proposed the late rudolf hess , adolf hitler 's former deputy , be awarded the nobel peace prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt -lrb- left -rrb- and the head of another far-right party , the dvu , gerhard frey if convicted , voigt could face up to three years in jail or a fine , police said .
founded in 1964 , the npd had its heyday in the late 60s when it was represented in seven state parliaments and narrowly missed clearing the five-percent threshold for representation in the bundestag , the national parliament .
on a national level , the npd plays an insignificant role .
it won only 1.6 per cent of the vote in the last general election in 2005 .
its current membership is put at around 6,000 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case has become a thorn in german-turkish relations . turkey 's antalya coast is enormously popular among german and british tourists for its pristine beaches , sporting activities and nightlife . a 17-year-old high school student from the small northern german town of ülzen , identified as marco w. in german media reports , had spent the easter break with his parents at a five-star hotel resort in side . but on april 12 , marco 's holiday turned into a nightmare . turkish police officers arrested him for having sex with a 13-year-old briton , known in german media as charlotte m. the mother of the manchester girl had accused marco of sexually abusing her daughter after he had been invited up to the girl 's hotel room . marco claims charlotte told him she was fifteen and what has emerged in the german media is a portrait of a manipulative 13-year-old deceiving a youth four years her senior . turkey has also been lambasted by the tabloids , commentators and politicians for its treatment of a juvenile .
much has been made of marco 's psychological state and the decrepit conditions of the detention cell , which he has been sharing with 30 other inmates for the past four months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- left -rrb- talked to turkey 's gül about marco german politicians have intervened on marco 's behalf at the highest levels .
chancellor angela merkel made public assurances that she would help marco and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke privately to his turkish counterpart , abdullah gül , who is likely to be elected turkey 's next president at the end of this month .
gül said that he could not interfere with turkey 's independent judiciary . different stories marco claims the two only kissed and engaged in " heavy petting , " consensually .
no sexual intercourse took place , he has said . on aug .
8 , a gynecologist who had examined charlotte said that there was no evidence of assault and the girl was still a virgin .
but there was sexual penetration , insisted charlotte 's lawyer ömer aycan , who told his client 's side of the story in a telephone interview with dw-world.de from antalya . charlotte has claimed that she was asleep in the double room when marco and another boy knocked on the door after midnight .
she asked marco to leave , but he refused and proceeded to force himself on her .
charlotte screamed , alerting other teenagers in the room , and marco fled . " charlotte refused to have sex with marco , so i can use the word rape .
he raped a 13-year-old girl , " said aycan , who added that charlotte 's age was known to the german youth . sexual contact without the use of force is criminal under turkish law when one of the individuals involved is under 15 .
aycan is seeking the maximum conviction , a sentence of fifteen years , although that penalty would be reduced by a third since marco is also a minor . statutory rape laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco is awaiting trial in an antalya prison the case has thrust turkey 's judicial system in the spotlight and reinforced the german perception that the predominantly muslim country is backward in its sexual attitudes , and therefore does not belong in the european union . but legal experts say that turkey has made tremendous strides in bringing its laws in line with eu norms , and the case would have been handled no differently in germany , england or the us . " the mother of the girl charged a young man with child abuse .
the prosecutors had no choice but to arrest marco , " said christian rumpf , an attorney in stuttgart who is an expert on turkish law . in turkey as in germany , any foreigner charged with a crime must remain in detention until cleared of the charges , said rumpf , who does not believe that marco will be easily acquitted . the law governing sex with underage minors , or " statutory rape , " is taken seriously in turkey and other countries .
the legal " age of consent " for sex can range from 14 to 18 years , depending on country or even different regions of the same country .
the law is meant to protect children and adolescents from being coerced by an older individual into having sex , but also applies to sexual activity between teens of similar ages . " where do you draw the line between the normal sexuality of teenagers and protecting a child from sexual abuse ? " asked rumpf . germany would have prosecuted too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kissing is not a felony at any age , but sex is in germany , that line is drawn at age 14 . " kissing is not a felony in germany at any age , if that is all they did .
but sexual contact is illegal in germany when one of them is under 14 , " said heribert ostendorf , a former federal prosecutor who heads the program for juvenile law and crime prevention at the university of kiel . " most people just do n't know the specifics of child-abuse laws in germany and that marco would have also been prosecuted in his own country , " he said , adding that the burden is on marco to prove that he did not know that charlotte was only 13 . " ignorance of the law is no protection from being punished by it , " he said . " there are only victims in this case " the case has resulted in a media circus and charlotte 's family has been hounded by german reporters in manchester .
the girl did not show up for the last hearing because of the publicity glare , according to aycan . " there are only victims in this case - marco , charlotte , and even the turkish justice system , which is facing intense scrutiny from germany , britain and the eu .
the turkish judges are under tremendous pressure and can not afford to make mistakes , " said lale akgün , a turkish-born social democratic parliamentarian in the german bundestag who served for many years as a family and youth counselor for the city of cologne . akgün also believes the case has been damaging for german-turkish relations .
news commentators in turkey were outraged that german politicians tried to influence a matter that belongs in the courts .

" most people just do n't know the specifics of child-abuse laws in germany and that marco would have also been prosecuted in his own country , " he said , adding that the burden is on marco to prove that he did not know that charlotte was only 13 . " ignorance of the law is no protection from being punished by it , " he said . " there are only victims in this case " the case has resulted in a media circus and charlotte 's family has been hounded by german reporters in manchester .
the girl did not show up for the last hearing because of the publicity glare , according to aycan . " there are only victims in this case - marco , charlotte , and even the turkish justice system , which is facing intense scrutiny from germany , britain and the eu .
the turkish judges are under tremendous pressure and can not afford to make mistakes , " said lale akgün , a turkish-born social democratic parliamentarian in the german bundestag who served for many years as a family and youth counselor for the city of cologne . akgün also believes the case has been damaging for german-turkish relations .
news commentators in turkey were outraged that german politicians tried to influence a matter that belongs in the courts .

wilson was 17 at the time , but his girlfriend was only 15 .
he was charged and convicted of child molestation . the wilson case has gotten wide publicity in the united states , and many americans are now questioning whether the statutory rape laws that are meant to protect minors go too far . in june , an appeal courts judge called wilson 's prison term " a grave miscarriage of justice , " but the former star athlete still remains behind bars . meanwhile marco 's next trial date in antalya is on september 6 .

" merkel arrives in china on monday and will meet president hu jintao , premier wen jiabao as well as cultural and civil rights groups .
she heads to japan on wednesday where she will talk to leaders there about climate change and economic issues . sudan , which has had a tense relationship with the west for some time now , expelled the european union and canadian envoys earlier this week after accusing them of " interfering " in the country 's internal affairs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western pressure has done little to improve darfur 's suffering however , eu envoy kent degerfelt has been given a reprieve by sudan .
khartoum will allow to remain until his tenure expires next month , following an eu apology , according to a presidential adviser who spoke on saturday . china has substantial economic interests in the african nation and has been under pressure to do more to quell the violence there , which is estimated to have cost 200,000 lives and displaced around 2.5 million people . urged to be tough on china on saturday , amnesty international called on merkel to also address the top of human rights in china itself when she meets the country 's leaders . " we hope that chancellor merkel will speak forcefully about the disastrous human rights situation in china , " said barbara lochbihler , secretary general of the human rights group 's german section . " the continued human rights violations in china are in strong contrast to the official pledges to improve the human rights situation , " she told the dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups say abuses continue in china in the lead-up to the 2008 olympics she said she expected chinese authorities to " continue their harassment of human rights campaigners " ahead of the olympic games that will take place in beijing next year .
there were also fears that journalists would be subjected to increased pressure before the games begin , she said . the chancellor raised the issue of human rights and appealed for more democracy when she met chinese leaders during a previous visit to the world 's most populous nation . officials in berlin say merkel will not shy away from difficult areas this time and will bring up the topics of human rights and press freedom in her official talks in the chinese capital .
she is scheduled to meet chinese journalists , but it is not clear which ones and whether these have been put under pressure by chinese authorities . calling the human rights situation in china " catastrophic , " lochbihler pointed out that the death sentence can be imposed for around 70 different crimes , including drug possession and tax evasion . even the right of citizens to freedom of information is severely restricted , she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 25.08.2007 as germany struggles with extremism , calls for new party ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a previous failed attempt , new calls are going out to ban the far-right npd party calls to ban the far-right npd party have resurfaced in germany following a mob attack which left eight indians injured .
in a separate incident , that party 's leader has been charged with incitement of racial hatred . the racially motivated attack on eight indians in the eastern town of mügeln continues to resonate in germany and the leader of the co-ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , spoke out in favor of a starting the process that would ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
but other political leaders and the interior ministry have voiced skepticism .
the npd is an anti-immigrant party that has close links to neo-nazis and is represented in the parliaments of two states in the former communist east germany .
eastern germany has seen disproportionate rates of violence against foreigners since german reunification in 1990 , although incidents have also occurred in western germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the indians injured in the attack in mügeln one of the states is saxony , where the indians were attacked and chased through the town of mügeln by a mob of about 50 germans , following a local festival on august 18 .
a crowd of onlookers did not intervene and it took about 70 police to gain control of the situation .
in another incident last weekend in the western state of rhineland-palatinate , two african men were attacked by a group of right-wing extremists , german media reported on friday .
both men were injured , one seriously .
police had kept the news from the media due to their investigation , officials said .
although the npd was not specifically blamed for the attacks , the party and other extreme-right groups are known to be active in the state and other parts of eastern germany .
racist party the npd has been branded as an ideological breeding ground for neo-nazi aggression , and germany 's domestic security agency says it foments racist violence .
it is also considered anti-semitic .
an attempt by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to ban the npd faltered in 2003 after the federal constitutional court refused to hear the case because the government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer stands guard in mügeln near the pizza parlor where the attack took place the interior ministry said friday that although the party met all the requirements to be outlawed , the intelligence service would have to drop surveillance of it if a new attempt were to be made to ban it .
the ministry did not want to see this happen , a spokesman said .
hans-peter uhl , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said he would be happy to see the party banned .
" but i fear that such an attempt would fail and that would be a disaster , " he said .
green party parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele said the previous failed attempt to ban the npd ended in a propaganda victory for the party , and he feared the same could happen if a new attempt were made .
government inactivity ?
some critics have blamed inactivity by the major political parties for the spread of right-wing activity in the eastern states , where unemployment and dissatisfaction are much higher than in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen has promised to do more to combat right-wing extremism the latest violence has prodded the government into action .
family affairs minister ursula von der leyen announced increased assistance to projects aimed at combating right-wing extremism .
" we do n't want to leave the field open to right-wing extremists , " she said friday after a two-day cabinet conclave in the village of meseberg , 70 kilometers north of berlin .
but the government , and particularly her ministry which is responsible for programs to curb extremism , have come under criticism in the press for allegedly not doing enough .
in an editorial in the daily financial times deutschland , the author wrote : " let me tell you one thing , my dear politicians : when some areas of germany are no longer safe for foreigners , and when you no longer see the state 's duty to protect people from other people as part of your jobs , then i wo n't accept that .
do you understand ?
you are responsible for security in this country . "
during campaigning before their election to the state parliament in mecklenburg-western pomerania last september , npd activists set up youth clubs in neglected rural areas and distributed 15,000 cds with songs by right-wing rock bands in a bid to woo younger voters .
charges filed on friday , police in the eastern city of jena said they had filed charges against udo voigt , the npd 's national leader , for inciting racial hatred .
in a speech last weekend , he had proposed the late rudolf hess , adolf hitler 's former deputy , be awarded the nobel peace prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt -lrb- left -rrb- and the head of another far-right party , the dvu , gerhard frey if convicted , voigt could face up to three years in jail or a fine , police said .
founded in 1964 , the npd had its heyday in the late 60s when it was represented in seven state parliaments and narrowly missed clearing the five-percent threshold for representation in the bundestag , the national parliament .
on a national level , the npd plays an insignificant role .
it won only 1.6 per cent of the vote in the last general election in 2005 .
its current membership is put at around 6,000 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 25.08.2007 as germany struggles with extremism , calls for new party ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a previous failed attempt , new calls are going out to ban the far-right npd party calls to ban the far-right npd party have resurfaced in germany following a mob attack which left eight indians injured .
in a separate incident , that party 's leader has been charged with incitement of racial hatred . the racially motivated attack on eight indians in the eastern town of mügeln continues to resonate in germany and the leader of the co-ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , spoke out in favor of a starting the process that would ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
but other political leaders and the interior ministry have voiced skepticism .
the npd is an anti-immigrant party that has close links to neo-nazis and is represented in the parliaments of two states in the former communist east germany .
eastern germany has seen disproportionate rates of violence against foreigners since german reunification in 1990 , although incidents have also occurred in western germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the indians injured in the attack in mügeln one of the states is saxony , where the indians were attacked and chased through the town of mügeln by a mob of about 50 germans , following a local festival on august 18 .
a crowd of onlookers did not intervene and it took about 70 police to gain control of the situation .
in another incident last weekend in the western state of rhineland-palatinate , two african men were attacked by a group of right-wing extremists , german media reported on friday .
both men were injured , one seriously .
police had kept the news from the media due to their investigation , officials said .
although the npd was not specifically blamed for the attacks , the party and other extreme-right groups are known to be active in the state and other parts of eastern germany .
racist party the npd has been branded as an ideological breeding ground for neo-nazi aggression , and germany 's domestic security agency says it foments racist violence .
it is also considered anti-semitic .
an attempt by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to ban the npd faltered in 2003 after the federal constitutional court refused to hear the case because the government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer stands guard in mügeln near the pizza parlor where the attack took place the interior ministry said friday that although the party met all the requirements to be outlawed , the intelligence service would have to drop surveillance of it if a new attempt were to be made to ban it .
the ministry did not want to see this happen , a spokesman said .
hans-peter uhl , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said he would be happy to see the party banned .
" but i fear that such an attempt would fail and that would be a disaster , " he said .
green party parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele said the previous failed attempt to ban the npd ended in a propaganda victory for the party , and he feared the same could happen if a new attempt were made .
government inactivity ?
some critics have blamed inactivity by the major political parties for the spread of right-wing activity in the eastern states , where unemployment and dissatisfaction are much higher than in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen has promised to do more to combat right-wing extremism the latest violence has prodded the government into action .
family affairs minister ursula von der leyen announced increased assistance to projects aimed at combating right-wing extremism .
" we do n't want to leave the field open to right-wing extremists , " she said friday after a two-day cabinet conclave in the village of meseberg , 70 kilometers north of berlin .
but the government , and particularly her ministry which is responsible for programs to curb extremism , have come under criticism in the press for allegedly not doing enough .
in an editorial in the daily financial times deutschland , the author wrote : " let me tell you one thing , my dear politicians : when some areas of germany are no longer safe for foreigners , and when you no longer see the state 's duty to protect people from other people as part of your jobs , then i wo n't accept that .
do you understand ?
you are responsible for security in this country . "
during campaigning before their election to the state parliament in mecklenburg-western pomerania last september , npd activists set up youth clubs in neglected rural areas and distributed 15,000 cds with songs by right-wing rock bands in a bid to woo younger voters .
charges filed on friday , police in the eastern city of jena said they had filed charges against udo voigt , the npd 's national leader , for inciting racial hatred .
in a speech last weekend , he had proposed the late rudolf hess , adolf hitler 's former deputy , be awarded the nobel peace prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt -lrb- left -rrb- and the head of another far-right party , the dvu , gerhard frey if convicted , voigt could face up to three years in jail or a fine , police said .
founded in 1964 , the npd had its heyday in the late 60s when it was represented in seven state parliaments and narrowly missed clearing the five-percent threshold for representation in the bundestag , the national parliament .
on a national level , the npd plays an insignificant role .
it won only 1.6 per cent of the vote in the last general election in 2005 .
its current membership is put at around 6,000 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case has become a thorn in german-turkish relations . turkey 's antalya coast is enormously popular among german and british tourists for its pristine beaches , sporting activities and nightlife . a 17-year-old high school student from the small northern german town of ülzen , identified as marco w. in german media reports , had spent the easter break with his parents at a five-star hotel resort in side . but on april 12 , marco 's holiday turned into a nightmare . turkish police officers arrested him for having sex with a 13-year-old briton , known in german media as charlotte m. the mother of the manchester girl had accused marco of sexually abusing her daughter after he had been invited up to the girl 's hotel room . marco claims charlotte told him she was fifteen and what has emerged in the german media is a portrait of a manipulative 13-year-old deceiving a youth four years her senior . turkey has also been lambasted by the tabloids , commentators and politicians for its treatment of a juvenile .
much has been made of marco 's psychological state and the decrepit conditions of the detention cell , which he has been sharing with 30 other inmates for the past four months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- left -rrb- talked to turkey 's gül about marco german politicians have intervened on marco 's behalf at the highest levels .
chancellor angela merkel made public assurances that she would help marco and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke privately to his turkish counterpart , abdullah gül , who is likely to be elected turkey 's next president at the end of this month .
gül said that he could not interfere with turkey 's independent judiciary . different stories marco claims the two only kissed and engaged in " heavy petting , " consensually .
no sexual intercourse took place , he has said . on aug .
8 , a gynecologist who had examined charlotte said that there was no evidence of assault and the girl was still a virgin .
but there was sexual penetration , insisted charlotte 's lawyer ömer aycan , who told his client 's side of the story in a telephone interview with dw-world.de from antalya . charlotte has claimed that she was asleep in the double room when marco and another boy knocked on the door after midnight .
she asked marco to leave , but he refused and proceeded to force himself on her .
charlotte screamed , alerting other teenagers in the room , and marco fled . " charlotte refused to have sex with marco , so i can use the word rape .
he raped a 13-year-old girl , " said aycan , who added that charlotte 's age was known to the german youth . sexual contact without the use of force is criminal under turkish law when one of the individuals involved is under 15 .
aycan is seeking the maximum conviction , a sentence of fifteen years , although that penalty would be reduced by a third since marco is also a minor . statutory rape laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco is awaiting trial in an antalya prison the case has thrust turkey 's judicial system in the spotlight and reinforced the german perception that the predominantly muslim country is backward in its sexual attitudes , and therefore does not belong in the european union . but legal experts say that turkey has made tremendous strides in bringing its laws in line with eu norms , and the case would have been handled no differently in germany , england or the us . " the mother of the girl charged a young man with child abuse .
the prosecutors had no choice but to arrest marco , " said christian rumpf , an attorney in stuttgart who is an expert on turkish law . in turkey as in germany , any foreigner charged with a crime must remain in detention until cleared of the charges , said rumpf , who does not believe that marco will be easily acquitted . the law governing sex with underage minors , or " statutory rape , " is taken seriously in turkey and other countries .
the legal " age of consent " for sex can range from 14 to 18 years , depending on country or even different regions of the same country .
the law is meant to protect children and adolescents from being coerced by an older individual into having sex , but also applies to sexual activity between teens of similar ages . " where do you draw the line between the normal sexuality of teenagers and protecting a child from sexual abuse ? " asked rumpf . germany would have prosecuted too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kissing is not a felony at any age , but sex is in germany , that line is drawn at age 14 . " kissing is not a felony in germany at any age , if that is all they did .
but sexual contact is illegal in germany when one of them is under 14 , " said heribert ostendorf , a former federal prosecutor who heads the program for juvenile law and crime prevention at the university of kiel . " most people just do n't know the specifics of child-abuse laws in germany and that marco would have also been prosecuted in his own country , " he said , adding that the burden is on marco to prove that he did not know that charlotte was only 13 . " ignorance of the law is no protection from being punished by it , " he said . " there are only victims in this case " the case has resulted in a media circus and charlotte 's family has been hounded by german reporters in manchester .
the girl did not show up for the last hearing because of the publicity glare , according to aycan . " there are only victims in this case - marco , charlotte , and even the turkish justice system , which is facing intense scrutiny from germany , britain and the eu .
the turkish judges are under tremendous pressure and can not afford to make mistakes , " said lale akgün , a turkish-born social democratic parliamentarian in the german bundestag who served for many years as a family and youth counselor for the city of cologne . akgün also believes the case has been damaging for german-turkish relations .

the case has become a thorn in german-turkish relations . turkey 's antalya coast is enormously popular among german and british tourists for its pristine beaches , sporting activities and nightlife . a 17-year-old high school student from the small northern german town of ülzen , identified as marco w. in german media reports , had spent the easter break with his parents at a five-star hotel resort in side . but on april 12 , marco 's holiday turned into a nightmare . turkish police officers arrested him for having sex with a 13-year-old briton , known in german media as charlotte m. the mother of the manchester girl had accused marco of sexually abusing her daughter after he had been invited up to the girl 's hotel room . marco claims charlotte told him she was fifteen and what has emerged in the german media is a portrait of a manipulative 13-year-old deceiving a youth four years her senior . turkey has also been lambasted by the tabloids , commentators and politicians for its treatment of a juvenile .
much has been made of marco 's psychological state and the decrepit conditions of the detention cell , which he has been sharing with 30 other inmates for the past four months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- left -rrb- talked to turkey 's gül about marco german politicians have intervened on marco 's behalf at the highest levels .
chancellor angela merkel made public assurances that she would help marco and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke privately to his turkish counterpart , abdullah gül , who is likely to be elected turkey 's next president at the end of this month .
gül said that he could not interfere with turkey 's independent judiciary . different stories marco claims the two only kissed and engaged in " heavy petting , " consensually .
no sexual intercourse took place , he has said . on aug .
8 , a gynecologist who had examined charlotte said that there was no evidence of assault and the girl was still a virgin .
but there was sexual penetration , insisted charlotte 's lawyer ömer aycan , who told his client 's side of the story in a telephone interview with dw-world.de from antalya . charlotte has claimed that she was asleep in the double room when marco and another boy knocked on the door after midnight .
she asked marco to leave , but he refused and proceeded to force himself on her .
charlotte screamed , alerting other teenagers in the room , and marco fled . " charlotte refused to have sex with marco , so i can use the word rape .
he raped a 13-year-old girl , " said aycan , who added that charlotte 's age was known to the german youth . sexual contact without the use of force is criminal under turkish law when one of the individuals involved is under 15 .
aycan is seeking the maximum conviction , a sentence of fifteen years , although that penalty would be reduced by a third since marco is also a minor . statutory rape laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco is awaiting trial in an antalya prison the case has thrust turkey 's judicial system in the spotlight and reinforced the german perception that the predominantly muslim country is backward in its sexual attitudes , and therefore does not belong in the european union . but legal experts say that turkey has made tremendous strides in bringing its laws in line with eu norms , and the case would have been handled no differently in germany , england or the us . " the mother of the girl charged a young man with child abuse .
the prosecutors had no choice but to arrest marco , " said christian rumpf , an attorney in stuttgart who is an expert on turkish law . in turkey as in germany , any foreigner charged with a crime must remain in detention until cleared of the charges , said rumpf , who does not believe that marco will be easily acquitted . the law governing sex with underage minors , or " statutory rape , " is taken seriously in turkey and other countries .
the legal " age of consent " for sex can range from 14 to 18 years , depending on country or even different regions of the same country .
the law is meant to protect children and adolescents from being coerced by an older individual into having sex , but also applies to sexual activity between teens of similar ages . " where do you draw the line between the normal sexuality of teenagers and protecting a child from sexual abuse ? " asked rumpf . germany would have prosecuted too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kissing is not a felony at any age , but sex is in germany , that line is drawn at age 14 . " kissing is not a felony in germany at any age , if that is all they did .
but sexual contact is illegal in germany when one of them is under 14 , " said heribert ostendorf , a former federal prosecutor who heads the program for juvenile law and crime prevention at the university of kiel . " most people just do n't know the specifics of child-abuse laws in germany and that marco would have also been prosecuted in his own country , " he said , adding that the burden is on marco to prove that he did not know that charlotte was only 13 . " ignorance of the law is no protection from being punished by it , " he said . " there are only victims in this case " the case has resulted in a media circus and charlotte 's family has been hounded by german reporters in manchester .
the girl did not show up for the last hearing because of the publicity glare , according to aycan . " there are only victims in this case - marco , charlotte , and even the turkish justice system , which is facing intense scrutiny from germany , britain and the eu .
the turkish judges are under tremendous pressure and can not afford to make mistakes , " said lale akgün , a turkish-born social democratic parliamentarian in the german bundestag who served for many years as a family and youth counselor for the city of cologne . akgün also believes the case has been damaging for german-turkish relations .
news commentators in turkey were outraged that german politicians tried to influence a matter that belongs in the courts . " the intervention of steinmeier has put even more pressure on the turkish judiciary to prove that it is capable of making independent decisions without being swayed by politics , " she said . parallels in the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's antalya coast is popular among german tourists in the united states , former president jimmy carter and democratic presidential hopeful barack obama unsuccessfully lobbied georgia 's high court to overturn the conviction of genarlow wilson , who is serving a ten-year jail sentence for having oral sex with his girlfriend . the girl never filed charges , but the act was caught on videotape at a new year 's eve party in 2003 , and wound up in the hands of georgia state prosecutors .
in georgia , the age of consent is 16 years of age .
wilson was 17 at the time , but his girlfriend was only 15 .
he was charged and convicted of child molestation . the wilson case has gotten wide publicity in the united states , and many americans are now questioning whether the statutory rape laws that are meant to protect minors go too far . in june , an appeal courts judge called wilson 's prison term " a grave miscarriage of justice , " but the former star athlete still remains behind bars . meanwhile marco 's next trial date in antalya is on september 6 .
the judicial process in this instanced is not unusually long , considering the backlog of cases in turkish courts and the time required to depose witnesses in three different countries , according to christian rumpf . " we need to let the turkish courts do their job and do it right , " said lale akgün .

" merkel arrives in china on monday and will meet president hu jintao , premier wen jiabao as well as cultural and civil rights groups .
she heads to japan on wednesday where she will talk to leaders there about climate change and economic issues . sudan , which has had a tense relationship with the west for some time now , expelled the european union and canadian envoys earlier this week after accusing them of " interfering " in the country 's internal affairs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western pressure has done little to improve darfur 's suffering however , eu envoy kent degerfelt has been given a reprieve by sudan .

" we hope that chancellor merkel will speak forcefully about the disastrous human rights situation in china , " said barbara lochbihler , secretary general of the human rights group 's german section .

she is scheduled to meet chinese journalists , but it is not clear which ones and whether these have been put under pressure by chinese authorities . calling the human rights situation in china " catastrophic , " lochbihler pointed out that the death sentence can be imposed for around 70 different crimes , including drug possession and tax evasion . even the right of citizens to freedom of information is severely restricted , she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 25.08.2007 as germany struggles with extremism , calls for new party ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a previous failed attempt , new calls are going out to ban the far-right npd party calls to ban the far-right npd party have resurfaced in germany following a mob attack which left eight indians injured .
in a separate incident , that party 's leader has been charged with incitement of racial hatred . the racially motivated attack on eight indians in the eastern town of mügeln continues to resonate in germany and the leader of the co-ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , spoke out in favor of a starting the process that would ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
but other political leaders and the interior ministry have voiced skepticism .
the npd is an anti-immigrant party that has close links to neo-nazis and is represented in the parliaments of two states in the former communist east germany .
eastern germany has seen disproportionate rates of violence against foreigners since german reunification in 1990 , although incidents have also occurred in western germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the indians injured in the attack in mügeln one of the states is saxony , where the indians were attacked and chased through the town of mügeln by a mob of about 50 germans , following a local festival on august 18 .
a crowd of onlookers did not intervene and it took about 70 police to gain control of the situation .
in another incident last weekend in the western state of rhineland-palatinate , two african men were attacked by a group of right-wing extremists , german media reported on friday .
both men were injured , one seriously .
police had kept the news from the media due to their investigation , officials said .
although the npd was not specifically blamed for the attacks , the party and other extreme-right groups are known to be active in the state and other parts of eastern germany .
racist party the npd has been branded as an ideological breeding ground for neo-nazi aggression , and germany 's domestic security agency says it foments racist violence .
it is also considered anti-semitic .
an attempt by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to ban the npd faltered in 2003 after the federal constitutional court refused to hear the case because the government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer stands guard in mügeln near the pizza parlor where the attack took place the interior ministry said friday that although the party met all the requirements to be outlawed , the intelligence service would have to drop surveillance of it if a new attempt were to be made to ban it .
the ministry did not want to see this happen , a spokesman said .
hans-peter uhl , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said he would be happy to see the party banned .
" but i fear that such an attempt would fail and that would be a disaster , " he said .
green party parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele said the previous failed attempt to ban the npd ended in a propaganda victory for the party , and he feared the same could happen if a new attempt were made .
government inactivity ?
some critics have blamed inactivity by the major political parties for the spread of right-wing activity in the eastern states , where unemployment and dissatisfaction are much higher than in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen has promised to do more to combat right-wing extremism the latest violence has prodded the government into action .
family affairs minister ursula von der leyen announced increased assistance to projects aimed at combating right-wing extremism .
" we do n't want to leave the field open to right-wing extremists , " she said friday after a two-day cabinet conclave in the village of meseberg , 70 kilometers north of berlin .
but the government , and particularly her ministry which is responsible for programs to curb extremism , have come under criticism in the press for allegedly not doing enough .
in an editorial in the daily financial times deutschland , the author wrote : " let me tell you one thing , my dear politicians : when some areas of germany are no longer safe for foreigners , and when you no longer see the state 's duty to protect people from other people as part of your jobs , then i wo n't accept that .
do you understand ?
you are responsible for security in this country . "
during campaigning before their election to the state parliament in mecklenburg-western pomerania last september , npd activists set up youth clubs in neglected rural areas and distributed 15,000 cds with songs by right-wing rock bands in a bid to woo younger voters .
charges filed on friday , police in the eastern city of jena said they had filed charges against udo voigt , the npd 's national leader , for inciting racial hatred .
in a speech last weekend , he had proposed the late rudolf hess , adolf hitler 's former deputy , be awarded the nobel peace prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt -lrb- left -rrb- and the head of another far-right party , the dvu , gerhard frey if convicted , voigt could face up to three years in jail or a fine , police said .
founded in 1964 , the npd had its heyday in the late 60s when it was represented in seven state parliaments and narrowly missed clearing the five-percent threshold for representation in the bundestag , the national parliament .
on a national level , the npd plays an insignificant role .
it won only 1.6 per cent of the vote in the last general election in 2005 .
its current membership is put at around 6,000 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" merkel arrives in china on monday and will meet president hu jintao , premier wen jiabao as well as cultural and civil rights groups .
she heads to japan on wednesday where she will talk to leaders there about climate change and economic issues . sudan , which has had a tense relationship with the west for some time now , expelled the european union and canadian envoys earlier this week after accusing them of " interfering " in the country 's internal affairs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western pressure has done little to improve darfur 's suffering however , eu envoy kent degerfelt has been given a reprieve by sudan .

there were also fears that journalists would be subjected to increased pressure before the games begin , she said . the chancellor raised the issue of human rights and appealed for more democracy when she met chinese leaders during a previous visit to the world 's most populous nation . officials in berlin say merkel will not shy away from difficult areas this time and will bring up the topics of human rights and press freedom in her official talks in the chinese capital .
she is scheduled to meet chinese journalists , but it is not clear which ones and whether these have been put under pressure by chinese authorities . calling the human rights situation in china " catastrophic , " lochbihler pointed out that the death sentence can be imposed for around 70 different crimes , including drug possession and tax evasion . even the right of citizens to freedom of information is severely restricted , she said .

in a separate incident , that party 's leader has been charged with incitement of racial hatred . the racially motivated attack on eight indians in the eastern town of mügeln continues to resonate in germany and the leader of the co-ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , spoke out in favor of a starting the process that would ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
but other political leaders and the interior ministry have voiced skepticism .
the npd is an anti-immigrant party that has close links to neo-nazis and is represented in the parliaments of two states in the former communist east germany .
eastern germany has seen disproportionate rates of violence against foreigners since german reunification in 1990 , although incidents have also occurred in western germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the indians injured in the attack in mügeln one of the states is saxony , where the indians were attacked and chased through the town of mügeln by a mob of about 50 germans , following a local festival on august 18 .
a crowd of onlookers did not intervene and it took about 70 police to gain control of the situation .
in another incident last weekend in the western state of rhineland-palatinate , two african men were attacked by a group of right-wing extremists , german media reported on friday .
both men were injured , one seriously .
police had kept the news from the media due to their investigation , officials said .
although the npd was not specifically blamed for the attacks , the party and other extreme-right groups are known to be active in the state and other parts of eastern germany .
racist party the npd has been branded as an ideological breeding ground for neo-nazi aggression , and germany 's domestic security agency says it foments racist violence .
it is also considered anti-semitic .
an attempt by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to ban the npd faltered in 2003 after the federal constitutional court refused to hear the case because the government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer stands guard in mügeln near the pizza parlor where the attack took place the interior ministry said friday that although the party met all the requirements to be outlawed , the intelligence service would have to drop surveillance of it if a new attempt were to be made to ban it .
the ministry did not want to see this happen , a spokesman said .
hans-peter uhl , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said he would be happy to see the party banned .
" but i fear that such an attempt would fail and that would be a disaster , " he said .
green party parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele said the previous failed attempt to ban the npd ended in a propaganda victory for the party , and he feared the same could happen if a new attempt were made .
government inactivity ?
some critics have blamed inactivity by the major political parties for the spread of right-wing activity in the eastern states , where unemployment and dissatisfaction are much higher than in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen has promised to do more to combat right-wing extremism the latest violence has prodded the government into action .
family affairs minister ursula von der leyen announced increased assistance to projects aimed at combating right-wing extremism .
" we do n't want to leave the field open to right-wing extremists , " she said friday after a two-day cabinet conclave in the village of meseberg , 70 kilometers north of berlin .
but the government , and particularly her ministry which is responsible for programs to curb extremism , have come under criticism in the press for allegedly not doing enough .
in an editorial in the daily financial times deutschland , the author wrote : " let me tell you one thing , my dear politicians : when some areas of germany are no longer safe for foreigners , and when you no longer see the state 's duty to protect people from other people as part of your jobs , then i wo n't accept that .
do you understand ?
you are responsible for security in this country . "
during campaigning before their election to the state parliament in mecklenburg-western pomerania last september , npd activists set up youth clubs in neglected rural areas and distributed 15,000 cds with songs by right-wing rock bands in a bid to woo younger voters .
charges filed on friday , police in the eastern city of jena said they had filed charges against udo voigt , the npd 's national leader , for inciting racial hatred .
in a speech last weekend , he had proposed the late rudolf hess , adolf hitler 's former deputy , be awarded the nobel peace prize .

the case has become a thorn in german-turkish relations . turkey 's antalya coast is enormously popular among german and british tourists for its pristine beaches , sporting activities and nightlife . a 17-year-old high school student from the small northern german town of ülzen , identified as marco w. in german media reports , had spent the easter break with his parents at a five-star hotel resort in side . but on april 12 , marco 's holiday turned into a nightmare . turkish police officers arrested him for having sex with a 13-year-old briton , known in german media as charlotte m. the mother of the manchester girl had accused marco of sexually abusing her daughter after he had been invited up to the girl 's hotel room . marco claims charlotte told him she was fifteen and what has emerged in the german media is a portrait of a manipulative 13-year-old deceiving a youth four years her senior . turkey has also been lambasted by the tabloids , commentators and politicians for its treatment of a juvenile .
much has been made of marco 's psychological state and the decrepit conditions of the detention cell , which he has been sharing with 30 other inmates for the past four months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- left -rrb- talked to turkey 's gül about marco german politicians have intervened on marco 's behalf at the highest levels .
chancellor angela merkel made public assurances that she would help marco and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke privately to his turkish counterpart , abdullah gül , who is likely to be elected turkey 's next president at the end of this month .
gül said that he could not interfere with turkey 's independent judiciary . different stories marco claims the two only kissed and engaged in " heavy petting , " consensually .
no sexual intercourse took place , he has said . on aug .
8 , a gynecologist who had examined charlotte said that there was no evidence of assault and the girl was still a virgin .
but there was sexual penetration , insisted charlotte 's lawyer ömer aycan , who told his client 's side of the story in a telephone interview with dw-world.de from antalya . charlotte has claimed that she was asleep in the double room when marco and another boy knocked on the door after midnight .
she asked marco to leave , but he refused and proceeded to force himself on her .
charlotte screamed , alerting other teenagers in the room , and marco fled . " charlotte refused to have sex with marco , so i can use the word rape .
he raped a 13-year-old girl , " said aycan , who added that charlotte 's age was known to the german youth . sexual contact without the use of force is criminal under turkish law when one of the individuals involved is under 15 .
aycan is seeking the maximum conviction , a sentence of fifteen years , although that penalty would be reduced by a third since marco is also a minor . statutory rape laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco is awaiting trial in an antalya prison the case has thrust turkey 's judicial system in the spotlight and reinforced the german perception that the predominantly muslim country is backward in its sexual attitudes , and therefore does not belong in the european union . but legal experts say that turkey has made tremendous strides in bringing its laws in line with eu norms , and the case would have been handled no differently in germany , england or the us . " the mother of the girl charged a young man with child abuse .
the prosecutors had no choice but to arrest marco , " said christian rumpf , an attorney in stuttgart who is an expert on turkish law . in turkey as in germany , any foreigner charged with a crime must remain in detention until cleared of the charges , said rumpf , who does not believe that marco will be easily acquitted . the law governing sex with underage minors , or " statutory rape , " is taken seriously in turkey and other countries .
the legal " age of consent " for sex can range from 14 to 18 years , depending on country or even different regions of the same country .
the law is meant to protect children and adolescents from being coerced by an older individual into having sex , but also applies to sexual activity between teens of similar ages .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 25.08.2007 teen sex case puts turkey 's judicial system in spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco thought the british girl was 15 teenagers are rarely prosecuted for having sex , but a 13-year-old british girl has managed to put a 17-year old-german boy behind bars in turkey .
the case has become a thorn in german-turkish relations . turkey 's antalya coast is enormously popular among german and british tourists for its pristine beaches , sporting activities and nightlife . a 17-year-old high school student from the small northern german town of ülzen , identified as marco w. in german media reports , had spent the easter break with his parents at a five-star hotel resort in side . but on april 12 , marco 's holiday turned into a nightmare . turkish police officers arrested him for having sex with a 13-year-old briton , known in german media as charlotte m. the mother of the manchester girl had accused marco of sexually abusing her daughter after he had been invited up to the girl 's hotel room . marco claims charlotte told him she was fifteen and what has emerged in the german media is a portrait of a manipulative 13-year-old deceiving a youth four years her senior . turkey has also been lambasted by the tabloids , commentators and politicians for its treatment of a juvenile .
much has been made of marco 's psychological state and the decrepit conditions of the detention cell , which he has been sharing with 30 other inmates for the past four months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- left -rrb- talked to turkey 's gül about marco german politicians have intervened on marco 's behalf at the highest levels .
chancellor angela merkel made public assurances that she would help marco and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke privately to his turkish counterpart , abdullah gül , who is likely to be elected turkey 's next president at the end of this month .
gül said that he could not interfere with turkey 's independent judiciary . different stories marco claims the two only kissed and engaged in " heavy petting , " consensually .
no sexual intercourse took place , he has said . on aug .
8 , a gynecologist who had examined charlotte said that there was no evidence of assault and the girl was still a virgin .
but there was sexual penetration , insisted charlotte 's lawyer ömer aycan , who told his client 's side of the story in a telephone interview with dw-world.de from antalya . charlotte has claimed that she was asleep in the double room when marco and another boy knocked on the door after midnight .
she asked marco to leave , but he refused and proceeded to force himself on her .
charlotte screamed , alerting other teenagers in the room , and marco fled . " charlotte refused to have sex with marco , so i can use the word rape .
he raped a 13-year-old girl , " said aycan , who added that charlotte 's age was known to the german youth . sexual contact without the use of force is criminal under turkish law when one of the individuals involved is under 15 .
aycan is seeking the maximum conviction , a sentence of fifteen years , although that penalty would be reduced by a third since marco is also a minor . statutory rape laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco is awaiting trial in an antalya prison the case has thrust turkey 's judicial system in the spotlight and reinforced the german perception that the predominantly muslim country is backward in its sexual attitudes , and therefore does not belong in the european union . but legal experts say that turkey has made tremendous strides in bringing its laws in line with eu norms , and the case would have been handled no differently in germany , england or the us . " the mother of the girl charged a young man with child abuse .
the prosecutors had no choice but to arrest marco , " said christian rumpf , an attorney in stuttgart who is an expert on turkish law . in turkey as in germany , any foreigner charged with a crime must remain in detention until cleared of the charges , said rumpf , who does not believe that marco will be easily acquitted . the law governing sex with underage minors , or " statutory rape , " is taken seriously in turkey and other countries .
the legal " age of consent " for sex can range from 14 to 18 years , depending on country or even different regions of the same country .
the law is meant to protect children and adolescents from being coerced by an older individual into having sex , but also applies to sexual activity between teens of similar ages . " where do you draw the line between the normal sexuality of teenagers and protecting a child from sexual abuse ? " asked rumpf . germany would have prosecuted too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kissing is not a felony at any age , but sex is in germany , that line is drawn at age 14 . " kissing is not a felony in germany at any age , if that is all they did .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 25.08.2007 as germany struggles with extremism , calls for new party ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a previous failed attempt , new calls are going out to ban the far-right npd party calls to ban the far-right npd party have resurfaced in germany following a mob attack which left eight indians injured .
in a separate incident , that party 's leader has been charged with incitement of racial hatred . the racially motivated attack on eight indians in the eastern town of mügeln continues to resonate in germany and the leader of the co-ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , spoke out in favor of a starting the process that would ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
but other political leaders and the interior ministry have voiced skepticism .
the npd is an anti-immigrant party that has close links to neo-nazis and is represented in the parliaments of two states in the former communist east germany .
eastern germany has seen disproportionate rates of violence against foreigners since german reunification in 1990 , although incidents have also occurred in western germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the indians injured in the attack in mügeln one of the states is saxony , where the indians were attacked and chased through the town of mügeln by a mob of about 50 germans , following a local festival on august 18 .
a crowd of onlookers did not intervene and it took about 70 police to gain control of the situation .
in another incident last weekend in the western state of rhineland-palatinate , two african men were attacked by a group of right-wing extremists , german media reported on friday .
both men were injured , one seriously .
police had kept the news from the media due to their investigation , officials said .
although the npd was not specifically blamed for the attacks , the party and other extreme-right groups are known to be active in the state and other parts of eastern germany .
racist party the npd has been branded as an ideological breeding ground for neo-nazi aggression , and germany 's domestic security agency says it foments racist violence .
it is also considered anti-semitic .
an attempt by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to ban the npd faltered in 2003 after the federal constitutional court refused to hear the case because the government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer stands guard in mügeln near the pizza parlor where the attack took place the interior ministry said friday that although the party met all the requirements to be outlawed , the intelligence service would have to drop surveillance of it if a new attempt were to be made to ban it .
the ministry did not want to see this happen , a spokesman said .
hans-peter uhl , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said he would be happy to see the party banned .
" but i fear that such an attempt would fail and that would be a disaster , " he said .
green party parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele said the previous failed attempt to ban the npd ended in a propaganda victory for the party , and he feared the same could happen if a new attempt were made .
government inactivity ?
some critics have blamed inactivity by the major political parties for the spread of right-wing activity in the eastern states , where unemployment and dissatisfaction are much higher than in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen has promised to do more to combat right-wing extremism the latest violence has prodded the government into action .
family affairs minister ursula von der leyen announced increased assistance to projects aimed at combating right-wing extremism .
" we do n't want to leave the field open to right-wing extremists , " she said friday after a two-day cabinet conclave in the village of meseberg , 70 kilometers north of berlin .
but the government , and particularly her ministry which is responsible for programs to curb extremism , have come under criticism in the press for allegedly not doing enough .
in an editorial in the daily financial times deutschland , the author wrote : " let me tell you one thing , my dear politicians : when some areas of germany are no longer safe for foreigners , and when you no longer see the state 's duty to protect people from other people as part of your jobs , then i wo n't accept that .
do you understand ?
you are responsible for security in this country . "
during campaigning before their election to the state parliament in mecklenburg-western pomerania last september , npd activists set up youth clubs in neglected rural areas and distributed 15,000 cds with songs by right-wing rock bands in a bid to woo younger voters .
charges filed on friday , police in the eastern city of jena said they had filed charges against udo voigt , the npd 's national leader , for inciting racial hatred .
in a speech last weekend , he had proposed the late rudolf hess , adolf hitler 's former deputy , be awarded the nobel peace prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt -lrb- left -rrb- and the head of another far-right party , the dvu , gerhard frey if convicted , voigt could face up to three years in jail or a fine , police said .
founded in 1964 , the npd had its heyday in the late 60s when it was represented in seven state parliaments and narrowly missed clearing the five-percent threshold for representation in the bundestag , the national parliament .
on a national level , the npd plays an insignificant role .
it won only 1.6 per cent of the vote in the last general election in 2005 .
its current membership is put at around 6,000 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" merkel arrives in china on monday and will meet president hu jintao , premier wen jiabao as well as cultural and civil rights groups .
she heads to japan on wednesday where she will talk to leaders there about climate change and economic issues . sudan , which has had a tense relationship with the west for some time now , expelled the european union and canadian envoys earlier this week after accusing them of " interfering " in the country 's internal affairs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western pressure has done little to improve darfur 's suffering however , eu envoy kent degerfelt has been given a reprieve by sudan .
khartoum will allow to remain until his tenure expires next month , following an eu apology , according to a presidential adviser who spoke on saturday . china has substantial economic interests in the african nation and has been under pressure to do more to quell the violence there , which is estimated to have cost 200,000 lives and displaced around 2.5 million people . urged to be tough on china on saturday , amnesty international called on merkel to also address the top of human rights in china itself when she meets the country 's leaders . " we hope that chancellor merkel will speak forcefully about the disastrous human rights situation in china , " said barbara lochbihler , secretary general of the human rights group 's german section . " the continued human rights violations in china are in strong contrast to the official pledges to improve the human rights situation , " she told the dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups say abuses continue in china in the lead-up to the 2008 olympics she said she expected chinese authorities to " continue their harassment of human rights campaigners " ahead of the olympic games that will take place in beijing next year .
there were also fears that journalists would be subjected to increased pressure before the games begin , she said . the chancellor raised the issue of human rights and appealed for more democracy when she met chinese leaders during a previous visit to the world 's most populous nation . officials in berlin say merkel will not shy away from difficult areas this time and will bring up the topics of human rights and press freedom in her official talks in the chinese capital .
she is scheduled to meet chinese journalists , but it is not clear which ones and whether these have been put under pressure by chinese authorities . calling the human rights situation in china " catastrophic , " lochbihler pointed out that the death sentence can be imposed for around 70 different crimes , including drug possession and tax evasion . even the right of citizens to freedom of information is severely restricted , she said . " if you key in the words human rights , democracy or amnesty international in an internet search engine in china you wo n't get a single response , " lochbihler said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

khartoum will allow to remain until his tenure expires next month , following an eu apology , according to a presidential adviser who spoke on saturday . china has substantial economic interests in the african nation and has been under pressure to do more to quell the violence there , which is estimated to have cost 200,000 lives and displaced around 2.5 million people . urged to be tough on china on saturday , amnesty international called on merkel to also address the top of human rights in china itself when she meets the country 's leaders . " we hope that chancellor merkel will speak forcefully about the disastrous human rights situation in china , " said barbara lochbihler , secretary general of the human rights group 's german section . " the continued human rights violations in china are in strong contrast to the official pledges to improve the human rights situation , " she told the dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights groups say abuses continue in china in the lead-up to the 2008 olympics she said she expected chinese authorities to " continue their harassment of human rights campaigners " ahead of the olympic games that will take place in beijing next year .
there were also fears that journalists would be subjected to increased pressure before the games begin , she said . the chancellor raised the issue of human rights and appealed for more democracy when she met chinese leaders during a previous visit to the world 's most populous nation . officials in berlin say merkel will not shy away from difficult areas this time and will bring up the topics of human rights and press freedom in her official talks in the chinese capital .
she is scheduled to meet chinese journalists , but it is not clear which ones and whether these have been put under pressure by chinese authorities . calling the human rights situation in china " catastrophic , " lochbihler pointed out that the death sentence can be imposed for around 70 different crimes , including drug possession and tax evasion . even the right of citizens to freedom of information is severely restricted , she said . " if you key in the words human rights , democracy or amnesty international in an internet search engine in china you wo n't get a single response , " lochbihler said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 25.08.2007 teen sex case puts turkey 's judicial system in spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco thought the british girl was 15 teenagers are rarely prosecuted for having sex , but a 13-year-old british girl has managed to put a 17-year old-german boy behind bars in turkey .
the case has become a thorn in german-turkish relations . turkey 's antalya coast is enormously popular among german and british tourists for its pristine beaches , sporting activities and nightlife . a 17-year-old high school student from the small northern german town of ülzen , identified as marco w. in german media reports , had spent the easter break with his parents at a five-star hotel resort in side . but on april 12 , marco 's holiday turned into a nightmare . turkish police officers arrested him for having sex with a 13-year-old briton , known in german media as charlotte m. the mother of the manchester girl had accused marco of sexually abusing her daughter after he had been invited up to the girl 's hotel room . marco claims charlotte told him she was fifteen and what has emerged in the german media is a portrait of a manipulative 13-year-old deceiving a youth four years her senior . turkey has also been lambasted by the tabloids , commentators and politicians for its treatment of a juvenile .
much has been made of marco 's psychological state and the decrepit conditions of the detention cell , which he has been sharing with 30 other inmates for the past four months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- left -rrb- talked to turkey 's gül about marco german politicians have intervened on marco 's behalf at the highest levels .
chancellor angela merkel made public assurances that she would help marco and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke privately to his turkish counterpart , abdullah gül , who is likely to be elected turkey 's next president at the end of this month .
gül said that he could not interfere with turkey 's independent judiciary . different stories marco claims the two only kissed and engaged in " heavy petting , " consensually .
no sexual intercourse took place , he has said . on aug .
8 , a gynecologist who had examined charlotte said that there was no evidence of assault and the girl was still a virgin .
but there was sexual penetration , insisted charlotte 's lawyer ömer aycan , who told his client 's side of the story in a telephone interview with dw-world.de from antalya . charlotte has claimed that she was asleep in the double room when marco and another boy knocked on the door after midnight .
she asked marco to leave , but he refused and proceeded to force himself on her .
charlotte screamed , alerting other teenagers in the room , and marco fled . " charlotte refused to have sex with marco , so i can use the word rape .
he raped a 13-year-old girl , " said aycan , who added that charlotte 's age was known to the german youth . sexual contact without the use of force is criminal under turkish law when one of the individuals involved is under 15 .
aycan is seeking the maximum conviction , a sentence of fifteen years , although that penalty would be reduced by a third since marco is also a minor . statutory rape laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco is awaiting trial in an antalya prison the case has thrust turkey 's judicial system in the spotlight and reinforced the german perception that the predominantly muslim country is backward in its sexual attitudes , and therefore does not belong in the european union . but legal experts say that turkey has made tremendous strides in bringing its laws in line with eu norms , and the case would have been handled no differently in germany , england or the us . " the mother of the girl charged a young man with child abuse .
the prosecutors had no choice but to arrest marco , " said christian rumpf , an attorney in stuttgart who is an expert on turkish law . in turkey as in germany , any foreigner charged with a crime must remain in detention until cleared of the charges , said rumpf , who does not believe that marco will be easily acquitted . the law governing sex with underage minors , or " statutory rape , " is taken seriously in turkey and other countries .
the legal " age of consent " for sex can range from 14 to 18 years , depending on country or even different regions of the same country .

the case has become a thorn in german-turkish relations . turkey 's antalya coast is enormously popular among german and british tourists for its pristine beaches , sporting activities and nightlife . a 17-year-old high school student from the small northern german town of ülzen , identified as marco w. in german media reports , had spent the easter break with his parents at a five-star hotel resort in side . but on april 12 , marco 's holiday turned into a nightmare . turkish police officers arrested him for having sex with a 13-year-old briton , known in german media as charlotte m. the mother of the manchester girl had accused marco of sexually abusing her daughter after he had been invited up to the girl 's hotel room . marco claims charlotte told him she was fifteen and what has emerged in the german media is a portrait of a manipulative 13-year-old deceiving a youth four years her senior . turkey has also been lambasted by the tabloids , commentators and politicians for its treatment of a juvenile .

the case has become a thorn in german-turkish relations . turkey 's antalya coast is enormously popular among german and british tourists for its pristine beaches , sporting activities and nightlife . a 17-year-old high school student from the small northern german town of ülzen , identified as marco w. in german media reports , had spent the easter break with his parents at a five-star hotel resort in side . but on april 12 , marco 's holiday turned into a nightmare . turkish police officers arrested him for having sex with a 13-year-old briton , known in german media as charlotte m. the mother of the manchester girl had accused marco of sexually abusing her daughter after he had been invited up to the girl 's hotel room . marco claims charlotte told him she was fifteen and what has emerged in the german media is a portrait of a manipulative 13-year-old deceiving a youth four years her senior . turkey has also been lambasted by the tabloids , commentators and politicians for its treatment of a juvenile .
much has been made of marco 's psychological state and the decrepit conditions of the detention cell , which he has been sharing with 30 other inmates for the past four months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- left -rrb- talked to turkey 's gül about marco german politicians have intervened on marco 's behalf at the highest levels .
chancellor angela merkel made public assurances that she would help marco and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke privately to his turkish counterpart , abdullah gül , who is likely to be elected turkey 's next president at the end of this month .
gül said that he could not interfere with turkey 's independent judiciary . different stories marco claims the two only kissed and engaged in " heavy petting , " consensually .
no sexual intercourse took place , he has said . on aug .
8 , a gynecologist who had examined charlotte said that there was no evidence of assault and the girl was still a virgin .
but there was sexual penetration , insisted charlotte 's lawyer ömer aycan , who told his client 's side of the story in a telephone interview with dw-world.de from antalya . charlotte has claimed that she was asleep in the double room when marco and another boy knocked on the door after midnight .
she asked marco to leave , but he refused and proceeded to force himself on her .
charlotte screamed , alerting other teenagers in the room , and marco fled . " charlotte refused to have sex with marco , so i can use the word rape .
he raped a 13-year-old girl , " said aycan , who added that charlotte 's age was known to the german youth . sexual contact without the use of force is criminal under turkish law when one of the individuals involved is under 15 .
aycan is seeking the maximum conviction , a sentence of fifteen years , although that penalty would be reduced by a third since marco is also a minor . statutory rape laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco is awaiting trial in an antalya prison the case has thrust turkey 's judicial system in the spotlight and reinforced the german perception that the predominantly muslim country is backward in its sexual attitudes , and therefore does not belong in the european union . but legal experts say that turkey has made tremendous strides in bringing its laws in line with eu norms , and the case would have been handled no differently in germany , england or the us . " the mother of the girl charged a young man with child abuse .
the prosecutors had no choice but to arrest marco , " said christian rumpf , an attorney in stuttgart who is an expert on turkish law . in turkey as in germany , any foreigner charged with a crime must remain in detention until cleared of the charges , said rumpf , who does not believe that marco will be easily acquitted . the law governing sex with underage minors , or " statutory rape , " is taken seriously in turkey and other countries .
the legal " age of consent " for sex can range from 14 to 18 years , depending on country or even different regions of the same country .
the law is meant to protect children and adolescents from being coerced by an older individual into having sex , but also applies to sexual activity between teens of similar ages . " where do you draw the line between the normal sexuality of teenagers and protecting a child from sexual abuse ? " asked rumpf . germany would have prosecuted too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kissing is not a felony at any age , but sex is in germany , that line is drawn at age 14 . " kissing is not a felony in germany at any age , if that is all they did .
but sexual contact is illegal in germany when one of them is under 14 , " said heribert ostendorf , a former federal prosecutor who heads the program for juvenile law and crime prevention at the university of kiel . " most people just do n't know the specifics of child-abuse laws in germany and that marco would have also been prosecuted in his own country , " he said , adding that the burden is on marco to prove that he did not know that charlotte was only 13 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 25.08.2007 as germany struggles with extremism , calls for new party ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a previous failed attempt , new calls are going out to ban the far-right npd party calls to ban the far-right npd party have resurfaced in germany following a mob attack which left eight indians injured .
in a separate incident , that party 's leader has been charged with incitement of racial hatred . the racially motivated attack on eight indians in the eastern town of mügeln continues to resonate in germany and the leader of the co-ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , spoke out in favor of a starting the process that would ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
but other political leaders and the interior ministry have voiced skepticism .
the npd is an anti-immigrant party that has close links to neo-nazis and is represented in the parliaments of two states in the former communist east germany .
eastern germany has seen disproportionate rates of violence against foreigners since german reunification in 1990 , although incidents have also occurred in western germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the indians injured in the attack in mügeln one of the states is saxony , where the indians were attacked and chased through the town of mügeln by a mob of about 50 germans , following a local festival on august 18 .
a crowd of onlookers did not intervene and it took about 70 police to gain control of the situation .
in another incident last weekend in the western state of rhineland-palatinate , two african men were attacked by a group of right-wing extremists , german media reported on friday .
both men were injured , one seriously .
police had kept the news from the media due to their investigation , officials said .
although the npd was not specifically blamed for the attacks , the party and other extreme-right groups are known to be active in the state and other parts of eastern germany .
racist party the npd has been branded as an ideological breeding ground for neo-nazi aggression , and germany 's domestic security agency says it foments racist violence .
it is also considered anti-semitic .
an attempt by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to ban the npd faltered in 2003 after the federal constitutional court refused to hear the case because the government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer stands guard in mügeln near the pizza parlor where the attack took place the interior ministry said friday that although the party met all the requirements to be outlawed , the intelligence service would have to drop surveillance of it if a new attempt were to be made to ban it .
the ministry did not want to see this happen , a spokesman said .
hans-peter uhl , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said he would be happy to see the party banned .
" but i fear that such an attempt would fail and that would be a disaster , " he said .
green party parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele said the previous failed attempt to ban the npd ended in a propaganda victory for the party , and he feared the same could happen if a new attempt were made .
government inactivity ?
some critics have blamed inactivity by the major political parties for the spread of right-wing activity in the eastern states , where unemployment and dissatisfaction are much higher than in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen has promised to do more to combat right-wing extremism the latest violence has prodded the government into action .
family affairs minister ursula von der leyen announced increased assistance to projects aimed at combating right-wing extremism .
" we do n't want to leave the field open to right-wing extremists , " she said friday after a two-day cabinet conclave in the village of meseberg , 70 kilometers north of berlin .
but the government , and particularly her ministry which is responsible for programs to curb extremism , have come under criticism in the press for allegedly not doing enough .
in an editorial in the daily financial times deutschland , the author wrote : " let me tell you one thing , my dear politicians : when some areas of germany are no longer safe for foreigners , and when you no longer see the state 's duty to protect people from other people as part of your jobs , then i wo n't accept that .
do you understand ?
you are responsible for security in this country . "
during campaigning before their election to the state parliament in mecklenburg-western pomerania last september , npd activists set up youth clubs in neglected rural areas and distributed 15,000 cds with songs by right-wing rock bands in a bid to woo younger voters .
charges filed on friday , police in the eastern city of jena said they had filed charges against udo voigt , the npd 's national leader , for inciting racial hatred .
in a speech last weekend , he had proposed the late rudolf hess , adolf hitler 's former deputy , be awarded the nobel peace prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt -lrb- left -rrb- and the head of another far-right party , the dvu , gerhard frey if convicted , voigt could face up to three years in jail or a fine , police said .
founded in 1964 , the npd had its heyday in the late 60s when it was represented in seven state parliaments and narrowly missed clearing the five-percent threshold for representation in the bundestag , the national parliament .
on a national level , the npd plays an insignificant role .
it won only 1.6 per cent of the vote in the last general election in 2005 .

in a separate incident , that party 's leader has been charged with incitement of racial hatred . the racially motivated attack on eight indians in the eastern town of mügeln continues to resonate in germany and the leader of the co-ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , spoke out in favor of a starting the process that would ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
but other political leaders and the interior ministry have voiced skepticism .
the npd is an anti-immigrant party that has close links to neo-nazis and is represented in the parliaments of two states in the former communist east germany .
eastern germany has seen disproportionate rates of violence against foreigners since german reunification in 1990 , although incidents have also occurred in western germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the indians injured in the attack in mügeln one of the states is saxony , where the indians were attacked and chased through the town of mügeln by a mob of about 50 germans , following a local festival on august 18 .
a crowd of onlookers did not intervene and it took about 70 police to gain control of the situation .
in another incident last weekend in the western state of rhineland-palatinate , two african men were attacked by a group of right-wing extremists , german media reported on friday .
both men were injured , one seriously .
police had kept the news from the media due to their investigation , officials said .
although the npd was not specifically blamed for the attacks , the party and other extreme-right groups are known to be active in the state and other parts of eastern germany .
racist party the npd has been branded as an ideological breeding ground for neo-nazi aggression , and germany 's domestic security agency says it foments racist violence .
it is also considered anti-semitic .
an attempt by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to ban the npd faltered in 2003 after the federal constitutional court refused to hear the case because the government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer stands guard in mügeln near the pizza parlor where the attack took place the interior ministry said friday that although the party met all the requirements to be outlawed , the intelligence service would have to drop surveillance of it if a new attempt were to be made to ban it .
the ministry did not want to see this happen , a spokesman said .
hans-peter uhl , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said he would be happy to see the party banned .
" but i fear that such an attempt would fail and that would be a disaster , " he said .
green party parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele said the previous failed attempt to ban the npd ended in a propaganda victory for the party , and he feared the same could happen if a new attempt were made .
government inactivity ?
some critics have blamed inactivity by the major political parties for the spread of right-wing activity in the eastern states , where unemployment and dissatisfaction are much higher than in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen has promised to do more to combat right-wing extremism the latest violence has prodded the government into action .
family affairs minister ursula von der leyen announced increased assistance to projects aimed at combating right-wing extremism .
" we do n't want to leave the field open to right-wing extremists , " she said friday after a two-day cabinet conclave in the village of meseberg , 70 kilometers north of berlin .
but the government , and particularly her ministry which is responsible for programs to curb extremism , have come under criticism in the press for allegedly not doing enough .
in an editorial in the daily financial times deutschland , the author wrote : " let me tell you one thing , my dear politicians : when some areas of germany are no longer safe for foreigners , and when you no longer see the state 's duty to protect people from other people as part of your jobs , then i wo n't accept that .
do you understand ?
you are responsible for security in this country . "
during campaigning before their election to the state parliament in mecklenburg-western pomerania last september , npd activists set up youth clubs in neglected rural areas and distributed 15,000 cds with songs by right-wing rock bands in a bid to woo younger voters .
charges filed on friday , police in the eastern city of jena said they had filed charges against udo voigt , the npd 's national leader , for inciting racial hatred .
in a speech last weekend , he had proposed the late rudolf hess , adolf hitler 's former deputy , be awarded the nobel peace prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt -lrb- left -rrb- and the head of another far-right party , the dvu , gerhard frey if convicted , voigt could face up to three years in jail or a fine , police said .
founded in 1964 , the npd had its heyday in the late 60s when it was represented in seven state parliaments and narrowly missed clearing the five-percent threshold for representation in the bundestag , the national parliament .

the love parade decamped to the industrial ruhr region after plans to keep it in germany 's capital fell through .
essen will be the first host . the love parade turns 18 this year .
and like a self-respecting adult , it 's moving away from home .
it will look for a new start in the ruhr region , germany 's industrial center in the western state of north rhine-westphalia .
the saturday parade in essen is the centerpiece of a four-day " love weekend " that includes more than 1,000 hours of music , 700 performers and 100 parties .
last year 's parade in berlin attracted one million visitors who grooved to the music of 230 djs from 17 countries .
ravers gyrate to electronic dance music booming from sound trucks and fixed stages manned by internationally known djs .
leaving berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelin ' the love in berlin organizers of this year 's show would n't say how many fans they expect to turn up in essen .
but the party will go on , with a parade of 27 floats planned .
the love parade will remain in the ruhr region for five years , but will lead a nomadic existence .
essen will be followed by the cities of dortmund , bochum , duisburg and gelsenkirchen .
the company that operates the event decided to move from berlin after failing to agree on terms with the capital 's administrators on a future concept for the parade .
the love parade was first held in 1989 as a private business venture .
in the subsequent years , it 's been exported all over the world , taking place in cities such as tel aviv , san francisco , sydney and mexico city .
yet the german parade has faced problems finding sponsors and was cancelled in 2004 and 2005 .
the events ' trademarks are scantily clad dancers , intoxication and summer sun .
its appeal extends far beyond fans of techno music .
" we will beat berlin in a number of factors , " said rainer schaller , managing director of loveparade gmbh , the company which operates the event .
the parade must go on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-flung love in tel aviv schaller said the love weekend from august 23-26 will be the " longest love parade in history " in terms of duration .
a former center of germany 's coal and steel industries , essen is now home to big corporations like thyssenkrupp , a german industrial conglomerate and one of the world 's largest steel producers .
a press release on the city of essen 's web site promised that the love parade " is staying true to its principles " and will retain its urban character .
" the parade is a child of the big city and will remain an urban phenomenon , " according to the press release . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 25.08.2007 as germany struggles with extremism , calls for new party ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a previous failed attempt , new calls are going out to ban the far-right npd party calls to ban the far-right npd party have resurfaced in germany following a mob attack which left eight indians injured .
in a separate incident , that party 's leader has been charged with incitement of racial hatred . the racially motivated attack on eight indians in the eastern town of mügeln continues to resonate in germany and the leader of the co-ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , spoke out in favor of a starting the process that would ban the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
but other political leaders and the interior ministry have voiced skepticism .
the npd is an anti-immigrant party that has close links to neo-nazis and is represented in the parliaments of two states in the former communist east germany .
eastern germany has seen disproportionate rates of violence against foreigners since german reunification in 1990 , although incidents have also occurred in western germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the indians injured in the attack in mügeln one of the states is saxony , where the indians were attacked and chased through the town of mügeln by a mob of about 50 germans , following a local festival on august 18 .
a crowd of onlookers did not intervene and it took about 70 police to gain control of the situation .
in another incident last weekend in the western state of rhineland-palatinate , two african men were attacked by a group of right-wing extremists , german media reported on friday .
both men were injured , one seriously .
police had kept the news from the media due to their investigation , officials said .
although the npd was not specifically blamed for the attacks , the party and other extreme-right groups are known to be active in the state and other parts of eastern germany .
racist party the npd has been branded as an ideological breeding ground for neo-nazi aggression , and germany 's domestic security agency says it foments racist violence .
it is also considered anti-semitic .
an attempt by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to ban the npd faltered in 2003 after the federal constitutional court refused to hear the case because the government had infiltrated the party with informants in high places .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer stands guard in mügeln near the pizza parlor where the attack took place the interior ministry said friday that although the party met all the requirements to be outlawed , the intelligence service would have to drop surveillance of it if a new attempt were to be made to ban it .
the ministry did not want to see this happen , a spokesman said .
hans-peter uhl , a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel 's sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said he would be happy to see the party banned .
" but i fear that such an attempt would fail and that would be a disaster , " he said .
green party parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele said the previous failed attempt to ban the npd ended in a propaganda victory for the party , and he feared the same could happen if a new attempt were made .
government inactivity ?
some critics have blamed inactivity by the major political parties for the spread of right-wing activity in the eastern states , where unemployment and dissatisfaction are much higher than in the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen has promised to do more to combat right-wing extremism the latest violence has prodded the government into action .
family affairs minister ursula von der leyen announced increased assistance to projects aimed at combating right-wing extremism .
" we do n't want to leave the field open to right-wing extremists , " she said friday after a two-day cabinet conclave in the village of meseberg , 70 kilometers north of berlin .
but the government , and particularly her ministry which is responsible for programs to curb extremism , have come under criticism in the press for allegedly not doing enough .
in an editorial in the daily financial times deutschland , the author wrote : " let me tell you one thing , my dear politicians : when some areas of germany are no longer safe for foreigners , and when you no longer see the state 's duty to protect people from other people as part of your jobs , then i wo n't accept that .
do you understand ?
you are responsible for security in this country . "
during campaigning before their election to the state parliament in mecklenburg-western pomerania last september , npd activists set up youth clubs in neglected rural areas and distributed 15,000 cds with songs by right-wing rock bands in a bid to woo younger voters .
charges filed on friday , police in the eastern city of jena said they had filed charges against udo voigt , the npd 's national leader , for inciting racial hatred .
in a speech last weekend , he had proposed the late rudolf hess , adolf hitler 's former deputy , be awarded the nobel peace prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt -lrb- left -rrb- and the head of another far-right party , the dvu , gerhard frey if convicted , voigt could face up to three years in jail or a fine , police said .
founded in 1964 , the npd had its heyday in the late 60s when it was represented in seven state parliaments and narrowly missed clearing the five-percent threshold for representation in the bundestag , the national parliament .
on a national level , the npd plays an insignificant role .
it won only 1.6 per cent of the vote in the last general election in 2005 .

the case has become a thorn in german-turkish relations . turkey 's antalya coast is enormously popular among german and british tourists for its pristine beaches , sporting activities and nightlife . a 17-year-old high school student from the small northern german town of ülzen , identified as marco w. in german media reports , had spent the easter break with his parents at a five-star hotel resort in side . but on april 12 , marco 's holiday turned into a nightmare . turkish police officers arrested him for having sex with a 13-year-old briton , known in german media as charlotte m. the mother of the manchester girl had accused marco of sexually abusing her daughter after he had been invited up to the girl 's hotel room . marco claims charlotte told him she was fifteen and what has emerged in the german media is a portrait of a manipulative 13-year-old deceiving a youth four years her senior . turkey has also been lambasted by the tabloids , commentators and politicians for its treatment of a juvenile .
much has been made of marco 's psychological state and the decrepit conditions of the detention cell , which he has been sharing with 30 other inmates for the past four months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- left -rrb- talked to turkey 's gül about marco german politicians have intervened on marco 's behalf at the highest levels .
chancellor angela merkel made public assurances that she would help marco and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke privately to his turkish counterpart , abdullah gül , who is likely to be elected turkey 's next president at the end of this month .
gül said that he could not interfere with turkey 's independent judiciary . different stories marco claims the two only kissed and engaged in " heavy petting , " consensually .
no sexual intercourse took place , he has said . on aug .
8 , a gynecologist who had examined charlotte said that there was no evidence of assault and the girl was still a virgin .
but there was sexual penetration , insisted charlotte 's lawyer ömer aycan , who told his client 's side of the story in a telephone interview with dw-world.de from antalya . charlotte has claimed that she was asleep in the double room when marco and another boy knocked on the door after midnight .
she asked marco to leave , but he refused and proceeded to force himself on her .
charlotte screamed , alerting other teenagers in the room , and marco fled . " charlotte refused to have sex with marco , so i can use the word rape .
he raped a 13-year-old girl , " said aycan , who added that charlotte 's age was known to the german youth . sexual contact without the use of force is criminal under turkish law when one of the individuals involved is under 15 .
aycan is seeking the maximum conviction , a sentence of fifteen years , although that penalty would be reduced by a third since marco is also a minor . statutory rape laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco is awaiting trial in an antalya prison the case has thrust turkey 's judicial system in the spotlight and reinforced the german perception that the predominantly muslim country is backward in its sexual attitudes , and therefore does not belong in the european union . but legal experts say that turkey has made tremendous strides in bringing its laws in line with eu norms , and the case would have been handled no differently in germany , england or the us . " the mother of the girl charged a young man with child abuse .
the prosecutors had no choice but to arrest marco , " said christian rumpf , an attorney in stuttgart who is an expert on turkish law . in turkey as in germany , any foreigner charged with a crime must remain in detention until cleared of the charges , said rumpf , who does not believe that marco will be easily acquitted . the law governing sex with underage minors , or " statutory rape , " is taken seriously in turkey and other countries .
the legal " age of consent " for sex can range from 14 to 18 years , depending on country or even different regions of the same country .
the law is meant to protect children and adolescents from being coerced by an older individual into having sex , but also applies to sexual activity between teens of similar ages . " where do you draw the line between the normal sexuality of teenagers and protecting a child from sexual abuse ? " asked rumpf . germany would have prosecuted too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kissing is not a felony at any age , but sex is in germany , that line is drawn at age 14 . " kissing is not a felony in germany at any age , if that is all they did .
but sexual contact is illegal in germany when one of them is under 14 , " said heribert ostendorf , a former federal prosecutor who heads the program for juvenile law and crime prevention at the university of kiel . " most people just do n't know the specifics of child-abuse laws in germany and that marco would have also been prosecuted in his own country , " he said , adding that the burden is on marco to prove that he did not know that charlotte was only 13 . " ignorance of the law is no protection from being punished by it , " he said . " there are only victims in this case " the case has resulted in a media circus and charlotte 's family has been hounded by german reporters in manchester .
the girl did not show up for the last hearing because of the publicity glare , according to aycan . " there are only victims in this case - marco , charlotte , and even the turkish justice system , which is facing intense scrutiny from germany , britain and the eu .
the turkish judges are under tremendous pressure and can not afford to make mistakes , " said lale akgün , a turkish-born social democratic parliamentarian in the german bundestag who served for many years as a family and youth counselor for the city of cologne . akgün also believes the case has been damaging for german-turkish relations .
news commentators in turkey were outraged that german politicians tried to influence a matter that belongs in the courts . " the intervention of steinmeier has put even more pressure on the turkish judiciary to prove that it is capable of making independent decisions without being swayed by politics , " she said . parallels in the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's antalya coast is popular among german tourists in the united states , former president jimmy carter and democratic presidential hopeful barack obama unsuccessfully lobbied georgia 's high court to overturn the conviction of genarlow wilson , who is serving a ten-year jail sentence for having oral sex with his girlfriend . the girl never filed charges , but the act was caught on videotape at a new year 's eve party in 2003 , and wound up in the hands of georgia state prosecutors .
in georgia , the age of consent is 16 years of age .
wilson was 17 at the time , but his girlfriend was only 15 .
he was charged and convicted of child molestation . the wilson case has gotten wide publicity in the united states , and many americans are now questioning whether the statutory rape laws that are meant to protect minors go too far . in june , an appeal courts judge called wilson 's prison term " a grave miscarriage of justice , " but the former star athlete still remains behind bars . meanwhile marco 's next trial date in antalya is on september 6 .
the judicial process in this instanced is not unusually long , considering the backlog of cases in turkish courts and the time required to depose witnesses in three different countries , according to christian rumpf . " we need to let the turkish courts do their job and do it right , " said lale akgün .
