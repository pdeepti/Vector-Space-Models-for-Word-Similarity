program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 25.12.2007 landmark treaty deal eu 's biggest success in 2007 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu managed to rise up to some of the main challenges haunting it throughout 2007 , the eu struggled to salvage its derailed constitution .
come year 's end , however , the 27-nation bloc can look back on some successes , the biggest one being the deal on its roadmap for the future . the european union will be ushering in the new year with a huge sense of relief at tackling one of the biggest challenges in its history .
two years after the citizens of france and the netherlands shot down a draft constitution in separate referendums , plunging the eu into crisis , the bloc managed to get its deeply divided members to agree on a pared down version of the treaty meant to reform its institutions .
earlier in the month , eu leaders gathered in lisbon to sign the landmark treaty .
eu commissioner for communications margot wallström said that the treaty of lisbon was a wonderful birthday gift for the eu , which turned 50 this year , and that the bloc 's popularity has grown as a result .
" membership of the eu is viewed positively , " wallström said .
" there 's more trust in its institutions .
it 's encouraging for those of us who work for the eu . "
bumpy road to treaty deal the road to the treaty deal , however , was anything but smooth .
as head of the six-month rotating presidency , german chancellor angela merkel led marathon negotiations at a fractious summit of european leaders in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles for the camera but tension behind the scenes - merkel with jaroslaw kaczynski the meeting was overshadowed by fraught discussions , in particular with poland .
warsaw clashed with berlin over the issues of its voting rights and the resulting compromise agreement included controversial concessions for poland .
then polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski was frequently at odds with other eu members too , a stance that threatened to isolate poland from the rest of europe .
in november , there was widespread relief in the eu as voters in poland threw out the conservative government led by kaczynski in favor of the pro-eu leader donald tusk and his center-right civic platform party .
the new eu reform treaty seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage .
it 's seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
" europe will be able to present a more united face in the world through a commissioner responsible for foreign policy and a permanent eu council president , " merkel said earlier this month .
" the national parliaments and thus citizens will able to influence more strongly what 's decided in europe . "
hungary became the first nation to ratify the eu treaty .
other members will have to follow by early 2009 , ahead of elections for the european parliament .
climate , russia pose challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dealing with russia - putin with portuguese premier jose socrates while the eu managed to climb out of the slump sparked by the constitutional crisis , it faced further challenges on the international level in the form of climate change and russia 's increasingly aggressive energy policy .
at an eu energy summit in march , the bloc agreed on forging a common eu energy policy to deal with global problems .
" we have to realize that we face global challenges : limited resources , climate change , dependence on imports and the need to invest in energy plants , " said andrej piebalgs , eu energy commissioner . " the eu 's answer is a common energy policy . "
the eu committed itself to reducing by 20 percent its levels of the principal greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
member states will also be required to make renewable energies such as solar and wind account for at least 20 percent of the total energy consumption across the eu by 2020 .
russia 's growing assertiveness on the world stage and outgoing president vladimir putin 's continuing clinging to power soured relations with the eu and marred regular summits between brussels and the kremlin .
the issue is now on hold until after russian elections in march 2008 .
africa , kosovo lingering problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo will be one problem the eu will carry over to the next year africa was also a priority for the eu this year .
after a seven-year break , the leaders of both continents met in lisbon for a summit - with the exception of british premier gordon brown who stayed home to protest human right violations in zimbabwe .
the eu-africa summit , however , did not achieve anything substantial .
the eu criticized governance in africa while african leaders joined forces and rejected the proffered economic cooperation .
kosovo , too , remains an unresolved problem , despite efforts by eu mediators .
not all eu states want to see independence for kosovo albanians and serbia , which has russia 's support , remains vehemently opposed to the idea of secession .
several balkan countries , with the exception of croatia , have been slow in coming around to the eu 's position on the serbian province .
it 's an issue that has raised hackles in parts of the eu .
" eu candidates have to fulfill conditions , not the european union , " said olli rehn , the eu 's enlargement commissioner .
" serbia wants to join the eu , not the other way around . "
a triumph and further responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party time - the schengen zone was expanded this month the eu managed to chalk up one triumph this month when the visa-free schengen zone was expanded to include nine additional european member states .
only new eu members romania and bulgaria remain outside the passport-free area .
though fears of criminality persist , eu leaders celebrated the event as a historic moment .
the eu will have its hands full in the coming year with a question mark still hovering over turkey 's eu membership as french president nicolas sarkozy underlines his continuing opposition to the prospect .
taking stock of the year , eu commission jose barroso said in an interview with deutsche welle that 2007 was overall a good year for the eu .
" europe should not fear the responsibilities of the 21st century , " barroso said .
" on the contrary , we 're a success story for globalization . "
" if we organize our diversity multinationally , we can show that we 're already equipped for a world in which each one has contact with the other , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

come year 's end , however , the 27-nation bloc can look back on some successes , the biggest one being the deal on its roadmap for the future . the european union will be ushering in the new year with a huge sense of relief at tackling one of the biggest challenges in its history .
two years after the citizens of france and the netherlands shot down a draft constitution in separate referendums , plunging the eu into crisis , the bloc managed to get its deeply divided members to agree on a pared down version of the treaty meant to reform its institutions .
earlier in the month , eu leaders gathered in lisbon to sign the landmark treaty .
eu commissioner for communications margot wallström said that the treaty of lisbon was a wonderful birthday gift for the eu , which turned 50 this year , and that the bloc 's popularity has grown as a result .
" membership of the eu is viewed positively , " wallström said .
" there 's more trust in its institutions .
it 's encouraging for those of us who work for the eu . "
bumpy road to treaty deal the road to the treaty deal , however , was anything but smooth .
as head of the six-month rotating presidency , german chancellor angela merkel led marathon negotiations at a fractious summit of european leaders in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles for the camera but tension behind the scenes - merkel with jaroslaw kaczynski the meeting was overshadowed by fraught discussions , in particular with poland .
warsaw clashed with berlin over the issues of its voting rights and the resulting compromise agreement included controversial concessions for poland .
then polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski was frequently at odds with other eu members too , a stance that threatened to isolate poland from the rest of europe .
in november , there was widespread relief in the eu as voters in poland threw out the conservative government led by kaczynski in favor of the pro-eu leader donald tusk and his center-right civic platform party .
the new eu reform treaty seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage .
it 's seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
" europe will be able to present a more united face in the world through a commissioner responsible for foreign policy and a permanent eu council president , " merkel said earlier this month .
" the national parliaments and thus citizens will able to influence more strongly what 's decided in europe . "
hungary became the first nation to ratify the eu treaty .
other members will have to follow by early 2009 , ahead of elections for the european parliament .
climate , russia pose challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dealing with russia - putin with portuguese premier jose socrates while the eu managed to climb out of the slump sparked by the constitutional crisis , it faced further challenges on the international level in the form of climate change and russia 's increasingly aggressive energy policy .
at an eu energy summit in march , the bloc agreed on forging a common eu energy policy to deal with global problems .
" we have to realize that we face global challenges : limited resources , climate change , dependence on imports and the need to invest in energy plants , " said andrej piebalgs , eu energy commissioner . " the eu 's answer is a common energy policy . "
the eu committed itself to reducing by 20 percent its levels of the principal greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
member states will also be required to make renewable energies such as solar and wind account for at least 20 percent of the total energy consumption across the eu by 2020 .

come year 's end , however , the 27-nation bloc can look back on some successes , the biggest one being the deal on its roadmap for the future . the european union will be ushering in the new year with a huge sense of relief at tackling one of the biggest challenges in its history .
two years after the citizens of france and the netherlands shot down a draft constitution in separate referendums , plunging the eu into crisis , the bloc managed to get its deeply divided members to agree on a pared down version of the treaty meant to reform its institutions .
earlier in the month , eu leaders gathered in lisbon to sign the landmark treaty .
eu commissioner for communications margot wallström said that the treaty of lisbon was a wonderful birthday gift for the eu , which turned 50 this year , and that the bloc 's popularity has grown as a result .
" membership of the eu is viewed positively , " wallström said .
" there 's more trust in its institutions .
it 's encouraging for those of us who work for the eu . "
bumpy road to treaty deal the road to the treaty deal , however , was anything but smooth .
as head of the six-month rotating presidency , german chancellor angela merkel led marathon negotiations at a fractious summit of european leaders in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles for the camera but tension behind the scenes - merkel with jaroslaw kaczynski the meeting was overshadowed by fraught discussions , in particular with poland .
warsaw clashed with berlin over the issues of its voting rights and the resulting compromise agreement included controversial concessions for poland .
then polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski was frequently at odds with other eu members too , a stance that threatened to isolate poland from the rest of europe .
in november , there was widespread relief in the eu as voters in poland threw out the conservative government led by kaczynski in favor of the pro-eu leader donald tusk and his center-right civic platform party .
the new eu reform treaty seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage .
it 's seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
" europe will be able to present a more united face in the world through a commissioner responsible for foreign policy and a permanent eu council president , " merkel said earlier this month .
" the national parliaments and thus citizens will able to influence more strongly what 's decided in europe . "
hungary became the first nation to ratify the eu treaty .
other members will have to follow by early 2009 , ahead of elections for the european parliament .
climate , russia pose challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dealing with russia - putin with portuguese premier jose socrates while the eu managed to climb out of the slump sparked by the constitutional crisis , it faced further challenges on the international level in the form of climate change and russia 's increasingly aggressive energy policy .
at an eu energy summit in march , the bloc agreed on forging a common eu energy policy to deal with global problems .
" we have to realize that we face global challenges : limited resources , climate change , dependence on imports and the need to invest in energy plants , " said andrej piebalgs , eu energy commissioner . " the eu 's answer is a common energy policy . "
the eu committed itself to reducing by 20 percent its levels of the principal greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
member states will also be required to make renewable energies such as solar and wind account for at least 20 percent of the total energy consumption across the eu by 2020 .
russia 's growing assertiveness on the world stage and outgoing president vladimir putin 's continuing clinging to power soured relations with the eu and marred regular summits between brussels and the kremlin .
the issue is now on hold until after russian elections in march 2008 .
africa , kosovo lingering problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo will be one problem the eu will carry over to the next year africa was also a priority for the eu this year .
after a seven-year break , the leaders of both continents met in lisbon for a summit - with the exception of british premier gordon brown who stayed home to protest human right violations in zimbabwe .
the eu-africa summit , however , did not achieve anything substantial .
the eu criticized governance in africa while african leaders joined forces and rejected the proffered economic cooperation .
kosovo , too , remains an unresolved problem , despite efforts by eu mediators .
not all eu states want to see independence for kosovo albanians and serbia , which has russia 's support , remains vehemently opposed to the idea of secession .
several balkan countries , with the exception of croatia , have been slow in coming around to the eu 's position on the serbian province .
it 's an issue that has raised hackles in parts of the eu .
" eu candidates have to fulfill conditions , not the european union , " said olli rehn , the eu 's enlargement commissioner .
" serbia wants to join the eu , not the other way around . "
a triumph and further responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party time - the schengen zone was expanded this month the eu managed to chalk up one triumph this month when the visa-free schengen zone was expanded to include nine additional european member states .
only new eu members romania and bulgaria remain outside the passport-free area .
though fears of criminality persist , eu leaders celebrated the event as a historic moment .
the eu will have its hands full in the coming year with a question mark still hovering over turkey 's eu membership as french president nicolas sarkozy underlines his continuing opposition to the prospect .
taking stock of the year , eu commission jose barroso said in an interview with deutsche welle that 2007 was overall a good year for the eu .
" europe should not fear the responsibilities of the 21st century , " barroso said .
" on the contrary , we 're a success story for globalization . "
" if we organize our diversity multinationally , we can show that we 're already equipped for a world in which each one has contact with the other , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new chamber of foreign trade has been set up to help german firms get started in russia . profits resulting from commerce between the two countries rose by over 30 percent in 2006 , making russia germany 's biggest trade partner in eastern europe . today , some 4,600 german companies have set up shop between kaliningrad in western russia and vladivostok in siberia , according to counts by the chambers of commerce . most recently , a new car factory was built in kaluga , 300 kilometers -lrb- 190 miles -rrb- away from moscow , where volkswagen will soon begin producing its skoda-octavia and vw-passat models . " the russian economy is booming and the positive developments in the russian federation are improving conditions for trade relations and cooperation , " said fyodor chorokordin , russia 's consul general to germany . there are opportunities in practically every sector , continued chorokordin , " whether production , service or distribution .

in 2006 , german companies invested nearly $ 10 billion -lrb- seven billion euros -rrb- in russia , while russia invested only a tenth of that amount in germany . the main reason is that only a small group of russia companies , predominantly in the machine sector , has settled in germany .
many of these are made up of just a handful of russian employees who have their permanent residence in germany but sell modern german-made machine technology in their home country . machines and technology in russia are outdated , said chorokordin .

germany gets one third of its natural gas from russia - the country with the largest natural gas supply in the world - and its energy need is increasing . though there is concern in germany about becoming too dependent on russian gas , chorokordin sees the situation positively . " russia is just as dependent on germany - it 's a mutual dependence , " he said .
" dependence should n't be used for political pressure . " to ensure the regular delivery of natural gas , german energy companies e.on , ruhrgas and basf have agreed together with russia 's state-run gazprom to construct a pipeline off the coast of the baltic sea .

wherever and however you celebrate , we wish you a good time together with people who are close to your heart . many of us can look back on a good year : at wishes that were fulfilled and endeavors that were worth the effort .
for some of us , a look back is also marked by painful memories : the loss of people dear to us , a fateful blow or thwarted hopes .
for everyone who 's unable to celebrate christmas with a light heart , i wish you strength and confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors have a lifetime of learning to pass on this year , too , i have traveled a lot in our country , and i 'm thankful for what people have shown me .
they have told me about their worries and difficulties , but also that they feel like things have gotten better in germany .
one thing in particular moves me every time : citizens joining forces where they face common problems and setting about to find solutions together , often entirely independent of public offices and authorities .
things come into being : playgrounds , theater groups and job exchanges for the unemployed and school partnerships , for example . and , in the end , people are happy to discover : we did more than merely filling a gap .
together , we have created something meaningful that shows us how much creative energy we possess and how much actually depends on us .
we have received confirmation and we have also taken one step against loneliness .
ever more people brought together by a common aim are taking responsibility for one another , and there they find something of the foothold that every one of us needs .
that 's good news .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens want to stay involved let us imagine what would happen if the young and old in germany truly discovered what they could make possible together .
let 's see : in the past 100 years , life expectancy here has increased by 30 years .
the years gained are a great gift .
but i sometimes think we still do n't pay enough heed to them .
people who can do a lot , who have a lot of experience and energy are still pushed out of active life .
yet so many of them want to pass on something to the young . i 'm thinking of the church musician in saxony who helps children with their homework .
i 'm thinking of the retired teacher in hamburg who knows how important good manners are and teaches them to schoolchildren , regardless of where they come from .
i 'm thinking of the manager who , after the end of his professional career , helps young people start their own companies , and the craftsman who , as a pensioner , goes to africa to train apprentices . i think it 's worthwhile to build on such examples .
i want the experience and poise of older people to connect with the eagerness and curiosity of the young , and i 'm sure that where that happens , it will result in good . i would like to thank everyone who already demonstrates that on a daily basis : the many grandparents who take care of their grandchildren and the older people who look out for children in their neighborhood and speak well of them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to contemplate life we all know how important attentiveness is .
i would also like to thank the young people who are there for their elderly relatives .
at the same time , the young families have a lot to bear .
the working world has certainly become more difficult and the burden of costs and taxes is high .
but the amount of trust and help we have between generations today , and what we can still make possible , is a treasure from which everyone benefits and which each person can add to . this evening i would like to thank everyone who is doing service over the holidays .
and i would like to send thanks and a greeting from home to our soldiers , our police officers and our aid workers abroad , working for world peace .
my thoughts in this hour also go out to the families of those who have lost their lives in foreign deployments . christmas is , for both of us , two things : a time to contemplate what is really important to us and a time to gain new confidence and to go forward , freshly bolstered .
let 's bring some of this special atmosphere into the new year and beyond . my wife and i wish you all tranquil holidays and a good , peaceful new year . translated by nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

wherever and however you celebrate , we wish you a good time together with people who are close to your heart . many of us can look back on a good year : at wishes that were fulfilled and endeavors that were worth the effort .
for some of us , a look back is also marked by painful memories : the loss of people dear to us , a fateful blow or thwarted hopes .
for everyone who 's unable to celebrate christmas with a light heart , i wish you strength and confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors have a lifetime of learning to pass on this year , too , i have traveled a lot in our country , and i 'm thankful for what people have shown me .
they have told me about their worries and difficulties , but also that they feel like things have gotten better in germany .
one thing in particular moves me every time : citizens joining forces where they face common problems and setting about to find solutions together , often entirely independent of public offices and authorities .
things come into being : playgrounds , theater groups and job exchanges for the unemployed and school partnerships , for example . and , in the end , people are happy to discover : we did more than merely filling a gap .
together , we have created something meaningful that shows us how much creative energy we possess and how much actually depends on us .
we have received confirmation and we have also taken one step against loneliness .
ever more people brought together by a common aim are taking responsibility for one another , and there they find something of the foothold that every one of us needs .
that 's good news .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens want to stay involved let us imagine what would happen if the young and old in germany truly discovered what they could make possible together .
let 's see : in the past 100 years , life expectancy here has increased by 30 years .
the years gained are a great gift .
but i sometimes think we still do n't pay enough heed to them .
people who can do a lot , who have a lot of experience and energy are still pushed out of active life .
yet so many of them want to pass on something to the young . i 'm thinking of the church musician in saxony who helps children with their homework .
i 'm thinking of the retired teacher in hamburg who knows how important good manners are and teaches them to schoolchildren , regardless of where they come from .
i 'm thinking of the manager who , after the end of his professional career , helps young people start their own companies , and the craftsman who , as a pensioner , goes to africa to train apprentices . i think it 's worthwhile to build on such examples .
i want the experience and poise of older people to connect with the eagerness and curiosity of the young , and i 'm sure that where that happens , it will result in good . i would like to thank everyone who already demonstrates that on a daily basis : the many grandparents who take care of their grandchildren and the older people who look out for children in their neighborhood and speak well of them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to contemplate life we all know how important attentiveness is .
i would also like to thank the young people who are there for their elderly relatives .
at the same time , the young families have a lot to bear .
the working world has certainly become more difficult and the burden of costs and taxes is high .
but the amount of trust and help we have between generations today , and what we can still make possible , is a treasure from which everyone benefits and which each person can add to . this evening i would like to thank everyone who is doing service over the holidays .
and i would like to send thanks and a greeting from home to our soldiers , our police officers and our aid workers abroad , working for world peace .
my thoughts in this hour also go out to the families of those who have lost their lives in foreign deployments . christmas is , for both of us , two things : a time to contemplate what is really important to us and a time to gain new confidence and to go forward , freshly bolstered .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 25.12.2007 landmark treaty deal eu 's biggest success in 2007 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu managed to rise up to some of the main challenges haunting it throughout 2007 , the eu struggled to salvage its derailed constitution .
come year 's end , however , the 27-nation bloc can look back on some successes , the biggest one being the deal on its roadmap for the future . the european union will be ushering in the new year with a huge sense of relief at tackling one of the biggest challenges in its history .
two years after the citizens of france and the netherlands shot down a draft constitution in separate referendums , plunging the eu into crisis , the bloc managed to get its deeply divided members to agree on a pared down version of the treaty meant to reform its institutions .
earlier in the month , eu leaders gathered in lisbon to sign the landmark treaty .
eu commissioner for communications margot wallström said that the treaty of lisbon was a wonderful birthday gift for the eu , which turned 50 this year , and that the bloc 's popularity has grown as a result .
" membership of the eu is viewed positively , " wallström said .
" there 's more trust in its institutions .
it 's encouraging for those of us who work for the eu . "
bumpy road to treaty deal the road to the treaty deal , however , was anything but smooth .
as head of the six-month rotating presidency , german chancellor angela merkel led marathon negotiations at a fractious summit of european leaders in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles for the camera but tension behind the scenes - merkel with jaroslaw kaczynski the meeting was overshadowed by fraught discussions , in particular with poland .
warsaw clashed with berlin over the issues of its voting rights and the resulting compromise agreement included controversial concessions for poland .
then polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski was frequently at odds with other eu members too , a stance that threatened to isolate poland from the rest of europe .
in november , there was widespread relief in the eu as voters in poland threw out the conservative government led by kaczynski in favor of the pro-eu leader donald tusk and his center-right civic platform party .
the new eu reform treaty seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage .
it 's seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
" europe will be able to present a more united face in the world through a commissioner responsible for foreign policy and a permanent eu council president , " merkel said earlier this month .
" the national parliaments and thus citizens will able to influence more strongly what 's decided in europe . "
hungary became the first nation to ratify the eu treaty .
other members will have to follow by early 2009 , ahead of elections for the european parliament .
climate , russia pose challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dealing with russia - putin with portuguese premier jose socrates while the eu managed to climb out of the slump sparked by the constitutional crisis , it faced further challenges on the international level in the form of climate change and russia 's increasingly aggressive energy policy .
at an eu energy summit in march , the bloc agreed on forging a common eu energy policy to deal with global problems .
" we have to realize that we face global challenges : limited resources , climate change , dependence on imports and the need to invest in energy plants , " said andrej piebalgs , eu energy commissioner . " the eu 's answer is a common energy policy . "
the eu committed itself to reducing by 20 percent its levels of the principal greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
member states will also be required to make renewable energies such as solar and wind account for at least 20 percent of the total energy consumption across the eu by 2020 .
russia 's growing assertiveness on the world stage and outgoing president vladimir putin 's continuing clinging to power soured relations with the eu and marred regular summits between brussels and the kremlin .
the issue is now on hold until after russian elections in march 2008 .
africa , kosovo lingering problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo will be one problem the eu will carry over to the next year africa was also a priority for the eu this year .
after a seven-year break , the leaders of both continents met in lisbon for a summit - with the exception of british premier gordon brown who stayed home to protest human right violations in zimbabwe .
the eu-africa summit , however , did not achieve anything substantial .
the eu criticized governance in africa while african leaders joined forces and rejected the proffered economic cooperation .
kosovo , too , remains an unresolved problem , despite efforts by eu mediators .
not all eu states want to see independence for kosovo albanians and serbia , which has russia 's support , remains vehemently opposed to the idea of secession .
several balkan countries , with the exception of croatia , have been slow in coming around to the eu 's position on the serbian province .
it 's an issue that has raised hackles in parts of the eu .
" eu candidates have to fulfill conditions , not the european union , " said olli rehn , the eu 's enlargement commissioner .
" serbia wants to join the eu , not the other way around . "
a triumph and further responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party time - the schengen zone was expanded this month the eu managed to chalk up one triumph this month when the visa-free schengen zone was expanded to include nine additional european member states .
only new eu members romania and bulgaria remain outside the passport-free area .
though fears of criminality persist , eu leaders celebrated the event as a historic moment .
the eu will have its hands full in the coming year with a question mark still hovering over turkey 's eu membership as french president nicolas sarkozy underlines his continuing opposition to the prospect .
taking stock of the year , eu commission jose barroso said in an interview with deutsche welle that 2007 was overall a good year for the eu .
" europe should not fear the responsibilities of the 21st century , " barroso said .
" on the contrary , we 're a success story for globalization . "

at an eu energy summit in march , the bloc agreed on forging a common eu energy policy to deal with global problems .
" we have to realize that we face global challenges : limited resources , climate change , dependence on imports and the need to invest in energy plants , " said andrej piebalgs , eu energy commissioner . " the eu 's answer is a common energy policy . "
the eu committed itself to reducing by 20 percent its levels of the principal greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
member states will also be required to make renewable energies such as solar and wind account for at least 20 percent of the total energy consumption across the eu by 2020 .

come year 's end , however , the 27-nation bloc can look back on some successes , the biggest one being the deal on its roadmap for the future . the european union will be ushering in the new year with a huge sense of relief at tackling one of the biggest challenges in its history .
two years after the citizens of france and the netherlands shot down a draft constitution in separate referendums , plunging the eu into crisis , the bloc managed to get its deeply divided members to agree on a pared down version of the treaty meant to reform its institutions .
earlier in the month , eu leaders gathered in lisbon to sign the landmark treaty .
eu commissioner for communications margot wallström said that the treaty of lisbon was a wonderful birthday gift for the eu , which turned 50 this year , and that the bloc 's popularity has grown as a result .
" membership of the eu is viewed positively , " wallström said .
" there 's more trust in its institutions .
it 's encouraging for those of us who work for the eu . "
bumpy road to treaty deal the road to the treaty deal , however , was anything but smooth .
as head of the six-month rotating presidency , german chancellor angela merkel led marathon negotiations at a fractious summit of european leaders in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles for the camera but tension behind the scenes - merkel with jaroslaw kaczynski the meeting was overshadowed by fraught discussions , in particular with poland .
warsaw clashed with berlin over the issues of its voting rights and the resulting compromise agreement included controversial concessions for poland .
then polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski was frequently at odds with other eu members too , a stance that threatened to isolate poland from the rest of europe .
in november , there was widespread relief in the eu as voters in poland threw out the conservative government led by kaczynski in favor of the pro-eu leader donald tusk and his center-right civic platform party .
the new eu reform treaty seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage .
it 's seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
" europe will be able to present a more united face in the world through a commissioner responsible for foreign policy and a permanent eu council president , " merkel said earlier this month .
" the national parliaments and thus citizens will able to influence more strongly what 's decided in europe . "
hungary became the first nation to ratify the eu treaty .

wherever and however you celebrate , we wish you a good time together with people who are close to your heart . many of us can look back on a good year : at wishes that were fulfilled and endeavors that were worth the effort .
for some of us , a look back is also marked by painful memories : the loss of people dear to us , a fateful blow or thwarted hopes .
for everyone who 's unable to celebrate christmas with a light heart , i wish you strength and confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors have a lifetime of learning to pass on this year , too , i have traveled a lot in our country , and i 'm thankful for what people have shown me .
they have told me about their worries and difficulties , but also that they feel like things have gotten better in germany .
one thing in particular moves me every time : citizens joining forces where they face common problems and setting about to find solutions together , often entirely independent of public offices and authorities .
things come into being : playgrounds , theater groups and job exchanges for the unemployed and school partnerships , for example . and , in the end , people are happy to discover : we did more than merely filling a gap .
together , we have created something meaningful that shows us how much creative energy we possess and how much actually depends on us .
we have received confirmation and we have also taken one step against loneliness .
ever more people brought together by a common aim are taking responsibility for one another , and there they find something of the foothold that every one of us needs .
that 's good news .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens want to stay involved let us imagine what would happen if the young and old in germany truly discovered what they could make possible together .
let 's see : in the past 100 years , life expectancy here has increased by 30 years .
the years gained are a great gift .
but i sometimes think we still do n't pay enough heed to them .
people who can do a lot , who have a lot of experience and energy are still pushed out of active life .
yet so many of them want to pass on something to the young . i 'm thinking of the church musician in saxony who helps children with their homework .
i 'm thinking of the retired teacher in hamburg who knows how important good manners are and teaches them to schoolchildren , regardless of where they come from .
i 'm thinking of the manager who , after the end of his professional career , helps young people start their own companies , and the craftsman who , as a pensioner , goes to africa to train apprentices . i think it 's worthwhile to build on such examples .
i want the experience and poise of older people to connect with the eagerness and curiosity of the young , and i 'm sure that where that happens , it will result in good . i would like to thank everyone who already demonstrates that on a daily basis : the many grandparents who take care of their grandchildren and the older people who look out for children in their neighborhood and speak well of them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to contemplate life we all know how important attentiveness is .
i would also like to thank the young people who are there for their elderly relatives .
at the same time , the young families have a lot to bear .
the working world has certainly become more difficult and the burden of costs and taxes is high .
but the amount of trust and help we have between generations today , and what we can still make possible , is a treasure from which everyone benefits and which each person can add to . this evening i would like to thank everyone who is doing service over the holidays .
and i would like to send thanks and a greeting from home to our soldiers , our police officers and our aid workers abroad , working for world peace .
my thoughts in this hour also go out to the families of those who have lost their lives in foreign deployments . christmas is , for both of us , two things : a time to contemplate what is really important to us and a time to gain new confidence and to go forward , freshly bolstered .
let 's bring some of this special atmosphere into the new year and beyond . my wife and i wish you all tranquil holidays and a good , peaceful new year . translated by nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ever more people brought together by a common aim are taking responsibility for one another , and there they find something of the foothold that every one of us needs .
that 's good news .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens want to stay involved let us imagine what would happen if the young and old in germany truly discovered what they could make possible together .
let 's see : in the past 100 years , life expectancy here has increased by 30 years .
the years gained are a great gift .
but i sometimes think we still do n't pay enough heed to them .
people who can do a lot , who have a lot of experience and energy are still pushed out of active life .
yet so many of them want to pass on something to the young . i 'm thinking of the church musician in saxony who helps children with their homework .
i 'm thinking of the retired teacher in hamburg who knows how important good manners are and teaches them to schoolchildren , regardless of where they come from .
i 'm thinking of the manager who , after the end of his professional career , helps young people start their own companies , and the craftsman who , as a pensioner , goes to africa to train apprentices . i think it 's worthwhile to build on such examples .
i want the experience and poise of older people to connect with the eagerness and curiosity of the young , and i 'm sure that where that happens , it will result in good . i would like to thank everyone who already demonstrates that on a daily basis : the many grandparents who take care of their grandchildren and the older people who look out for children in their neighborhood and speak well of them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to contemplate life we all know how important attentiveness is .
i would also like to thank the young people who are there for their elderly relatives .
at the same time , the young families have a lot to bear .
the working world has certainly become more difficult and the burden of costs and taxes is high .
but the amount of trust and help we have between generations today , and what we can still make possible , is a treasure from which everyone benefits and which each person can add to . this evening i would like to thank everyone who is doing service over the holidays .
and i would like to send thanks and a greeting from home to our soldiers , our police officers and our aid workers abroad , working for world peace .
my thoughts in this hour also go out to the families of those who have lost their lives in foreign deployments . christmas is , for both of us , two things : a time to contemplate what is really important to us and a time to gain new confidence and to go forward , freshly bolstered .
let 's bring some of this special atmosphere into the new year and beyond . my wife and i wish you all tranquil holidays and a good , peaceful new year . translated by nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

come year 's end , however , the 27-nation bloc can look back on some successes , the biggest one being the deal on its roadmap for the future . the european union will be ushering in the new year with a huge sense of relief at tackling one of the biggest challenges in its history .
two years after the citizens of france and the netherlands shot down a draft constitution in separate referendums , plunging the eu into crisis , the bloc managed to get its deeply divided members to agree on a pared down version of the treaty meant to reform its institutions .
earlier in the month , eu leaders gathered in lisbon to sign the landmark treaty .
eu commissioner for communications margot wallström said that the treaty of lisbon was a wonderful birthday gift for the eu , which turned 50 this year , and that the bloc 's popularity has grown as a result .
" membership of the eu is viewed positively , " wallström said .
" there 's more trust in its institutions .
it 's encouraging for those of us who work for the eu . "
bumpy road to treaty deal the road to the treaty deal , however , was anything but smooth .
as head of the six-month rotating presidency , german chancellor angela merkel led marathon negotiations at a fractious summit of european leaders in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles for the camera but tension behind the scenes - merkel with jaroslaw kaczynski the meeting was overshadowed by fraught discussions , in particular with poland .
warsaw clashed with berlin over the issues of its voting rights and the resulting compromise agreement included controversial concessions for poland .
then polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski was frequently at odds with other eu members too , a stance that threatened to isolate poland from the rest of europe .
in november , there was widespread relief in the eu as voters in poland threw out the conservative government led by kaczynski in favor of the pro-eu leader donald tusk and his center-right civic platform party .
the new eu reform treaty seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage .
it 's seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
" europe will be able to present a more united face in the world through a commissioner responsible for foreign policy and a permanent eu council president , " merkel said earlier this month .
" the national parliaments and thus citizens will able to influence more strongly what 's decided in europe . "
hungary became the first nation to ratify the eu treaty .
other members will have to follow by early 2009 , ahead of elections for the european parliament .
climate , russia pose challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dealing with russia - putin with portuguese premier jose socrates while the eu managed to climb out of the slump sparked by the constitutional crisis , it faced further challenges on the international level in the form of climate change and russia 's increasingly aggressive energy policy .
at an eu energy summit in march , the bloc agreed on forging a common eu energy policy to deal with global problems .
" we have to realize that we face global challenges : limited resources , climate change , dependence on imports and the need to invest in energy plants , " said andrej piebalgs , eu energy commissioner . " the eu 's answer is a common energy policy . "
the eu committed itself to reducing by 20 percent its levels of the principal greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
member states will also be required to make renewable energies such as solar and wind account for at least 20 percent of the total energy consumption across the eu by 2020 .
russia 's growing assertiveness on the world stage and outgoing president vladimir putin 's continuing clinging to power soured relations with the eu and marred regular summits between brussels and the kremlin .
the issue is now on hold until after russian elections in march 2008 .
africa , kosovo lingering problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo will be one problem the eu will carry over to the next year africa was also a priority for the eu this year .
after a seven-year break , the leaders of both continents met in lisbon for a summit - with the exception of british premier gordon brown who stayed home to protest human right violations in zimbabwe .
the eu-africa summit , however , did not achieve anything substantial .
the eu criticized governance in africa while african leaders joined forces and rejected the proffered economic cooperation .
kosovo , too , remains an unresolved problem , despite efforts by eu mediators .
not all eu states want to see independence for kosovo albanians and serbia , which has russia 's support , remains vehemently opposed to the idea of secession .
several balkan countries , with the exception of croatia , have been slow in coming around to the eu 's position on the serbian province .
it 's an issue that has raised hackles in parts of the eu .
" eu candidates have to fulfill conditions , not the european union , " said olli rehn , the eu 's enlargement commissioner .
" serbia wants to join the eu , not the other way around . "
a triumph and further responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party time - the schengen zone was expanded this month the eu managed to chalk up one triumph this month when the visa-free schengen zone was expanded to include nine additional european member states .
only new eu members romania and bulgaria remain outside the passport-free area .
though fears of criminality persist , eu leaders celebrated the event as a historic moment .
the eu will have its hands full in the coming year with a question mark still hovering over turkey 's eu membership as french president nicolas sarkozy underlines his continuing opposition to the prospect .
taking stock of the year , eu commission jose barroso said in an interview with deutsche welle that 2007 was overall a good year for the eu .
" europe should not fear the responsibilities of the 21st century , " barroso said .
" on the contrary , we 're a success story for globalization . "
" if we organize our diversity multinationally , we can show that we 're already equipped for a world in which each one has contact with the other , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

come year 's end , however , the 27-nation bloc can look back on some successes , the biggest one being the deal on its roadmap for the future . the european union will be ushering in the new year with a huge sense of relief at tackling one of the biggest challenges in its history .
two years after the citizens of france and the netherlands shot down a draft constitution in separate referendums , plunging the eu into crisis , the bloc managed to get its deeply divided members to agree on a pared down version of the treaty meant to reform its institutions .
earlier in the month , eu leaders gathered in lisbon to sign the landmark treaty .
eu commissioner for communications margot wallström said that the treaty of lisbon was a wonderful birthday gift for the eu , which turned 50 this year , and that the bloc 's popularity has grown as a result .
" membership of the eu is viewed positively , " wallström said .
" there 's more trust in its institutions .
it 's encouraging for those of us who work for the eu . "
bumpy road to treaty deal the road to the treaty deal , however , was anything but smooth .
as head of the six-month rotating presidency , german chancellor angela merkel led marathon negotiations at a fractious summit of european leaders in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles for the camera but tension behind the scenes - merkel with jaroslaw kaczynski the meeting was overshadowed by fraught discussions , in particular with poland .
warsaw clashed with berlin over the issues of its voting rights and the resulting compromise agreement included controversial concessions for poland .
then polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski was frequently at odds with other eu members too , a stance that threatened to isolate poland from the rest of europe .
in november , there was widespread relief in the eu as voters in poland threw out the conservative government led by kaczynski in favor of the pro-eu leader donald tusk and his center-right civic platform party .
the new eu reform treaty seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage .
it 's seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
" europe will be able to present a more united face in the world through a commissioner responsible for foreign policy and a permanent eu council president , " merkel said earlier this month .
" the national parliaments and thus citizens will able to influence more strongly what 's decided in europe . "
hungary became the first nation to ratify the eu treaty .
other members will have to follow by early 2009 , ahead of elections for the european parliament .
climate , russia pose challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dealing with russia - putin with portuguese premier jose socrates while the eu managed to climb out of the slump sparked by the constitutional crisis , it faced further challenges on the international level in the form of climate change and russia 's increasingly aggressive energy policy .
at an eu energy summit in march , the bloc agreed on forging a common eu energy policy to deal with global problems .
" we have to realize that we face global challenges : limited resources , climate change , dependence on imports and the need to invest in energy plants , " said andrej piebalgs , eu energy commissioner . " the eu 's answer is a common energy policy . "
the eu committed itself to reducing by 20 percent its levels of the principal greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
member states will also be required to make renewable energies such as solar and wind account for at least 20 percent of the total energy consumption across the eu by 2020 .
russia 's growing assertiveness on the world stage and outgoing president vladimir putin 's continuing clinging to power soured relations with the eu and marred regular summits between brussels and the kremlin .
the issue is now on hold until after russian elections in march 2008 .
africa , kosovo lingering problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo will be one problem the eu will carry over to the next year africa was also a priority for the eu this year .
after a seven-year break , the leaders of both continents met in lisbon for a summit - with the exception of british premier gordon brown who stayed home to protest human right violations in zimbabwe .
the eu-africa summit , however , did not achieve anything substantial .
the eu criticized governance in africa while african leaders joined forces and rejected the proffered economic cooperation .
kosovo , too , remains an unresolved problem , despite efforts by eu mediators .
not all eu states want to see independence for kosovo albanians and serbia , which has russia 's support , remains vehemently opposed to the idea of secession .
several balkan countries , with the exception of croatia , have been slow in coming around to the eu 's position on the serbian province .
it 's an issue that has raised hackles in parts of the eu .
" eu candidates have to fulfill conditions , not the european union , " said olli rehn , the eu 's enlargement commissioner .
" serbia wants to join the eu , not the other way around . "
a triumph and further responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party time - the schengen zone was expanded this month the eu managed to chalk up one triumph this month when the visa-free schengen zone was expanded to include nine additional european member states .
only new eu members romania and bulgaria remain outside the passport-free area .
though fears of criminality persist , eu leaders celebrated the event as a historic moment .
the eu will have its hands full in the coming year with a question mark still hovering over turkey 's eu membership as french president nicolas sarkozy underlines his continuing opposition to the prospect .
taking stock of the year , eu commission jose barroso said in an interview with deutsche welle that 2007 was overall a good year for the eu .
" europe should not fear the responsibilities of the 21st century , " barroso said .
" on the contrary , we 're a success story for globalization . "

member states will also be required to make renewable energies such as solar and wind account for at least 20 percent of the total energy consumption across the eu by 2020 .
russia 's growing assertiveness on the world stage and outgoing president vladimir putin 's continuing clinging to power soured relations with the eu and marred regular summits between brussels and the kremlin .
the issue is now on hold until after russian elections in march 2008 .
africa , kosovo lingering problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo will be one problem the eu will carry over to the next year africa was also a priority for the eu this year .
after a seven-year break , the leaders of both continents met in lisbon for a summit - with the exception of british premier gordon brown who stayed home to protest human right violations in zimbabwe .
the eu-africa summit , however , did not achieve anything substantial .
the eu criticized governance in africa while african leaders joined forces and rejected the proffered economic cooperation .
kosovo , too , remains an unresolved problem , despite efforts by eu mediators .
not all eu states want to see independence for kosovo albanians and serbia , which has russia 's support , remains vehemently opposed to the idea of secession .
several balkan countries , with the exception of croatia , have been slow in coming around to the eu 's position on the serbian province .
it 's an issue that has raised hackles in parts of the eu .
" eu candidates have to fulfill conditions , not the european union , " said olli rehn , the eu 's enlargement commissioner .
" serbia wants to join the eu , not the other way around . "
a triumph and further responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party time - the schengen zone was expanded this month the eu managed to chalk up one triumph this month when the visa-free schengen zone was expanded to include nine additional european member states .
only new eu members romania and bulgaria remain outside the passport-free area .
though fears of criminality persist , eu leaders celebrated the event as a historic moment .
the eu will have its hands full in the coming year with a question mark still hovering over turkey 's eu membership as french president nicolas sarkozy underlines his continuing opposition to the prospect .
taking stock of the year , eu commission jose barroso said in an interview with deutsche welle that 2007 was overall a good year for the eu .
" europe should not fear the responsibilities of the 21st century , " barroso said .
" on the contrary , we 're a success story for globalization . "
" if we organize our diversity multinationally , we can show that we 're already equipped for a world in which each one has contact with the other , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

wherever and however you celebrate , we wish you a good time together with people who are close to your heart . many of us can look back on a good year : at wishes that were fulfilled and endeavors that were worth the effort .

things come into being : playgrounds , theater groups and job exchanges for the unemployed and school partnerships , for example . and , in the end , people are happy to discover : we did more than merely filling a gap .
together , we have created something meaningful that shows us how much creative energy we possess and how much actually depends on us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 25.12.2007 landmark treaty deal eu 's biggest success in 2007 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu managed to rise up to some of the main challenges haunting it throughout 2007 , the eu struggled to salvage its derailed constitution .
come year 's end , however , the 27-nation bloc can look back on some successes , the biggest one being the deal on its roadmap for the future . the european union will be ushering in the new year with a huge sense of relief at tackling one of the biggest challenges in its history .
two years after the citizens of france and the netherlands shot down a draft constitution in separate referendums , plunging the eu into crisis , the bloc managed to get its deeply divided members to agree on a pared down version of the treaty meant to reform its institutions .
earlier in the month , eu leaders gathered in lisbon to sign the landmark treaty .
eu commissioner for communications margot wallström said that the treaty of lisbon was a wonderful birthday gift for the eu , which turned 50 this year , and that the bloc 's popularity has grown as a result .
" membership of the eu is viewed positively , " wallström said .
" there 's more trust in its institutions .
it 's encouraging for those of us who work for the eu . "
bumpy road to treaty deal the road to the treaty deal , however , was anything but smooth .
as head of the six-month rotating presidency , german chancellor angela merkel led marathon negotiations at a fractious summit of european leaders in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles for the camera but tension behind the scenes - merkel with jaroslaw kaczynski the meeting was overshadowed by fraught discussions , in particular with poland .
warsaw clashed with berlin over the issues of its voting rights and the resulting compromise agreement included controversial concessions for poland .
then polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski was frequently at odds with other eu members too , a stance that threatened to isolate poland from the rest of europe .
in november , there was widespread relief in the eu as voters in poland threw out the conservative government led by kaczynski in favor of the pro-eu leader donald tusk and his center-right civic platform party .
the new eu reform treaty seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage .
it 's seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
" europe will be able to present a more united face in the world through a commissioner responsible for foreign policy and a permanent eu council president , " merkel said earlier this month .
" the national parliaments and thus citizens will able to influence more strongly what 's decided in europe . "
hungary became the first nation to ratify the eu treaty .
other members will have to follow by early 2009 , ahead of elections for the european parliament .
climate , russia pose challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dealing with russia - putin with portuguese premier jose socrates while the eu managed to climb out of the slump sparked by the constitutional crisis , it faced further challenges on the international level in the form of climate change and russia 's increasingly aggressive energy policy .
at an eu energy summit in march , the bloc agreed on forging a common eu energy policy to deal with global problems .
" we have to realize that we face global challenges : limited resources , climate change , dependence on imports and the need to invest in energy plants , " said andrej piebalgs , eu energy commissioner . " the eu 's answer is a common energy policy . "
the eu committed itself to reducing by 20 percent its levels of the principal greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
member states will also be required to make renewable energies such as solar and wind account for at least 20 percent of the total energy consumption across the eu by 2020 .
russia 's growing assertiveness on the world stage and outgoing president vladimir putin 's continuing clinging to power soured relations with the eu and marred regular summits between brussels and the kremlin .
the issue is now on hold until after russian elections in march 2008 .
africa , kosovo lingering problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo will be one problem the eu will carry over to the next year africa was also a priority for the eu this year .
after a seven-year break , the leaders of both continents met in lisbon for a summit - with the exception of british premier gordon brown who stayed home to protest human right violations in zimbabwe .
the eu-africa summit , however , did not achieve anything substantial .
the eu criticized governance in africa while african leaders joined forces and rejected the proffered economic cooperation .
kosovo , too , remains an unresolved problem , despite efforts by eu mediators .
not all eu states want to see independence for kosovo albanians and serbia , which has russia 's support , remains vehemently opposed to the idea of secession .
several balkan countries , with the exception of croatia , have been slow in coming around to the eu 's position on the serbian province .
it 's an issue that has raised hackles in parts of the eu .
" eu candidates have to fulfill conditions , not the european union , " said olli rehn , the eu 's enlargement commissioner .
" serbia wants to join the eu , not the other way around . "
a triumph and further responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party time - the schengen zone was expanded this month the eu managed to chalk up one triumph this month when the visa-free schengen zone was expanded to include nine additional european member states .
only new eu members romania and bulgaria remain outside the passport-free area .
though fears of criminality persist , eu leaders celebrated the event as a historic moment .
the eu will have its hands full in the coming year with a question mark still hovering over turkey 's eu membership as french president nicolas sarkozy underlines his continuing opposition to the prospect .
taking stock of the year , eu commission jose barroso said in an interview with deutsche welle that 2007 was overall a good year for the eu .
" europe should not fear the responsibilities of the 21st century , " barroso said .
" on the contrary , we 're a success story for globalization . "
" if we organize our diversity multinationally , we can show that we 're already equipped for a world in which each one has contact with the other , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

wherever and however you celebrate , we wish you a good time together with people who are close to your heart . many of us can look back on a good year : at wishes that were fulfilled and endeavors that were worth the effort .
for some of us , a look back is also marked by painful memories : the loss of people dear to us , a fateful blow or thwarted hopes .
for everyone who 's unable to celebrate christmas with a light heart , i wish you strength and confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors have a lifetime of learning to pass on this year , too , i have traveled a lot in our country , and i 'm thankful for what people have shown me .
they have told me about their worries and difficulties , but also that they feel like things have gotten better in germany .
one thing in particular moves me every time : citizens joining forces where they face common problems and setting about to find solutions together , often entirely independent of public offices and authorities .
things come into being : playgrounds , theater groups and job exchanges for the unemployed and school partnerships , for example . and , in the end , people are happy to discover : we did more than merely filling a gap .
together , we have created something meaningful that shows us how much creative energy we possess and how much actually depends on us .
we have received confirmation and we have also taken one step against loneliness .
ever more people brought together by a common aim are taking responsibility for one another , and there they find something of the foothold that every one of us needs .
that 's good news .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens want to stay involved let us imagine what would happen if the young and old in germany truly discovered what they could make possible together .
let 's see : in the past 100 years , life expectancy here has increased by 30 years .
the years gained are a great gift .
but i sometimes think we still do n't pay enough heed to them .
people who can do a lot , who have a lot of experience and energy are still pushed out of active life .
yet so many of them want to pass on something to the young . i 'm thinking of the church musician in saxony who helps children with their homework .
i 'm thinking of the retired teacher in hamburg who knows how important good manners are and teaches them to schoolchildren , regardless of where they come from .
i 'm thinking of the manager who , after the end of his professional career , helps young people start their own companies , and the craftsman who , as a pensioner , goes to africa to train apprentices . i think it 's worthwhile to build on such examples .
i want the experience and poise of older people to connect with the eagerness and curiosity of the young , and i 'm sure that where that happens , it will result in good . i would like to thank everyone who already demonstrates that on a daily basis : the many grandparents who take care of their grandchildren and the older people who look out for children in their neighborhood and speak well of them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to contemplate life we all know how important attentiveness is .
i would also like to thank the young people who are there for their elderly relatives .
at the same time , the young families have a lot to bear .
the working world has certainly become more difficult and the burden of costs and taxes is high .
but the amount of trust and help we have between generations today , and what we can still make possible , is a treasure from which everyone benefits and which each person can add to . this evening i would like to thank everyone who is doing service over the holidays .
and i would like to send thanks and a greeting from home to our soldiers , our police officers and our aid workers abroad , working for world peace .
my thoughts in this hour also go out to the families of those who have lost their lives in foreign deployments . christmas is , for both of us , two things : a time to contemplate what is really important to us and a time to gain new confidence and to go forward , freshly bolstered .

wherever and however you celebrate , we wish you a good time together with people who are close to your heart . many of us can look back on a good year : at wishes that were fulfilled and endeavors that were worth the effort .
for some of us , a look back is also marked by painful memories : the loss of people dear to us , a fateful blow or thwarted hopes .
for everyone who 's unable to celebrate christmas with a light heart , i wish you strength and confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors have a lifetime of learning to pass on this year , too , i have traveled a lot in our country , and i 'm thankful for what people have shown me .
they have told me about their worries and difficulties , but also that they feel like things have gotten better in germany .
one thing in particular moves me every time : citizens joining forces where they face common problems and setting about to find solutions together , often entirely independent of public offices and authorities .
things come into being : playgrounds , theater groups and job exchanges for the unemployed and school partnerships , for example . and , in the end , people are happy to discover : we did more than merely filling a gap .
together , we have created something meaningful that shows us how much creative energy we possess and how much actually depends on us .
we have received confirmation and we have also taken one step against loneliness .
ever more people brought together by a common aim are taking responsibility for one another , and there they find something of the foothold that every one of us needs .
that 's good news .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens want to stay involved let us imagine what would happen if the young and old in germany truly discovered what they could make possible together .
let 's see : in the past 100 years , life expectancy here has increased by 30 years .
the years gained are a great gift .
but i sometimes think we still do n't pay enough heed to them .
people who can do a lot , who have a lot of experience and energy are still pushed out of active life .
yet so many of them want to pass on something to the young . i 'm thinking of the church musician in saxony who helps children with their homework .
i 'm thinking of the retired teacher in hamburg who knows how important good manners are and teaches them to schoolchildren , regardless of where they come from .
i 'm thinking of the manager who , after the end of his professional career , helps young people start their own companies , and the craftsman who , as a pensioner , goes to africa to train apprentices . i think it 's worthwhile to build on such examples .
i want the experience and poise of older people to connect with the eagerness and curiosity of the young , and i 'm sure that where that happens , it will result in good . i would like to thank everyone who already demonstrates that on a daily basis : the many grandparents who take care of their grandchildren and the older people who look out for children in their neighborhood and speak well of them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to contemplate life we all know how important attentiveness is .
i would also like to thank the young people who are there for their elderly relatives .
at the same time , the young families have a lot to bear .
the working world has certainly become more difficult and the burden of costs and taxes is high .
but the amount of trust and help we have between generations today , and what we can still make possible , is a treasure from which everyone benefits and which each person can add to . this evening i would like to thank everyone who is doing service over the holidays .
and i would like to send thanks and a greeting from home to our soldiers , our police officers and our aid workers abroad , working for world peace .
my thoughts in this hour also go out to the families of those who have lost their lives in foreign deployments . christmas is , for both of us , two things : a time to contemplate what is really important to us and a time to gain new confidence and to go forward , freshly bolstered .
let 's bring some of this special atmosphere into the new year and beyond . my wife and i wish you all tranquil holidays and a good , peaceful new year . translated by nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 25.12.2007 landmark treaty deal eu 's biggest success in 2007 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu managed to rise up to some of the main challenges haunting it throughout 2007 , the eu struggled to salvage its derailed constitution .
come year 's end , however , the 27-nation bloc can look back on some successes , the biggest one being the deal on its roadmap for the future . the european union will be ushering in the new year with a huge sense of relief at tackling one of the biggest challenges in its history .
two years after the citizens of france and the netherlands shot down a draft constitution in separate referendums , plunging the eu into crisis , the bloc managed to get its deeply divided members to agree on a pared down version of the treaty meant to reform its institutions .
earlier in the month , eu leaders gathered in lisbon to sign the landmark treaty .
eu commissioner for communications margot wallström said that the treaty of lisbon was a wonderful birthday gift for the eu , which turned 50 this year , and that the bloc 's popularity has grown as a result .
" membership of the eu is viewed positively , " wallström said .
" there 's more trust in its institutions .
it 's encouraging for those of us who work for the eu . "
bumpy road to treaty deal the road to the treaty deal , however , was anything but smooth .
as head of the six-month rotating presidency , german chancellor angela merkel led marathon negotiations at a fractious summit of european leaders in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles for the camera but tension behind the scenes - merkel with jaroslaw kaczynski the meeting was overshadowed by fraught discussions , in particular with poland .
warsaw clashed with berlin over the issues of its voting rights and the resulting compromise agreement included controversial concessions for poland .
then polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski was frequently at odds with other eu members too , a stance that threatened to isolate poland from the rest of europe .
in november , there was widespread relief in the eu as voters in poland threw out the conservative government led by kaczynski in favor of the pro-eu leader donald tusk and his center-right civic platform party .
the new eu reform treaty seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage .
it 's seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
" europe will be able to present a more united face in the world through a commissioner responsible for foreign policy and a permanent eu council president , " merkel said earlier this month .
" the national parliaments and thus citizens will able to influence more strongly what 's decided in europe . "
hungary became the first nation to ratify the eu treaty .
other members will have to follow by early 2009 , ahead of elections for the european parliament .
climate , russia pose challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dealing with russia - putin with portuguese premier jose socrates while the eu managed to climb out of the slump sparked by the constitutional crisis , it faced further challenges on the international level in the form of climate change and russia 's increasingly aggressive energy policy .
at an eu energy summit in march , the bloc agreed on forging a common eu energy policy to deal with global problems .
" we have to realize that we face global challenges : limited resources , climate change , dependence on imports and the need to invest in energy plants , " said andrej piebalgs , eu energy commissioner . " the eu 's answer is a common energy policy . "
the eu committed itself to reducing by 20 percent its levels of the principal greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
member states will also be required to make renewable energies such as solar and wind account for at least 20 percent of the total energy consumption across the eu by 2020 .
russia 's growing assertiveness on the world stage and outgoing president vladimir putin 's continuing clinging to power soured relations with the eu and marred regular summits between brussels and the kremlin .
the issue is now on hold until after russian elections in march 2008 .
africa , kosovo lingering problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo will be one problem the eu will carry over to the next year africa was also a priority for the eu this year .
after a seven-year break , the leaders of both continents met in lisbon for a summit - with the exception of british premier gordon brown who stayed home to protest human right violations in zimbabwe .
the eu-africa summit , however , did not achieve anything substantial .
the eu criticized governance in africa while african leaders joined forces and rejected the proffered economic cooperation .
kosovo , too , remains an unresolved problem , despite efforts by eu mediators .
not all eu states want to see independence for kosovo albanians and serbia , which has russia 's support , remains vehemently opposed to the idea of secession .
several balkan countries , with the exception of croatia , have been slow in coming around to the eu 's position on the serbian province .
it 's an issue that has raised hackles in parts of the eu .
" eu candidates have to fulfill conditions , not the european union , " said olli rehn , the eu 's enlargement commissioner .
" serbia wants to join the eu , not the other way around . "
a triumph and further responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party time - the schengen zone was expanded this month the eu managed to chalk up one triumph this month when the visa-free schengen zone was expanded to include nine additional european member states .
only new eu members romania and bulgaria remain outside the passport-free area .
though fears of criminality persist , eu leaders celebrated the event as a historic moment .
the eu will have its hands full in the coming year with a question mark still hovering over turkey 's eu membership as french president nicolas sarkozy underlines his continuing opposition to the prospect .
taking stock of the year , eu commission jose barroso said in an interview with deutsche welle that 2007 was overall a good year for the eu .
" europe should not fear the responsibilities of the 21st century , " barroso said .
" on the contrary , we 're a success story for globalization . "

come year 's end , however , the 27-nation bloc can look back on some successes , the biggest one being the deal on its roadmap for the future . the european union will be ushering in the new year with a huge sense of relief at tackling one of the biggest challenges in its history .
two years after the citizens of france and the netherlands shot down a draft constitution in separate referendums , plunging the eu into crisis , the bloc managed to get its deeply divided members to agree on a pared down version of the treaty meant to reform its institutions .
earlier in the month , eu leaders gathered in lisbon to sign the landmark treaty .
eu commissioner for communications margot wallström said that the treaty of lisbon was a wonderful birthday gift for the eu , which turned 50 this year , and that the bloc 's popularity has grown as a result .
" membership of the eu is viewed positively , " wallström said .
" there 's more trust in its institutions .
it 's encouraging for those of us who work for the eu . "
bumpy road to treaty deal the road to the treaty deal , however , was anything but smooth .
as head of the six-month rotating presidency , german chancellor angela merkel led marathon negotiations at a fractious summit of european leaders in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles for the camera but tension behind the scenes - merkel with jaroslaw kaczynski the meeting was overshadowed by fraught discussions , in particular with poland .
warsaw clashed with berlin over the issues of its voting rights and the resulting compromise agreement included controversial concessions for poland .
then polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski was frequently at odds with other eu members too , a stance that threatened to isolate poland from the rest of europe .
in november , there was widespread relief in the eu as voters in poland threw out the conservative government led by kaczynski in favor of the pro-eu leader donald tusk and his center-right civic platform party .
the new eu reform treaty seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage .
it 's seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
" europe will be able to present a more united face in the world through a commissioner responsible for foreign policy and a permanent eu council president , " merkel said earlier this month .
" the national parliaments and thus citizens will able to influence more strongly what 's decided in europe . "
hungary became the first nation to ratify the eu treaty .
other members will have to follow by early 2009 , ahead of elections for the european parliament .
climate , russia pose challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dealing with russia - putin with portuguese premier jose socrates while the eu managed to climb out of the slump sparked by the constitutional crisis , it faced further challenges on the international level in the form of climate change and russia 's increasingly aggressive energy policy .
at an eu energy summit in march , the bloc agreed on forging a common eu energy policy to deal with global problems .
" we have to realize that we face global challenges : limited resources , climate change , dependence on imports and the need to invest in energy plants , " said andrej piebalgs , eu energy commissioner . " the eu 's answer is a common energy policy . "
the eu committed itself to reducing by 20 percent its levels of the principal greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
member states will also be required to make renewable energies such as solar and wind account for at least 20 percent of the total energy consumption across the eu by 2020 .

" barrier-free energy branch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pipeline project has raised concerns over gas supply in transit country poland despite a growing economy , foreign companies looking to set up shop in russia often complain of strict market regulations , excessive bureaucracy and monopolistic tendencies of state-run banks . the energy sector , however , is an exception .
germany gets one third of its natural gas from russia - the country with the largest natural gas supply in the world - and its energy need is increasing . though there is concern in germany about becoming too dependent on russian gas , chorokordin sees the situation positively . " russia is just as dependent on germany - it 's a mutual dependence , " he said .
" dependence should n't be used for political pressure . " to ensure the regular delivery of natural gas , german energy companies e.on , ruhrgas and basf have agreed together with russia 's state-run gazprom to construct a pipeline off the coast of the baltic sea .

wherever and however you celebrate , we wish you a good time together with people who are close to your heart . many of us can look back on a good year : at wishes that were fulfilled and endeavors that were worth the effort .
for some of us , a look back is also marked by painful memories : the loss of people dear to us , a fateful blow or thwarted hopes .
for everyone who 's unable to celebrate christmas with a light heart , i wish you strength and confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors have a lifetime of learning to pass on this year , too , i have traveled a lot in our country , and i 'm thankful for what people have shown me .
they have told me about their worries and difficulties , but also that they feel like things have gotten better in germany .
one thing in particular moves me every time : citizens joining forces where they face common problems and setting about to find solutions together , often entirely independent of public offices and authorities .
things come into being : playgrounds , theater groups and job exchanges for the unemployed and school partnerships , for example . and , in the end , people are happy to discover : we did more than merely filling a gap .
together , we have created something meaningful that shows us how much creative energy we possess and how much actually depends on us .
we have received confirmation and we have also taken one step against loneliness .
ever more people brought together by a common aim are taking responsibility for one another , and there they find something of the foothold that every one of us needs .
that 's good news .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens want to stay involved let us imagine what would happen if the young and old in germany truly discovered what they could make possible together .
let 's see : in the past 100 years , life expectancy here has increased by 30 years .
the years gained are a great gift .
but i sometimes think we still do n't pay enough heed to them .
people who can do a lot , who have a lot of experience and energy are still pushed out of active life .
yet so many of them want to pass on something to the young . i 'm thinking of the church musician in saxony who helps children with their homework .
i 'm thinking of the retired teacher in hamburg who knows how important good manners are and teaches them to schoolchildren , regardless of where they come from .
i 'm thinking of the manager who , after the end of his professional career , helps young people start their own companies , and the craftsman who , as a pensioner , goes to africa to train apprentices . i think it 's worthwhile to build on such examples .
i want the experience and poise of older people to connect with the eagerness and curiosity of the young , and i 'm sure that where that happens , it will result in good . i would like to thank everyone who already demonstrates that on a daily basis : the many grandparents who take care of their grandchildren and the older people who look out for children in their neighborhood and speak well of them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to contemplate life we all know how important attentiveness is .
i would also like to thank the young people who are there for their elderly relatives .
at the same time , the young families have a lot to bear .
the working world has certainly become more difficult and the burden of costs and taxes is high .
but the amount of trust and help we have between generations today , and what we can still make possible , is a treasure from which everyone benefits and which each person can add to . this evening i would like to thank everyone who is doing service over the holidays .
and i would like to send thanks and a greeting from home to our soldiers , our police officers and our aid workers abroad , working for world peace .
my thoughts in this hour also go out to the families of those who have lost their lives in foreign deployments . christmas is , for both of us , two things : a time to contemplate what is really important to us and a time to gain new confidence and to go forward , freshly bolstered .
let 's bring some of this special atmosphere into the new year and beyond . my wife and i wish you all tranquil holidays and a good , peaceful new year . translated by nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new chamber of foreign trade has been set up to help german firms get started in russia . profits resulting from commerce between the two countries rose by over 30 percent in 2006 , making russia germany 's biggest trade partner in eastern europe . today , some 4,600 german companies have set up shop between kaliningrad in western russia and vladivostok in siberia , according to counts by the chambers of commerce . most recently , a new car factory was built in kaluga , 300 kilometers -lrb- 190 miles -rrb- away from moscow , where volkswagen will soon begin producing its skoda-octavia and vw-passat models . " the russian economy is booming and the positive developments in the russian federation are improving conditions for trade relations and cooperation , " said fyodor chorokordin , russia 's consul general to germany . there are opportunities in practically every sector , continued chorokordin , " whether production , service or distribution . " russia benefits from made-in-germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , russia was the partner country of the world 's biggest it fair in hanover , germany as far as investments go , however , there is a large discrepancy between the two countries .
in 2006 , german companies invested nearly $ 10 billion -lrb- seven billion euros -rrb- in russia , while russia invested only a tenth of that amount in germany . the main reason is that only a small group of russia companies , predominantly in the machine sector , has settled in germany .
many of these are made up of just a handful of russian employees who have their permanent residence in germany but sell modern german-made machine technology in their home country . machines and technology in russia are outdated , said chorokordin .

wherever and however you celebrate , we wish you a good time together with people who are close to your heart . many of us can look back on a good year : at wishes that were fulfilled and endeavors that were worth the effort .
for some of us , a look back is also marked by painful memories : the loss of people dear to us , a fateful blow or thwarted hopes .
for everyone who 's unable to celebrate christmas with a light heart , i wish you strength and confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors have a lifetime of learning to pass on this year , too , i have traveled a lot in our country , and i 'm thankful for what people have shown me .
they have told me about their worries and difficulties , but also that they feel like things have gotten better in germany .
one thing in particular moves me every time : citizens joining forces where they face common problems and setting about to find solutions together , often entirely independent of public offices and authorities .
things come into being : playgrounds , theater groups and job exchanges for the unemployed and school partnerships , for example . and , in the end , people are happy to discover : we did more than merely filling a gap .
together , we have created something meaningful that shows us how much creative energy we possess and how much actually depends on us .
we have received confirmation and we have also taken one step against loneliness .
ever more people brought together by a common aim are taking responsibility for one another , and there they find something of the foothold that every one of us needs .
that 's good news .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens want to stay involved let us imagine what would happen if the young and old in germany truly discovered what they could make possible together .
let 's see : in the past 100 years , life expectancy here has increased by 30 years .
the years gained are a great gift .
but i sometimes think we still do n't pay enough heed to them .
people who can do a lot , who have a lot of experience and energy are still pushed out of active life .
yet so many of them want to pass on something to the young . i 'm thinking of the church musician in saxony who helps children with their homework .
i 'm thinking of the retired teacher in hamburg who knows how important good manners are and teaches them to schoolchildren , regardless of where they come from .
i 'm thinking of the manager who , after the end of his professional career , helps young people start their own companies , and the craftsman who , as a pensioner , goes to africa to train apprentices . i think it 's worthwhile to build on such examples .
i want the experience and poise of older people to connect with the eagerness and curiosity of the young , and i 'm sure that where that happens , it will result in good . i would like to thank everyone who already demonstrates that on a daily basis : the many grandparents who take care of their grandchildren and the older people who look out for children in their neighborhood and speak well of them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to contemplate life we all know how important attentiveness is .
i would also like to thank the young people who are there for their elderly relatives .
at the same time , the young families have a lot to bear .
the working world has certainly become more difficult and the burden of costs and taxes is high .
but the amount of trust and help we have between generations today , and what we can still make possible , is a treasure from which everyone benefits and which each person can add to . this evening i would like to thank everyone who is doing service over the holidays .
and i would like to send thanks and a greeting from home to our soldiers , our police officers and our aid workers abroad , working for world peace .
my thoughts in this hour also go out to the families of those who have lost their lives in foreign deployments . christmas is , for both of us , two things : a time to contemplate what is really important to us and a time to gain new confidence and to go forward , freshly bolstered .
let 's bring some of this special atmosphere into the new year and beyond . my wife and i wish you all tranquil holidays and a good , peaceful new year . translated by nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new chamber of foreign trade has been set up to help german firms get started in russia . profits resulting from commerce between the two countries rose by over 30 percent in 2006 , making russia germany 's biggest trade partner in eastern europe . today , some 4,600 german companies have set up shop between kaliningrad in western russia and vladivostok in siberia , according to counts by the chambers of commerce . most recently , a new car factory was built in kaluga , 300 kilometers -lrb- 190 miles -rrb- away from moscow , where volkswagen will soon begin producing its skoda-octavia and vw-passat models . " the russian economy is booming and the positive developments in the russian federation are improving conditions for trade relations and cooperation , " said fyodor chorokordin , russia 's consul general to germany . there are opportunities in practically every sector , continued chorokordin , " whether production , service or distribution . " russia benefits from made-in-germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , russia was the partner country of the world 's biggest it fair in hanover , germany as far as investments go , however , there is a large discrepancy between the two countries .
in 2006 , german companies invested nearly $ 10 billion -lrb- seven billion euros -rrb- in russia , while russia invested only a tenth of that amount in germany . the main reason is that only a small group of russia companies , predominantly in the machine sector , has settled in germany .
many of these are made up of just a handful of russian employees who have their permanent residence in germany but sell modern german-made machine technology in their home country . machines and technology in russia are outdated , said chorokordin .
" the russian economy strongly relies on modern machines and german products , which have enjoyed a good reputation for a long time . " barrier-free energy branch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pipeline project has raised concerns over gas supply in transit country poland despite a growing economy , foreign companies looking to set up shop in russia often complain of strict market regulations , excessive bureaucracy and monopolistic tendencies of state-run banks . the energy sector , however , is an exception .
germany gets one third of its natural gas from russia - the country with the largest natural gas supply in the world - and its energy need is increasing . though there is concern in germany about becoming too dependent on russian gas , chorokordin sees the situation positively . " russia is just as dependent on germany - it 's a mutual dependence , " he said .
" dependence should n't be used for political pressure . " to ensure the regular delivery of natural gas , german energy companies e.on , ruhrgas and basf have agreed together with russia 's state-run gazprom to construct a pipeline off the coast of the baltic sea .
starting in 2010 , over 27 billion cubic meters -lrb- 950 billion cubit feet -rrb- of natural gas should flow from vyborg near st. petersburg to greifswald in germany . viktoria gottberg -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the russian economy is booming and the positive developments in the russian federation are improving conditions for trade relations and cooperation , " said fyodor chorokordin , russia 's consul general to germany . there are opportunities in practically every sector , continued chorokordin , " whether production , service or distribution .

germany gets one third of its natural gas from russia - the country with the largest natural gas supply in the world - and its energy need is increasing . though there is concern in germany about becoming too dependent on russian gas , chorokordin sees the situation positively .

" dependence should n't be used for political pressure . " to ensure the regular delivery of natural gas , german energy companies e.on , ruhrgas and basf have agreed together with russia 's state-run gazprom to construct a pipeline off the coast of the baltic sea .

wherever and however you celebrate , we wish you a good time together with people who are close to your heart . many of us can look back on a good year : at wishes that were fulfilled and endeavors that were worth the effort .
for some of us , a look back is also marked by painful memories : the loss of people dear to us , a fateful blow or thwarted hopes .
for everyone who 's unable to celebrate christmas with a light heart , i wish you strength and confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors have a lifetime of learning to pass on this year , too , i have traveled a lot in our country , and i 'm thankful for what people have shown me .
they have told me about their worries and difficulties , but also that they feel like things have gotten better in germany .
one thing in particular moves me every time : citizens joining forces where they face common problems and setting about to find solutions together , often entirely independent of public offices and authorities .
things come into being : playgrounds , theater groups and job exchanges for the unemployed and school partnerships , for example . and , in the end , people are happy to discover : we did more than merely filling a gap .
together , we have created something meaningful that shows us how much creative energy we possess and how much actually depends on us .
we have received confirmation and we have also taken one step against loneliness .

the years gained are a great gift .
but i sometimes think we still do n't pay enough heed to them .
people who can do a lot , who have a lot of experience and energy are still pushed out of active life .
yet so many of them want to pass on something to the young . i 'm thinking of the church musician in saxony who helps children with their homework .
i 'm thinking of the retired teacher in hamburg who knows how important good manners are and teaches them to schoolchildren , regardless of where they come from .
i 'm thinking of the manager who , after the end of his professional career , helps young people start their own companies , and the craftsman who , as a pensioner , goes to africa to train apprentices . i think it 's worthwhile to build on such examples .
i want the experience and poise of older people to connect with the eagerness and curiosity of the young , and i 'm sure that where that happens , it will result in good . i would like to thank everyone who already demonstrates that on a daily basis : the many grandparents who take care of their grandchildren and the older people who look out for children in their neighborhood and speak well of them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to contemplate life we all know how important attentiveness is .
i would also like to thank the young people who are there for their elderly relatives .
at the same time , the young families have a lot to bear .
the working world has certainly become more difficult and the burden of costs and taxes is high .
but the amount of trust and help we have between generations today , and what we can still make possible , is a treasure from which everyone benefits and which each person can add to . this evening i would like to thank everyone who is doing service over the holidays .
and i would like to send thanks and a greeting from home to our soldiers , our police officers and our aid workers abroad , working for world peace .
my thoughts in this hour also go out to the families of those who have lost their lives in foreign deployments . christmas is , for both of us , two things : a time to contemplate what is really important to us and a time to gain new confidence and to go forward , freshly bolstered .

wherever and however you celebrate , we wish you a good time together with people who are close to your heart . many of us can look back on a good year : at wishes that were fulfilled and endeavors that were worth the effort .
for some of us , a look back is also marked by painful memories : the loss of people dear to us , a fateful blow or thwarted hopes .
for everyone who 's unable to celebrate christmas with a light heart , i wish you strength and confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors have a lifetime of learning to pass on this year , too , i have traveled a lot in our country , and i 'm thankful for what people have shown me .
they have told me about their worries and difficulties , but also that they feel like things have gotten better in germany .
one thing in particular moves me every time : citizens joining forces where they face common problems and setting about to find solutions together , often entirely independent of public offices and authorities .
things come into being : playgrounds , theater groups and job exchanges for the unemployed and school partnerships , for example . and , in the end , people are happy to discover : we did more than merely filling a gap .
together , we have created something meaningful that shows us how much creative energy we possess and how much actually depends on us .
we have received confirmation and we have also taken one step against loneliness .
ever more people brought together by a common aim are taking responsibility for one another , and there they find something of the foothold that every one of us needs .
that 's good news .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens want to stay involved let us imagine what would happen if the young and old in germany truly discovered what they could make possible together .
let 's see : in the past 100 years , life expectancy here has increased by 30 years .
the years gained are a great gift .
but i sometimes think we still do n't pay enough heed to them .
people who can do a lot , who have a lot of experience and energy are still pushed out of active life .
yet so many of them want to pass on something to the young . i 'm thinking of the church musician in saxony who helps children with their homework .
i 'm thinking of the retired teacher in hamburg who knows how important good manners are and teaches them to schoolchildren , regardless of where they come from .
i 'm thinking of the manager who , after the end of his professional career , helps young people start their own companies , and the craftsman who , as a pensioner , goes to africa to train apprentices . i think it 's worthwhile to build on such examples .
i want the experience and poise of older people to connect with the eagerness and curiosity of the young , and i 'm sure that where that happens , it will result in good . i would like to thank everyone who already demonstrates that on a daily basis : the many grandparents who take care of their grandchildren and the older people who look out for children in their neighborhood and speak well of them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to contemplate life we all know how important attentiveness is .
i would also like to thank the young people who are there for their elderly relatives .
at the same time , the young families have a lot to bear .
the working world has certainly become more difficult and the burden of costs and taxes is high .
but the amount of trust and help we have between generations today , and what we can still make possible , is a treasure from which everyone benefits and which each person can add to . this evening i would like to thank everyone who is doing service over the holidays .
and i would like to send thanks and a greeting from home to our soldiers , our police officers and our aid workers abroad , working for world peace .
my thoughts in this hour also go out to the families of those who have lost their lives in foreign deployments . christmas is , for both of us , two things : a time to contemplate what is really important to us and a time to gain new confidence and to go forward , freshly bolstered .
let 's bring some of this special atmosphere into the new year and beyond . my wife and i wish you all tranquil holidays and a good , peaceful new year . translated by nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 25.12.2007 landmark treaty deal eu 's biggest success in 2007 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu managed to rise up to some of the main challenges haunting it throughout 2007 , the eu struggled to salvage its derailed constitution .
come year 's end , however , the 27-nation bloc can look back on some successes , the biggest one being the deal on its roadmap for the future . the european union will be ushering in the new year with a huge sense of relief at tackling one of the biggest challenges in its history .
two years after the citizens of france and the netherlands shot down a draft constitution in separate referendums , plunging the eu into crisis , the bloc managed to get its deeply divided members to agree on a pared down version of the treaty meant to reform its institutions .
earlier in the month , eu leaders gathered in lisbon to sign the landmark treaty .
eu commissioner for communications margot wallström said that the treaty of lisbon was a wonderful birthday gift for the eu , which turned 50 this year , and that the bloc 's popularity has grown as a result .
" membership of the eu is viewed positively , " wallström said .
" there 's more trust in its institutions .
it 's encouraging for those of us who work for the eu . "
bumpy road to treaty deal the road to the treaty deal , however , was anything but smooth .
as head of the six-month rotating presidency , german chancellor angela merkel led marathon negotiations at a fractious summit of european leaders in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles for the camera but tension behind the scenes - merkel with jaroslaw kaczynski the meeting was overshadowed by fraught discussions , in particular with poland .
warsaw clashed with berlin over the issues of its voting rights and the resulting compromise agreement included controversial concessions for poland .
then polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski was frequently at odds with other eu members too , a stance that threatened to isolate poland from the rest of europe .
in november , there was widespread relief in the eu as voters in poland threw out the conservative government led by kaczynski in favor of the pro-eu leader donald tusk and his center-right civic platform party .
the new eu reform treaty seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage .
it 's seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
" europe will be able to present a more united face in the world through a commissioner responsible for foreign policy and a permanent eu council president , " merkel said earlier this month .
" the national parliaments and thus citizens will able to influence more strongly what 's decided in europe . "
hungary became the first nation to ratify the eu treaty .
other members will have to follow by early 2009 , ahead of elections for the european parliament .
climate , russia pose challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dealing with russia - putin with portuguese premier jose socrates while the eu managed to climb out of the slump sparked by the constitutional crisis , it faced further challenges on the international level in the form of climate change and russia 's increasingly aggressive energy policy .
at an eu energy summit in march , the bloc agreed on forging a common eu energy policy to deal with global problems .
" we have to realize that we face global challenges : limited resources , climate change , dependence on imports and the need to invest in energy plants , " said andrej piebalgs , eu energy commissioner . " the eu 's answer is a common energy policy . "
the eu committed itself to reducing by 20 percent its levels of the principal greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
member states will also be required to make renewable energies such as solar and wind account for at least 20 percent of the total energy consumption across the eu by 2020 .
russia 's growing assertiveness on the world stage and outgoing president vladimir putin 's continuing clinging to power soured relations with the eu and marred regular summits between brussels and the kremlin .
the issue is now on hold until after russian elections in march 2008 .
africa , kosovo lingering problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo will be one problem the eu will carry over to the next year africa was also a priority for the eu this year .
after a seven-year break , the leaders of both continents met in lisbon for a summit - with the exception of british premier gordon brown who stayed home to protest human right violations in zimbabwe .
the eu-africa summit , however , did not achieve anything substantial .
the eu criticized governance in africa while african leaders joined forces and rejected the proffered economic cooperation .
kosovo , too , remains an unresolved problem , despite efforts by eu mediators .
not all eu states want to see independence for kosovo albanians and serbia , which has russia 's support , remains vehemently opposed to the idea of secession .
several balkan countries , with the exception of croatia , have been slow in coming around to the eu 's position on the serbian province .
it 's an issue that has raised hackles in parts of the eu .
" eu candidates have to fulfill conditions , not the european union , " said olli rehn , the eu 's enlargement commissioner .
" serbia wants to join the eu , not the other way around . "
a triumph and further responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party time - the schengen zone was expanded this month the eu managed to chalk up one triumph this month when the visa-free schengen zone was expanded to include nine additional european member states .
only new eu members romania and bulgaria remain outside the passport-free area .
though fears of criminality persist , eu leaders celebrated the event as a historic moment .
the eu will have its hands full in the coming year with a question mark still hovering over turkey 's eu membership as french president nicolas sarkozy underlines his continuing opposition to the prospect .
taking stock of the year , eu commission jose barroso said in an interview with deutsche welle that 2007 was overall a good year for the eu .
" europe should not fear the responsibilities of the 21st century , " barroso said .
" on the contrary , we 're a success story for globalization . "

come year 's end , however , the 27-nation bloc can look back on some successes , the biggest one being the deal on its roadmap for the future . the european union will be ushering in the new year with a huge sense of relief at tackling one of the biggest challenges in its history .
two years after the citizens of france and the netherlands shot down a draft constitution in separate referendums , plunging the eu into crisis , the bloc managed to get its deeply divided members to agree on a pared down version of the treaty meant to reform its institutions .
earlier in the month , eu leaders gathered in lisbon to sign the landmark treaty .
eu commissioner for communications margot wallström said that the treaty of lisbon was a wonderful birthday gift for the eu , which turned 50 this year , and that the bloc 's popularity has grown as a result .
" membership of the eu is viewed positively , " wallström said .
" there 's more trust in its institutions .
it 's encouraging for those of us who work for the eu . "
bumpy road to treaty deal the road to the treaty deal , however , was anything but smooth .
as head of the six-month rotating presidency , german chancellor angela merkel led marathon negotiations at a fractious summit of european leaders in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles for the camera but tension behind the scenes - merkel with jaroslaw kaczynski the meeting was overshadowed by fraught discussions , in particular with poland .
warsaw clashed with berlin over the issues of its voting rights and the resulting compromise agreement included controversial concessions for poland .
then polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski was frequently at odds with other eu members too , a stance that threatened to isolate poland from the rest of europe .
in november , there was widespread relief in the eu as voters in poland threw out the conservative government led by kaczynski in favor of the pro-eu leader donald tusk and his center-right civic platform party .
the new eu reform treaty seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage .
it 's seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
" europe will be able to present a more united face in the world through a commissioner responsible for foreign policy and a permanent eu council president , " merkel said earlier this month .
" the national parliaments and thus citizens will able to influence more strongly what 's decided in europe . "
hungary became the first nation to ratify the eu treaty .
other members will have to follow by early 2009 , ahead of elections for the european parliament .
climate , russia pose challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dealing with russia - putin with portuguese premier jose socrates while the eu managed to climb out of the slump sparked by the constitutional crisis , it faced further challenges on the international level in the form of climate change and russia 's increasingly aggressive energy policy .
at an eu energy summit in march , the bloc agreed on forging a common eu energy policy to deal with global problems .
" we have to realize that we face global challenges : limited resources , climate change , dependence on imports and the need to invest in energy plants , " said andrej piebalgs , eu energy commissioner . " the eu 's answer is a common energy policy . "
the eu committed itself to reducing by 20 percent its levels of the principal greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
member states will also be required to make renewable energies such as solar and wind account for at least 20 percent of the total energy consumption across the eu by 2020 .
russia 's growing assertiveness on the world stage and outgoing president vladimir putin 's continuing clinging to power soured relations with the eu and marred regular summits between brussels and the kremlin .
the issue is now on hold until after russian elections in march 2008 .

come year 's end , however , the 27-nation bloc can look back on some successes , the biggest one being the deal on its roadmap for the future . the european union will be ushering in the new year with a huge sense of relief at tackling one of the biggest challenges in its history .
two years after the citizens of france and the netherlands shot down a draft constitution in separate referendums , plunging the eu into crisis , the bloc managed to get its deeply divided members to agree on a pared down version of the treaty meant to reform its institutions .
earlier in the month , eu leaders gathered in lisbon to sign the landmark treaty .
eu commissioner for communications margot wallström said that the treaty of lisbon was a wonderful birthday gift for the eu , which turned 50 this year , and that the bloc 's popularity has grown as a result .
" membership of the eu is viewed positively , " wallström said .
" there 's more trust in its institutions .
it 's encouraging for those of us who work for the eu . "
bumpy road to treaty deal the road to the treaty deal , however , was anything but smooth .
as head of the six-month rotating presidency , german chancellor angela merkel led marathon negotiations at a fractious summit of european leaders in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles for the camera but tension behind the scenes - merkel with jaroslaw kaczynski the meeting was overshadowed by fraught discussions , in particular with poland .
warsaw clashed with berlin over the issues of its voting rights and the resulting compromise agreement included controversial concessions for poland .
then polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski was frequently at odds with other eu members too , a stance that threatened to isolate poland from the rest of europe .
in november , there was widespread relief in the eu as voters in poland threw out the conservative government led by kaczynski in favor of the pro-eu leader donald tusk and his center-right civic platform party .
the new eu reform treaty seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage .
it 's seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
" europe will be able to present a more united face in the world through a commissioner responsible for foreign policy and a permanent eu council president , " merkel said earlier this month .
" the national parliaments and thus citizens will able to influence more strongly what 's decided in europe . "
hungary became the first nation to ratify the eu treaty .
other members will have to follow by early 2009 , ahead of elections for the european parliament .
climate , russia pose challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dealing with russia - putin with portuguese premier jose socrates while the eu managed to climb out of the slump sparked by the constitutional crisis , it faced further challenges on the international level in the form of climate change and russia 's increasingly aggressive energy policy .
at an eu energy summit in march , the bloc agreed on forging a common eu energy policy to deal with global problems .
" we have to realize that we face global challenges : limited resources , climate change , dependence on imports and the need to invest in energy plants , " said andrej piebalgs , eu energy commissioner . " the eu 's answer is a common energy policy . "
the eu committed itself to reducing by 20 percent its levels of the principal greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
member states will also be required to make renewable energies such as solar and wind account for at least 20 percent of the total energy consumption across the eu by 2020 .
russia 's growing assertiveness on the world stage and outgoing president vladimir putin 's continuing clinging to power soured relations with the eu and marred regular summits between brussels and the kremlin .
the issue is now on hold until after russian elections in march 2008 .
africa , kosovo lingering problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo will be one problem the eu will carry over to the next year africa was also a priority for the eu this year .
after a seven-year break , the leaders of both continents met in lisbon for a summit - with the exception of british premier gordon brown who stayed home to protest human right violations in zimbabwe .
the eu-africa summit , however , did not achieve anything substantial .
the eu criticized governance in africa while african leaders joined forces and rejected the proffered economic cooperation .
kosovo , too , remains an unresolved problem , despite efforts by eu mediators .
not all eu states want to see independence for kosovo albanians and serbia , which has russia 's support , remains vehemently opposed to the idea of secession .
several balkan countries , with the exception of croatia , have been slow in coming around to the eu 's position on the serbian province .
it 's an issue that has raised hackles in parts of the eu .
" eu candidates have to fulfill conditions , not the european union , " said olli rehn , the eu 's enlargement commissioner .
" serbia wants to join the eu , not the other way around . "
a triumph and further responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party time - the schengen zone was expanded this month the eu managed to chalk up one triumph this month when the visa-free schengen zone was expanded to include nine additional european member states .
only new eu members romania and bulgaria remain outside the passport-free area .
though fears of criminality persist , eu leaders celebrated the event as a historic moment .
the eu will have its hands full in the coming year with a question mark still hovering over turkey 's eu membership as french president nicolas sarkozy underlines his continuing opposition to the prospect .
taking stock of the year , eu commission jose barroso said in an interview with deutsche welle that 2007 was overall a good year for the eu .
" europe should not fear the responsibilities of the 21st century , " barroso said .
" on the contrary , we 're a success story for globalization . "
" if we organize our diversity multinationally , we can show that we 're already equipped for a world in which each one has contact with the other , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

wherever and however you celebrate , we wish you a good time together with people who are close to your heart . many of us can look back on a good year : at wishes that were fulfilled and endeavors that were worth the effort .
for some of us , a look back is also marked by painful memories : the loss of people dear to us , a fateful blow or thwarted hopes .
for everyone who 's unable to celebrate christmas with a light heart , i wish you strength and confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors have a lifetime of learning to pass on this year , too , i have traveled a lot in our country , and i 'm thankful for what people have shown me .
they have told me about their worries and difficulties , but also that they feel like things have gotten better in germany .
one thing in particular moves me every time : citizens joining forces where they face common problems and setting about to find solutions together , often entirely independent of public offices and authorities .
things come into being : playgrounds , theater groups and job exchanges for the unemployed and school partnerships , for example . and , in the end , people are happy to discover : we did more than merely filling a gap .
together , we have created something meaningful that shows us how much creative energy we possess and how much actually depends on us .
we have received confirmation and we have also taken one step against loneliness .
ever more people brought together by a common aim are taking responsibility for one another , and there they find something of the foothold that every one of us needs .
that 's good news .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens want to stay involved let us imagine what would happen if the young and old in germany truly discovered what they could make possible together .
let 's see : in the past 100 years , life expectancy here has increased by 30 years .
the years gained are a great gift .
but i sometimes think we still do n't pay enough heed to them .
people who can do a lot , who have a lot of experience and energy are still pushed out of active life .
yet so many of them want to pass on something to the young . i 'm thinking of the church musician in saxony who helps children with their homework .
i 'm thinking of the retired teacher in hamburg who knows how important good manners are and teaches them to schoolchildren , regardless of where they come from .
i 'm thinking of the manager who , after the end of his professional career , helps young people start their own companies , and the craftsman who , as a pensioner , goes to africa to train apprentices . i think it 's worthwhile to build on such examples .
i want the experience and poise of older people to connect with the eagerness and curiosity of the young , and i 'm sure that where that happens , it will result in good . i would like to thank everyone who already demonstrates that on a daily basis : the many grandparents who take care of their grandchildren and the older people who look out for children in their neighborhood and speak well of them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to contemplate life we all know how important attentiveness is .
i would also like to thank the young people who are there for their elderly relatives .
at the same time , the young families have a lot to bear .
the working world has certainly become more difficult and the burden of costs and taxes is high .
but the amount of trust and help we have between generations today , and what we can still make possible , is a treasure from which everyone benefits and which each person can add to . this evening i would like to thank everyone who is doing service over the holidays .
and i would like to send thanks and a greeting from home to our soldiers , our police officers and our aid workers abroad , working for world peace .
my thoughts in this hour also go out to the families of those who have lost their lives in foreign deployments . christmas is , for both of us , two things : a time to contemplate what is really important to us and a time to gain new confidence and to go forward , freshly bolstered .

wherever and however you celebrate , we wish you a good time together with people who are close to your heart . many of us can look back on a good year : at wishes that were fulfilled and endeavors that were worth the effort .
for some of us , a look back is also marked by painful memories : the loss of people dear to us , a fateful blow or thwarted hopes .
for everyone who 's unable to celebrate christmas with a light heart , i wish you strength and confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors have a lifetime of learning to pass on this year , too , i have traveled a lot in our country , and i 'm thankful for what people have shown me .
they have told me about their worries and difficulties , but also that they feel like things have gotten better in germany .
one thing in particular moves me every time : citizens joining forces where they face common problems and setting about to find solutions together , often entirely independent of public offices and authorities .
things come into being : playgrounds , theater groups and job exchanges for the unemployed and school partnerships , for example . and , in the end , people are happy to discover : we did more than merely filling a gap .
together , we have created something meaningful that shows us how much creative energy we possess and how much actually depends on us .
we have received confirmation and we have also taken one step against loneliness .
ever more people brought together by a common aim are taking responsibility for one another , and there they find something of the foothold that every one of us needs .
that 's good news .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior citizens want to stay involved let us imagine what would happen if the young and old in germany truly discovered what they could make possible together .
let 's see : in the past 100 years , life expectancy here has increased by 30 years .
the years gained are a great gift .
but i sometimes think we still do n't pay enough heed to them .
people who can do a lot , who have a lot of experience and energy are still pushed out of active life .
yet so many of them want to pass on something to the young . i 'm thinking of the church musician in saxony who helps children with their homework .
i 'm thinking of the retired teacher in hamburg who knows how important good manners are and teaches them to schoolchildren , regardless of where they come from .
i 'm thinking of the manager who , after the end of his professional career , helps young people start their own companies , and the craftsman who , as a pensioner , goes to africa to train apprentices . i think it 's worthwhile to build on such examples .
i want the experience and poise of older people to connect with the eagerness and curiosity of the young , and i 'm sure that where that happens , it will result in good . i would like to thank everyone who already demonstrates that on a daily basis : the many grandparents who take care of their grandchildren and the older people who look out for children in their neighborhood and speak well of them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a time to contemplate life we all know how important attentiveness is .
i would also like to thank the young people who are there for their elderly relatives .
at the same time , the young families have a lot to bear .
the working world has certainly become more difficult and the burden of costs and taxes is high .
but the amount of trust and help we have between generations today , and what we can still make possible , is a treasure from which everyone benefits and which each person can add to . this evening i would like to thank everyone who is doing service over the holidays .
and i would like to send thanks and a greeting from home to our soldiers , our police officers and our aid workers abroad , working for world peace .
my thoughts in this hour also go out to the families of those who have lost their lives in foreign deployments . christmas is , for both of us , two things : a time to contemplate what is really important to us and a time to gain new confidence and to go forward , freshly bolstered .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 25.12.2007 landmark treaty deal eu 's biggest success in 2007 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu managed to rise up to some of the main challenges haunting it throughout 2007 , the eu struggled to salvage its derailed constitution .
come year 's end , however , the 27-nation bloc can look back on some successes , the biggest one being the deal on its roadmap for the future . the european union will be ushering in the new year with a huge sense of relief at tackling one of the biggest challenges in its history .
two years after the citizens of france and the netherlands shot down a draft constitution in separate referendums , plunging the eu into crisis , the bloc managed to get its deeply divided members to agree on a pared down version of the treaty meant to reform its institutions .
earlier in the month , eu leaders gathered in lisbon to sign the landmark treaty .
eu commissioner for communications margot wallström said that the treaty of lisbon was a wonderful birthday gift for the eu , which turned 50 this year , and that the bloc 's popularity has grown as a result .
" membership of the eu is viewed positively , " wallström said .
" there 's more trust in its institutions .
it 's encouraging for those of us who work for the eu . "
bumpy road to treaty deal the road to the treaty deal , however , was anything but smooth .
as head of the six-month rotating presidency , german chancellor angela merkel led marathon negotiations at a fractious summit of european leaders in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles for the camera but tension behind the scenes - merkel with jaroslaw kaczynski the meeting was overshadowed by fraught discussions , in particular with poland .
warsaw clashed with berlin over the issues of its voting rights and the resulting compromise agreement included controversial concessions for poland .
then polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski was frequently at odds with other eu members too , a stance that threatened to isolate poland from the rest of europe .
in november , there was widespread relief in the eu as voters in poland threw out the conservative government led by kaczynski in favor of the pro-eu leader donald tusk and his center-right civic platform party .
the new eu reform treaty seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage .
it 's seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
" europe will be able to present a more united face in the world through a commissioner responsible for foreign policy and a permanent eu council president , " merkel said earlier this month .
" the national parliaments and thus citizens will able to influence more strongly what 's decided in europe . "
hungary became the first nation to ratify the eu treaty .
other members will have to follow by early 2009 , ahead of elections for the european parliament .
climate , russia pose challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dealing with russia - putin with portuguese premier jose socrates while the eu managed to climb out of the slump sparked by the constitutional crisis , it faced further challenges on the international level in the form of climate change and russia 's increasingly aggressive energy policy .
at an eu energy summit in march , the bloc agreed on forging a common eu energy policy to deal with global problems .
" we have to realize that we face global challenges : limited resources , climate change , dependence on imports and the need to invest in energy plants , " said andrej piebalgs , eu energy commissioner . " the eu 's answer is a common energy policy . "
the eu committed itself to reducing by 20 percent its levels of the principal greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
member states will also be required to make renewable energies such as solar and wind account for at least 20 percent of the total energy consumption across the eu by 2020 .
russia 's growing assertiveness on the world stage and outgoing president vladimir putin 's continuing clinging to power soured relations with the eu and marred regular summits between brussels and the kremlin .
the issue is now on hold until after russian elections in march 2008 .
africa , kosovo lingering problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo will be one problem the eu will carry over to the next year africa was also a priority for the eu this year .
after a seven-year break , the leaders of both continents met in lisbon for a summit - with the exception of british premier gordon brown who stayed home to protest human right violations in zimbabwe .
the eu-africa summit , however , did not achieve anything substantial .
the eu criticized governance in africa while african leaders joined forces and rejected the proffered economic cooperation .
kosovo , too , remains an unresolved problem , despite efforts by eu mediators .
not all eu states want to see independence for kosovo albanians and serbia , which has russia 's support , remains vehemently opposed to the idea of secession .
several balkan countries , with the exception of croatia , have been slow in coming around to the eu 's position on the serbian province .
it 's an issue that has raised hackles in parts of the eu .
" eu candidates have to fulfill conditions , not the european union , " said olli rehn , the eu 's enlargement commissioner .
" serbia wants to join the eu , not the other way around . "
a triumph and further responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party time - the schengen zone was expanded this month the eu managed to chalk up one triumph this month when the visa-free schengen zone was expanded to include nine additional european member states .
only new eu members romania and bulgaria remain outside the passport-free area .
though fears of criminality persist , eu leaders celebrated the event as a historic moment .
the eu will have its hands full in the coming year with a question mark still hovering over turkey 's eu membership as french president nicolas sarkozy underlines his continuing opposition to the prospect .
taking stock of the year , eu commission jose barroso said in an interview with deutsche welle that 2007 was overall a good year for the eu .
" europe should not fear the responsibilities of the 21st century , " barroso said .
" on the contrary , we 're a success story for globalization . "
" if we organize our diversity multinationally , we can show that we 're already equipped for a world in which each one has contact with the other , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

come year 's end , however , the 27-nation bloc can look back on some successes , the biggest one being the deal on its roadmap for the future . the european union will be ushering in the new year with a huge sense of relief at tackling one of the biggest challenges in its history .
two years after the citizens of france and the netherlands shot down a draft constitution in separate referendums , plunging the eu into crisis , the bloc managed to get its deeply divided members to agree on a pared down version of the treaty meant to reform its institutions .
earlier in the month , eu leaders gathered in lisbon to sign the landmark treaty .
eu commissioner for communications margot wallström said that the treaty of lisbon was a wonderful birthday gift for the eu , which turned 50 this year , and that the bloc 's popularity has grown as a result .
" membership of the eu is viewed positively , " wallström said .
" there 's more trust in its institutions .
it 's encouraging for those of us who work for the eu . "
bumpy road to treaty deal the road to the treaty deal , however , was anything but smooth .
as head of the six-month rotating presidency , german chancellor angela merkel led marathon negotiations at a fractious summit of european leaders in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles for the camera but tension behind the scenes - merkel with jaroslaw kaczynski the meeting was overshadowed by fraught discussions , in particular with poland .
warsaw clashed with berlin over the issues of its voting rights and the resulting compromise agreement included controversial concessions for poland .
then polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski was frequently at odds with other eu members too , a stance that threatened to isolate poland from the rest of europe .
in november , there was widespread relief in the eu as voters in poland threw out the conservative government led by kaczynski in favor of the pro-eu leader donald tusk and his center-right civic platform party .
the new eu reform treaty seeks to simplify and speed up the eu 's decision-making process and give the eu more clout on the international stage .
it 's seen as the eu 's chance for reform and an opportunity to put national interests aside in favor of a more common stance .
" europe will be able to present a more united face in the world through a commissioner responsible for foreign policy and a permanent eu council president , " merkel said earlier this month .
" the national parliaments and thus citizens will able to influence more strongly what 's decided in europe . "
hungary became the first nation to ratify the eu treaty .
other members will have to follow by early 2009 , ahead of elections for the european parliament .
climate , russia pose challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dealing with russia - putin with portuguese premier jose socrates while the eu managed to climb out of the slump sparked by the constitutional crisis , it faced further challenges on the international level in the form of climate change and russia 's increasingly aggressive energy policy .
at an eu energy summit in march , the bloc agreed on forging a common eu energy policy to deal with global problems .
" we have to realize that we face global challenges : limited resources , climate change , dependence on imports and the need to invest in energy plants , " said andrej piebalgs , eu energy commissioner . " the eu 's answer is a common energy policy . "
the eu committed itself to reducing by 20 percent its levels of the principal greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , by 2020 compared with 1990 levels .
member states will also be required to make renewable energies such as solar and wind account for at least 20 percent of the total energy consumption across the eu by 2020 .
russia 's growing assertiveness on the world stage and outgoing president vladimir putin 's continuing clinging to power soured relations with the eu and marred regular summits between brussels and the kremlin .
the issue is now on hold until after russian elections in march 2008 .
africa , kosovo lingering problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo will be one problem the eu will carry over to the next year africa was also a priority for the eu this year .
after a seven-year break , the leaders of both continents met in lisbon for a summit - with the exception of british premier gordon brown who stayed home to protest human right violations in zimbabwe .
the eu-africa summit , however , did not achieve anything substantial .
the eu criticized governance in africa while african leaders joined forces and rejected the proffered economic cooperation .
kosovo , too , remains an unresolved problem , despite efforts by eu mediators .
not all eu states want to see independence for kosovo albanians and serbia , which has russia 's support , remains vehemently opposed to the idea of secession .
several balkan countries , with the exception of croatia , have been slow in coming around to the eu 's position on the serbian province .
it 's an issue that has raised hackles in parts of the eu .
" eu candidates have to fulfill conditions , not the european union , " said olli rehn , the eu 's enlargement commissioner .
" serbia wants to join the eu , not the other way around . "
a triumph and further responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party time - the schengen zone was expanded this month the eu managed to chalk up one triumph this month when the visa-free schengen zone was expanded to include nine additional european member states .
only new eu members romania and bulgaria remain outside the passport-free area .
though fears of criminality persist , eu leaders celebrated the event as a historic moment .
the eu will have its hands full in the coming year with a question mark still hovering over turkey 's eu membership as french president nicolas sarkozy underlines his continuing opposition to the prospect .
taking stock of the year , eu commission jose barroso said in an interview with deutsche welle that 2007 was overall a good year for the eu .
" europe should not fear the responsibilities of the 21st century , " barroso said .
" on the contrary , we 're a success story for globalization . "
" if we organize our diversity multinationally , we can show that we 're already equipped for a world in which each one has contact with the other , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

andrew fentem has worked on innovative human computer interfaces for some time , after beginning his career in military research and development , specifically missiles .
his work today is part-art , part hobby , part business venture .
his latest creation , the fentix cube , is generating a lot of interest from toy manufacturers and buzz on the internet , based on a few clips he put on youtube .
" because of absurd level of interest generated by youtube everyone wants the device , " he says .
" i 'm being bombarded by toy firms from korea . "
a small plastic cube with playful lights , it could be mistaken for a mass market throwaway toy manufactured by the million in the far east .
but the colourful exterior masks a combination of innovative technologies that have propelled apple 's iphone and nintendo 's wii to huge success this year .
the cube contains a large battery , an array of leds and crucially three accelerometers which can detect the pitch and yaw of the device , and sensors on the inside surface for touch control .
mr fentem says : " you instinctively know how to use it .
the way you understand the world as a young child is through physical and spatial awareness , up or down .
it 's how you learn and communicate . "
the accelerometers are essentially chips which can sense the direction of gravity ; once you know that , you can work out which way is up and down .
" it took about a month to build ; i thought it would be nice to do a cube computer after i had seen an electronic rubik 's cube , which was very poor . "
the cube has been programmed to play a handful of games , such as a pacman-inspired maze game .
but the combination of touch , light and three dimensions opens up a range of possibilities - from music games , to puzzles and even a lifestyle device .
mr fentem said he was inspired to build the cube because he was dismayed by the quality of many of today 's electronic toys .
" this was originally an artistic intervention into the gadget market .
if you really want to make something unusual , you really have to understand the physics of how things work .
" because most people do n't know much about engineering , the ideas tend to be poor . "
up until the age of 22 mr fentem worked at thorn emi on highly classified projects , and had to sit in a faraday cage , a shielded space which prevents any sort of transmission in or out .
disillusioned by the industry he moved to london and fell into the art and electronics scene .
much of his work is displayed at the kinetica gallery , the uk 's only space dedicated to electronic art .
his previous designs include multi-touch screen interfaces for musical applications , which won him an innovation award from the national endowment for science , technology and the arts .
he has also worked on touchscreen surface technology , for creating musical scores , playing games , interactive floors and artistic purposes .
he says the cube is designed partly as a calling card for investors and companies .
" i 'd like the cube to go mass market .
i 'd like to see it in people 's homes .
but if it only serves as an introduction to my work , i 'll be happy . "

andrew fentem has worked on innovative human computer interfaces for some time , after beginning his career in military research and development , specifically missiles .
his work today is part-art , part hobby , part business venture .
his latest creation , the fentix cube , is generating a lot of interest from toy manufacturers and buzz on the internet , based on a few clips he put on youtube .
" because of absurd level of interest generated by youtube everyone wants the device , " he says .
" i 'm being bombarded by toy firms from korea . "
a small plastic cube with playful lights , it could be mistaken for a mass market throwaway toy manufactured by the million in the far east .
playing the cube but the colourful exterior masks a combination of innovative technologies that have propelled apple 's iphone and nintendo 's wii to huge success this year .
the cube contains a large battery , an array of leds and crucially three accelerometers which can detect the pitch and yaw of the device , and sensors on the inside surface for touch control .
mr fentem says : " you instinctively know how to use it .
the way you understand the world as a young child is through physical and spatial awareness , up or down .
it 's how you learn and communicate . "
the accelerometers are essentially chips which can sense the direction of gravity ; once you know that , you can work out which way is up and down .
" it took about a month to build ; i thought it would be nice to do a cube computer after i had seen an electronic rubik 's cube , which was very poor . "
the cube could have a commercial spin off the cube has been programmed to play a handful of games , such as a pacman-inspired maze game .
but the combination of touch , light and three dimensions opens up a range of possibilities - from music games , to puzzles and even a lifestyle device .
mr fentem said he was inspired to build the cube because he was dismayed by the quality of many of today 's electronic toys .
" this was originally an artistic intervention into the gadget market .
if you really want to make something unusual , you really have to understand the physics of how things work .
" because most people do n't know much about engineering , the ideas tend to be poor . "
up until the age of 22 mr fentem worked at thorn emi on highly classified projects , and had to sit in a faraday cage , a shielded space which prevents any sort of transmission in or out .
disillusioned by the industry he moved to london and fell into the art and electronics scene .
much of his work is displayed at the kinetica gallery , the uk 's only space dedicated to electronic art .
his previous designs include multi-touch screen interfaces for musical applications , which won him an innovation award from the national endowment for science , technology and the arts .
he has also worked on touchscreen surface technology , for creating musical scores , playing games , interactive floors and artistic purposes .
he says the cube is designed partly as a calling card for investors and companies .
" i 'd like the cube to go mass market .
i 'd like to see it in people 's homes .
but if it only serves as an introduction to my work , i 'll be happy . "

among them were kath and paul ashforth , whose house on sheffield 's winn gardens was badly damaged by the deluge .
the estate was one of the worst-hit areas in sheffield with about 200 residents having to be evacuated .
six months on , the ashforths were determined to finish the clean-up operation in time for christmas .
but being back home has not lifted the emotional and mental strain of the flood nightmare .
' exhausted and drained ' mrs ashforth , 50 , said : " our house was a complete mess .
the entire downstairs was flooded and there was sludge everywhere .
" paul has done a lot of the work himself in the house because we were so determined to get back in for christmas .
he 's worked every hour of the day for the last couple of months .
much of sheffield was badly hit by floodwater " the intention was to get back in for christmas but to be honest we feel so exhausted and drained from the whole nightmare that it 's difficult to get the energy to celebrate .
" i 've bought presents and decorations but it wo n't feel the same this year after what we 've been through . "
many of mrs ashforth 's neighbours are not as fortunate and will spend christmas in caravans , as will many of the city 's other residents .
sheffield city council said about 170 people were expected to spend the festive period in temporary accommodation , with many families in doncaster , barnsley and rotherham also displaced from their homes .
mrs ashforth said : " we 're the only ones in a block of seven on our estate who are home .

among them were kath and paul ashforth , whose house on sheffield 's winn gardens was badly damaged by the deluge .
the estate was one of the worst-hit areas in sheffield with about 200 residents having to be evacuated .
six months on , the ashforths were determined to finish the clean-up operation in time for christmas .
but being back home has not lifted the emotional and mental strain of the flood nightmare .
' exhausted and drained ' mrs ashforth , 50 , said : " our house was a complete mess .
the entire downstairs was flooded and there was sludge everywhere .
" paul has done a lot of the work himself in the house because we were so determined to get back in for christmas .
he 's worked every hour of the day for the last couple of months .
much of sheffield was badly hit by floodwater " the intention was to get back in for christmas but to be honest we feel so exhausted and drained from the whole nightmare that it 's difficult to get the energy to celebrate .
" i 've bought presents and decorations but it wo n't feel the same this year after what we 've been through . "
many of mrs ashforth 's neighbours are not as fortunate and will spend christmas in caravans , as will many of the city 's other residents .
sheffield city council said about 170 people were expected to spend the festive period in temporary accommodation , with many families in doncaster , barnsley and rotherham also displaced from their homes .
mrs ashforth said : " we 're the only ones in a block of seven on our estate who are home .
