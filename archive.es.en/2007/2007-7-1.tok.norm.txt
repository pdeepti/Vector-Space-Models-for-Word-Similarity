for the next six months premier jose socrates , seen as a tough reformer at home , will face the challenge of his career : keeping the eu treaty process on track . germany handed over the rotating six-month eu council presidency to portugal on saturaday , july 30 . portugal 's main task will be to finalize the treaty work started by the larger , wealthier fellow eu member state .
in june , german chancellor angela merkel negotiated a revamped eu treaty after a tortuous summit which allowed the eu to preserve elements of the european constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
socrates said he wants to " keep up the momentum of the agreement reached in brussels and to approve a new treaty for the european union as quickly as possible . "
treaty trouble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal takes over from germany as long as the treaty does n't fall apart , portugal 's presidency will be seen as a success , said sebastian kurpas , an eu expert at the center for european policy studies -lrb- ceps . -rrb-
but the treaty is by no means a done deal .
the process could become political , with countries trying to wiggle their way out of already-agreed-upon issues .
" the risk is that here and there countries will disagree again , " kurpas said .
" i think it 's a challenge . "
there are signs it may be already happening .
on friday , poland 's prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski made eu officials nervous when he said he wanted to " fine tune the deal " to ensure poland gets concessions on voting rights .
socrates said he did n't think poland means to re-open debate on the issue .
" i was present at the summit and know what was agreed , " socrates said . " the mandate is very clear and precise on what has to be done .
i am sure this is only a misunderstanding . "
socrates acknowledged at a recent speech in lisbon that it 's portugal 's job to finalize the agreement , which he predicted will be " demanding , intensive and complex . "
" we must be ready for the problems that can arise and which so often become apparent as we enter the home straits of the negotiation process , " socrates said .
tough reformer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socrates sees himself as a reformer in portugal , socrates has fashioned himself as a politician who makes difficult decisions and is n't afraid to pass measures that are controversial or painful .
public opinion in portugal is split on the job socrates has done since his center-left socialist party won an absolute parliamentary majority in 2005 .
the government inherited a budget deficit that was 6.8 percent of the country 's gross domestic product , the euro zone ’ s highest .
the deficit has become " the paramount issue in portuguese politics , " said pedro magalhaes , a political scientist at the university of lisbon .
to reduce the deficit , the government has slashed spending and has launched major reforms of the public sector and of social security .
" from a country notable for a total absence of reform , we have become one of europe 's top reformers and will continue to implement daring structural reforms , " socrates said in an interview with the financial times last year .
while opinion polls show many of portuguese believe sacrifice is necessary to reduce the deficit , " two years have passed , people are waiting for results , " magalhaes said .
" they feel the consequences of this economic stagnation . "
public sector wages have largely been frozen and unemployment in portugal is high .
educational reforms have angered the powerful teachers union .
focusing on europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's chance to shine several recent controversies have also hurt the 49-year-old divorcee 's poll ratings .
he was recently accused of improperly being awarded a university degree .
he 's also been seen as using his influence to stifle opposition .
within portugal , he 's in danger of being viewed as a " democratic dictator , " magalhaes said .
" there ’ s sort of a tipping point where authoritative becomes authoritarian , " he said .
" we ’ re around that tipping point . "
yet socrates will likely get a break from domestic worries during his presidency .
the center-right opposition , the social democratic party , is very pro-european and will likely became less antagonistic and critical as socrates focuses on eu issues .
" they don ’ t want to be perceived as creating difficulties for the role this government will have in the eu in the next six months , " magalhaes said .
most countries view the eu presidency as a time to focus additional attention on their country .
" for the political leadership of the country it ’ s a great opportunity to give itself visibility on an international stage , " said eu policy expert kurpas .
bigger is n't always better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has vacation plans the portuguese presidency looks like it will be different from germany 's tenure .

while larger countries often have more control over the eu agenda , being a small nation also has advantages for the presidency , experts say .
large countries often find themselves in the awkward position of negotiating eu issues in which their country has strong national interests .
portugal will be able to act more as a neutral broker in the big issues facing europe .

the idea is to sell it at the recycling center to earn a few rupees .
inside , the air conditioning hums , converting the indian capital 's brutal summer heat of 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 f -rrb- and more into a bearable 25 degrees celsius .
a large green ' g ' hung over the entrance doors gives away the identity of the building 's occupant .
but that 's only half the story in this part of the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the famous goethe institut logo india remains the only country where the goethe institute - germany 's premier language and culture institute which has branches across the globe - is called the max müller bhavan or max müller house said stefan dreyer , head of delhi 's goethe institut .
" we have both .
max müller does n't stand against goethe , rather it all goes with goethe . "
with max müller 's blessings born in 1823 in dessau , max müller was one of the first scholars to research the indian classical language , sanskrit and is considered the father of modern indology .
he died in oxford in 1900 .
" goethe means a lot to indians today , " said dreyer .
" but of course it 's a homage to india when the institute 's name symbolizes the relationship to this country .
in this case , it 's represented by max müller . "
india of course has changed unrecognizably since max müller 's writings on the vedic culture of india .
along with china , the south asian giant is at the center of a major asian economic boom .
the country 's economy has averaged growth rates of over seven percent in the past decade .
india is home to a growing , well-educated middle class that 's thirsting for knowledge and success .
stefan dreyer said the massive economic and social changes sweeping the country are felt deeply by the goethe institute too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : difficult deutsch - students at the goethe institut library in delhi " the motivation to learn german has changed sharply over the past years , " said dreyer .
until 7 to 10 years ago , indians would choose to learn german to be able to read intellectuals such as kant , brecht , grass or goethe in the original , dreyer pointed out . " today things are totally different .
we have many young people who want to learn german because they want to use it to boost their chances of success in their professions , " dreyer said .
language as a weapon india is home to six goethe institutes or max müller bhavans .
more are planned .
the demand for german language courses is skyrocketing and the institute is having a tough time meeting it .
at the goethe institut in delhi alone , 2,200 students pass through its doors every year .
ranjan , a 34-year-old who works for an insurance company , has been learning german for the past three years - for purely pragmatic reasons .
" i thought if i combine a foreign language with my insurance skills then i would have better chances to prove myself and work for a german company here in india , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young urban indians are looking for ways to boost their career chances though he has n't landed his dream job as yet , he 's relying on the unwritten laws of the globalized world .
" it 's no new concept that jobs are moving to cheap countries , " said ranjan .
" if germany did n't do the same , it would lose a lot of business . "
the goethe institute too stands to profit from this young ambitious generation in india raring to use the german language as a weapon on the global marketplace .
kirti , a 21-year-old says that after a year and three months of learning german , she 's now abandoned her idea of becoming an english language teacher and would now like to teach german instead at the goethe institute .
" all foreign languages are important for india because india is becoming increasingly important in the world , " said kirti . " germany is a new country for india , german is a new language .
that just improves our career chances . " sandra petersmann -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for the next six months premier jose socrates , seen as a tough reformer at home , will face the challenge of his career : keeping the eu treaty process on track . germany handed over the rotating six-month eu council presidency to portugal on saturaday , july 30 . portugal 's main task will be to finalize the treaty work started by the larger , wealthier fellow eu member state .
in june , german chancellor angela merkel negotiated a revamped eu treaty after a tortuous summit which allowed the eu to preserve elements of the european constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
socrates said he wants to " keep up the momentum of the agreement reached in brussels and to approve a new treaty for the european union as quickly as possible . "
treaty trouble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal takes over from germany as long as the treaty does n't fall apart , portugal 's presidency will be seen as a success , said sebastian kurpas , an eu expert at the center for european policy studies -lrb- ceps . -rrb-
but the treaty is by no means a done deal .
the process could become political , with countries trying to wiggle their way out of already-agreed-upon issues .
" the risk is that here and there countries will disagree again , " kurpas said .
" i think it 's a challenge . "
there are signs it may be already happening .
on friday , poland 's prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski made eu officials nervous when he said he wanted to " fine tune the deal " to ensure poland gets concessions on voting rights .
socrates said he did n't think poland means to re-open debate on the issue .
" i was present at the summit and know what was agreed , " socrates said . " the mandate is very clear and precise on what has to be done .
i am sure this is only a misunderstanding . "
socrates acknowledged at a recent speech in lisbon that it 's portugal 's job to finalize the agreement , which he predicted will be " demanding , intensive and complex . "
" we must be ready for the problems that can arise and which so often become apparent as we enter the home straits of the negotiation process , " socrates said .
tough reformer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socrates sees himself as a reformer in portugal , socrates has fashioned himself as a politician who makes difficult decisions and is n't afraid to pass measures that are controversial or painful .
public opinion in portugal is split on the job socrates has done since his center-left socialist party won an absolute parliamentary majority in 2005 .
the government inherited a budget deficit that was 6.8 percent of the country 's gross domestic product , the euro zone ’ s highest .
the deficit has become " the paramount issue in portuguese politics , " said pedro magalhaes , a political scientist at the university of lisbon .
to reduce the deficit , the government has slashed spending and has launched major reforms of the public sector and of social security .
" from a country notable for a total absence of reform , we have become one of europe 's top reformers and will continue to implement daring structural reforms , " socrates said in an interview with the financial times last year .
while opinion polls show many of portuguese believe sacrifice is necessary to reduce the deficit , " two years have passed , people are waiting for results , " magalhaes said .
" they feel the consequences of this economic stagnation . "
public sector wages have largely been frozen and unemployment in portugal is high .
educational reforms have angered the powerful teachers union .

socrates said he wants to " keep up the momentum of the agreement reached in brussels and to approve a new treaty for the european union as quickly as possible . "
treaty trouble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal takes over from germany as long as the treaty does n't fall apart , portugal 's presidency will be seen as a success , said sebastian kurpas , an eu expert at the center for european policy studies -lrb- ceps . -rrb-
but the treaty is by no means a done deal .
the process could become political , with countries trying to wiggle their way out of already-agreed-upon issues .
" the risk is that here and there countries will disagree again , " kurpas said .
" i think it 's a challenge . "
there are signs it may be already happening .
on friday , poland 's prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski made eu officials nervous when he said he wanted to " fine tune the deal " to ensure poland gets concessions on voting rights .
socrates said he did n't think poland means to re-open debate on the issue .
" i was present at the summit and know what was agreed , " socrates said . " the mandate is very clear and precise on what has to be done .
i am sure this is only a misunderstanding . "
socrates acknowledged at a recent speech in lisbon that it 's portugal 's job to finalize the agreement , which he predicted will be " demanding , intensive and complex . "
" we must be ready for the problems that can arise and which so often become apparent as we enter the home straits of the negotiation process , " socrates said .
tough reformer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socrates sees himself as a reformer in portugal , socrates has fashioned himself as a politician who makes difficult decisions and is n't afraid to pass measures that are controversial or painful .
public opinion in portugal is split on the job socrates has done since his center-left socialist party won an absolute parliamentary majority in 2005 .
the government inherited a budget deficit that was 6.8 percent of the country 's gross domestic product , the euro zone ’ s highest .
the deficit has become " the paramount issue in portuguese politics , " said pedro magalhaes , a political scientist at the university of lisbon .
to reduce the deficit , the government has slashed spending and has launched major reforms of the public sector and of social security .
" from a country notable for a total absence of reform , we have become one of europe 's top reformers and will continue to implement daring structural reforms , " socrates said in an interview with the financial times last year .
while opinion polls show many of portuguese believe sacrifice is necessary to reduce the deficit , " two years have passed , people are waiting for results , " magalhaes said .
" they feel the consequences of this economic stagnation . "
public sector wages have largely been frozen and unemployment in portugal is high .
educational reforms have angered the powerful teachers union .
focusing on europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's chance to shine several recent controversies have also hurt the 49-year-old divorcee 's poll ratings .
he was recently accused of improperly being awarded a university degree .
he 's also been seen as using his influence to stifle opposition .
within portugal , he 's in danger of being viewed as a " democratic dictator , " magalhaes said .
" there ’ s sort of a tipping point where authoritative becomes authoritarian , " he said .
" we ’ re around that tipping point . "
yet socrates will likely get a break from domestic worries during his presidency .
the center-right opposition , the social democratic party , is very pro-european and will likely became less antagonistic and critical as socrates focuses on eu issues .
" they don ’ t want to be perceived as creating difficulties for the role this government will have in the eu in the next six months , " magalhaes said .
most countries view the eu presidency as a time to focus additional attention on their country .
" for the political leadership of the country it ’ s a great opportunity to give itself visibility on an international stage , " said eu policy expert kurpas .
bigger is n't always better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has vacation plans the portuguese presidency looks like it will be different from germany 's tenure .
germany designed a no-frills web site heavy on press releases and civics lessons for its eu presidency .
click over to portugal and visitors are greeted by ambient music and a kaleidoscope of flags .
while larger countries often have more control over the eu agenda , being a small nation also has advantages for the presidency , experts say .
large countries often find themselves in the awkward position of negotiating eu issues in which their country has strong national interests .
portugal will be able to act more as a neutral broker in the big issues facing europe .
" it 's a huge learning experience , " kurpas said .
" it 's intense , especially for smaller countries , this means a lot of resources are going into european issues .
i think it 's a major effort . " trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " we are dealing with a long-term threat .
it is not going to go away in the next few weeks or months , " brown said .
he added it is " clear that we are dealing , in general terms , with people who are associated with al qaeda . " britain raises security level to " critical " brown was speaking after britain raised its security level to " critical " - the highest level which means a terrorist attack is imminent - after a four-wheel-drive vehicle burst into flames after ramming into the main entrance of a terminal in glasgow airport on saturday . two men , one badly burned and in critical condition were arrested after the explosion which police described as a " terrorist incident . "
the men are of asian descent . the glasgow attack came barely 36 hours after police in central london discovered and defused two car bombs which could have killed hundreds if they had detonated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scene at glasgow airport after the car burst into flames the authorities have launched a manhunt for those responsible .
british police arrested a fifth person sunday in connection with the attacks . the arrests included a 26-year-old man and a 27-year-old woman seized on a major highway in northern england on saturday night and another man , 26 , who was detained in liverpool , in the northwest of england , on sunday . later on sunday , police said they had carried out a controlled detonation of a suspicious vehicle left in the car park of a hospital near glasgow where one of the two airport assailants was being treated for severe burns . they said they believed the car was linked to the attack on the airport , but said it was not thought to contain explosives . police in london are looking through hundreds of hours of video footage after two foiled car bomb attacks .
the area of london where the bombs were planted are some of the intensely monitored by cctv surveillance . the original car packed with petrol , gas and nails was placed in a car parked outside a nightclub in haymarket , between leicester square and piccadilly circus in the city ’ s theater district , an area normally crowded with droves of londoners and tourists . police were alerted to it after an ambulance crew , which was called to the nightclub to treat a sick man , saw smoke coming from the green metallic mercedes early friday .
bomb experts then manually disabled the device . a second car , also a mercedes and equally crammed with gas and nails , was later found to have been parked close to the first before it was towed away by traffic police in the early hours of friday for violating parking restrictions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forensic police officers near piccadilly circus police say the events in london and glasgow are linked and experts believe the attacks to bear the hallmarks of al qaeda . " i can confirm that we believe the incident at glasgow airport is linked to the events in london yesterday , " willie rae , the top police officer in the glasgow area , told reporters . " we will not be intimidated " brown told the bbc that terorism in all its forms was totally unacceptable . " irrespective of iraq , irrespective of afghanistan , irrespective of what is happening in different parts of the world , we have an international organisation trying to inflict the maximum damage on civilian life in pursuit of a terrorist cause that is totally unacceptable to most people , " brown said . " it 's obvious that we have a group of people - not just in this country , but round the world - who 're prepared at any time to inflict what they want to be maximum damage on civilians , irrespective of the religion of these people who are killed or maimed are to be , " he said . " terrorism can never be justified as an act of faith .
it is an act of evil in all circumstances . " home secretary jacqui smith said the british public would not be " intimidated or let anyone stop us getting on with our lives .

" " we are dealing with a long-term threat .
it is not going to go away in the next few weeks or months , " brown said .
he added it is " clear that we are dealing , in general terms , with people who are associated with al qaeda . " britain raises security level to " critical " brown was speaking after britain raised its security level to " critical " - the highest level which means a terrorist attack is imminent - after a four-wheel-drive vehicle burst into flames after ramming into the main entrance of a terminal in glasgow airport on saturday . two men , one badly burned and in critical condition were arrested after the explosion which police described as a " terrorist incident . "
the men are of asian descent . the glasgow attack came barely 36 hours after police in central london discovered and defused two car bombs which could have killed hundreds if they had detonated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scene at glasgow airport after the car burst into flames the authorities have launched a manhunt for those responsible .
british police arrested a fifth person sunday in connection with the attacks . the arrests included a 26-year-old man and a 27-year-old woman seized on a major highway in northern england on saturday night and another man , 26 , who was detained in liverpool , in the northwest of england , on sunday . later on sunday , police said they had carried out a controlled detonation of a suspicious vehicle left in the car park of a hospital near glasgow where one of the two airport assailants was being treated for severe burns . they said they believed the car was linked to the attack on the airport , but said it was not thought to contain explosives . police in london are looking through hundreds of hours of video footage after two foiled car bomb attacks .
the area of london where the bombs were planted are some of the intensely monitored by cctv surveillance . the original car packed with petrol , gas and nails was placed in a car parked outside a nightclub in haymarket , between leicester square and piccadilly circus in the city ’ s theater district , an area normally crowded with droves of londoners and tourists . police were alerted to it after an ambulance crew , which was called to the nightclub to treat a sick man , saw smoke coming from the green metallic mercedes early friday .
bomb experts then manually disabled the device . a second car , also a mercedes and equally crammed with gas and nails , was later found to have been parked close to the first before it was towed away by traffic police in the early hours of friday for violating parking restrictions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forensic police officers near piccadilly circus police say the events in london and glasgow are linked and experts believe the attacks to bear the hallmarks of al qaeda . " i can confirm that we believe the incident at glasgow airport is linked to the events in london yesterday , " willie rae , the top police officer in the glasgow area , told reporters . " we will not be intimidated " brown told the bbc that terorism in all its forms was totally unacceptable . " irrespective of iraq , irrespective of afghanistan , irrespective of what is happening in different parts of the world , we have an international organisation trying to inflict the maximum damage on civilian life in pursuit of a terrorist cause that is totally unacceptable to most people , " brown said . " it 's obvious that we have a group of people - not just in this country , but round the world - who 're prepared at any time to inflict what they want to be maximum damage on civilians , irrespective of the religion of these people who are killed or maimed are to be , " he said . " terrorism can never be justified as an act of faith .
it is an act of evil in all circumstances . " home secretary jacqui smith said the british public would not be " intimidated or let anyone stop us getting on with our lives .

the idea is to sell it at the recycling center to earn a few rupees .
inside , the air conditioning hums , converting the indian capital 's brutal summer heat of 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 f -rrb- and more into a bearable 25 degrees celsius .
a large green ' g ' hung over the entrance doors gives away the identity of the building 's occupant .
but that 's only half the story in this part of the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the famous goethe institut logo india remains the only country where the goethe institute - germany 's premier language and culture institute which has branches across the globe - is called the max müller bhavan or max müller house said stefan dreyer , head of delhi 's goethe institut .
" we have both .
max müller does n't stand against goethe , rather it all goes with goethe . "
with max müller 's blessings born in 1823 in dessau , max müller was one of the first scholars to research the indian classical language , sanskrit and is considered the father of modern indology .
he died in oxford in 1900 .
" goethe means a lot to indians today , " said dreyer .
" but of course it 's a homage to india when the institute 's name symbolizes the relationship to this country .
in this case , it 's represented by max müller . "
india of course has changed unrecognizably since max müller 's writings on the vedic culture of india .
along with china , the south asian giant is at the center of a major asian economic boom .
the country 's economy has averaged growth rates of over seven percent in the past decade .
india is home to a growing , well-educated middle class that 's thirsting for knowledge and success .
stefan dreyer said the massive economic and social changes sweeping the country are felt deeply by the goethe institute too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : difficult deutsch - students at the goethe institut library in delhi " the motivation to learn german has changed sharply over the past years , " said dreyer .
until 7 to 10 years ago , indians would choose to learn german to be able to read intellectuals such as kant , brecht , grass or goethe in the original , dreyer pointed out . " today things are totally different .
we have many young people who want to learn german because they want to use it to boost their chances of success in their professions , " dreyer said .
language as a weapon india is home to six goethe institutes or max müller bhavans .
more are planned .
the demand for german language courses is skyrocketing and the institute is having a tough time meeting it .
at the goethe institut in delhi alone , 2,200 students pass through its doors every year .
ranjan , a 34-year-old who works for an insurance company , has been learning german for the past three years - for purely pragmatic reasons .
" i thought if i combine a foreign language with my insurance skills then i would have better chances to prove myself and work for a german company here in india , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young urban indians are looking for ways to boost their career chances though he has n't landed his dream job as yet , he 's relying on the unwritten laws of the globalized world .
" it 's no new concept that jobs are moving to cheap countries , " said ranjan .
" if germany did n't do the same , it would lose a lot of business . "
the goethe institute too stands to profit from this young ambitious generation in india raring to use the german language as a weapon on the global marketplace .
kirti , a 21-year-old says that after a year and three months of learning german , she 's now abandoned her idea of becoming an english language teacher and would now like to teach german instead at the goethe institute .
" all foreign languages are important for india because india is becoming increasingly important in the world , " said kirti . " germany is a new country for india , german is a new language .
that just improves our career chances . " sandra petersmann -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de the german language 's role in a changing world dw-world spoke with ludwig m. eichinger , director of the institute for the german language , about the place of german in the world today .
-lrb- 24.06.2007 -rrb- conservatives declare war on unnecessary english a group of center-right politicians said german is being inundated with anglicisms that make life difficult for those without a grasp of english .
they 're calling on the government and industry to stick to " deutsch . " -lrb- 21.03.2007 -rrb- when german words travel , our zeitgeist goes oom-pah-pah why do finnish buses take coffee breaks ?
and why are the french always puzzled when they look at a skylight ?
it 's because they use words of german origin , sometimes without even realizing it .

but that 's only half the story in this part of the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the famous goethe institut logo india remains the only country where the goethe institute - germany 's premier language and culture institute which has branches across the globe - is called the max müller bhavan or max müller house said stefan dreyer , head of delhi 's goethe institut .
" we have both .
max müller does n't stand against goethe , rather it all goes with goethe . "
with max müller 's blessings born in 1823 in dessau , max müller was one of the first scholars to research the indian classical language , sanskrit and is considered the father of modern indology .
he died in oxford in 1900 .
" goethe means a lot to indians today , " said dreyer .
" but of course it 's a homage to india when the institute 's name symbolizes the relationship to this country .
in this case , it 's represented by max müller . "
india of course has changed unrecognizably since max müller 's writings on the vedic culture of india .
along with china , the south asian giant is at the center of a major asian economic boom .
the country 's economy has averaged growth rates of over seven percent in the past decade .
india is home to a growing , well-educated middle class that 's thirsting for knowledge and success .
stefan dreyer said the massive economic and social changes sweeping the country are felt deeply by the goethe institute too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : difficult deutsch - students at the goethe institut library in delhi " the motivation to learn german has changed sharply over the past years , " said dreyer .
until 7 to 10 years ago , indians would choose to learn german to be able to read intellectuals such as kant , brecht , grass or goethe in the original , dreyer pointed out . " today things are totally different .
we have many young people who want to learn german because they want to use it to boost their chances of success in their professions , " dreyer said .
language as a weapon india is home to six goethe institutes or max müller bhavans .
more are planned .
the demand for german language courses is skyrocketing and the institute is having a tough time meeting it .
at the goethe institut in delhi alone , 2,200 students pass through its doors every year .
ranjan , a 34-year-old who works for an insurance company , has been learning german for the past three years - for purely pragmatic reasons .
" i thought if i combine a foreign language with my insurance skills then i would have better chances to prove myself and work for a german company here in india , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young urban indians are looking for ways to boost their career chances though he has n't landed his dream job as yet , he 's relying on the unwritten laws of the globalized world .
" it 's no new concept that jobs are moving to cheap countries , " said ranjan .
" if germany did n't do the same , it would lose a lot of business . "
the goethe institute too stands to profit from this young ambitious generation in india raring to use the german language as a weapon on the global marketplace .
kirti , a 21-year-old says that after a year and three months of learning german , she 's now abandoned her idea of becoming an english language teacher and would now like to teach german instead at the goethe institute .
" all foreign languages are important for india because india is becoming increasingly important in the world , " said kirti . " germany is a new country for india , german is a new language .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.07.2007 socrates faces daunting task as portugal heads eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's socrates will spend the next six months in europe 's hot seat germany has handed over the eu presidency to portugal .
for the next six months premier jose socrates , seen as a tough reformer at home , will face the challenge of his career : keeping the eu treaty process on track . germany handed over the rotating six-month eu council presidency to portugal on saturaday , july 30 . portugal 's main task will be to finalize the treaty work started by the larger , wealthier fellow eu member state .
in june , german chancellor angela merkel negotiated a revamped eu treaty after a tortuous summit which allowed the eu to preserve elements of the european constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
socrates said he wants to " keep up the momentum of the agreement reached in brussels and to approve a new treaty for the european union as quickly as possible . "
treaty trouble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal takes over from germany as long as the treaty does n't fall apart , portugal 's presidency will be seen as a success , said sebastian kurpas , an eu expert at the center for european policy studies -lrb- ceps . -rrb-
but the treaty is by no means a done deal .
the process could become political , with countries trying to wiggle their way out of already-agreed-upon issues .
" the risk is that here and there countries will disagree again , " kurpas said .
" i think it 's a challenge . "
there are signs it may be already happening .
on friday , poland 's prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski made eu officials nervous when he said he wanted to " fine tune the deal " to ensure poland gets concessions on voting rights .
socrates said he did n't think poland means to re-open debate on the issue .
" i was present at the summit and know what was agreed , " socrates said . " the mandate is very clear and precise on what has to be done .
i am sure this is only a misunderstanding . "
socrates acknowledged at a recent speech in lisbon that it 's portugal 's job to finalize the agreement , which he predicted will be " demanding , intensive and complex . "
" we must be ready for the problems that can arise and which so often become apparent as we enter the home straits of the negotiation process , " socrates said .
tough reformer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socrates sees himself as a reformer in portugal , socrates has fashioned himself as a politician who makes difficult decisions and is n't afraid to pass measures that are controversial or painful .
public opinion in portugal is split on the job socrates has done since his center-left socialist party won an absolute parliamentary majority in 2005 .
the government inherited a budget deficit that was 6.8 percent of the country 's gross domestic product , the euro zone ’ s highest .
the deficit has become " the paramount issue in portuguese politics , " said pedro magalhaes , a political scientist at the university of lisbon .
to reduce the deficit , the government has slashed spending and has launched major reforms of the public sector and of social security .
" from a country notable for a total absence of reform , we have become one of europe 's top reformers and will continue to implement daring structural reforms , " socrates said in an interview with the financial times last year .
while opinion polls show many of portuguese believe sacrifice is necessary to reduce the deficit , " two years have passed , people are waiting for results , " magalhaes said .
" they feel the consequences of this economic stagnation . "
public sector wages have largely been frozen and unemployment in portugal is high .
educational reforms have angered the powerful teachers union .
focusing on europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's chance to shine several recent controversies have also hurt the 49-year-old divorcee 's poll ratings .
he was recently accused of improperly being awarded a university degree .
he 's also been seen as using his influence to stifle opposition .
within portugal , he 's in danger of being viewed as a " democratic dictator , " magalhaes said .
" there ’ s sort of a tipping point where authoritative becomes authoritarian , " he said .
" we ’ re around that tipping point . "
yet socrates will likely get a break from domestic worries during his presidency .
the center-right opposition , the social democratic party , is very pro-european and will likely became less antagonistic and critical as socrates focuses on eu issues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.07.2007 socrates faces daunting task as portugal heads eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's socrates will spend the next six months in europe 's hot seat germany has handed over the eu presidency to portugal .
for the next six months premier jose socrates , seen as a tough reformer at home , will face the challenge of his career : keeping the eu treaty process on track . germany handed over the rotating six-month eu council presidency to portugal on saturaday , july 30 . portugal 's main task will be to finalize the treaty work started by the larger , wealthier fellow eu member state .
in june , german chancellor angela merkel negotiated a revamped eu treaty after a tortuous summit which allowed the eu to preserve elements of the european constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
socrates said he wants to " keep up the momentum of the agreement reached in brussels and to approve a new treaty for the european union as quickly as possible . "
treaty trouble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal takes over from germany as long as the treaty does n't fall apart , portugal 's presidency will be seen as a success , said sebastian kurpas , an eu expert at the center for european policy studies -lrb- ceps . -rrb-
but the treaty is by no means a done deal .
the process could become political , with countries trying to wiggle their way out of already-agreed-upon issues .
" the risk is that here and there countries will disagree again , " kurpas said .
" i think it 's a challenge . "
there are signs it may be already happening .
on friday , poland 's prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski made eu officials nervous when he said he wanted to " fine tune the deal " to ensure poland gets concessions on voting rights .
socrates said he did n't think poland means to re-open debate on the issue .
" i was present at the summit and know what was agreed , " socrates said . " the mandate is very clear and precise on what has to be done .
i am sure this is only a misunderstanding . "
socrates acknowledged at a recent speech in lisbon that it 's portugal 's job to finalize the agreement , which he predicted will be " demanding , intensive and complex . "
" we must be ready for the problems that can arise and which so often become apparent as we enter the home straits of the negotiation process , " socrates said .
tough reformer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socrates sees himself as a reformer in portugal , socrates has fashioned himself as a politician who makes difficult decisions and is n't afraid to pass measures that are controversial or painful .
public opinion in portugal is split on the job socrates has done since his center-left socialist party won an absolute parliamentary majority in 2005 .
the government inherited a budget deficit that was 6.8 percent of the country 's gross domestic product , the euro zone ’ s highest .
the deficit has become " the paramount issue in portuguese politics , " said pedro magalhaes , a political scientist at the university of lisbon .
to reduce the deficit , the government has slashed spending and has launched major reforms of the public sector and of social security .
" from a country notable for a total absence of reform , we have become one of europe 's top reformers and will continue to implement daring structural reforms , " socrates said in an interview with the financial times last year .
while opinion polls show many of portuguese believe sacrifice is necessary to reduce the deficit , " two years have passed , people are waiting for results , " magalhaes said .
" they feel the consequences of this economic stagnation . "

the idea is to sell it at the recycling center to earn a few rupees .
inside , the air conditioning hums , converting the indian capital 's brutal summer heat of 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 f -rrb- and more into a bearable 25 degrees celsius .
a large green ' g ' hung over the entrance doors gives away the identity of the building 's occupant .
but that 's only half the story in this part of the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the famous goethe institut logo india remains the only country where the goethe institute - germany 's premier language and culture institute which has branches across the globe - is called the max müller bhavan or max müller house said stefan dreyer , head of delhi 's goethe institut .
" we have both .
max müller does n't stand against goethe , rather it all goes with goethe . "
with max müller 's blessings born in 1823 in dessau , max müller was one of the first scholars to research the indian classical language , sanskrit and is considered the father of modern indology .
he died in oxford in 1900 .
" goethe means a lot to indians today , " said dreyer .
" but of course it 's a homage to india when the institute 's name symbolizes the relationship to this country .
in this case , it 's represented by max müller . "
india of course has changed unrecognizably since max müller 's writings on the vedic culture of india .
along with china , the south asian giant is at the center of a major asian economic boom .
the country 's economy has averaged growth rates of over seven percent in the past decade .
india is home to a growing , well-educated middle class that 's thirsting for knowledge and success .
stefan dreyer said the massive economic and social changes sweeping the country are felt deeply by the goethe institute too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : difficult deutsch - students at the goethe institut library in delhi " the motivation to learn german has changed sharply over the past years , " said dreyer .
until 7 to 10 years ago , indians would choose to learn german to be able to read intellectuals such as kant , brecht , grass or goethe in the original , dreyer pointed out . " today things are totally different .
we have many young people who want to learn german because they want to use it to boost their chances of success in their professions , " dreyer said .
language as a weapon india is home to six goethe institutes or max müller bhavans .
more are planned .
the demand for german language courses is skyrocketing and the institute is having a tough time meeting it .
at the goethe institut in delhi alone , 2,200 students pass through its doors every year .
ranjan , a 34-year-old who works for an insurance company , has been learning german for the past three years - for purely pragmatic reasons .
" i thought if i combine a foreign language with my insurance skills then i would have better chances to prove myself and work for a german company here in india , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young urban indians are looking for ways to boost their career chances though he has n't landed his dream job as yet , he 's relying on the unwritten laws of the globalized world .
" it 's no new concept that jobs are moving to cheap countries , " said ranjan .
" if germany did n't do the same , it would lose a lot of business . "
the goethe institute too stands to profit from this young ambitious generation in india raring to use the german language as a weapon on the global marketplace .
kirti , a 21-year-old says that after a year and three months of learning german , she 's now abandoned her idea of becoming an english language teacher and would now like to teach german instead at the goethe institute .
" all foreign languages are important for india because india is becoming increasingly important in the world , " said kirti . " germany is a new country for india , german is a new language .
that just improves our career chances . " sandra petersmann -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for the next six months premier jose socrates , seen as a tough reformer at home , will face the challenge of his career : keeping the eu treaty process on track . germany handed over the rotating six-month eu council presidency to portugal on saturaday , july 30 . portugal 's main task will be to finalize the treaty work started by the larger , wealthier fellow eu member state .
in june , german chancellor angela merkel negotiated a revamped eu treaty after a tortuous summit which allowed the eu to preserve elements of the european constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
socrates said he wants to " keep up the momentum of the agreement reached in brussels and to approve a new treaty for the european union as quickly as possible . "
treaty trouble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal takes over from germany as long as the treaty does n't fall apart , portugal 's presidency will be seen as a success , said sebastian kurpas , an eu expert at the center for european policy studies -lrb- ceps . -rrb-
but the treaty is by no means a done deal .
the process could become political , with countries trying to wiggle their way out of already-agreed-upon issues .
" the risk is that here and there countries will disagree again , " kurpas said .
" i think it 's a challenge . "
there are signs it may be already happening .
on friday , poland 's prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski made eu officials nervous when he said he wanted to " fine tune the deal " to ensure poland gets concessions on voting rights .
socrates said he did n't think poland means to re-open debate on the issue .
" i was present at the summit and know what was agreed , " socrates said . " the mandate is very clear and precise on what has to be done .
i am sure this is only a misunderstanding . "
socrates acknowledged at a recent speech in lisbon that it 's portugal 's job to finalize the agreement , which he predicted will be " demanding , intensive and complex . "
" we must be ready for the problems that can arise and which so often become apparent as we enter the home straits of the negotiation process , " socrates said .
tough reformer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socrates sees himself as a reformer in portugal , socrates has fashioned himself as a politician who makes difficult decisions and is n't afraid to pass measures that are controversial or painful .
public opinion in portugal is split on the job socrates has done since his center-left socialist party won an absolute parliamentary majority in 2005 .
the government inherited a budget deficit that was 6.8 percent of the country 's gross domestic product , the euro zone ’ s highest .
the deficit has become " the paramount issue in portuguese politics , " said pedro magalhaes , a political scientist at the university of lisbon .
to reduce the deficit , the government has slashed spending and has launched major reforms of the public sector and of social security .
" from a country notable for a total absence of reform , we have become one of europe 's top reformers and will continue to implement daring structural reforms , " socrates said in an interview with the financial times last year .
while opinion polls show many of portuguese believe sacrifice is necessary to reduce the deficit , " two years have passed , people are waiting for results , " magalhaes said .
" they feel the consequences of this economic stagnation . "
public sector wages have largely been frozen and unemployment in portugal is high .
educational reforms have angered the powerful teachers union .
focusing on europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's chance to shine several recent controversies have also hurt the 49-year-old divorcee 's poll ratings .
he was recently accused of improperly being awarded a university degree .

within portugal , he 's in danger of being viewed as a " democratic dictator , " magalhaes said .

for the next six months premier jose socrates , seen as a tough reformer at home , will face the challenge of his career : keeping the eu treaty process on track . germany handed over the rotating six-month eu council presidency to portugal on saturaday , july 30 . portugal 's main task will be to finalize the treaty work started by the larger , wealthier fellow eu member state .
in june , german chancellor angela merkel negotiated a revamped eu treaty after a tortuous summit which allowed the eu to preserve elements of the european constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
socrates said he wants to " keep up the momentum of the agreement reached in brussels and to approve a new treaty for the european union as quickly as possible . "
treaty trouble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal takes over from germany as long as the treaty does n't fall apart , portugal 's presidency will be seen as a success , said sebastian kurpas , an eu expert at the center for european policy studies -lrb- ceps . -rrb-
but the treaty is by no means a done deal .
the process could become political , with countries trying to wiggle their way out of already-agreed-upon issues .
" the risk is that here and there countries will disagree again , " kurpas said .
" i think it 's a challenge . "
there are signs it may be already happening .
on friday , poland 's prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski made eu officials nervous when he said he wanted to " fine tune the deal " to ensure poland gets concessions on voting rights .
socrates said he did n't think poland means to re-open debate on the issue .
" i was present at the summit and know what was agreed , " socrates said . " the mandate is very clear and precise on what has to be done .
i am sure this is only a misunderstanding . "
socrates acknowledged at a recent speech in lisbon that it 's portugal 's job to finalize the agreement , which he predicted will be " demanding , intensive and complex . "
" we must be ready for the problems that can arise and which so often become apparent as we enter the home straits of the negotiation process , " socrates said .
tough reformer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socrates sees himself as a reformer in portugal , socrates has fashioned himself as a politician who makes difficult decisions and is n't afraid to pass measures that are controversial or painful .
public opinion in portugal is split on the job socrates has done since his center-left socialist party won an absolute parliamentary majority in 2005 .
the government inherited a budget deficit that was 6.8 percent of the country 's gross domestic product , the euro zone ’ s highest .
the deficit has become " the paramount issue in portuguese politics , " said pedro magalhaes , a political scientist at the university of lisbon .
to reduce the deficit , the government has slashed spending and has launched major reforms of the public sector and of social security .
" from a country notable for a total absence of reform , we have become one of europe 's top reformers and will continue to implement daring structural reforms , " socrates said in an interview with the financial times last year .
while opinion polls show many of portuguese believe sacrifice is necessary to reduce the deficit , " two years have passed , people are waiting for results , " magalhaes said .
" they feel the consequences of this economic stagnation . "
public sector wages have largely been frozen and unemployment in portugal is high .
educational reforms have angered the powerful teachers union .
focusing on europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's chance to shine several recent controversies have also hurt the 49-year-old divorcee 's poll ratings .
he was recently accused of improperly being awarded a university degree .
he 's also been seen as using his influence to stifle opposition .
within portugal , he 's in danger of being viewed as a " democratic dictator , " magalhaes said .
" there ’ s sort of a tipping point where authoritative becomes authoritarian , " he said .
" we ’ re around that tipping point . "
yet socrates will likely get a break from domestic worries during his presidency .
the center-right opposition , the social democratic party , is very pro-european and will likely became less antagonistic and critical as socrates focuses on eu issues .
" they don ’ t want to be perceived as creating difficulties for the role this government will have in the eu in the next six months , " magalhaes said .
most countries view the eu presidency as a time to focus additional attention on their country .
" for the political leadership of the country it ’ s a great opportunity to give itself visibility on an international stage , " said eu policy expert kurpas .
bigger is n't always better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has vacation plans the portuguese presidency looks like it will be different from germany 's tenure .
germany designed a no-frills web site heavy on press releases and civics lessons for its eu presidency .
click over to portugal and visitors are greeted by ambient music and a kaleidoscope of flags .
while larger countries often have more control over the eu agenda , being a small nation also has advantages for the presidency , experts say .
large countries often find themselves in the awkward position of negotiating eu issues in which their country has strong national interests .
portugal will be able to act more as a neutral broker in the big issues facing europe .
" it 's a huge learning experience , " kurpas said .
" it 's intense , especially for smaller countries , this means a lot of resources are going into european issues .
i think it 's a major effort . " trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for the next six months premier jose socrates , seen as a tough reformer at home , will face the challenge of his career : keeping the eu treaty process on track . germany handed over the rotating six-month eu council presidency to portugal on saturaday , july 30 . portugal 's main task will be to finalize the treaty work started by the larger , wealthier fellow eu member state .
in june , german chancellor angela merkel negotiated a revamped eu treaty after a tortuous summit which allowed the eu to preserve elements of the european constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
socrates said he wants to " keep up the momentum of the agreement reached in brussels and to approve a new treaty for the european union as quickly as possible . "
treaty trouble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal takes over from germany as long as the treaty does n't fall apart , portugal 's presidency will be seen as a success , said sebastian kurpas , an eu expert at the center for european policy studies -lrb- ceps . -rrb-
but the treaty is by no means a done deal .
the process could become political , with countries trying to wiggle their way out of already-agreed-upon issues .
" the risk is that here and there countries will disagree again , " kurpas said .
" i think it 's a challenge . "
there are signs it may be already happening .
on friday , poland 's prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski made eu officials nervous when he said he wanted to " fine tune the deal " to ensure poland gets concessions on voting rights .
socrates said he did n't think poland means to re-open debate on the issue .
" i was present at the summit and know what was agreed , " socrates said . " the mandate is very clear and precise on what has to be done .
i am sure this is only a misunderstanding . "
socrates acknowledged at a recent speech in lisbon that it 's portugal 's job to finalize the agreement , which he predicted will be " demanding , intensive and complex . "
" we must be ready for the problems that can arise and which so often become apparent as we enter the home straits of the negotiation process , " socrates said .
tough reformer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socrates sees himself as a reformer in portugal , socrates has fashioned himself as a politician who makes difficult decisions and is n't afraid to pass measures that are controversial or painful .
public opinion in portugal is split on the job socrates has done since his center-left socialist party won an absolute parliamentary majority in 2005 .
the government inherited a budget deficit that was 6.8 percent of the country 's gross domestic product , the euro zone ’ s highest .
the deficit has become " the paramount issue in portuguese politics , " said pedro magalhaes , a political scientist at the university of lisbon .
to reduce the deficit , the government has slashed spending and has launched major reforms of the public sector and of social security .
" from a country notable for a total absence of reform , we have become one of europe 's top reformers and will continue to implement daring structural reforms , " socrates said in an interview with the financial times last year .
while opinion polls show many of portuguese believe sacrifice is necessary to reduce the deficit , " two years have passed , people are waiting for results , " magalhaes said .
" they feel the consequences of this economic stagnation . "
public sector wages have largely been frozen and unemployment in portugal is high .
educational reforms have angered the powerful teachers union .
focusing on europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's chance to shine several recent controversies have also hurt the 49-year-old divorcee 's poll ratings .
he was recently accused of improperly being awarded a university degree .
he 's also been seen as using his influence to stifle opposition .
within portugal , he 's in danger of being viewed as a " democratic dictator , " magalhaes said .
" there ’ s sort of a tipping point where authoritative becomes authoritarian , " he said .
" we ’ re around that tipping point . "
yet socrates will likely get a break from domestic worries during his presidency .
the center-right opposition , the social democratic party , is very pro-european and will likely became less antagonistic and critical as socrates focuses on eu issues .
" they don ’ t want to be perceived as creating difficulties for the role this government will have in the eu in the next six months , " magalhaes said .
most countries view the eu presidency as a time to focus additional attention on their country .
" for the political leadership of the country it ’ s a great opportunity to give itself visibility on an international stage , " said eu policy expert kurpas .
bigger is n't always better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has vacation plans the portuguese presidency looks like it will be different from germany 's tenure .
germany designed a no-frills web site heavy on press releases and civics lessons for its eu presidency .

while larger countries often have more control over the eu agenda , being a small nation also has advantages for the presidency , experts say .
large countries often find themselves in the awkward position of negotiating eu issues in which their country has strong national interests .
portugal will be able to act more as a neutral broker in the big issues facing europe .
" it 's a huge learning experience , " kurpas said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.07.2007 socrates faces daunting task as portugal heads eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's socrates will spend the next six months in europe 's hot seat germany has handed over the eu presidency to portugal .
for the next six months premier jose socrates , seen as a tough reformer at home , will face the challenge of his career : keeping the eu treaty process on track . germany handed over the rotating six-month eu council presidency to portugal on saturaday , july 30 . portugal 's main task will be to finalize the treaty work started by the larger , wealthier fellow eu member state .
in june , german chancellor angela merkel negotiated a revamped eu treaty after a tortuous summit which allowed the eu to preserve elements of the european constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
socrates said he wants to " keep up the momentum of the agreement reached in brussels and to approve a new treaty for the european union as quickly as possible . "
treaty trouble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal takes over from germany as long as the treaty does n't fall apart , portugal 's presidency will be seen as a success , said sebastian kurpas , an eu expert at the center for european policy studies -lrb- ceps . -rrb-
but the treaty is by no means a done deal .
the process could become political , with countries trying to wiggle their way out of already-agreed-upon issues .
" the risk is that here and there countries will disagree again , " kurpas said .
" i think it 's a challenge . "
there are signs it may be already happening .
on friday , poland 's prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski made eu officials nervous when he said he wanted to " fine tune the deal " to ensure poland gets concessions on voting rights .
socrates said he did n't think poland means to re-open debate on the issue .
" i was present at the summit and know what was agreed , " socrates said . " the mandate is very clear and precise on what has to be done .
i am sure this is only a misunderstanding . "
socrates acknowledged at a recent speech in lisbon that it 's portugal 's job to finalize the agreement , which he predicted will be " demanding , intensive and complex . "
" we must be ready for the problems that can arise and which so often become apparent as we enter the home straits of the negotiation process , " socrates said .
tough reformer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socrates sees himself as a reformer in portugal , socrates has fashioned himself as a politician who makes difficult decisions and is n't afraid to pass measures that are controversial or painful .
public opinion in portugal is split on the job socrates has done since his center-left socialist party won an absolute parliamentary majority in 2005 .
the government inherited a budget deficit that was 6.8 percent of the country 's gross domestic product , the euro zone ’ s highest .
the deficit has become " the paramount issue in portuguese politics , " said pedro magalhaes , a political scientist at the university of lisbon .
to reduce the deficit , the government has slashed spending and has launched major reforms of the public sector and of social security .
" from a country notable for a total absence of reform , we have become one of europe 's top reformers and will continue to implement daring structural reforms , " socrates said in an interview with the financial times last year .
while opinion polls show many of portuguese believe sacrifice is necessary to reduce the deficit , " two years have passed , people are waiting for results , " magalhaes said .
" they feel the consequences of this economic stagnation . "
public sector wages have largely been frozen and unemployment in portugal is high .
educational reforms have angered the powerful teachers union .
focusing on europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's chance to shine several recent controversies have also hurt the 49-year-old divorcee 's poll ratings .
he was recently accused of improperly being awarded a university degree .
he 's also been seen as using his influence to stifle opposition .
within portugal , he 's in danger of being viewed as a " democratic dictator , " magalhaes said .
" there ’ s sort of a tipping point where authoritative becomes authoritarian , " he said .
" we ’ re around that tipping point . "
yet socrates will likely get a break from domestic worries during his presidency .
the center-right opposition , the social democratic party , is very pro-european and will likely became less antagonistic and critical as socrates focuses on eu issues .
" they don ’ t want to be perceived as creating difficulties for the role this government will have in the eu in the next six months , " magalhaes said .

for the next six months premier jose socrates , seen as a tough reformer at home , will face the challenge of his career : keeping the eu treaty process on track . germany handed over the rotating six-month eu council presidency to portugal on saturaday , july 30 . portugal 's main task will be to finalize the treaty work started by the larger , wealthier fellow eu member state .
in june , german chancellor angela merkel negotiated a revamped eu treaty after a tortuous summit which allowed the eu to preserve elements of the european constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
socrates said he wants to " keep up the momentum of the agreement reached in brussels and to approve a new treaty for the european union as quickly as possible . "
treaty trouble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal takes over from germany as long as the treaty does n't fall apart , portugal 's presidency will be seen as a success , said sebastian kurpas , an eu expert at the center for european policy studies -lrb- ceps . -rrb-
but the treaty is by no means a done deal .
the process could become political , with countries trying to wiggle their way out of already-agreed-upon issues .
" the risk is that here and there countries will disagree again , " kurpas said .
" i think it 's a challenge . "
there are signs it may be already happening .
on friday , poland 's prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski made eu officials nervous when he said he wanted to " fine tune the deal " to ensure poland gets concessions on voting rights .
socrates said he did n't think poland means to re-open debate on the issue .
" i was present at the summit and know what was agreed , " socrates said . " the mandate is very clear and precise on what has to be done .
i am sure this is only a misunderstanding . "
socrates acknowledged at a recent speech in lisbon that it 's portugal 's job to finalize the agreement , which he predicted will be " demanding , intensive and complex . "
" we must be ready for the problems that can arise and which so often become apparent as we enter the home straits of the negotiation process , " socrates said .
tough reformer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socrates sees himself as a reformer in portugal , socrates has fashioned himself as a politician who makes difficult decisions and is n't afraid to pass measures that are controversial or painful .
public opinion in portugal is split on the job socrates has done since his center-left socialist party won an absolute parliamentary majority in 2005 .
the government inherited a budget deficit that was 6.8 percent of the country 's gross domestic product , the euro zone ’ s highest .
the deficit has become " the paramount issue in portuguese politics , " said pedro magalhaes , a political scientist at the university of lisbon .
to reduce the deficit , the government has slashed spending and has launched major reforms of the public sector and of social security .
" from a country notable for a total absence of reform , we have become one of europe 's top reformers and will continue to implement daring structural reforms , " socrates said in an interview with the financial times last year .
while opinion polls show many of portuguese believe sacrifice is necessary to reduce the deficit , " two years have passed , people are waiting for results , " magalhaes said .
" they feel the consequences of this economic stagnation . "
public sector wages have largely been frozen and unemployment in portugal is high .
educational reforms have angered the powerful teachers union .
focusing on europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's chance to shine several recent controversies have also hurt the 49-year-old divorcee 's poll ratings .
he was recently accused of improperly being awarded a university degree .
he 's also been seen as using his influence to stifle opposition .
within portugal , he 's in danger of being viewed as a " democratic dictator , " magalhaes said .
" there ’ s sort of a tipping point where authoritative becomes authoritarian , " he said .
" we ’ re around that tipping point . "
yet socrates will likely get a break from domestic worries during his presidency .
the center-right opposition , the social democratic party , is very pro-european and will likely became less antagonistic and critical as socrates focuses on eu issues .

the idea is to sell it at the recycling center to earn a few rupees .
inside , the air conditioning hums , converting the indian capital 's brutal summer heat of 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 f -rrb- and more into a bearable 25 degrees celsius .
a large green ' g ' hung over the entrance doors gives away the identity of the building 's occupant .
but that 's only half the story in this part of the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the famous goethe institut logo india remains the only country where the goethe institute - germany 's premier language and culture institute which has branches across the globe - is called the max müller bhavan or max müller house said stefan dreyer , head of delhi 's goethe institut .
" we have both .
max müller does n't stand against goethe , rather it all goes with goethe . "
with max müller 's blessings born in 1823 in dessau , max müller was one of the first scholars to research the indian classical language , sanskrit and is considered the father of modern indology .
he died in oxford in 1900 .
" goethe means a lot to indians today , " said dreyer .
" but of course it 's a homage to india when the institute 's name symbolizes the relationship to this country .
in this case , it 's represented by max müller . "
india of course has changed unrecognizably since max müller 's writings on the vedic culture of india .
along with china , the south asian giant is at the center of a major asian economic boom .
the country 's economy has averaged growth rates of over seven percent in the past decade .
india is home to a growing , well-educated middle class that 's thirsting for knowledge and success .
stefan dreyer said the massive economic and social changes sweeping the country are felt deeply by the goethe institute too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : difficult deutsch - students at the goethe institut library in delhi " the motivation to learn german has changed sharply over the past years , " said dreyer .
until 7 to 10 years ago , indians would choose to learn german to be able to read intellectuals such as kant , brecht , grass or goethe in the original , dreyer pointed out . " today things are totally different .
we have many young people who want to learn german because they want to use it to boost their chances of success in their professions , " dreyer said .
language as a weapon india is home to six goethe institutes or max müller bhavans .
more are planned .
the demand for german language courses is skyrocketing and the institute is having a tough time meeting it .
at the goethe institut in delhi alone , 2,200 students pass through its doors every year .
ranjan , a 34-year-old who works for an insurance company , has been learning german for the past three years - for purely pragmatic reasons .
" i thought if i combine a foreign language with my insurance skills then i would have better chances to prove myself and work for a german company here in india , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young urban indians are looking for ways to boost their career chances though he has n't landed his dream job as yet , he 's relying on the unwritten laws of the globalized world .
" it 's no new concept that jobs are moving to cheap countries , " said ranjan .
" if germany did n't do the same , it would lose a lot of business . "
the goethe institute too stands to profit from this young ambitious generation in india raring to use the german language as a weapon on the global marketplace .
kirti , a 21-year-old says that after a year and three months of learning german , she 's now abandoned her idea of becoming an english language teacher and would now like to teach german instead at the goethe institute .
" all foreign languages are important for india because india is becoming increasingly important in the world , " said kirti . " germany is a new country for india , german is a new language .
that just improves our career chances . " sandra petersmann -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tough reformer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socrates sees himself as a reformer in portugal , socrates has fashioned himself as a politician who makes difficult decisions and is n't afraid to pass measures that are controversial or painful .
public opinion in portugal is split on the job socrates has done since his center-left socialist party won an absolute parliamentary majority in 2005 .
the government inherited a budget deficit that was 6.8 percent of the country 's gross domestic product , the euro zone ’ s highest .
the deficit has become " the paramount issue in portuguese politics , " said pedro magalhaes , a political scientist at the university of lisbon .
to reduce the deficit , the government has slashed spending and has launched major reforms of the public sector and of social security .
" from a country notable for a total absence of reform , we have become one of europe 's top reformers and will continue to implement daring structural reforms , " socrates said in an interview with the financial times last year .
while opinion polls show many of portuguese believe sacrifice is necessary to reduce the deficit , " two years have passed , people are waiting for results , " magalhaes said .
" they feel the consequences of this economic stagnation . "

for the next six months premier jose socrates , seen as a tough reformer at home , will face the challenge of his career : keeping the eu treaty process on track . germany handed over the rotating six-month eu council presidency to portugal on saturaday , july 30 . portugal 's main task will be to finalize the treaty work started by the larger , wealthier fellow eu member state .
in june , german chancellor angela merkel negotiated a revamped eu treaty after a tortuous summit which allowed the eu to preserve elements of the european constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
socrates said he wants to " keep up the momentum of the agreement reached in brussels and to approve a new treaty for the european union as quickly as possible . "

for the next six months premier jose socrates , seen as a tough reformer at home , will face the challenge of his career : keeping the eu treaty process on track . germany handed over the rotating six-month eu council presidency to portugal on saturaday , july 30 . portugal 's main task will be to finalize the treaty work started by the larger , wealthier fellow eu member state .
in june , german chancellor angela merkel negotiated a revamped eu treaty after a tortuous summit which allowed the eu to preserve elements of the european constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
socrates said he wants to " keep up the momentum of the agreement reached in brussels and to approve a new treaty for the european union as quickly as possible . "
treaty trouble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal takes over from germany as long as the treaty does n't fall apart , portugal 's presidency will be seen as a success , said sebastian kurpas , an eu expert at the center for european policy studies -lrb- ceps . -rrb-
but the treaty is by no means a done deal .
the process could become political , with countries trying to wiggle their way out of already-agreed-upon issues .
" the risk is that here and there countries will disagree again , " kurpas said .
" i think it 's a challenge . "
there are signs it may be already happening .
on friday , poland 's prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski made eu officials nervous when he said he wanted to " fine tune the deal " to ensure poland gets concessions on voting rights .
socrates said he did n't think poland means to re-open debate on the issue .
" i was present at the summit and know what was agreed , " socrates said . " the mandate is very clear and precise on what has to be done .
i am sure this is only a misunderstanding . "
socrates acknowledged at a recent speech in lisbon that it 's portugal 's job to finalize the agreement , which he predicted will be " demanding , intensive and complex . "
" we must be ready for the problems that can arise and which so often become apparent as we enter the home straits of the negotiation process , " socrates said .
tough reformer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socrates sees himself as a reformer in portugal , socrates has fashioned himself as a politician who makes difficult decisions and is n't afraid to pass measures that are controversial or painful .
public opinion in portugal is split on the job socrates has done since his center-left socialist party won an absolute parliamentary majority in 2005 .
the government inherited a budget deficit that was 6.8 percent of the country 's gross domestic product , the euro zone ’ s highest .
the deficit has become " the paramount issue in portuguese politics , " said pedro magalhaes , a political scientist at the university of lisbon .
to reduce the deficit , the government has slashed spending and has launched major reforms of the public sector and of social security .
" from a country notable for a total absence of reform , we have become one of europe 's top reformers and will continue to implement daring structural reforms , " socrates said in an interview with the financial times last year .
while opinion polls show many of portuguese believe sacrifice is necessary to reduce the deficit , " two years have passed , people are waiting for results , " magalhaes said .
" they feel the consequences of this economic stagnation . "
public sector wages have largely been frozen and unemployment in portugal is high .
educational reforms have angered the powerful teachers union .
focusing on europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's chance to shine several recent controversies have also hurt the 49-year-old divorcee 's poll ratings .
he was recently accused of improperly being awarded a university degree .
he 's also been seen as using his influence to stifle opposition .
within portugal , he 's in danger of being viewed as a " democratic dictator , " magalhaes said .
" there ’ s sort of a tipping point where authoritative becomes authoritarian , " he said .
" we ’ re around that tipping point . "
yet socrates will likely get a break from domestic worries during his presidency .
the center-right opposition , the social democratic party , is very pro-european and will likely became less antagonistic and critical as socrates focuses on eu issues .
" they don ’ t want to be perceived as creating difficulties for the role this government will have in the eu in the next six months , " magalhaes said .
most countries view the eu presidency as a time to focus additional attention on their country .
" for the political leadership of the country it ’ s a great opportunity to give itself visibility on an international stage , " said eu policy expert kurpas .
bigger is n't always better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has vacation plans the portuguese presidency looks like it will be different from germany 's tenure .
germany designed a no-frills web site heavy on press releases and civics lessons for its eu presidency .
click over to portugal and visitors are greeted by ambient music and a kaleidoscope of flags .
while larger countries often have more control over the eu agenda , being a small nation also has advantages for the presidency , experts say .
large countries often find themselves in the awkward position of negotiating eu issues in which their country has strong national interests .
portugal will be able to act more as a neutral broker in the big issues facing europe .
" it 's a huge learning experience , " kurpas said .
" it 's intense , especially for smaller countries , this means a lot of resources are going into european issues .
i think it 's a major effort . " trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " we are dealing with a long-term threat .
it is not going to go away in the next few weeks or months , " brown said .
he added it is " clear that we are dealing , in general terms , with people who are associated with al qaeda . " britain raises security level to " critical " brown was speaking after britain raised its security level to " critical " - the highest level which means a terrorist attack is imminent - after a four-wheel-drive vehicle burst into flames after ramming into the main entrance of a terminal in glasgow airport on saturday . two men , one badly burned and in critical condition were arrested after the explosion which police described as a " terrorist incident . "
the men are of asian descent . the glasgow attack came barely 36 hours after police in central london discovered and defused two car bombs which could have killed hundreds if they had detonated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scene at glasgow airport after the car burst into flames the authorities have launched a manhunt for those responsible .
british police arrested a fifth person sunday in connection with the attacks . the arrests included a 26-year-old man and a 27-year-old woman seized on a major highway in northern england on saturday night and another man , 26 , who was detained in liverpool , in the northwest of england , on sunday . later on sunday , police said they had carried out a controlled detonation of a suspicious vehicle left in the car park of a hospital near glasgow where one of the two airport assailants was being treated for severe burns . they said they believed the car was linked to the attack on the airport , but said it was not thought to contain explosives . police in london are looking through hundreds of hours of video footage after two foiled car bomb attacks .
the area of london where the bombs were planted are some of the intensely monitored by cctv surveillance . the original car packed with petrol , gas and nails was placed in a car parked outside a nightclub in haymarket , between leicester square and piccadilly circus in the city ’ s theater district , an area normally crowded with droves of londoners and tourists . police were alerted to it after an ambulance crew , which was called to the nightclub to treat a sick man , saw smoke coming from the green metallic mercedes early friday .
bomb experts then manually disabled the device . a second car , also a mercedes and equally crammed with gas and nails , was later found to have been parked close to the first before it was towed away by traffic police in the early hours of friday for violating parking restrictions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forensic police officers near piccadilly circus police say the events in london and glasgow are linked and experts believe the attacks to bear the hallmarks of al qaeda . " i can confirm that we believe the incident at glasgow airport is linked to the events in london yesterday , " willie rae , the top police officer in the glasgow area , told reporters . " we will not be intimidated " brown told the bbc that terorism in all its forms was totally unacceptable . " irrespective of iraq , irrespective of afghanistan , irrespective of what is happening in different parts of the world , we have an international organisation trying to inflict the maximum damage on civilian life in pursuit of a terrorist cause that is totally unacceptable to most people , " brown said . " it 's obvious that we have a group of people - not just in this country , but round the world - who 're prepared at any time to inflict what they want to be maximum damage on civilians , irrespective of the religion of these people who are killed or maimed are to be , " he said . " terrorism can never be justified as an act of faith .
it is an act of evil in all circumstances . " home secretary jacqui smith said the british public would not be " intimidated or let anyone stop us getting on with our lives .

he added it is " clear that we are dealing , in general terms , with people who are associated with al qaeda . " britain raises security level to " critical " brown was speaking after britain raised its security level to " critical " - the highest level which means a terrorist attack is imminent - after a four-wheel-drive vehicle burst into flames after ramming into the main entrance of a terminal in glasgow airport on saturday . two men , one badly burned and in critical condition were arrested after the explosion which police described as a " terrorist incident .

" irrespective of iraq , irrespective of afghanistan , irrespective of what is happening in different parts of the world , we have an international organisation trying to inflict the maximum damage on civilian life in pursuit of a terrorist cause that is totally unacceptable to most people , " brown said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.07.2007 socrates faces daunting task as portugal heads eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's socrates will spend the next six months in europe 's hot seat germany has handed over the eu presidency to portugal .
for the next six months premier jose socrates , seen as a tough reformer at home , will face the challenge of his career : keeping the eu treaty process on track . germany handed over the rotating six-month eu council presidency to portugal on saturaday , july 30 . portugal 's main task will be to finalize the treaty work started by the larger , wealthier fellow eu member state .
in june , german chancellor angela merkel negotiated a revamped eu treaty after a tortuous summit which allowed the eu to preserve elements of the european constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
socrates said he wants to " keep up the momentum of the agreement reached in brussels and to approve a new treaty for the european union as quickly as possible . "
treaty trouble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal takes over from germany as long as the treaty does n't fall apart , portugal 's presidency will be seen as a success , said sebastian kurpas , an eu expert at the center for european policy studies -lrb- ceps . -rrb-
but the treaty is by no means a done deal .
the process could become political , with countries trying to wiggle their way out of already-agreed-upon issues .
" the risk is that here and there countries will disagree again , " kurpas said .
" i think it 's a challenge . "
there are signs it may be already happening .
on friday , poland 's prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski made eu officials nervous when he said he wanted to " fine tune the deal " to ensure poland gets concessions on voting rights .
socrates said he did n't think poland means to re-open debate on the issue .
" i was present at the summit and know what was agreed , " socrates said . " the mandate is very clear and precise on what has to be done .
i am sure this is only a misunderstanding . "
socrates acknowledged at a recent speech in lisbon that it 's portugal 's job to finalize the agreement , which he predicted will be " demanding , intensive and complex . "
" we must be ready for the problems that can arise and which so often become apparent as we enter the home straits of the negotiation process , " socrates said .
tough reformer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socrates sees himself as a reformer in portugal , socrates has fashioned himself as a politician who makes difficult decisions and is n't afraid to pass measures that are controversial or painful .
public opinion in portugal is split on the job socrates has done since his center-left socialist party won an absolute parliamentary majority in 2005 .
the government inherited a budget deficit that was 6.8 percent of the country 's gross domestic product , the euro zone ’ s highest .
the deficit has become " the paramount issue in portuguese politics , " said pedro magalhaes , a political scientist at the university of lisbon .
to reduce the deficit , the government has slashed spending and has launched major reforms of the public sector and of social security .
" from a country notable for a total absence of reform , we have become one of europe 's top reformers and will continue to implement daring structural reforms , " socrates said in an interview with the financial times last year .
while opinion polls show many of portuguese believe sacrifice is necessary to reduce the deficit , " two years have passed , people are waiting for results , " magalhaes said .
" they feel the consequences of this economic stagnation . "
public sector wages have largely been frozen and unemployment in portugal is high .
educational reforms have angered the powerful teachers union .
focusing on europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's chance to shine several recent controversies have also hurt the 49-year-old divorcee 's poll ratings .
he was recently accused of improperly being awarded a university degree .
he 's also been seen as using his influence to stifle opposition .
within portugal , he 's in danger of being viewed as a " democratic dictator , " magalhaes said .
" there ’ s sort of a tipping point where authoritative becomes authoritarian , " he said .
" we ’ re around that tipping point . "
yet socrates will likely get a break from domestic worries during his presidency .
the center-right opposition , the social democratic party , is very pro-european and will likely became less antagonistic and critical as socrates focuses on eu issues .
" they don ’ t want to be perceived as creating difficulties for the role this government will have in the eu in the next six months , " magalhaes said .
most countries view the eu presidency as a time to focus additional attention on their country .
" for the political leadership of the country it ’ s a great opportunity to give itself visibility on an international stage , " said eu policy expert kurpas .
bigger is n't always better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has vacation plans the portuguese presidency looks like it will be different from germany 's tenure .
germany designed a no-frills web site heavy on press releases and civics lessons for its eu presidency .
click over to portugal and visitors are greeted by ambient music and a kaleidoscope of flags .
while larger countries often have more control over the eu agenda , being a small nation also has advantages for the presidency , experts say .
large countries often find themselves in the awkward position of negotiating eu issues in which their country has strong national interests .
portugal will be able to act more as a neutral broker in the big issues facing europe .
" it 's a huge learning experience , " kurpas said .
" it 's intense , especially for smaller countries , this means a lot of resources are going into european issues .
i think it 's a major effort . " trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

treaty trouble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal takes over from germany as long as the treaty does n't fall apart , portugal 's presidency will be seen as a success , said sebastian kurpas , an eu expert at the center for european policy studies -lrb- ceps . -rrb-
but the treaty is by no means a done deal .
the process could become political , with countries trying to wiggle their way out of already-agreed-upon issues .
" the risk is that here and there countries will disagree again , " kurpas said .
" i think it 's a challenge . "
there are signs it may be already happening .
on friday , poland 's prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski made eu officials nervous when he said he wanted to " fine tune the deal " to ensure poland gets concessions on voting rights .
socrates said he did n't think poland means to re-open debate on the issue .
" i was present at the summit and know what was agreed , " socrates said . " the mandate is very clear and precise on what has to be done .
i am sure this is only a misunderstanding . "
socrates acknowledged at a recent speech in lisbon that it 's portugal 's job to finalize the agreement , which he predicted will be " demanding , intensive and complex . "
" we must be ready for the problems that can arise and which so often become apparent as we enter the home straits of the negotiation process , " socrates said .
tough reformer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socrates sees himself as a reformer in portugal , socrates has fashioned himself as a politician who makes difficult decisions and is n't afraid to pass measures that are controversial or painful .
public opinion in portugal is split on the job socrates has done since his center-left socialist party won an absolute parliamentary majority in 2005 .
the government inherited a budget deficit that was 6.8 percent of the country 's gross domestic product , the euro zone ’ s highest .
the deficit has become " the paramount issue in portuguese politics , " said pedro magalhaes , a political scientist at the university of lisbon .
to reduce the deficit , the government has slashed spending and has launched major reforms of the public sector and of social security .
" from a country notable for a total absence of reform , we have become one of europe 's top reformers and will continue to implement daring structural reforms , " socrates said in an interview with the financial times last year .
while opinion polls show many of portuguese believe sacrifice is necessary to reduce the deficit , " two years have passed , people are waiting for results , " magalhaes said .
" they feel the consequences of this economic stagnation . "
public sector wages have largely been frozen and unemployment in portugal is high .
educational reforms have angered the powerful teachers union .
focusing on europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's chance to shine several recent controversies have also hurt the 49-year-old divorcee 's poll ratings .
he was recently accused of improperly being awarded a university degree .
he 's also been seen as using his influence to stifle opposition .
within portugal , he 's in danger of being viewed as a " democratic dictator , " magalhaes said .
" there ’ s sort of a tipping point where authoritative becomes authoritarian , " he said .
" we ’ re around that tipping point . "
yet socrates will likely get a break from domestic worries during his presidency .
the center-right opposition , the social democratic party , is very pro-european and will likely became less antagonistic and critical as socrates focuses on eu issues .
" they don ’ t want to be perceived as creating difficulties for the role this government will have in the eu in the next six months , " magalhaes said .
most countries view the eu presidency as a time to focus additional attention on their country .
" for the political leadership of the country it ’ s a great opportunity to give itself visibility on an international stage , " said eu policy expert kurpas .
bigger is n't always better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has vacation plans the portuguese presidency looks like it will be different from germany 's tenure .

portugal will be able to act more as a neutral broker in the big issues facing europe .

for the next six months premier jose socrates , seen as a tough reformer at home , will face the challenge of his career : keeping the eu treaty process on track . germany handed over the rotating six-month eu council presidency to portugal on saturaday , july 30 . portugal 's main task will be to finalize the treaty work started by the larger , wealthier fellow eu member state .
in june , german chancellor angela merkel negotiated a revamped eu treaty after a tortuous summit which allowed the eu to preserve elements of the european constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .

" " we are dealing with a long-term threat .
it is not going to go away in the next few weeks or months , " brown said .
he added it is " clear that we are dealing , in general terms , with people who are associated with al qaeda . " britain raises security level to " critical " brown was speaking after britain raised its security level to " critical " - the highest level which means a terrorist attack is imminent - after a four-wheel-drive vehicle burst into flames after ramming into the main entrance of a terminal in glasgow airport on saturday . two men , one badly burned and in critical condition were arrested after the explosion which police described as a " terrorist incident . "
the men are of asian descent . the glasgow attack came barely 36 hours after police in central london discovered and defused two car bombs which could have killed hundreds if they had detonated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scene at glasgow airport after the car burst into flames the authorities have launched a manhunt for those responsible .
british police arrested a fifth person sunday in connection with the attacks . the arrests included a 26-year-old man and a 27-year-old woman seized on a major highway in northern england on saturday night and another man , 26 , who was detained in liverpool , in the northwest of england , on sunday . later on sunday , police said they had carried out a controlled detonation of a suspicious vehicle left in the car park of a hospital near glasgow where one of the two airport assailants was being treated for severe burns . they said they believed the car was linked to the attack on the airport , but said it was not thought to contain explosives . police in london are looking through hundreds of hours of video footage after two foiled car bomb attacks .
the area of london where the bombs were planted are some of the intensely monitored by cctv surveillance . the original car packed with petrol , gas and nails was placed in a car parked outside a nightclub in haymarket , between leicester square and piccadilly circus in the city ’ s theater district , an area normally crowded with droves of londoners and tourists . police were alerted to it after an ambulance crew , which was called to the nightclub to treat a sick man , saw smoke coming from the green metallic mercedes early friday .
bomb experts then manually disabled the device . a second car , also a mercedes and equally crammed with gas and nails , was later found to have been parked close to the first before it was towed away by traffic police in the early hours of friday for violating parking restrictions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forensic police officers near piccadilly circus police say the events in london and glasgow are linked and experts believe the attacks to bear the hallmarks of al qaeda . " i can confirm that we believe the incident at glasgow airport is linked to the events in london yesterday , " willie rae , the top police officer in the glasgow area , told reporters . " we will not be intimidated " brown told the bbc that terorism in all its forms was totally unacceptable . " irrespective of iraq , irrespective of afghanistan , irrespective of what is happening in different parts of the world , we have an international organisation trying to inflict the maximum damage on civilian life in pursuit of a terrorist cause that is totally unacceptable to most people , " brown said . " it 's obvious that we have a group of people - not just in this country , but round the world - who 're prepared at any time to inflict what they want to be maximum damage on civilians , irrespective of the religion of these people who are killed or maimed are to be , " he said . " terrorism can never be justified as an act of faith .
it is an act of evil in all circumstances . " home secretary jacqui smith said the british public would not be " intimidated or let anyone stop us getting on with our lives .

" " we are dealing with a long-term threat .
it is not going to go away in the next few weeks or months , " brown said .
he added it is " clear that we are dealing , in general terms , with people who are associated with al qaeda . " britain raises security level to " critical " brown was speaking after britain raised its security level to " critical " - the highest level which means a terrorist attack is imminent - after a four-wheel-drive vehicle burst into flames after ramming into the main entrance of a terminal in glasgow airport on saturday . two men , one badly burned and in critical condition were arrested after the explosion which police described as a " terrorist incident . "
the men are of asian descent . the glasgow attack came barely 36 hours after police in central london discovered and defused two car bombs which could have killed hundreds if they had detonated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scene at glasgow airport after the car burst into flames the authorities have launched a manhunt for those responsible .
british police arrested a fifth person sunday in connection with the attacks . the arrests included a 26-year-old man and a 27-year-old woman seized on a major highway in northern england on saturday night and another man , 26 , who was detained in liverpool , in the northwest of england , on sunday . later on sunday , police said they had carried out a controlled detonation of a suspicious vehicle left in the car park of a hospital near glasgow where one of the two airport assailants was being treated for severe burns . they said they believed the car was linked to the attack on the airport , but said it was not thought to contain explosives . police in london are looking through hundreds of hours of video footage after two foiled car bomb attacks .
the area of london where the bombs were planted are some of the intensely monitored by cctv surveillance . the original car packed with petrol , gas and nails was placed in a car parked outside a nightclub in haymarket , between leicester square and piccadilly circus in the city ’ s theater district , an area normally crowded with droves of londoners and tourists . police were alerted to it after an ambulance crew , which was called to the nightclub to treat a sick man , saw smoke coming from the green metallic mercedes early friday .
bomb experts then manually disabled the device . a second car , also a mercedes and equally crammed with gas and nails , was later found to have been parked close to the first before it was towed away by traffic police in the early hours of friday for violating parking restrictions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forensic police officers near piccadilly circus police say the events in london and glasgow are linked and experts believe the attacks to bear the hallmarks of al qaeda . " i can confirm that we believe the incident at glasgow airport is linked to the events in london yesterday , " willie rae , the top police officer in the glasgow area , told reporters . " we will not be intimidated " brown told the bbc that terorism in all its forms was totally unacceptable . " irrespective of iraq , irrespective of afghanistan , irrespective of what is happening in different parts of the world , we have an international organisation trying to inflict the maximum damage on civilian life in pursuit of a terrorist cause that is totally unacceptable to most people , " brown said . " it 's obvious that we have a group of people - not just in this country , but round the world - who 're prepared at any time to inflict what they want to be maximum damage on civilians , irrespective of the religion of these people who are killed or maimed are to be , " he said . " terrorism can never be justified as an act of faith .
it is an act of evil in all circumstances . " home secretary jacqui smith said the british public would not be " intimidated or let anyone stop us getting on with our lives . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of a bus in london after it was destroyed by a bomb in the attacks of 2005 the bomb scares come almost two years after a series of suicide attacks on london 's public transport system killed 52 people .
members of an islamist-inspired gang were jailed for life earlier this year after plotting to attack a number of high-profile british targets , including london 's ministry of sound nightclub . british muslim groups condemned the series of incidents and urged muslims to cooperate with the authorities . " we are utterly appalled by this sinister plot and commend the professionalism of the security services in aborting it , " the british muslim initiative said in a statement . britain has stepped up security at all its airports in the country and air traffic at glasgow airport was gradually returning to normal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.07.2007 socrates faces daunting task as portugal heads eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's socrates will spend the next six months in europe 's hot seat germany has handed over the eu presidency to portugal .
for the next six months premier jose socrates , seen as a tough reformer at home , will face the challenge of his career : keeping the eu treaty process on track . germany handed over the rotating six-month eu council presidency to portugal on saturaday , july 30 . portugal 's main task will be to finalize the treaty work started by the larger , wealthier fellow eu member state .
in june , german chancellor angela merkel negotiated a revamped eu treaty after a tortuous summit which allowed the eu to preserve elements of the european constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
socrates said he wants to " keep up the momentum of the agreement reached in brussels and to approve a new treaty for the european union as quickly as possible . "
treaty trouble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal takes over from germany as long as the treaty does n't fall apart , portugal 's presidency will be seen as a success , said sebastian kurpas , an eu expert at the center for european policy studies -lrb- ceps . -rrb-
but the treaty is by no means a done deal .
the process could become political , with countries trying to wiggle their way out of already-agreed-upon issues .
" the risk is that here and there countries will disagree again , " kurpas said .
" i think it 's a challenge . "
there are signs it may be already happening .
on friday , poland 's prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski made eu officials nervous when he said he wanted to " fine tune the deal " to ensure poland gets concessions on voting rights .
socrates said he did n't think poland means to re-open debate on the issue .
" i was present at the summit and know what was agreed , " socrates said . " the mandate is very clear and precise on what has to be done .
i am sure this is only a misunderstanding . "
socrates acknowledged at a recent speech in lisbon that it 's portugal 's job to finalize the agreement , which he predicted will be " demanding , intensive and complex . "
" we must be ready for the problems that can arise and which so often become apparent as we enter the home straits of the negotiation process , " socrates said .
tough reformer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socrates sees himself as a reformer in portugal , socrates has fashioned himself as a politician who makes difficult decisions and is n't afraid to pass measures that are controversial or painful .
public opinion in portugal is split on the job socrates has done since his center-left socialist party won an absolute parliamentary majority in 2005 .
the government inherited a budget deficit that was 6.8 percent of the country 's gross domestic product , the euro zone ’ s highest .
the deficit has become " the paramount issue in portuguese politics , " said pedro magalhaes , a political scientist at the university of lisbon .
to reduce the deficit , the government has slashed spending and has launched major reforms of the public sector and of social security .
" from a country notable for a total absence of reform , we have become one of europe 's top reformers and will continue to implement daring structural reforms , " socrates said in an interview with the financial times last year .
while opinion polls show many of portuguese believe sacrifice is necessary to reduce the deficit , " two years have passed , people are waiting for results , " magalhaes said .
" they feel the consequences of this economic stagnation . "
public sector wages have largely been frozen and unemployment in portugal is high .
educational reforms have angered the powerful teachers union .
focusing on europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's chance to shine several recent controversies have also hurt the 49-year-old divorcee 's poll ratings .
he was recently accused of improperly being awarded a university degree .
he 's also been seen as using his influence to stifle opposition .
within portugal , he 's in danger of being viewed as a " democratic dictator , " magalhaes said .
" there ’ s sort of a tipping point where authoritative becomes authoritarian , " he said .
" we ’ re around that tipping point . "
yet socrates will likely get a break from domestic worries during his presidency .
the center-right opposition , the social democratic party , is very pro-european and will likely became less antagonistic and critical as socrates focuses on eu issues .
" they don ’ t want to be perceived as creating difficulties for the role this government will have in the eu in the next six months , " magalhaes said .
most countries view the eu presidency as a time to focus additional attention on their country .
" for the political leadership of the country it ’ s a great opportunity to give itself visibility on an international stage , " said eu policy expert kurpas .
bigger is n't always better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has vacation plans the portuguese presidency looks like it will be different from germany 's tenure .
germany designed a no-frills web site heavy on press releases and civics lessons for its eu presidency .
click over to portugal and visitors are greeted by ambient music and a kaleidoscope of flags .
while larger countries often have more control over the eu agenda , being a small nation also has advantages for the presidency , experts say .
large countries often find themselves in the awkward position of negotiating eu issues in which their country has strong national interests .
portugal will be able to act more as a neutral broker in the big issues facing europe .
" it 's a huge learning experience , " kurpas said .
" it 's intense , especially for smaller countries , this means a lot of resources are going into european issues .
i think it 's a major effort . " trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for the next six months premier jose socrates , seen as a tough reformer at home , will face the challenge of his career : keeping the eu treaty process on track . germany handed over the rotating six-month eu council presidency to portugal on saturaday , july 30 . portugal 's main task will be to finalize the treaty work started by the larger , wealthier fellow eu member state .
in june , german chancellor angela merkel negotiated a revamped eu treaty after a tortuous summit which allowed the eu to preserve elements of the european constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
socrates said he wants to " keep up the momentum of the agreement reached in brussels and to approve a new treaty for the european union as quickly as possible . "
treaty trouble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal takes over from germany as long as the treaty does n't fall apart , portugal 's presidency will be seen as a success , said sebastian kurpas , an eu expert at the center for european policy studies -lrb- ceps . -rrb-
but the treaty is by no means a done deal .
the process could become political , with countries trying to wiggle their way out of already-agreed-upon issues .
" the risk is that here and there countries will disagree again , " kurpas said .
" i think it 's a challenge . "
there are signs it may be already happening .
on friday , poland 's prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski made eu officials nervous when he said he wanted to " fine tune the deal " to ensure poland gets concessions on voting rights .
socrates said he did n't think poland means to re-open debate on the issue .
" i was present at the summit and know what was agreed , " socrates said . " the mandate is very clear and precise on what has to be done .
i am sure this is only a misunderstanding . "
socrates acknowledged at a recent speech in lisbon that it 's portugal 's job to finalize the agreement , which he predicted will be " demanding , intensive and complex . "
" we must be ready for the problems that can arise and which so often become apparent as we enter the home straits of the negotiation process , " socrates said .
tough reformer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socrates sees himself as a reformer in portugal , socrates has fashioned himself as a politician who makes difficult decisions and is n't afraid to pass measures that are controversial or painful .
public opinion in portugal is split on the job socrates has done since his center-left socialist party won an absolute parliamentary majority in 2005 .
the government inherited a budget deficit that was 6.8 percent of the country 's gross domestic product , the euro zone ’ s highest .
the deficit has become " the paramount issue in portuguese politics , " said pedro magalhaes , a political scientist at the university of lisbon .
to reduce the deficit , the government has slashed spending and has launched major reforms of the public sector and of social security .
" from a country notable for a total absence of reform , we have become one of europe 's top reformers and will continue to implement daring structural reforms , " socrates said in an interview with the financial times last year .
while opinion polls show many of portuguese believe sacrifice is necessary to reduce the deficit , " two years have passed , people are waiting for results , " magalhaes said .
" they feel the consequences of this economic stagnation . "
public sector wages have largely been frozen and unemployment in portugal is high .
educational reforms have angered the powerful teachers union .
focusing on europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's chance to shine several recent controversies have also hurt the 49-year-old divorcee 's poll ratings .
he was recently accused of improperly being awarded a university degree .
he 's also been seen as using his influence to stifle opposition .
within portugal , he 's in danger of being viewed as a " democratic dictator , " magalhaes said .
" there ’ s sort of a tipping point where authoritative becomes authoritarian , " he said .
" we ’ re around that tipping point . "
yet socrates will likely get a break from domestic worries during his presidency .
the center-right opposition , the social democratic party , is very pro-european and will likely became less antagonistic and critical as socrates focuses on eu issues .
" they don ’ t want to be perceived as creating difficulties for the role this government will have in the eu in the next six months , " magalhaes said .
most countries view the eu presidency as a time to focus additional attention on their country .
" for the political leadership of the country it ’ s a great opportunity to give itself visibility on an international stage , " said eu policy expert kurpas .
bigger is n't always better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has vacation plans the portuguese presidency looks like it will be different from germany 's tenure .
germany designed a no-frills web site heavy on press releases and civics lessons for its eu presidency .
click over to portugal and visitors are greeted by ambient music and a kaleidoscope of flags .
while larger countries often have more control over the eu agenda , being a small nation also has advantages for the presidency , experts say .
large countries often find themselves in the awkward position of negotiating eu issues in which their country has strong national interests .
portugal will be able to act more as a neutral broker in the big issues facing europe .
" it 's a huge learning experience , " kurpas said .
" it 's intense , especially for smaller countries , this means a lot of resources are going into european issues .
i think it 's a major effort . " trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for the next six months premier jose socrates , seen as a tough reformer at home , will face the challenge of his career : keeping the eu treaty process on track . germany handed over the rotating six-month eu council presidency to portugal on saturaday , july 30 . portugal 's main task will be to finalize the treaty work started by the larger , wealthier fellow eu member state .
in june , german chancellor angela merkel negotiated a revamped eu treaty after a tortuous summit which allowed the eu to preserve elements of the european constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
socrates said he wants to " keep up the momentum of the agreement reached in brussels and to approve a new treaty for the european union as quickly as possible . "
treaty trouble bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal takes over from germany as long as the treaty does n't fall apart , portugal 's presidency will be seen as a success , said sebastian kurpas , an eu expert at the center for european policy studies -lrb- ceps . -rrb-
but the treaty is by no means a done deal .
the process could become political , with countries trying to wiggle their way out of already-agreed-upon issues .
" the risk is that here and there countries will disagree again , " kurpas said .
" i think it 's a challenge . "
there are signs it may be already happening .
on friday , poland 's prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski made eu officials nervous when he said he wanted to " fine tune the deal " to ensure poland gets concessions on voting rights .
socrates said he did n't think poland means to re-open debate on the issue .
" i was present at the summit and know what was agreed , " socrates said . " the mandate is very clear and precise on what has to be done .
i am sure this is only a misunderstanding . "
socrates acknowledged at a recent speech in lisbon that it 's portugal 's job to finalize the agreement , which he predicted will be " demanding , intensive and complex . "
" we must be ready for the problems that can arise and which so often become apparent as we enter the home straits of the negotiation process , " socrates said .
tough reformer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socrates sees himself as a reformer in portugal , socrates has fashioned himself as a politician who makes difficult decisions and is n't afraid to pass measures that are controversial or painful .
public opinion in portugal is split on the job socrates has done since his center-left socialist party won an absolute parliamentary majority in 2005 .
the government inherited a budget deficit that was 6.8 percent of the country 's gross domestic product , the euro zone ’ s highest .
the deficit has become " the paramount issue in portuguese politics , " said pedro magalhaes , a political scientist at the university of lisbon .
to reduce the deficit , the government has slashed spending and has launched major reforms of the public sector and of social security .
" from a country notable for a total absence of reform , we have become one of europe 's top reformers and will continue to implement daring structural reforms , " socrates said in an interview with the financial times last year .
while opinion polls show many of portuguese believe sacrifice is necessary to reduce the deficit , " two years have passed , people are waiting for results , " magalhaes said .
" they feel the consequences of this economic stagnation . "
public sector wages have largely been frozen and unemployment in portugal is high .
educational reforms have angered the powerful teachers union .
focusing on europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's chance to shine several recent controversies have also hurt the 49-year-old divorcee 's poll ratings .
he was recently accused of improperly being awarded a university degree .
he 's also been seen as using his influence to stifle opposition .
within portugal , he 's in danger of being viewed as a " democratic dictator , " magalhaes said .
" there ’ s sort of a tipping point where authoritative becomes authoritarian , " he said .
" we ’ re around that tipping point . "
yet socrates will likely get a break from domestic worries during his presidency .
the center-right opposition , the social democratic party , is very pro-european and will likely became less antagonistic and critical as socrates focuses on eu issues .
" they don ’ t want to be perceived as creating difficulties for the role this government will have in the eu in the next six months , " magalhaes said .
most countries view the eu presidency as a time to focus additional attention on their country .
" for the political leadership of the country it ’ s a great opportunity to give itself visibility on an international stage , " said eu policy expert kurpas .

" " we are dealing with a long-term threat .
it is not going to go away in the next few weeks or months , " brown said .
he added it is " clear that we are dealing , in general terms , with people who are associated with al qaeda . " britain raises security level to " critical " brown was speaking after britain raised its security level to " critical " - the highest level which means a terrorist attack is imminent - after a four-wheel-drive vehicle burst into flames after ramming into the main entrance of a terminal in glasgow airport on saturday . two men , one badly burned and in critical condition were arrested after the explosion which police described as a " terrorist incident .

the men are of asian descent . the glasgow attack came barely 36 hours after police in central london discovered and defused two car bombs which could have killed hundreds if they had detonated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scene at glasgow airport after the car burst into flames the authorities have launched a manhunt for those responsible .
british police arrested a fifth person sunday in connection with the attacks . the arrests included a 26-year-old man and a 27-year-old woman seized on a major highway in northern england on saturday night and another man , 26 , who was detained in liverpool , in the northwest of england , on sunday . later on sunday , police said they had carried out a controlled detonation of a suspicious vehicle left in the car park of a hospital near glasgow where one of the two airport assailants was being treated for severe burns . they said they believed the car was linked to the attack on the airport , but said it was not thought to contain explosives . police in london are looking through hundreds of hours of video footage after two foiled car bomb attacks .

bomb experts then manually disabled the device . a second car , also a mercedes and equally crammed with gas and nails , was later found to have been parked close to the first before it was towed away by traffic police in the early hours of friday for violating parking restrictions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forensic police officers near piccadilly circus police say the events in london and glasgow are linked and experts believe the attacks to bear the hallmarks of al qaeda .

" we will not be intimidated " brown told the bbc that terorism in all its forms was totally unacceptable . " irrespective of iraq , irrespective of afghanistan , irrespective of what is happening in different parts of the world , we have an international organisation trying to inflict the maximum damage on civilian life in pursuit of a terrorist cause that is totally unacceptable to most people , " brown said . " it 's obvious that we have a group of people - not just in this country , but round the world - who 're prepared at any time to inflict what they want to be maximum damage on civilians , irrespective of the religion of these people who are killed or maimed are to be , " he said .

" " we are dealing with a long-term threat .
it is not going to go away in the next few weeks or months , " brown said .
he added it is " clear that we are dealing , in general terms , with people who are associated with al qaeda . " britain raises security level to " critical " brown was speaking after britain raised its security level to " critical " - the highest level which means a terrorist attack is imminent - after a four-wheel-drive vehicle burst into flames after ramming into the main entrance of a terminal in glasgow airport on saturday . two men , one badly burned and in critical condition were arrested after the explosion which police described as a " terrorist incident . "
the men are of asian descent . the glasgow attack came barely 36 hours after police in central london discovered and defused two car bombs which could have killed hundreds if they had detonated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scene at glasgow airport after the car burst into flames the authorities have launched a manhunt for those responsible .
british police arrested a fifth person sunday in connection with the attacks . the arrests included a 26-year-old man and a 27-year-old woman seized on a major highway in northern england on saturday night and another man , 26 , who was detained in liverpool , in the northwest of england , on sunday . later on sunday , police said they had carried out a controlled detonation of a suspicious vehicle left in the car park of a hospital near glasgow where one of the two airport assailants was being treated for severe burns . they said they believed the car was linked to the attack on the airport , but said it was not thought to contain explosives . police in london are looking through hundreds of hours of video footage after two foiled car bomb attacks .
the area of london where the bombs were planted are some of the intensely monitored by cctv surveillance . the original car packed with petrol , gas and nails was placed in a car parked outside a nightclub in haymarket , between leicester square and piccadilly circus in the city ’ s theater district , an area normally crowded with droves of londoners and tourists . police were alerted to it after an ambulance crew , which was called to the nightclub to treat a sick man , saw smoke coming from the green metallic mercedes early friday .
bomb experts then manually disabled the device . a second car , also a mercedes and equally crammed with gas and nails , was later found to have been parked close to the first before it was towed away by traffic police in the early hours of friday for violating parking restrictions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forensic police officers near piccadilly circus police say the events in london and glasgow are linked and experts believe the attacks to bear the hallmarks of al qaeda . " i can confirm that we believe the incident at glasgow airport is linked to the events in london yesterday , " willie rae , the top police officer in the glasgow area , told reporters . " we will not be intimidated " brown told the bbc that terorism in all its forms was totally unacceptable . " irrespective of iraq , irrespective of afghanistan , irrespective of what is happening in different parts of the world , we have an international organisation trying to inflict the maximum damage on civilian life in pursuit of a terrorist cause that is totally unacceptable to most people , " brown said . " it 's obvious that we have a group of people - not just in this country , but round the world - who 're prepared at any time to inflict what they want to be maximum damage on civilians , irrespective of the religion of these people who are killed or maimed are to be , " he said . " terrorism can never be justified as an act of faith .
it is an act of evil in all circumstances . " home secretary jacqui smith said the british public would not be " intimidated or let anyone stop us getting on with our lives .

now travelers can stop there for the night voluntarily . colditz castle was the scene of numerous spectacular escape attempts by allied officers during world war two .
the place is mentioned in british history books and exciting colditz castle prison stories live on in films and television stories .
british citizen hugh bruce spent two and a half years locked up in colditz castle , which looms high above the 6,000-person saxon town of the same name .
now he shows tourists around the site .
bruce recalled two polish officers who tried to escape by sliding down ropes lowered through their cell windows .
they did n't make it far , however .
" the germans opened the windows and looked out and there they were , suspended -lrb- by the ropes -rrb- , so they ran around on the outside and shouted , ' hände hoch ! ' - ' hands up ! " ' said bruce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it must have looked much less romantic to the prisoners hearing stories like this helps visitors get a feel for the colditz myth .
they can also learn about spectacular attempts by captives to dig tunnels or build makeshift gliders under the noses of their german guards .
following the traces of history in a clever marketing move , saxony has pumped seven and a half million euros into a section of the castle to turn it into a youth hostel meant to attract visitors from all over europe and the us .
" it 's a very big experience to come here and find all this history , and follow the traces of officers who tried to escape here , " said marketing expert ulrike peter .
alan russell from britain and head of the dresden trust agrees that placing a youth hostel in colditz castle is a terrific idea .
" it 's not only the history of a prisoner of war camp but of a great renaissance castle , " said russell .
" i think that , certainly in my own country in the united kingdom , knowledge of german architecture is somewhat woeful , so it 's very good that they can have a chance to see it .

it is not going to go away in the next few weeks or months , " brown said .
he added it is " clear that we are dealing , in general terms , with people who are associated with al qaeda . " britain raises security level to " critical " brown was speaking after britain raised its security level to " critical " - the highest level which means a terrorist attack is imminent - after a four-wheel-drive vehicle burst into flames after ramming into the main entrance of a terminal in glasgow airport on saturday . two men , one badly burned and in critical condition were arrested after the explosion which police described as a " terrorist incident .

the area of london where the bombs were planted are some of the intensely monitored by cctv surveillance . the original car packed with petrol , gas and nails was placed in a car parked outside a nightclub in haymarket , between leicester square and piccadilly circus in the city ’ s theater district , an area normally crowded with droves of londoners and tourists . police were alerted to it after an ambulance crew , which was called to the nightclub to treat a sick man , saw smoke coming from the green metallic mercedes early friday .

" irrespective of iraq , irrespective of afghanistan , irrespective of what is happening in different parts of the world , we have an international organisation trying to inflict the maximum damage on civilian life in pursuit of a terrorist cause that is totally unacceptable to most people , " brown said . " it 's obvious that we have a group of people - not just in this country , but round the world - who 're prepared at any time to inflict what they want to be maximum damage on civilians , irrespective of the religion of these people who are killed or maimed are to be , " he said .

the idea is to sell it at the recycling center to earn a few rupees .
inside , the air conditioning hums , converting the indian capital 's brutal summer heat of 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 f -rrb- and more into a bearable 25 degrees celsius .
a large green ' g ' hung over the entrance doors gives away the identity of the building 's occupant .
but that 's only half the story in this part of the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the famous goethe institut logo india remains the only country where the goethe institute - germany 's premier language and culture institute which has branches across the globe - is called the max müller bhavan or max müller house said stefan dreyer , head of delhi 's goethe institut .
" we have both .
max müller does n't stand against goethe , rather it all goes with goethe . "
with max müller 's blessings born in 1823 in dessau , max müller was one of the first scholars to research the indian classical language , sanskrit and is considered the father of modern indology .
he died in oxford in 1900 .
" goethe means a lot to indians today , " said dreyer .
" but of course it 's a homage to india when the institute 's name symbolizes the relationship to this country .
in this case , it 's represented by max müller . "
india of course has changed unrecognizably since max müller 's writings on the vedic culture of india .
along with china , the south asian giant is at the center of a major asian economic boom .

" we have both .
max müller does n't stand against goethe , rather it all goes with goethe . "
with max müller 's blessings born in 1823 in dessau , max müller was one of the first scholars to research the indian classical language , sanskrit and is considered the father of modern indology .
he died in oxford in 1900 .
" goethe means a lot to indians today , " said dreyer .
" but of course it 's a homage to india when the institute 's name symbolizes the relationship to this country .
in this case , it 's represented by max müller . "
india of course has changed unrecognizably since max müller 's writings on the vedic culture of india .
along with china , the south asian giant is at the center of a major asian economic boom .
the country 's economy has averaged growth rates of over seven percent in the past decade .

strathclyde police also said the attack was being linked with the car bombs found in central london on friday .
the force 's chief constable willie rae said : " there are clearly similarities and we can confirm this is being treated as a terrorist incident . "
two men were arrested following the attack at 1515 bst on saturday .
two further arrests were made in cheshire in connection with the incident in glasgow and the car bombs found in london 's west end .
anti-terror police from the metropolitan police 's counter terrorism command assisted by officers from the west midlands counter terrorism unit made the arrests , scotland yard said .
' device removed ' mr rae earlier told a news conference in glasgow that the suspect at the city 's royal alexandra hospital was being treated for severe burns and was in a critical condition .
he said a ' suspect device ' had been found on the suspect .
" as a consequence of that , the hospital was partly evacuated until the device was removed and put into a safe area , " he said .
experts later found the item was not linked to any explosive and it was declared safe , however the hospital 's a & e remains closed . "
we believe the incident is linked to events in london yesterday " chief constable willie rae strathclyde police salmond : life ' should go on ' mr rae said the second man was being detained in police custody .
the vehicle at the airport is now considered safe , and will be subject to full forensic investigation as part of the ongoing police investigation .
it is expected to be removed later in the morning .
a detailed search is still continuing within the airport and the area will remain cordoned off until this is complete .
he said the airport had been evacuated and a number of passengers had been " stranded on the tarmac " as a result .
" it would have been unwise to evacuate them into the terminal building , " he said .
no warning the chief constable added : " we believe the incident is linked to events in london yesterday .
" there are clearly similarities and we can confirm this is being treated as a terrorist incident . "
" there was no prior intelligence to suggest that scotland was going to be the target of a terror attack , " he added .
he said the force was working alongside the metropolitan police 's counter terrorism officers .
deputy assistant commissioner peter clarke , who has responsibility for terrorism throughout the uk , was travelling to glasgow .
police forces across the country are on high alert after the national terrorism threat level was increased to critical .
one member of the public received a leg injury as a result of the attack but there were no other casualties .
flights suspended about 2,300 passengers are being coached from glasgow airport to a reception centre at the secc , where they will be reunited with friends and family .
all flights to and from the airport were suspended after the attack on saturday .
the airport reopened to incoming flights at 0737 bst when a plane from ibiza landed , and first departure is expected at 0900 bst .
anyone due to fly during sunday should confirm the status of their flight with their airline before leaving for the airport .
chief constable rae appealed to about 20 to 30 people who were outside the terminal building at the time of the attack to come forward .
he also asked the public to be extremely vigilant and urged anyone with information about the attacks to phone the police incident room on 0800 056 0944 .

analysis by nick assinder political correspondent , bbc news website mr brown 's reaction has been unlike tony blair 's after the 7 july attacks gordon brown could hardly have faced a sharper test of his leadership than the latest terrorist attacks in the uk - quite possibly timed to coincide with his succession .
the way he responds to the crisis , both in terms of policy and his personal style , will help define his premiership even before he has really got into his stride .
ex-prime minister tony blair was noted for his ability - scripted or otherwise - to chime with the public mood and his remarks on the death of princess diana and the 7 july london bombings appeared to strike precisely the right note for the time .
gordon brown is different , and that difference has been striking in his reaction to the latest attacks and the way he has tried to speak for , and to , the nation .
there have been none of the smooth sound bites we have got used to .
in their place has been the sort of solidity and weight , some will say dourness , that have always been the mark of gordon brown .
public 's view whether voters will find the change in style refreshing and reassuring or whether they will hanker after the blair style remains to be seen .
but that reaction could set in stone the public 's view of their new leader from here on in .
the prime minister , in his interview for bbc one 's sunday am , also hinted at a significant change in the policy reaction to the latest events .
his predecessor was unbending in his wish to see detention without charge extended to 90 days , despite suffering a commons defeat over it , for example .
mr brown has insisted , significantly , that this is not an issue for today and that he is seeking consensus .
and he once again insisted he was prepared to call on individuals from any political party or any walk of life to contribute their skills to his policy making , whatever views they may have expressed in the past .
' cold war ' he also notably refused to get into any debate over whether britain had become a less safe place as a direct result of the iraq war , insisting there was a global terrorist threat " irrespective " of that , or the action in afghanistan .
he placed his emphasis on winning hearts and minds and spoke of the possible need for a cold war-style propaganda campaign to pursue that battle .
that again is a significant , if small , shift in emphasis from the former prime minister 's approach .
the next few days will show just how well this change in leadership style and approach to policy-making has gone down with voters .
on other areas , mr brown delivered a pretty stinging rebuff to his predecessor 's style , stating he would be running cabinet government , not " sofa government " .
bearing in mind his reputation with some people as a " control freak " who brooks no opposition , that is one pledge that will be closely watched .
it will be the clearest possible indication of whether all his talk of change and openness , consensus and involving " all the talents " really adds up to a row of beans , or whether it will be dismissed as spin from the man who said he wanted to end spin .

analysis by nick assinder political correspondent , bbc news website mr brown 's reaction has been unlike tony blair 's after the 7 july attacks gordon brown could hardly have faced a sharper test of his leadership than the latest terrorist attacks in the uk - quite possibly timed to coincide with his succession .
the way he responds to the crisis , both in terms of policy and his personal style , will help define his premiership even before he has really got into his stride .
ex-prime minister tony blair was noted for his ability - scripted or otherwise - to chime with the public mood and his remarks on the death of princess diana and the 7 july london bombings appeared to strike precisely the right note for the time .
gordon brown is different , and that difference has been striking in his reaction to the latest attacks and the way he has tried to speak for , and to , the nation .
there have been none of the smooth sound bites we have got used to .
in their place has been the sort of solidity and weight , some will say dourness , that have always been the mark of gordon brown .
public 's view whether voters will find the change in style refreshing and reassuring or whether they will hanker after the blair style remains to be seen .
but that reaction could set in stone the public 's view of their new leader from here on in .
the prime minister , in his interview for bbc one 's sunday am , also hinted at a significant change in the policy reaction to the latest events .
his predecessor was unbending in his wish to see detention without charge extended to 90 days , despite suffering a commons defeat over it , for example .
mr brown has insisted , significantly , that this is not an issue for today and that he is seeking consensus .
and he once again insisted he was prepared to call on individuals from any political party or any walk of life to contribute their skills to his policy making , whatever views they may have expressed in the past .
' cold war ' he also notably refused to get into any debate over whether britain had become a less safe place as a direct result of the iraq war , insisting there was a global terrorist threat " irrespective " of that , or the action in afghanistan .
he placed his emphasis on winning hearts and minds and spoke of the possible need for a cold war-style propaganda campaign to pursue that battle .
that again is a significant , if small , shift in emphasis from the former prime minister 's approach .
the next few days will show just how well this change in leadership style and approach to policy-making has gone down with voters .
on other areas , mr brown delivered a pretty stinging rebuff to his predecessor 's style , stating he would be running cabinet government , not " sofa government " .
bearing in mind his reputation with some people as a " control freak " who brooks no opposition , that is one pledge that will be closely watched .
it will be the clearest possible indication of whether all his talk of change and openness , consensus and involving " all the talents " really adds up to a row of beans , or whether it will be dismissed as spin from the man who said he wanted to end spin .

analysis by nick assinder political correspondent , bbc news website mr brown 's reaction has been unlike tony blair 's after the 7 july attacks gordon brown could hardly have faced a sharper test of his leadership than the latest terrorist attacks in the uk - quite possibly timed to coincide with his succession .
the way he responds to the crisis , both in terms of policy and his personal style , will help define his premiership even before he has really got into his stride .
ex-prime minister tony blair was noted for his ability - scripted or otherwise - to chime with the public mood and his remarks on the death of princess diana and the 7 july london bombings appeared to strike precisely the right note for the time .
gordon brown is different , and that difference has been striking in his reaction to the latest attacks and the way he has tried to speak for , and to , the nation .
there have been none of the smooth sound bites we have got used to .
in their place has been the sort of solidity and weight , some will say dourness , that have always been the mark of gordon brown .
public 's view whether voters will find the change in style refreshing and reassuring or whether they will hanker after the blair style remains to be seen .
but that reaction could set in stone the public 's view of their new leader from here on in .
the prime minister , in his interview for bbc one 's sunday am , also hinted at a significant change in the policy reaction to the latest events .
his predecessor was unbending in his wish to see detention without charge extended to 90 days , despite suffering a commons defeat over it , for example .
mr brown has insisted , significantly , that this is not an issue for today and that he is seeking consensus .
and he once again insisted he was prepared to call on individuals from any political party or any walk of life to contribute their skills to his policy making , whatever views they may have expressed in the past .
' cold war ' he also notably refused to get into any debate over whether britain had become a less safe place as a direct result of the iraq war , insisting there was a global terrorist threat " irrespective " of that , or the action in afghanistan .
he placed his emphasis on winning hearts and minds and spoke of the possible need for a cold war-style propaganda campaign to pursue that battle .
that again is a significant , if small , shift in emphasis from the former prime minister 's approach .
the next few days will show just how well this change in leadership style and approach to policy-making has gone down with voters .
on other areas , mr brown delivered a pretty stinging rebuff to his predecessor 's style , stating he would be running cabinet government , not " sofa government " .
bearing in mind his reputation with some people as a " control freak " who brooks no opposition , that is one pledge that will be closely watched .
it will be the clearest possible indication of whether all his talk of change and openness , consensus and involving " all the talents " really adds up to a row of beans , or whether it will be dismissed as spin from the man who said he wanted to end spin .
