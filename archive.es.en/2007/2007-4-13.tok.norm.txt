"
asked about the us plan to install part of the anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic , jung said : " i think it is good that in nato , as with the nato-russia council , we are working together to assuage possible doubts " .
although jung has voiced support for the us scheme , it is not a view that is universally backed within the german cabinet .
but he did insist it was important for the west " to work on a partnership basis with russia " on the matter , he added .
russia should be convinced of the argument so as " to reach an agreement for the protection of populations , for european populations in particular , " he said .
protective measure ? the united states has asked the czech republic to host a radar system and poland to host interceptor rockets as part of its missile defense plans .
washington insists the anti-missile shield is intended as protection against attacks from " rogue states " such as iran .
it points out that the proposed system would be useless against russia 's vast weapons arsenal .
but russia 's president vladimir putin has said it could spark a new arms race and that it was a needless distraction from the fight against terrorism .
preventing a nuclear iran jung also told the european deputies that every possible diplomatic effort should be made " to prevent iran from equipping itself with nuclear arms " .
he added : " it is vital for world peace .
the united states , russia , europe and china must work together . "
president putin had been very clear on one point , he continued . " it is also in russia 's interests that iran does not possess atomic weapons , " jung said .
on april 19 , at nato 's brussels headquarters , the 26 nato allies - including 21 eu member states - will discuss the anti-missile system in the north atlantic council and then with russia at a nato-russia meeting .
russia still critical putin has strongly criticized the plans for the us missile defesce system .
" why is it necessary to put military infrastructure on our border ?
it 's hardly connected to today 's global threats .
what is the real threat ?
terrorism , " putin told a security conference in munich in february .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 13.04.2007 bitterly disputed german-russian gas pipeline heads for estonia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns that the pipeline may disturb world war ii weapons dumped in the sea a controversial pipeline to carry russian gas under the baltic sea to germany could run through estonian waters , an official from the consortium behind the project said on friday . the nord stream consortium " sees a possibility that the pipeline could go through estonian waters , " spokeswoman neel stroebaek told reporters .
" two days ago we asked the estonian authorities for a permit to measure the depth of the sea in estonian waters , " she added , according to baltic news service bns .
estonian sources contacted by deutsche presse-agentur dpa confirmed that an informal application has been received , but that more details would be needed before any permit could be issued .
" nord stream have to explain the purpose of the study : what they intend to do , the timetable and what they will need , " ehtel halliste , spokeswoman for the estonian foreign office , told dpa .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war two .
threat of environmental disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one is really sure where the undersea arms dumps are such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment , stroebaek said .
given estonian fears , any routing of the pipeline through estonian waters is likely to be welcomed in tallinn .
" if such an idea were to appear , it means we would automatically be part of the environmental impact assessment scheme , " gromov pointed out .
but the planned pipeline could equally meet with political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
eu 's eastern neighbors get nervous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas stand-off made everyone in europe jittery as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
the fact that the project - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - was negotiated by the two states without consulting the countries between them created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
and in recent months russia has harshly criticized estonian plans to move a red army monument from the centre of tallinn to a less prominent location - leaving many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
whatever the economic and political arguments , the pipeline 's route is likely to take some time to confirm .
according to halliste , once the estonian maritime agency receives an official application , it will have up to four months to decide on issuing a permit .
" when we have the permit from the estonian authorities , the measurement of the sea 's depth will take a few weeks .
we hope we will be ready to say whether we are going to estonia or not in late summer or early autumn , " stroebaek added . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltic sea pipeline consortium considers alternate routes the german-russian consortium planning a major gas pipeline in the baltic sea said it would investigate alternate routes for the project amid concerns that construction could disrupt the environment .

" two days ago we asked the estonian authorities for a permit to measure the depth of the sea in estonian waters , " she added , according to baltic news service bns .
estonian sources contacted by deutsche presse-agentur dpa confirmed that an informal application has been received , but that more details would be needed before any permit could be issued .
" nord stream have to explain the purpose of the study : what they intend to do , the timetable and what they will need , " ehtel halliste , spokeswoman for the estonian foreign office , told dpa .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war two .
threat of environmental disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one is really sure where the undersea arms dumps are such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment , stroebaek said .
given estonian fears , any routing of the pipeline through estonian waters is likely to be welcomed in tallinn .
" if such an idea were to appear , it means we would automatically be part of the environmental impact assessment scheme , " gromov pointed out .
but the planned pipeline could equally meet with political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
eu 's eastern neighbors get nervous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas stand-off made everyone in europe jittery as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
the fact that the project - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - was negotiated by the two states without consulting the countries between them created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
and in recent months russia has harshly criticized estonian plans to move a red army monument from the centre of tallinn to a less prominent location - leaving many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
whatever the economic and political arguments , the pipeline 's route is likely to take some time to confirm .
according to halliste , once the estonian maritime agency receives an official application , it will have up to four months to decide on issuing a permit .
" when we have the permit from the estonian authorities , the measurement of the sea 's depth will take a few weeks .
we hope we will be ready to say whether we are going to estonia or not in late summer or early autumn , " stroebaek added . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltic sea pipeline consortium considers alternate routes the german-russian consortium planning a major gas pipeline in the baltic sea said it would investigate alternate routes for the project amid concerns that construction could disrupt the environment .

" the stability of iraq is in our common interest , " commission spokeswoman krisztina nagy told reporters in brussels .
" the eu recognizes the constructive role turkey plays in the area and in this context it is important that turkey continues to play such a positive role , " she added .
" the eu is following the situation in the region very closely , " said nagy .
" our hope and the interest of all involved is that possible differences are dealt with in a peaceful and constructive manner . "
in a rare press conference at the army headquarters , general yasar buyukanit pushed on thursday for a cross-border operation into northern iraq to crack down on turkish kurd rebels he said had sought refuge there .
general buyukanit said that it was necessary to launch a cross-border military operation against pkk rebels based in northern iraq there , but that this would require political authorization .
" it is necessary to launch an operation into iraq , " buyukanit told reporters .
" the pkk has huge freedom of movement in iraq . "
missions within turkey target returning fighters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish troops in northern iraq in 2005 he also said the military had launched a number of large-scale operations against kurdish rebels in south-east turkey .
buyukanit said the operations had been launched as snow melting in mountain passes made it easier for pkk rebels to enter turkey from neighboring iraq .
turkey has accused iraqi kurds of tolerating , and even backing the kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has waged a bloody campaign for kurdish self-rule in turkey 's southeast since 1984 .
the conflict has claimed some 37,000 lives .
the turkish military has claimed there are around 5,000 pkk guerrillas based in camps in mountainous northern iraq .
ankara says thousands of militants of the pkk enjoy unrestricted movement in northern iraq and are able to obtain weapons and explosives there .
the group is listed as a terrorist group by turkey and much of the international community .
iraqi kurds taking threats very seriously the kurds in northern iraq are taking the threats by the turkish army to launch a military offensive against kurdish rebels seriously , the president of the autonomous kurdish parliament said friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military has clashed with rebels in southern turkey adnan al-mufti told reporters in arbil , northern iraq that " these threats are nothing new for us , we take them seriously . "
he said the authorities in the autonomous kurdish region of northern iraq would seek the support of the iraqi government .
" we want a dialogue , but those responsible in turkey are not ready for one , " al-mufti added .
when asked why the kurdish authorities , who control three provinces in northern iraq , have not taken action against pkk rebels , al-mufti said that " the situation in iraq is altogether too unstable ; therefore we can not take steps against this party . "
the turkish government has repeatedly called on the united states and iraq to launch its own operations against the pkk in northern iraq .
the organization is black-listed as a terrorist organization by both the us and the eu .
on friday the president of the iraqi parliament mahmoud al- mashhadani warned that all those foreign powers that had a hand in iraq 's internal affairs would have " the hand hacked off . "

"
asked about the us plan to install part of the anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic , jung said : " i think it is good that in nato , as with the nato-russia council , we are working together to assuage possible doubts " .
although jung has voiced support for the us scheme , it is not a view that is universally backed within the german cabinet .
but he did insist it was important for the west " to work on a partnership basis with russia " on the matter , he added .
russia should be convinced of the argument so as " to reach an agreement for the protection of populations , for european populations in particular , " he said .
protective measure ? the united states has asked the czech republic to host a radar system and poland to host interceptor rockets as part of its missile defense plans .
washington insists the anti-missile shield is intended as protection against attacks from " rogue states " such as iran .
it points out that the proposed system would be useless against russia 's vast weapons arsenal .
but russia 's president vladimir putin has said it could spark a new arms race and that it was a needless distraction from the fight against terrorism .
preventing a nuclear iran jung also told the european deputies that every possible diplomatic effort should be made " to prevent iran from equipping itself with nuclear arms " .
he added : " it is vital for world peace .
the united states , russia , europe and china must work together . "
president putin had been very clear on one point , he continued . " it is also in russia 's interests that iran does not possess atomic weapons , " jung said .
on april 19 , at nato 's brussels headquarters , the 26 nato allies - including 21 eu member states - will discuss the anti-missile system in the north atlantic council and then with russia at a nato-russia meeting .
russia still critical putin has strongly criticized the plans for the us missile defesce system .
" why is it necessary to put military infrastructure on our border ?
it 's hardly connected to today 's global threats .
what is the real threat ?
terrorism , " putin told a security conference in munich in february .
that speech marked a further worsening of relations between moscow and washington under putin , who has tried to restore russia 's prestige since the economic collapse that followed the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nukes still a threat 50 years after first peace declaration the scientists who signed the göttinger declaration on april 12 , 1957 weren ’ t able to keep nuclear weapons from being stationed in germany .

" two days ago we asked the estonian authorities for a permit to measure the depth of the sea in estonian waters , " she added , according to baltic news service bns .
estonian sources contacted by deutsche presse-agentur dpa confirmed that an informal application has been received , but that more details would be needed before any permit could be issued .
" nord stream have to explain the purpose of the study : what they intend to do , the timetable and what they will need , " ehtel halliste , spokeswoman for the estonian foreign office , told dpa .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war two .
threat of environmental disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one is really sure where the undersea arms dumps are such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment , stroebaek said .
given estonian fears , any routing of the pipeline through estonian waters is likely to be welcomed in tallinn .
" if such an idea were to appear , it means we would automatically be part of the environmental impact assessment scheme , " gromov pointed out .
but the planned pipeline could equally meet with political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
eu 's eastern neighbors get nervous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas stand-off made everyone in europe jittery as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
the fact that the project - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - was negotiated by the two states without consulting the countries between them created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
and in recent months russia has harshly criticized estonian plans to move a red army monument from the centre of tallinn to a less prominent location - leaving many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
whatever the economic and political arguments , the pipeline 's route is likely to take some time to confirm .
according to halliste , once the estonian maritime agency receives an official application , it will have up to four months to decide on issuing a permit .
" when we have the permit from the estonian authorities , the measurement of the sea 's depth will take a few weeks .
we hope we will be ready to say whether we are going to estonia or not in late summer or early autumn , " stroebaek added . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltic sea pipeline consortium considers alternate routes the german-russian consortium planning a major gas pipeline in the baltic sea said it would investigate alternate routes for the project amid concerns that construction could disrupt the environment .

bayer leverkusen failed to overturn a 3-0 first leg deficit , losing 1-0 to osasuna . germany striker miroslav klose ended his goal drought in style at the weserstadion on thursday with a brace in werder bremen 's 4-1 win over az alkmaar which secured their place in the uefa cup semi-finals where they will meet espanyol .
the polish-born forward scored in the 36th minute to end his barren spell , which dated back to january 31 and lasted 1158 minutes , to add to tim borowski 's opener - which had been pegged back by moussa dembele 's excellent 32nd minute equalizer .
any doubts that werder - who almost put barcelona out in the champions league group stages - would not be in the final four were settled when klose added their third in the 62nd minute .
inspirational brazilian playmaker diego rounded off the scoring against the plucky dutch with a well deserved goal eight minutes from time , hitting home from the edge of the penalty area after playing a neat 1-2 with klose .
confident klose rediscovers his touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose displayed few signs of suffering from his drought werder coach thomas schaaf said the thought had never entered his mind that klose had lost his touch .
" miroslav always trained hard and never lost confidence , " said schaaf .
" his situation was never as catastrophic as people said .
he knew he had not lost his goal scoring talents and today his work paid off . "
the first half came to a boil after borowski netted in the 19th minute , escaping the attentions of an alkmaar defender to latch onto a delightful lobbed ball from diego to shoot into the far corner of the net .
alkmaar were far from cowed and captain and former glasgow rangers striker shota arveladze almost leveled with a splendid lob from outside the area which took a deflection for a corner .
the dutch side , though , did draw level as dembele produced a fierce left footed shot from just outside the box which beat the diving tim wiese in the left hand corner for his fourth goal of the campaign .
it had coach louis van gaal punching the air in delight , but the former barcelona and dutch national coach was not in the same mood when klose got on the end of aaron hunt 's pass across the five-yard line to score his first goal of the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego slams in his goal to make it 4-1 to werder indeed van gaal was in even more of a fury when what looked like a perfectly good goal was disallowed and he had several words with the fourth official over referee mike riley 's decision .
the hosts should have been 3-1 up a minute later as borowski squared the ball from the right but klose was only able to screw the ball over the bar .
the second half was as exciting an affair with werder 's naldo going agonizingly close with a rasping free kick but it was to be klose who closed things down for the german side .
again diego was the architect , the pocket-sized brazilian floating over an inch-perfect cross from the right for klose to send a diving header past the keeper and secure his brace , and bremen 's victory .
lackluster leverkusen crash out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen looked resigned to their fate from the start germany ’ s other uefa cup quarter-finalists bayer leverkusen couldn ’ t overturn the 3-0 deficit racked up in the first leg of their clash against spanish side osasuna and suffered further ignominy by losing the second game 1-0 .
osasuna midfielder juanlu gave the spaniards a deserved win when he steered in past rene adler from close range after the leverkusen keeper had palmed a roberto soldado shot into his path just after the hour .
a poor and lacklustre leverkusen side laboured against their opponents and only fashioned one serious attempt on goal when defender jan-ingwer callsen bracker had a header cleared off the line early in the second half .

bayer leverkusen failed to overturn a 3-0 first leg deficit , losing 1-0 to osasuna . germany striker miroslav klose ended his goal drought in style at the weserstadion on thursday with a brace in werder bremen 's 4-1 win over az alkmaar which secured their place in the uefa cup semi-finals where they will meet espanyol .
the polish-born forward scored in the 36th minute to end his barren spell , which dated back to january 31 and lasted 1158 minutes , to add to tim borowski 's opener - which had been pegged back by moussa dembele 's excellent 32nd minute equalizer .
any doubts that werder - who almost put barcelona out in the champions league group stages - would not be in the final four were settled when klose added their third in the 62nd minute .
inspirational brazilian playmaker diego rounded off the scoring against the plucky dutch with a well deserved goal eight minutes from time , hitting home from the edge of the penalty area after playing a neat 1-2 with klose .
confident klose rediscovers his touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose displayed few signs of suffering from his drought werder coach thomas schaaf said the thought had never entered his mind that klose had lost his touch .
" miroslav always trained hard and never lost confidence , " said schaaf .
" his situation was never as catastrophic as people said .
he knew he had not lost his goal scoring talents and today his work paid off . "
the first half came to a boil after borowski netted in the 19th minute , escaping the attentions of an alkmaar defender to latch onto a delightful lobbed ball from diego to shoot into the far corner of the net .
alkmaar were far from cowed and captain and former glasgow rangers striker shota arveladze almost leveled with a splendid lob from outside the area which took a deflection for a corner .
the dutch side , though , did draw level as dembele produced a fierce left footed shot from just outside the box which beat the diving tim wiese in the left hand corner for his fourth goal of the campaign .
it had coach louis van gaal punching the air in delight , but the former barcelona and dutch national coach was not in the same mood when klose got on the end of aaron hunt 's pass across the five-yard line to score his first goal of the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego slams in his goal to make it 4-1 to werder indeed van gaal was in even more of a fury when what looked like a perfectly good goal was disallowed and he had several words with the fourth official over referee mike riley 's decision .
the hosts should have been 3-1 up a minute later as borowski squared the ball from the right but klose was only able to screw the ball over the bar .
the second half was as exciting an affair with werder 's naldo going agonizingly close with a rasping free kick but it was to be klose who closed things down for the german side .
again diego was the architect , the pocket-sized brazilian floating over an inch-perfect cross from the right for klose to send a diving header past the keeper and secure his brace , and bremen 's victory .
lackluster leverkusen crash out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen looked resigned to their fate from the start germany ’ s other uefa cup quarter-finalists bayer leverkusen couldn ’ t overturn the 3-0 deficit racked up in the first leg of their clash against spanish side osasuna and suffered further ignominy by losing the second game 1-0 .
osasuna midfielder juanlu gave the spaniards a deserved win when he steered in past rene adler from close range after the leverkusen keeper had palmed a roberto soldado shot into his path just after the hour .
a poor and lacklustre leverkusen side laboured against their opponents and only fashioned one serious attempt on goal when defender jan-ingwer callsen bracker had a header cleared off the line early in the second half .
osasuna now face compatriots sevilla in the semi after the cup holders drew 2-2 with english premiership side tottenham hotspur , advancing 3-4 on aggregate . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leverkusen routed while bremen keep uefa cup dream alive werder bremen could be germany 's last contender in the uefa cup by the end of next week after bayer leverkusen suffered a hugely damaging 3-0 home defeat against osasuna .

the committee 's backing sets the stage for a vote before the full parliament in a plenary session on may 10 in brussels and a final decision by eu telecoms ministers on june 7 in luxembourg .
" we are sending a very clear message to the consumers and telecom operators , " said the bill 's rapporteur , austrian conservative paul ruedig .
" it 's a good basis for our deliberations . "
the plans as adopted by the panel go even farther in the favor of consumers than original propositions from the european commission , which had proposed a 44-cent ceiling on outgoing calls made abroad in the eu and a 15-cent cap on incoming calls .
protecting consumers the eu 's executive arm hopes to see so-called roaming charges fall by as much as 70 percent , thanks to its plans to cap what operators charge customers at the retail level and what they charge each other at the wholesale level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu consumers could benefit from the price caps this summer already the commission drew up the plans to regulate roaming rates last year after finding evidence of huge variations between operators ' prices with roaming calls costing some times up to six times those of local mobile calls .
eu telecoms commissioner viviane reding , who has led the drive for regulation of roaming rates , hailed the committee 's support for her plans as " very good news for europe 's consumers . "
the beuc european consumers association said that while the plans " go in the right direction , " the price caps " are still too high and should be readjusted based on real costs . "
reding is aiming for the package to go into effect in summer so consumers can benefit from lower prices during the holidays abroad , although some eu lawmakers have said its application might not come until the autumn .
" in view of the emerging consensus on the new rules , an early entry into force of the eu roaming regulation is now a very realistic possibility , " she added .
industry up in arms the package has the industry , which argues that fierce competition has already driven down prices , up in arms and it has been lobbying hard to get the plans watered down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone companies can expect the caps to hurt the gsma trade association said that " retail price regulation is inappropriate and unprecedented on the basis of the principles of a market economy . "
it charged that the plans " will force european mobile operators to offer roaming services at below cost and give them no scope to compete with each other on price and on new services . "
the organization has been lobbying for a ceiling of at least 65 cents for outgoing calls abroad and 35 cents for incoming calls .
with roaming charges generating on average 10 percent of operators revenues , reding acknowledged that the regulations would prove to be painful for operators and would probably provoke a " correction " in the share prices . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bahn , vodafone team up on mobile payment scheme global wireless company vodafone will make a fresh foray into the micro-banking business , testing a mobile payment system in partnership with deutsche bahn , the companies announced at the weekend .

the committee 's backing sets the stage for a vote before the full parliament in a plenary session on may 10 in brussels and a final decision by eu telecoms ministers on june 7 in luxembourg .
" we are sending a very clear message to the consumers and telecom operators , " said the bill 's rapporteur , austrian conservative paul ruedig .
" it 's a good basis for our deliberations . "
the plans as adopted by the panel go even farther in the favor of consumers than original propositions from the european commission , which had proposed a 44-cent ceiling on outgoing calls made abroad in the eu and a 15-cent cap on incoming calls .
protecting consumers the eu 's executive arm hopes to see so-called roaming charges fall by as much as 70 percent , thanks to its plans to cap what operators charge customers at the retail level and what they charge each other at the wholesale level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu consumers could benefit from the price caps this summer already the commission drew up the plans to regulate roaming rates last year after finding evidence of huge variations between operators ' prices with roaming calls costing some times up to six times those of local mobile calls .
eu telecoms commissioner viviane reding , who has led the drive for regulation of roaming rates , hailed the committee 's support for her plans as " very good news for europe 's consumers . "
the beuc european consumers association said that while the plans " go in the right direction , " the price caps " are still too high and should be readjusted based on real costs . "
reding is aiming for the package to go into effect in summer so consumers can benefit from lower prices during the holidays abroad , although some eu lawmakers have said its application might not come until the autumn .
" in view of the emerging consensus on the new rules , an early entry into force of the eu roaming regulation is now a very realistic possibility , " she added .
industry up in arms the package has the industry , which argues that fierce competition has already driven down prices , up in arms and it has been lobbying hard to get the plans watered down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone companies can expect the caps to hurt the gsma trade association said that " retail price regulation is inappropriate and unprecedented on the basis of the principles of a market economy . "
it charged that the plans " will force european mobile operators to offer roaming services at below cost and give them no scope to compete with each other on price and on new services . "
the organization has been lobbying for a ceiling of at least 65 cents for outgoing calls abroad and 35 cents for incoming calls .
with roaming charges generating on average 10 percent of operators revenues , reding acknowledged that the regulations would prove to be painful for operators and would probably provoke a " correction " in the share prices . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bahn , vodafone team up on mobile payment scheme global wireless company vodafone will make a fresh foray into the micro-banking business , testing a mobile payment system in partnership with deutsche bahn , the companies announced at the weekend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.04.2007 german solar boom shines its light on depressed east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one study says by 2020 , more people could work in solar and related branches than in the car industry german accounts for 55 percent of global solar electricity production and is the world 's market leader .
one of the main benefactors of the solar boom is eastern germany , which has long been under an economic shadow . although germans are renowned for spending much of their six weeks of annual vacation in sunnier climes to escape the frequent gray skies and rain of home , solar energy is turning out to be one of the country 's fastest-growing sectors and could be the light at the end of the tunnel for the struggling east .
the eastern city of frankfurt an der oder is turning into one of the main beneficiaries of the solar upsurge , with three solar production facilities planned for the region .
one , being built by the green energy company conergy , is scheduled to go online in october or november .
inside the shell of a chip factory that never got off the ground another in a long string of economic disappointments for the region workers are busy putting in machines that cut and clean silicon .
when up and running toward the end of this year , conergy hopes to produce about 1.2 million photovoltaic modules , which convert the sun 's energy into electricity , per year and employ around 600 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a welder at the conergy plant in frankfurt an der oder for frankfurt , which symbolizes the economic woes of eastern germany in the wake of reunification , the news of new jobs was like bread for the starving .
" we had a job forum in december , where we and the other two solar companies presented ourselves , " said andreas von brandemer , the plant director at this new location .
" afterwards we had 5,000 people applying for a job in our factory .
the hr people had a lot to do . "
only 100 jobs were on offer at the time , although von brandermer says if all goes to plan , conergy hopes to build a second factory in the city in 2009 and will employ around 1,000 .
germany 's biggest solar company , bonn-based solarworld , is also expanding its presence in the east .
expansion plans at its state-of-the-art production facility in freiburg , in the eastern state of saxony , have a price tag in the hundreds of millions of euros .
" solar valley " eastern germany is attractive so many solar players that it 's been dubbed , perhaps inevitably , " solar valley . "
it is attractive to investors for several reasons : wages in the east are lower then they are in western germany ; massive investment in the years since reunification means the infrastructure is excellent ; and eastern german cities have been generous with tax incentives to lure companies .
but another important reason for potential investors has been the hometown workforce .
frankfurt an der oder was the home of east germany 's semiconductor industry .
the region already has a skilled workforce , although many of those who used to work in the gdr-era semiconductor industry have been out of work for years or been forced to enter different industries .
many are ready to return .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels in the eastern state of brandenburg " so you already have a lot of skilled , knowledgeable workers in the field of handling silicon and that 's a major point for companies considering investing in eastern germany , " said nicholas dobrott , director of renewable energies for the industrial investment council .
andreas kritzski is one of them .
he worked in frankfurt 's semiconductor factory in the gdr era , but lost his job with the plant closed .
he entered retraining programs in construction , did some work in western germany , then lost other jobs as firms folded .
he was out of work for several years before starting at conergy about a month ago .
" the recovery is finally coming , like it was announced all those years ago , " he said .
" people are sending in their applications and waiting excitedly .
like i did , a lot of looking on the internet to find out how solar energy works . "
enough sun although it might be counterintuitive , photovoltaic cells can operate just fine under cloudy skies , since despite the grayness of a rainy day , there is still solar radiation in the air , otherwise it would be dark .
while the sunniest spots in the world , like the sahara desert , have a solar energy potential of about two thousand kilowatt hours per square meter per year , germany 's manages a respectable one thousand , according to henner weithöner of solarpraxis , a company that tracks germany 's solar sector .
" this shows how much even germany or parts of northern europe , how much solar energy we have and what huge potential , " he said .
" we just have to use it . "
germans ' general environmental consciousness has also helped the country take the solar lead .
the green party is a strong presence on the political stage , having been part of the previous governing coalition headed by chancellor gerhard schröder .
renewables law experts say that that administration 's passage of the renewable energies law in 2000 was the momentum behind the current solar surge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge solar facility near the eastern city of leipzig with around 33.500 solar modules the legislation committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 .
it set up generous rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid , and created a market for solar energy .
last year , the solar industry had sales of 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- and employs 53,000 .
according to a report in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , a study carried out by the munich-based consulting firm roland berger estimates that by 2020 , more people could be employed in the environment-related sector than are in the auto industry and engineering .
there are still hurdles to be overcome , especially around the issue of price , and bringing it down .
estimates are that electricity from photovoltaics still needs ten years to become competitive with energy from traditional sources like coal or nuclear .
but solar companies are n't waiting .
they are continuing to invest , counting on technology to eventually bring those prices down .
" if you build up a solar company , lots of manpower is needed , " said weithöner of solarpraxis .
" it is a real job engine for the eastern states .

" the stability of iraq is in our common interest , " commission spokeswoman krisztina nagy told reporters in brussels .
" the eu recognizes the constructive role turkey plays in the area and in this context it is important that turkey continues to play such a positive role , " she added .
" the eu is following the situation in the region very closely , " said nagy .
" our hope and the interest of all involved is that possible differences are dealt with in a peaceful and constructive manner . "
in a rare press conference at the army headquarters , general yasar buyukanit pushed on thursday for a cross-border operation into northern iraq to crack down on turkish kurd rebels he said had sought refuge there .
general buyukanit said that it was necessary to launch a cross-border military operation against pkk rebels based in northern iraq there , but that this would require political authorization .

buyukanit said the operations had been launched as snow melting in mountain passes made it easier for pkk rebels to enter turkey from neighboring iraq .

when asked why the kurdish authorities , who control three provinces in northern iraq , have not taken action against pkk rebels , al-mufti said that " the situation in iraq is altogether too unstable ; therefore we can not take steps against this party . "
the turkish government has repeatedly called on the united states and iraq to launch its own operations against the pkk in northern iraq .

" the stability of iraq is in our common interest , " commission spokeswoman krisztina nagy told reporters in brussels .
" the eu recognizes the constructive role turkey plays in the area and in this context it is important that turkey continues to play such a positive role , " she added .
" the eu is following the situation in the region very closely , " said nagy .
" our hope and the interest of all involved is that possible differences are dealt with in a peaceful and constructive manner . "
in a rare press conference at the army headquarters , general yasar buyukanit pushed on thursday for a cross-border operation into northern iraq to crack down on turkish kurd rebels he said had sought refuge there .
general buyukanit said that it was necessary to launch a cross-border military operation against pkk rebels based in northern iraq there , but that this would require political authorization .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.04.2007 bitterly disputed german-russian gas pipeline heads for estonia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns that the pipeline may disturb world war ii weapons dumped in the sea a controversial pipeline to carry russian gas under the baltic sea to germany could run through estonian waters , an official from the consortium behind the project said on friday . the nord stream consortium " sees a possibility that the pipeline could go through estonian waters , " spokeswoman neel stroebaek told reporters .
" two days ago we asked the estonian authorities for a permit to measure the depth of the sea in estonian waters , " she added , according to baltic news service bns .
estonian sources contacted by deutsche presse-agentur dpa confirmed that an informal application has been received , but that more details would be needed before any permit could be issued .
" nord stream have to explain the purpose of the study : what they intend to do , the timetable and what they will need , " ehtel halliste , spokeswoman for the estonian foreign office , told dpa .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war two .
threat of environmental disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one is really sure where the undersea arms dumps are such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment , stroebaek said .
given estonian fears , any routing of the pipeline through estonian waters is likely to be welcomed in tallinn .
" if such an idea were to appear , it means we would automatically be part of the environmental impact assessment scheme , " gromov pointed out .
but the planned pipeline could equally meet with political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
eu 's eastern neighbors get nervous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas stand-off made everyone in europe jittery as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
the fact that the project - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - was negotiated by the two states without consulting the countries between them created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
and in recent months russia has harshly criticized estonian plans to move a red army monument from the centre of tallinn to a less prominent location - leaving many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
whatever the economic and political arguments , the pipeline 's route is likely to take some time to confirm .
according to halliste , once the estonian maritime agency receives an official application , it will have up to four months to decide on issuing a permit .
" when we have the permit from the estonian authorities , the measurement of the sea 's depth will take a few weeks .
we hope we will be ready to say whether we are going to estonia or not in late summer or early autumn , " stroebaek added . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltic sea pipeline consortium considers alternate routes the german-russian consortium planning a major gas pipeline in the baltic sea said it would investigate alternate routes for the project amid concerns that construction could disrupt the environment .

" but if you want to win the league , you have to win in mainz . " schalke coach mirko slomka has minor injury concerns with danish striker soren larsen twisting an ankle in training and halil altintop facing a fitness race to partner in-form striker kevin kuranyi up front .
" a win could be a major milestone for us on the road to the league title , " said slomka . schalke 's main hopes rest on the return of playmaker lincoln from a five-game suspension for the final six matches of the season .
" lincoln is back , he is extremely important for us , " said slomka .
the schalke coach also said he would be happy if bremen lose in dortmund , but that his team must do its own share : " we must win our games . " bitter rivals wish each other the best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi scored twice in the 4-0 win against mainz earlier this season schalke striker kevin kuranyi also hoped the royal blues ’ bitter rivals get a result : " i will never become a dortmund fan but i hope they get three points against bremen . " it only highlights a somewhat bizarre season that rabid local rivals dortmund also want schalke to win .
" it 's crazy , this time we are keeping our fingers crossed for schalke , " said dortmund defender christian wörns .
points for mainz could seriously jeopardize dortmund ’ s top-flight status . werder - who romped to a 4-1 win over az alkmaar in the uefa cup quarter-finals on thursday with miroslav klose ending his goal drought with a double - go to struggling dortmund on sunday , while bayern munich , in fourth , will be looking to put the hurt of their champions league exit behind them against bayer leverkusen on the same day .

" but if you want to win the league , you have to win in mainz . " schalke coach mirko slomka has minor injury concerns with danish striker soren larsen twisting an ankle in training and halil altintop facing a fitness race to partner in-form striker kevin kuranyi up front .
" a win could be a major milestone for us on the road to the league title , " said slomka . schalke 's main hopes rest on the return of playmaker lincoln from a five-game suspension for the final six matches of the season .
" lincoln is back , he is extremely important for us , " said slomka .
the schalke coach also said he would be happy if bremen lose in dortmund , but that his team must do its own share : " we must win our games . " bitter rivals wish each other the best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi scored twice in the 4-0 win against mainz earlier this season schalke striker kevin kuranyi also hoped the royal blues ’ bitter rivals get a result : " i will never become a dortmund fan but i hope they get three points against bremen . " it only highlights a somewhat bizarre season that rabid local rivals dortmund also want schalke to win .
" it 's crazy , this time we are keeping our fingers crossed for schalke , " said dortmund defender christian wörns .
points for mainz could seriously jeopardize dortmund ’ s top-flight status . werder - who romped to a 4-1 win over az alkmaar in the uefa cup quarter-finals on thursday with miroslav klose ending his goal drought with a double - go to struggling dortmund on sunday , while bayern munich , in fourth , will be looking to put the hurt of their champions league exit behind them against bayer leverkusen on the same day .

we examine why the bundesliga has taken such a surreal turn and how individual performances , not team spirit , may determine some clubs ' fortunes . in one respect , the bundesliga has followed its normal pattern this season .
with six games left , a handful of teams are fighting for the title while a couple of others are in the hunt for international competitions . but the top clubs have actually under-performed - with 56 points , table-toppers schalke would have only been in fourth place at this point last year .
and points lost at the top get redistributed down to the bundesliga 's lower rungs . the result is huge mass of mediocrity and an intriguing situation .
the relegation candidates - defined as any team two games or fewer away from the bottom three - now starts at seventh in the table . this unprecedented constellation may give the lie to the old adage that relegation fights are won and lost as a team .
although collective willingness to fight remains crucial , individual creativity - or blundering - could determine who gets to remain in the first division . from flop to top in ten minutes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head to head match-ups are key late in the season case in point : the team that currently occupies the seventh spot in the table - wolfsburg . in their last match , wolfsburg were behind 2-1 , and opponents mainz were riding out what appeared to be a safe victory against a relegation rival . then in the 80th minute , the wolves ' eccentric brazilian playmaker marcelinho fired an out-of-the-blue blast from just outside of the box into the upper left-hand corner of goal . not content with having salvaged a point , marcelinho scored a nearly identical goal seven minutes later from 20 meters out to secure the unlikely 3-2 win . two individual moments of brilliance dramatically altered the table .
without marcelinho 's goals , wolfsburg would be 14th and mainz , currently next-to-last , 13th in the standings . the headlines after the match summed it up : " marcelinho saves the wolves . " to err is stupid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a relegation fight is no time to fall down on the job what applies to genius holds equally true for individual acts of foolishness , frustration , incompetence or just plain bad luck . hamburg had been on a hot streak , but in their last match , at home to stuttgart , a referee overlooked a foul that led to the visitors ' first goal .
but defender änis ben-hatira sealed a bad loss for the hosts , when he was red-carded for a challenge that was reckless in anyone 's book .
now hamburg are only two points clear of the drop zone . in a similar vein , defender joe simunic got sent off just seconds after hertha had tied the score in their last game against bielefeld , which subsequently ended in a draw .
a win would have lifted berlin from the thick of the fray . mistakes by opponents can also help teams avoid relegation .
in leverkusen 's last match , defender karim haggui scored an own goal and set up another for opponents bochum with an awful back pass .
the result : bochum moved out of the bottom three . in none of these game-changing moments did teamwork play much of a role .
so it will be interesting to follow which players emerge as heroes and which as goats in the wild weeks remaining this season . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de götz gone as hertha prepare to fight relegation hertha berlin were in fifth place at the break , but since then they compiled the worst record in the bundesliga .

" the stability of iraq is in our common interest , " commission spokeswoman krisztina nagy told reporters in brussels .
" the eu recognizes the constructive role turkey plays in the area and in this context it is important that turkey continues to play such a positive role , " she added .
" the eu is following the situation in the region very closely , " said nagy .
" our hope and the interest of all involved is that possible differences are dealt with in a peaceful and constructive manner . "
in a rare press conference at the army headquarters , general yasar buyukanit pushed on thursday for a cross-border operation into northern iraq to crack down on turkish kurd rebels he said had sought refuge there .
general buyukanit said that it was necessary to launch a cross-border military operation against pkk rebels based in northern iraq there , but that this would require political authorization .
" it is necessary to launch an operation into iraq , " buyukanit told reporters .
" the pkk has huge freedom of movement in iraq . "
missions within turkey target returning fighters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish troops in northern iraq in 2005 he also said the military had launched a number of large-scale operations against kurdish rebels in south-east turkey .
buyukanit said the operations had been launched as snow melting in mountain passes made it easier for pkk rebels to enter turkey from neighboring iraq .
turkey has accused iraqi kurds of tolerating , and even backing the kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has waged a bloody campaign for kurdish self-rule in turkey 's southeast since 1984 .
the conflict has claimed some 37,000 lives .
the turkish military has claimed there are around 5,000 pkk guerrillas based in camps in mountainous northern iraq .
ankara says thousands of militants of the pkk enjoy unrestricted movement in northern iraq and are able to obtain weapons and explosives there .
the group is listed as a terrorist group by turkey and much of the international community .
iraqi kurds taking threats very seriously the kurds in northern iraq are taking the threats by the turkish army to launch a military offensive against kurdish rebels seriously , the president of the autonomous kurdish parliament said friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military has clashed with rebels in southern turkey adnan al-mufti told reporters in arbil , northern iraq that " these threats are nothing new for us , we take them seriously . "
he said the authorities in the autonomous kurdish region of northern iraq would seek the support of the iraqi government .
" we want a dialogue , but those responsible in turkey are not ready for one , " al-mufti added .
when asked why the kurdish authorities , who control three provinces in northern iraq , have not taken action against pkk rebels , al-mufti said that " the situation in iraq is altogether too unstable ; therefore we can not take steps against this party . "
the turkish government has repeatedly called on the united states and iraq to launch its own operations against the pkk in northern iraq .
the organization is black-listed as a terrorist organization by both the us and the eu .
on friday the president of the iraqi parliament mahmoud al- mashhadani warned that all those foreign powers that had a hand in iraq 's internal affairs would have " the hand hacked off . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.04.2007 german solar boom shines its light on depressed east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one study says by 2020 , more people could work in solar and related branches than in the car industry german accounts for 55 percent of global solar electricity production and is the world 's market leader .
one of the main benefactors of the solar boom is eastern germany , which has long been under an economic shadow . although germans are renowned for spending much of their six weeks of annual vacation in sunnier climes to escape the frequent gray skies and rain of home , solar energy is turning out to be one of the country 's fastest-growing sectors and could be the light at the end of the tunnel for the struggling east .
the eastern city of frankfurt an der oder is turning into one of the main beneficiaries of the solar upsurge , with three solar production facilities planned for the region .
one , being built by the green energy company conergy , is scheduled to go online in october or november .
inside the shell of a chip factory that never got off the ground another in a long string of economic disappointments for the region workers are busy putting in machines that cut and clean silicon .
when up and running toward the end of this year , conergy hopes to produce about 1.2 million photovoltaic modules , which convert the sun 's energy into electricity , per year and employ around 600 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a welder at the conergy plant in frankfurt an der oder for frankfurt , which symbolizes the economic woes of eastern germany in the wake of reunification , the news of new jobs was like bread for the starving .
" we had a job forum in december , where we and the other two solar companies presented ourselves , " said andreas von brandemer , the plant director at this new location .
" afterwards we had 5,000 people applying for a job in our factory .
the hr people had a lot to do . "
only 100 jobs were on offer at the time , although von brandermer says if all goes to plan , conergy hopes to build a second factory in the city in 2009 and will employ around 1,000 .
germany 's biggest solar company , bonn-based solarworld , is also expanding its presence in the east .
expansion plans at its state-of-the-art production facility in freiburg , in the eastern state of saxony , have a price tag in the hundreds of millions of euros .
" solar valley " eastern germany is attractive so many solar players that it 's been dubbed , perhaps inevitably , " solar valley . "
it is attractive to investors for several reasons : wages in the east are lower then they are in western germany ; massive investment in the years since reunification means the infrastructure is excellent ; and eastern german cities have been generous with tax incentives to lure companies .
but another important reason for potential investors has been the hometown workforce .
frankfurt an der oder was the home of east germany 's semiconductor industry .
the region already has a skilled workforce , although many of those who used to work in the gdr-era semiconductor industry have been out of work for years or been forced to enter different industries .
many are ready to return .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels in the eastern state of brandenburg " so you already have a lot of skilled , knowledgeable workers in the field of handling silicon and that 's a major point for companies considering investing in eastern germany , " said nicholas dobrott , director of renewable energies for the industrial investment council .
andreas kritzski is one of them .
he worked in frankfurt 's semiconductor factory in the gdr era , but lost his job with the plant closed .
he entered retraining programs in construction , did some work in western germany , then lost other jobs as firms folded .
he was out of work for several years before starting at conergy about a month ago .
" the recovery is finally coming , like it was announced all those years ago , " he said .
" people are sending in their applications and waiting excitedly .
like i did , a lot of looking on the internet to find out how solar energy works . "
enough sun although it might be counterintuitive , photovoltaic cells can operate just fine under cloudy skies , since despite the grayness of a rainy day , there is still solar radiation in the air , otherwise it would be dark .
while the sunniest spots in the world , like the sahara desert , have a solar energy potential of about two thousand kilowatt hours per square meter per year , germany 's manages a respectable one thousand , according to henner weithöner of solarpraxis , a company that tracks germany 's solar sector .
" this shows how much even germany or parts of northern europe , how much solar energy we have and what huge potential , " he said .
" we just have to use it . "
germans ' general environmental consciousness has also helped the country take the solar lead .
the green party is a strong presence on the political stage , having been part of the previous governing coalition headed by chancellor gerhard schröder .
renewables law experts say that that administration 's passage of the renewable energies law in 2000 was the momentum behind the current solar surge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge solar facility near the eastern city of leipzig with around 33.500 solar modules the legislation committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 .
it set up generous rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid , and created a market for solar energy .
last year , the solar industry had sales of 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- and employs 53,000 .
according to a report in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , a study carried out by the munich-based consulting firm roland berger estimates that by 2020 , more people could be employed in the environment-related sector than are in the auto industry and engineering .
there are still hurdles to be overcome , especially around the issue of price , and bringing it down .
estimates are that electricity from photovoltaics still needs ten years to become competitive with energy from traditional sources like coal or nuclear .

"
asked about the us plan to install part of the anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic , jung said : " i think it is good that in nato , as with the nato-russia council , we are working together to assuage possible doubts " .
although jung has voiced support for the us scheme , it is not a view that is universally backed within the german cabinet .
but he did insist it was important for the west " to work on a partnership basis with russia " on the matter , he added .
russia should be convinced of the argument so as " to reach an agreement for the protection of populations , for european populations in particular , " he said .
protective measure ? the united states has asked the czech republic to host a radar system and poland to host interceptor rockets as part of its missile defense plans .
washington insists the anti-missile shield is intended as protection against attacks from " rogue states " such as iran .
it points out that the proposed system would be useless against russia 's vast weapons arsenal .
but russia 's president vladimir putin has said it could spark a new arms race and that it was a needless distraction from the fight against terrorism .
preventing a nuclear iran jung also told the european deputies that every possible diplomatic effort should be made " to prevent iran from equipping itself with nuclear arms " .
he added : " it is vital for world peace .
the united states , russia , europe and china must work together . "
president putin had been very clear on one point , he continued . " it is also in russia 's interests that iran does not possess atomic weapons , " jung said .
on april 19 , at nato 's brussels headquarters , the 26 nato allies - including 21 eu member states - will discuss the anti-missile system in the north atlantic council and then with russia at a nato-russia meeting .
russia still critical putin has strongly criticized the plans for the us missile defesce system .
" why is it necessary to put military infrastructure on our border ?
it 's hardly connected to today 's global threats .
what is the real threat ?
terrorism , " putin told a security conference in munich in february .
that speech marked a further worsening of relations between moscow and washington under putin , who has tried to restore russia 's prestige since the economic collapse that followed the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nukes still a threat 50 years after first peace declaration the scientists who signed the göttinger declaration on april 12 , 1957 weren ’ t able to keep nuclear weapons from being stationed in germany .

" but if you want to win the league , you have to win in mainz . " schalke coach mirko slomka has minor injury concerns with danish striker soren larsen twisting an ankle in training and halil altintop facing a fitness race to partner in-form striker kevin kuranyi up front .
" a win could be a major milestone for us on the road to the league title , " said slomka . schalke 's main hopes rest on the return of playmaker lincoln from a five-game suspension for the final six matches of the season .
" lincoln is back , he is extremely important for us , " said slomka .
the schalke coach also said he would be happy if bremen lose in dortmund , but that his team must do its own share : " we must win our games . " bitter rivals wish each other the best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi scored twice in the 4-0 win against mainz earlier this season schalke striker kevin kuranyi also hoped the royal blues ’ bitter rivals get a result : " i will never become a dortmund fan but i hope they get three points against bremen . " it only highlights a somewhat bizarre season that rabid local rivals dortmund also want schalke to win .
" it 's crazy , this time we are keeping our fingers crossed for schalke , " said dortmund defender christian wörns .
points for mainz could seriously jeopardize dortmund ’ s top-flight status . werder - who romped to a 4-1 win over az alkmaar in the uefa cup quarter-finals on thursday with miroslav klose ending his goal drought with a double - go to struggling dortmund on sunday , while bayern munich , in fourth , will be looking to put the hurt of their champions league exit behind them against bayer leverkusen on the same day . " it is still about first place .
but we have to win all our matches , " said munich midfielder owen hargreaves . stuttgart look to capitalize in saturday clash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only way is up for stuttgart 's title hopefuls so third-placed vfb stuttgart 's coach armin veh knows his side must win at home to hanover on saturday in front of their faithful fans to keep the pressure on the sides above them . " hanover are a good counter-attacking side , " said veh .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 13.04.2007 german solar boom shines its light on depressed east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one study says by 2020 , more people could work in solar and related branches than in the car industry german accounts for 55 percent of global solar electricity production and is the world 's market leader .
one of the main benefactors of the solar boom is eastern germany , which has long been under an economic shadow . although germans are renowned for spending much of their six weeks of annual vacation in sunnier climes to escape the frequent gray skies and rain of home , solar energy is turning out to be one of the country 's fastest-growing sectors and could be the light at the end of the tunnel for the struggling east .
the eastern city of frankfurt an der oder is turning into one of the main beneficiaries of the solar upsurge , with three solar production facilities planned for the region .
one , being built by the green energy company conergy , is scheduled to go online in october or november .
inside the shell of a chip factory that never got off the ground another in a long string of economic disappointments for the region workers are busy putting in machines that cut and clean silicon .
when up and running toward the end of this year , conergy hopes to produce about 1.2 million photovoltaic modules , which convert the sun 's energy into electricity , per year and employ around 600 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a welder at the conergy plant in frankfurt an der oder for frankfurt , which symbolizes the economic woes of eastern germany in the wake of reunification , the news of new jobs was like bread for the starving .
" we had a job forum in december , where we and the other two solar companies presented ourselves , " said andreas von brandemer , the plant director at this new location .
" afterwards we had 5,000 people applying for a job in our factory .
the hr people had a lot to do . "
only 100 jobs were on offer at the time , although von brandermer says if all goes to plan , conergy hopes to build a second factory in the city in 2009 and will employ around 1,000 .
germany 's biggest solar company , bonn-based solarworld , is also expanding its presence in the east .
expansion plans at its state-of-the-art production facility in freiburg , in the eastern state of saxony , have a price tag in the hundreds of millions of euros .
" solar valley " eastern germany is attractive so many solar players that it 's been dubbed , perhaps inevitably , " solar valley . "
it is attractive to investors for several reasons : wages in the east are lower then they are in western germany ; massive investment in the years since reunification means the infrastructure is excellent ; and eastern german cities have been generous with tax incentives to lure companies .
but another important reason for potential investors has been the hometown workforce .
frankfurt an der oder was the home of east germany 's semiconductor industry .
the region already has a skilled workforce , although many of those who used to work in the gdr-era semiconductor industry have been out of work for years or been forced to enter different industries .
many are ready to return .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels in the eastern state of brandenburg " so you already have a lot of skilled , knowledgeable workers in the field of handling silicon and that 's a major point for companies considering investing in eastern germany , " said nicholas dobrott , director of renewable energies for the industrial investment council .
andreas kritzski is one of them .
he worked in frankfurt 's semiconductor factory in the gdr era , but lost his job with the plant closed .
he entered retraining programs in construction , did some work in western germany , then lost other jobs as firms folded .
he was out of work for several years before starting at conergy about a month ago .
" the recovery is finally coming , like it was announced all those years ago , " he said .
" people are sending in their applications and waiting excitedly .
like i did , a lot of looking on the internet to find out how solar energy works . "
enough sun although it might be counterintuitive , photovoltaic cells can operate just fine under cloudy skies , since despite the grayness of a rainy day , there is still solar radiation in the air , otherwise it would be dark .
while the sunniest spots in the world , like the sahara desert , have a solar energy potential of about two thousand kilowatt hours per square meter per year , germany 's manages a respectable one thousand , according to henner weithöner of solarpraxis , a company that tracks germany 's solar sector .
" this shows how much even germany or parts of northern europe , how much solar energy we have and what huge potential , " he said .
" we just have to use it . "
germans ' general environmental consciousness has also helped the country take the solar lead .
the green party is a strong presence on the political stage , having been part of the previous governing coalition headed by chancellor gerhard schröder .
renewables law experts say that that administration 's passage of the renewable energies law in 2000 was the momentum behind the current solar surge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge solar facility near the eastern city of leipzig with around 33.500 solar modules the legislation committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 .
it set up generous rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid , and created a market for solar energy .
last year , the solar industry had sales of 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- and employs 53,000 .
according to a report in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , a study carried out by the munich-based consulting firm roland berger estimates that by 2020 , more people could be employed in the environment-related sector than are in the auto industry and engineering .
there are still hurdles to be overcome , especially around the issue of price , and bringing it down .
estimates are that electricity from photovoltaics still needs ten years to become competitive with energy from traditional sources like coal or nuclear .
but solar companies are n't waiting .
they are continuing to invest , counting on technology to eventually bring those prices down .
" if you build up a solar company , lots of manpower is needed , " said weithöner of solarpraxis .
" it is a real job engine for the eastern states .

" europe 's foreign ministers should not miss the opportunity of their forthcoming meeting ... to restore the faith of palestinians in the european union , " oxfam international executive director jeremy hobbs said .
the ministers were due to hold their talks on april 23 and 24 in luxembourg .
" despite welcoming the national unity government , the european union has failed to restore aid payments , " he added in a statement from the british charity .
" with palestinian institutions collapsing and insecurity growing , the resumption of international aid to the palestinian authority is a necessary step to preventing further suffering and securing a just and lasting settlement on the basis of international law . "

" europe 's foreign ministers should not miss the opportunity of their forthcoming meeting ... to restore the faith of palestinians in the european union , " oxfam international executive director jeremy hobbs said .
the ministers were due to hold their talks on april 23 and 24 in luxembourg .
" despite welcoming the national unity government , the european union has failed to restore aid payments , " he added in a statement from the british charity .
" with palestinian institutions collapsing and insecurity growing , the resumption of international aid to the palestinian authority is a necessary step to preventing further suffering and securing a just and lasting settlement on the basis of international law . "

one of the main benefactors of the solar boom is eastern germany , which has long been under an economic shadow . although germans are renowned for spending much of their six weeks of annual vacation in sunnier climes to escape the frequent gray skies and rain of home , solar energy is turning out to be one of the country 's fastest-growing sectors and could be the light at the end of the tunnel for the struggling east .
the eastern city of frankfurt an der oder is turning into one of the main beneficiaries of the solar upsurge , with three solar production facilities planned for the region .
one , being built by the green energy company conergy , is scheduled to go online in october or november .
inside the shell of a chip factory that never got off the ground another in a long string of economic disappointments for the region workers are busy putting in machines that cut and clean silicon .
when up and running toward the end of this year , conergy hopes to produce about 1.2 million photovoltaic modules , which convert the sun 's energy into electricity , per year and employ around 600 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a welder at the conergy plant in frankfurt an der oder for frankfurt , which symbolizes the economic woes of eastern germany in the wake of reunification , the news of new jobs was like bread for the starving .
" we had a job forum in december , where we and the other two solar companies presented ourselves , " said andreas von brandemer , the plant director at this new location .
" afterwards we had 5,000 people applying for a job in our factory .
the hr people had a lot to do . "
only 100 jobs were on offer at the time , although von brandermer says if all goes to plan , conergy hopes to build a second factory in the city in 2009 and will employ around 1,000 .
germany 's biggest solar company , bonn-based solarworld , is also expanding its presence in the east .
expansion plans at its state-of-the-art production facility in freiburg , in the eastern state of saxony , have a price tag in the hundreds of millions of euros .
" solar valley " eastern germany is attractive so many solar players that it 's been dubbed , perhaps inevitably , " solar valley . "
it is attractive to investors for several reasons : wages in the east are lower then they are in western germany ; massive investment in the years since reunification means the infrastructure is excellent ; and eastern german cities have been generous with tax incentives to lure companies .
but another important reason for potential investors has been the hometown workforce .
frankfurt an der oder was the home of east germany 's semiconductor industry .
the region already has a skilled workforce , although many of those who used to work in the gdr-era semiconductor industry have been out of work for years or been forced to enter different industries .
many are ready to return .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels in the eastern state of brandenburg " so you already have a lot of skilled , knowledgeable workers in the field of handling silicon and that 's a major point for companies considering investing in eastern germany , " said nicholas dobrott , director of renewable energies for the industrial investment council .
andreas kritzski is one of them .
he worked in frankfurt 's semiconductor factory in the gdr era , but lost his job with the plant closed .
he entered retraining programs in construction , did some work in western germany , then lost other jobs as firms folded .
he was out of work for several years before starting at conergy about a month ago .
" the recovery is finally coming , like it was announced all those years ago , " he said .
" people are sending in their applications and waiting excitedly .
like i did , a lot of looking on the internet to find out how solar energy works . "
enough sun although it might be counterintuitive , photovoltaic cells can operate just fine under cloudy skies , since despite the grayness of a rainy day , there is still solar radiation in the air , otherwise it would be dark .
while the sunniest spots in the world , like the sahara desert , have a solar energy potential of about two thousand kilowatt hours per square meter per year , germany 's manages a respectable one thousand , according to henner weithöner of solarpraxis , a company that tracks germany 's solar sector .
" this shows how much even germany or parts of northern europe , how much solar energy we have and what huge potential , " he said .
" we just have to use it . "
germans ' general environmental consciousness has also helped the country take the solar lead .
the green party is a strong presence on the political stage , having been part of the previous governing coalition headed by chancellor gerhard schröder .
renewables law experts say that that administration 's passage of the renewable energies law in 2000 was the momentum behind the current solar surge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge solar facility near the eastern city of leipzig with around 33.500 solar modules the legislation committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 .
it set up generous rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid , and created a market for solar energy .
last year , the solar industry had sales of 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- and employs 53,000 .
according to a report in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , a study carried out by the munich-based consulting firm roland berger estimates that by 2020 , more people could be employed in the environment-related sector than are in the auto industry and engineering .
there are still hurdles to be overcome , especially around the issue of price , and bringing it down .
estimates are that electricity from photovoltaics still needs ten years to become competitive with energy from traditional sources like coal or nuclear .
but solar companies are n't waiting .
they are continuing to invest , counting on technology to eventually bring those prices down .

"
asked about the us plan to install part of the anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic , jung said : " i think it is good that in nato , as with the nato-russia council , we are working together to assuage possible doubts " .
although jung has voiced support for the us scheme , it is not a view that is universally backed within the german cabinet .
but he did insist it was important for the west " to work on a partnership basis with russia " on the matter , he added .
russia should be convinced of the argument so as " to reach an agreement for the protection of populations , for european populations in particular , " he said .
protective measure ? the united states has asked the czech republic to host a radar system and poland to host interceptor rockets as part of its missile defense plans .
washington insists the anti-missile shield is intended as protection against attacks from " rogue states " such as iran .
it points out that the proposed system would be useless against russia 's vast weapons arsenal .
but russia 's president vladimir putin has said it could spark a new arms race and that it was a needless distraction from the fight against terrorism .
preventing a nuclear iran jung also told the european deputies that every possible diplomatic effort should be made " to prevent iran from equipping itself with nuclear arms " .
he added : " it is vital for world peace .
the united states , russia , europe and china must work together . "
president putin had been very clear on one point , he continued . " it is also in russia 's interests that iran does not possess atomic weapons , " jung said .
on april 19 , at nato 's brussels headquarters , the 26 nato allies - including 21 eu member states - will discuss the anti-missile system in the north atlantic council and then with russia at a nato-russia meeting .
russia still critical putin has strongly criticized the plans for the us missile defesce system .
" why is it necessary to put military infrastructure on our border ?
it 's hardly connected to today 's global threats .
what is the real threat ?
terrorism , " putin told a security conference in munich in february .
that speech marked a further worsening of relations between moscow and washington under putin , who has tried to restore russia 's prestige since the economic collapse that followed the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nukes still a threat 50 years after first peace declaration the scientists who signed the göttinger declaration on april 12 , 1957 weren ’ t able to keep nuclear weapons from being stationed in germany .

"
asked about the us plan to install part of the anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic , jung said : " i think it is good that in nato , as with the nato-russia council , we are working together to assuage possible doubts " .
although jung has voiced support for the us scheme , it is not a view that is universally backed within the german cabinet .
but he did insist it was important for the west " to work on a partnership basis with russia " on the matter , he added .
russia should be convinced of the argument so as " to reach an agreement for the protection of populations , for european populations in particular , " he said .
protective measure ? the united states has asked the czech republic to host a radar system and poland to host interceptor rockets as part of its missile defense plans .
washington insists the anti-missile shield is intended as protection against attacks from " rogue states " such as iran .
it points out that the proposed system would be useless against russia 's vast weapons arsenal .
but russia 's president vladimir putin has said it could spark a new arms race and that it was a needless distraction from the fight against terrorism .
preventing a nuclear iran jung also told the european deputies that every possible diplomatic effort should be made " to prevent iran from equipping itself with nuclear arms " .
he added : " it is vital for world peace .
the united states , russia , europe and china must work together . "
president putin had been very clear on one point , he continued . " it is also in russia 's interests that iran does not possess atomic weapons , " jung said .
on april 19 , at nato 's brussels headquarters , the 26 nato allies - including 21 eu member states - will discuss the anti-missile system in the north atlantic council and then with russia at a nato-russia meeting .
russia still critical putin has strongly criticized the plans for the us missile defesce system .
" why is it necessary to put military infrastructure on our border ?
it 's hardly connected to today 's global threats .
what is the real threat ?
terrorism , " putin told a security conference in munich in february .
that speech marked a further worsening of relations between moscow and washington under putin , who has tried to restore russia 's prestige since the economic collapse that followed the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nukes still a threat 50 years after first peace declaration the scientists who signed the göttinger declaration on april 12 , 1957 weren ’ t able to keep nuclear weapons from being stationed in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 13.04.2007 teamwork is n't everything großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho could be wolfburg 's bleach-blond savior never before have 12 teams been fighting relegation so late in a season .
we examine why the bundesliga has taken such a surreal turn and how individual performances , not team spirit , may determine some clubs ' fortunes . in one respect , the bundesliga has followed its normal pattern this season .
with six games left , a handful of teams are fighting for the title while a couple of others are in the hunt for international competitions . but the top clubs have actually under-performed - with 56 points , table-toppers schalke would have only been in fourth place at this point last year .
and points lost at the top get redistributed down to the bundesliga 's lower rungs . the result is huge mass of mediocrity and an intriguing situation .
the relegation candidates - defined as any team two games or fewer away from the bottom three - now starts at seventh in the table . this unprecedented constellation may give the lie to the old adage that relegation fights are won and lost as a team .
although collective willingness to fight remains crucial , individual creativity - or blundering - could determine who gets to remain in the first division . from flop to top in ten minutes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head to head match-ups are key late in the season case in point : the team that currently occupies the seventh spot in the table - wolfsburg . in their last match , wolfsburg were behind 2-1 , and opponents mainz were riding out what appeared to be a safe victory against a relegation rival . then in the 80th minute , the wolves ' eccentric brazilian playmaker marcelinho fired an out-of-the-blue blast from just outside of the box into the upper left-hand corner of goal . not content with having salvaged a point , marcelinho scored a nearly identical goal seven minutes later from 20 meters out to secure the unlikely 3-2 win . two individual moments of brilliance dramatically altered the table .
without marcelinho 's goals , wolfsburg would be 14th and mainz , currently next-to-last , 13th in the standings . the headlines after the match summed it up : " marcelinho saves the wolves . " to err is stupid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a relegation fight is no time to fall down on the job what applies to genius holds equally true for individual acts of foolishness , frustration , incompetence or just plain bad luck . hamburg had been on a hot streak , but in their last match , at home to stuttgart , a referee overlooked a foul that led to the visitors ' first goal .
but defender änis ben-hatira sealed a bad loss for the hosts , when he was red-carded for a challenge that was reckless in anyone 's book .
now hamburg are only two points clear of the drop zone . in a similar vein , defender joe simunic got sent off just seconds after hertha had tied the score in their last game against bielefeld , which subsequently ended in a draw .
a win would have lifted berlin from the thick of the fray . mistakes by opponents can also help teams avoid relegation .
in leverkusen 's last match , defender karim haggui scored an own goal and set up another for opponents bochum with an awful back pass .
the result : bochum moved out of the bottom three . in none of these game-changing moments did teamwork play much of a role .
so it will be interesting to follow which players emerge as heroes and which as goats in the wild weeks remaining this season . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de götz gone as hertha prepare to fight relegation hertha berlin were in fifth place at the break , but since then they compiled the worst record in the bundesliga .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.04.2007 eu urges restraint over turkish talk of kurdish crackdown großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has been clamping down on kurds and pkk supporters at home and abroad the european commission urged turkey on friday to play a " constructive " role in iraq a day after turkey 's army chief called for a military incursion into northern iraq to hunt turkish kurd rebels . " the stability of iraq is in our common interest , " commission spokeswoman krisztina nagy told reporters in brussels .
" the eu recognizes the constructive role turkey plays in the area and in this context it is important that turkey continues to play such a positive role , " she added .
" the eu is following the situation in the region very closely , " said nagy .
" our hope and the interest of all involved is that possible differences are dealt with in a peaceful and constructive manner . "
in a rare press conference at the army headquarters , general yasar buyukanit pushed on thursday for a cross-border operation into northern iraq to crack down on turkish kurd rebels he said had sought refuge there .
general buyukanit said that it was necessary to launch a cross-border military operation against pkk rebels based in northern iraq there , but that this would require political authorization .
" it is necessary to launch an operation into iraq , " buyukanit told reporters .
" the pkk has huge freedom of movement in iraq . "
missions within turkey target returning fighters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish troops in northern iraq in 2005 he also said the military had launched a number of large-scale operations against kurdish rebels in south-east turkey .
buyukanit said the operations had been launched as snow melting in mountain passes made it easier for pkk rebels to enter turkey from neighboring iraq .
turkey has accused iraqi kurds of tolerating , and even backing the kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has waged a bloody campaign for kurdish self-rule in turkey 's southeast since 1984 .
the conflict has claimed some 37,000 lives .
the turkish military has claimed there are around 5,000 pkk guerrillas based in camps in mountainous northern iraq .
ankara says thousands of militants of the pkk enjoy unrestricted movement in northern iraq and are able to obtain weapons and explosives there .
the group is listed as a terrorist group by turkey and much of the international community .
iraqi kurds taking threats very seriously the kurds in northern iraq are taking the threats by the turkish army to launch a military offensive against kurdish rebels seriously , the president of the autonomous kurdish parliament said friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military has clashed with rebels in southern turkey adnan al-mufti told reporters in arbil , northern iraq that " these threats are nothing new for us , we take them seriously . "
he said the authorities in the autonomous kurdish region of northern iraq would seek the support of the iraqi government .
" we want a dialogue , but those responsible in turkey are not ready for one , " al-mufti added .
when asked why the kurdish authorities , who control three provinces in northern iraq , have not taken action against pkk rebels , al-mufti said that " the situation in iraq is altogether too unstable ; therefore we can not take steps against this party . "
the turkish government has repeatedly called on the united states and iraq to launch its own operations against the pkk in northern iraq .
the organization is black-listed as a terrorist organization by both the us and the eu .
on friday the president of the iraqi parliament mahmoud al- mashhadani warned that all those foreign powers that had a hand in iraq 's internal affairs would have " the hand hacked off . "
observers interpreted this statement as referring to the turkish military threats to intervene in northern iraq . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence feeds doubts on turkey 's eu bid on the verge of opening eu accession talks , turkey is facing growing violence from kurdish separatists and growing opposition from within europe , potentially jeopardizing ankara 's bid to join the bloc .

öttinger had caused a furor on wednesday when he eulogized filbinger , a former navy judge under the third reich , as an " opponent of the nazi regime . " in a statement , merkel said she wished that “ beyond honoring the great life ’ s work of premier hans filbinger , critical questions about the nazi era had also been posed . ”
she said this was especially important “ out of respect for the feelings of the victims ” of the nazi regime . öttinger had outraged political and religious leaders on wednesday when he claimed that “ there is no verdict that hans filbinger handed down that led to someone losing his life . ”
evidence directly contradicts this claim , as nazi-era documents show that filbinger was involved - as a judge and prosecutor - in death sentences against deserters during world war ii . öttinger claimed during the eulogy that filbinger was not a real nazi , but like millions of other germans was forced to bow to the pressure of the times . massive criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans filbinger : criminal or victim ?
in the state capital stuttgart , rabbi joel berger told the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger that öttinger “ better have damned good evidence for publicly claiming filbinger was an opponent of the nazi regime . ” the leader of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , went further , telling afp news service that öttinger ’ s claim was “ dangerous and , for the survivors , an insulting perversion of historical reality . ” öttinger also came under fire from social democrats and the opposition green party .
ute vogt , leader of the social democratic party in baden-württemberg , echoed knobloch ’ s view that öttinger “ is distorting history , ” she told german television .
“ he issued two death sentences .
it ’ s wrong to call filbinger a victim , ” she said . and the simon wiesenthal center , an international organization that hunts down nazi war criminals , has called on öttinger to resign .
“ the öttinger comments are absolutely incredible , ” efraim zuroff , director of the israeli chapter in jerusalem , told reuters news agency .
“ it is unacceptable for a german state premier to deny and whitewash the nazi past of an ex-leader and nazi judge , ” he said , “ and we call for his resignation . ” filbinger resigned over nazi past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filbinger -lrb- left -rrb- after his resignation in 1978 .

"
asked about the us plan to install part of the anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic , jung said : " i think it is good that in nato , as with the nato-russia council , we are working together to assuage possible doubts " .
although jung has voiced support for the us scheme , it is not a view that is universally backed within the german cabinet .
but he did insist it was important for the west " to work on a partnership basis with russia " on the matter , he added .
russia should be convinced of the argument so as " to reach an agreement for the protection of populations , for european populations in particular , " he said .
protective measure ? the united states has asked the czech republic to host a radar system and poland to host interceptor rockets as part of its missile defense plans .
washington insists the anti-missile shield is intended as protection against attacks from " rogue states " such as iran .
it points out that the proposed system would be useless against russia 's vast weapons arsenal .
but russia 's president vladimir putin has said it could spark a new arms race and that it was a needless distraction from the fight against terrorism .
preventing a nuclear iran jung also told the european deputies that every possible diplomatic effort should be made " to prevent iran from equipping itself with nuclear arms " .
he added : " it is vital for world peace .
the united states , russia , europe and china must work together . "
president putin had been very clear on one point , he continued . " it is also in russia 's interests that iran does not possess atomic weapons , " jung said .
on april 19 , at nato 's brussels headquarters , the 26 nato allies - including 21 eu member states - will discuss the anti-missile system in the north atlantic council and then with russia at a nato-russia meeting .
russia still critical putin has strongly criticized the plans for the us missile defesce system .
" why is it necessary to put military infrastructure on our border ?
it 's hardly connected to today 's global threats .
what is the real threat ?
terrorism , " putin told a security conference in munich in february .
that speech marked a further worsening of relations between moscow and washington under putin , who has tried to restore russia 's prestige since the economic collapse that followed the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nukes still a threat 50 years after first peace declaration the scientists who signed the göttinger declaration on april 12 , 1957 weren ’ t able to keep nuclear weapons from being stationed in germany .

one of the main benefactors of the solar boom is eastern germany , which has long been under an economic shadow . although germans are renowned for spending much of their six weeks of annual vacation in sunnier climes to escape the frequent gray skies and rain of home , solar energy is turning out to be one of the country 's fastest-growing sectors and could be the light at the end of the tunnel for the struggling east .
the eastern city of frankfurt an der oder is turning into one of the main beneficiaries of the solar upsurge , with three solar production facilities planned for the region .
one , being built by the green energy company conergy , is scheduled to go online in october or november .
inside the shell of a chip factory that never got off the ground another in a long string of economic disappointments for the region workers are busy putting in machines that cut and clean silicon .
when up and running toward the end of this year , conergy hopes to produce about 1.2 million photovoltaic modules , which convert the sun 's energy into electricity , per year and employ around 600 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a welder at the conergy plant in frankfurt an der oder for frankfurt , which symbolizes the economic woes of eastern germany in the wake of reunification , the news of new jobs was like bread for the starving .
" we had a job forum in december , where we and the other two solar companies presented ourselves , " said andreas von brandemer , the plant director at this new location .
" afterwards we had 5,000 people applying for a job in our factory .
the hr people had a lot to do . "
only 100 jobs were on offer at the time , although von brandermer says if all goes to plan , conergy hopes to build a second factory in the city in 2009 and will employ around 1,000 .
germany 's biggest solar company , bonn-based solarworld , is also expanding its presence in the east .
expansion plans at its state-of-the-art production facility in freiburg , in the eastern state of saxony , have a price tag in the hundreds of millions of euros .
" solar valley " eastern germany is attractive so many solar players that it 's been dubbed , perhaps inevitably , " solar valley . "
it is attractive to investors for several reasons : wages in the east are lower then they are in western germany ; massive investment in the years since reunification means the infrastructure is excellent ; and eastern german cities have been generous with tax incentives to lure companies .
but another important reason for potential investors has been the hometown workforce .
frankfurt an der oder was the home of east germany 's semiconductor industry .
the region already has a skilled workforce , although many of those who used to work in the gdr-era semiconductor industry have been out of work for years or been forced to enter different industries .
many are ready to return .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels in the eastern state of brandenburg " so you already have a lot of skilled , knowledgeable workers in the field of handling silicon and that 's a major point for companies considering investing in eastern germany , " said nicholas dobrott , director of renewable energies for the industrial investment council .
andreas kritzski is one of them .
he worked in frankfurt 's semiconductor factory in the gdr era , but lost his job with the plant closed .
he entered retraining programs in construction , did some work in western germany , then lost other jobs as firms folded .
he was out of work for several years before starting at conergy about a month ago .
" the recovery is finally coming , like it was announced all those years ago , " he said .
" people are sending in their applications and waiting excitedly .
like i did , a lot of looking on the internet to find out how solar energy works . "
enough sun although it might be counterintuitive , photovoltaic cells can operate just fine under cloudy skies , since despite the grayness of a rainy day , there is still solar radiation in the air , otherwise it would be dark .
while the sunniest spots in the world , like the sahara desert , have a solar energy potential of about two thousand kilowatt hours per square meter per year , germany 's manages a respectable one thousand , according to henner weithöner of solarpraxis , a company that tracks germany 's solar sector .
" this shows how much even germany or parts of northern europe , how much solar energy we have and what huge potential , " he said .
" we just have to use it . "
germans ' general environmental consciousness has also helped the country take the solar lead .
the green party is a strong presence on the political stage , having been part of the previous governing coalition headed by chancellor gerhard schröder .
renewables law experts say that that administration 's passage of the renewable energies law in 2000 was the momentum behind the current solar surge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge solar facility near the eastern city of leipzig with around 33.500 solar modules the legislation committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 .
it set up generous rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid , and created a market for solar energy .
last year , the solar industry had sales of 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- and employs 53,000 .
according to a report in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , a study carried out by the munich-based consulting firm roland berger estimates that by 2020 , more people could be employed in the environment-related sector than are in the auto industry and engineering .
there are still hurdles to be overcome , especially around the issue of price , and bringing it down .
estimates are that electricity from photovoltaics still needs ten years to become competitive with energy from traditional sources like coal or nuclear .
but solar companies are n't waiting .
they are continuing to invest , counting on technology to eventually bring those prices down .

one of the main benefactors of the solar boom is eastern germany , which has long been under an economic shadow . although germans are renowned for spending much of their six weeks of annual vacation in sunnier climes to escape the frequent gray skies and rain of home , solar energy is turning out to be one of the country 's fastest-growing sectors and could be the light at the end of the tunnel for the struggling east .
the eastern city of frankfurt an der oder is turning into one of the main beneficiaries of the solar upsurge , with three solar production facilities planned for the region .
one , being built by the green energy company conergy , is scheduled to go online in october or november .
inside the shell of a chip factory that never got off the ground another in a long string of economic disappointments for the region workers are busy putting in machines that cut and clean silicon .
when up and running toward the end of this year , conergy hopes to produce about 1.2 million photovoltaic modules , which convert the sun 's energy into electricity , per year and employ around 600 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a welder at the conergy plant in frankfurt an der oder for frankfurt , which symbolizes the economic woes of eastern germany in the wake of reunification , the news of new jobs was like bread for the starving .
" we had a job forum in december , where we and the other two solar companies presented ourselves , " said andreas von brandemer , the plant director at this new location .
" afterwards we had 5,000 people applying for a job in our factory .
the hr people had a lot to do . "
only 100 jobs were on offer at the time , although von brandermer says if all goes to plan , conergy hopes to build a second factory in the city in 2009 and will employ around 1,000 .
germany 's biggest solar company , bonn-based solarworld , is also expanding its presence in the east .
expansion plans at its state-of-the-art production facility in freiburg , in the eastern state of saxony , have a price tag in the hundreds of millions of euros .
" solar valley " eastern germany is attractive so many solar players that it 's been dubbed , perhaps inevitably , " solar valley . "
it is attractive to investors for several reasons : wages in the east are lower then they are in western germany ; massive investment in the years since reunification means the infrastructure is excellent ; and eastern german cities have been generous with tax incentives to lure companies .
but another important reason for potential investors has been the hometown workforce .
frankfurt an der oder was the home of east germany 's semiconductor industry .
the region already has a skilled workforce , although many of those who used to work in the gdr-era semiconductor industry have been out of work for years or been forced to enter different industries .
many are ready to return .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels in the eastern state of brandenburg " so you already have a lot of skilled , knowledgeable workers in the field of handling silicon and that 's a major point for companies considering investing in eastern germany , " said nicholas dobrott , director of renewable energies for the industrial investment council .
andreas kritzski is one of them .
he worked in frankfurt 's semiconductor factory in the gdr era , but lost his job with the plant closed .
he entered retraining programs in construction , did some work in western germany , then lost other jobs as firms folded .
he was out of work for several years before starting at conergy about a month ago .
" the recovery is finally coming , like it was announced all those years ago , " he said .
" people are sending in their applications and waiting excitedly .
like i did , a lot of looking on the internet to find out how solar energy works . "
enough sun although it might be counterintuitive , photovoltaic cells can operate just fine under cloudy skies , since despite the grayness of a rainy day , there is still solar radiation in the air , otherwise it would be dark .
while the sunniest spots in the world , like the sahara desert , have a solar energy potential of about two thousand kilowatt hours per square meter per year , germany 's manages a respectable one thousand , according to henner weithöner of solarpraxis , a company that tracks germany 's solar sector .
" this shows how much even germany or parts of northern europe , how much solar energy we have and what huge potential , " he said .
" we just have to use it . "
germans ' general environmental consciousness has also helped the country take the solar lead .
the green party is a strong presence on the political stage , having been part of the previous governing coalition headed by chancellor gerhard schröder .
renewables law experts say that that administration 's passage of the renewable energies law in 2000 was the momentum behind the current solar surge .

it set up generous rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid , and created a market for solar energy .
last year , the solar industry had sales of 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- and employs 53,000 .
according to a report in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , a study carried out by the munich-based consulting firm roland berger estimates that by 2020 , more people could be employed in the environment-related sector than are in the auto industry and engineering .
there are still hurdles to be overcome , especially around the issue of price , and bringing it down .
estimates are that electricity from photovoltaics still needs ten years to become competitive with energy from traditional sources like coal or nuclear .
but solar companies are n't waiting .
they are continuing to invest , counting on technology to eventually bring those prices down .
" if you build up a solar company , lots of manpower is needed , " said weithöner of solarpraxis .

enough sun although it might be counterintuitive , photovoltaic cells can operate just fine under cloudy skies , since despite the grayness of a rainy day , there is still solar radiation in the air , otherwise it would be dark .
while the sunniest spots in the world , like the sahara desert , have a solar energy potential of about two thousand kilowatt hours per square meter per year , germany 's manages a respectable one thousand , according to henner weithöner of solarpraxis , a company that tracks germany 's solar sector .
" this shows how much even germany or parts of northern europe , how much solar energy we have and what huge potential , " he said .
" we just have to use it . "
germans ' general environmental consciousness has also helped the country take the solar lead .
the green party is a strong presence on the political stage , having been part of the previous governing coalition headed by chancellor gerhard schröder .
renewables law experts say that that administration 's passage of the renewable energies law in 2000 was the momentum behind the current solar surge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge solar facility near the eastern city of leipzig with around 33.500 solar modules the legislation committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 .
it set up generous rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid , and created a market for solar energy .
last year , the solar industry had sales of 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- and employs 53,000 .
according to a report in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , a study carried out by the munich-based consulting firm roland berger estimates that by 2020 , more people could be employed in the environment-related sector than are in the auto industry and engineering .
there are still hurdles to be overcome , especially around the issue of price , and bringing it down .
estimates are that electricity from photovoltaics still needs ten years to become competitive with energy from traditional sources like coal or nuclear .
but solar companies are n't waiting .
they are continuing to invest , counting on technology to eventually bring those prices down .
" if you build up a solar company , lots of manpower is needed , " said weithöner of solarpraxis .
" it is a real job engine for the eastern states .

bayer leverkusen failed to overturn a 3-0 first leg deficit , losing 1-0 to osasuna . germany striker miroslav klose ended his goal drought in style at the weserstadion on thursday with a brace in werder bremen 's 4-1 win over az alkmaar which secured their place in the uefa cup semi-finals where they will meet espanyol .
the polish-born forward scored in the 36th minute to end his barren spell , which dated back to january 31 and lasted 1158 minutes , to add to tim borowski 's opener - which had been pegged back by moussa dembele 's excellent 32nd minute equalizer .
any doubts that werder - who almost put barcelona out in the champions league group stages - would not be in the final four were settled when klose added their third in the 62nd minute .
inspirational brazilian playmaker diego rounded off the scoring against the plucky dutch with a well deserved goal eight minutes from time , hitting home from the edge of the penalty area after playing a neat 1-2 with klose .
confident klose rediscovers his touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose displayed few signs of suffering from his drought werder coach thomas schaaf said the thought had never entered his mind that klose had lost his touch .
" miroslav always trained hard and never lost confidence , " said schaaf .
" his situation was never as catastrophic as people said .
he knew he had not lost his goal scoring talents and today his work paid off . "
the first half came to a boil after borowski netted in the 19th minute , escaping the attentions of an alkmaar defender to latch onto a delightful lobbed ball from diego to shoot into the far corner of the net .
alkmaar were far from cowed and captain and former glasgow rangers striker shota arveladze almost leveled with a splendid lob from outside the area which took a deflection for a corner .
the dutch side , though , did draw level as dembele produced a fierce left footed shot from just outside the box which beat the diving tim wiese in the left hand corner for his fourth goal of the campaign .
it had coach louis van gaal punching the air in delight , but the former barcelona and dutch national coach was not in the same mood when klose got on the end of aaron hunt 's pass across the five-yard line to score his first goal of the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego slams in his goal to make it 4-1 to werder indeed van gaal was in even more of a fury when what looked like a perfectly good goal was disallowed and he had several words with the fourth official over referee mike riley 's decision .
the hosts should have been 3-1 up a minute later as borowski squared the ball from the right but klose was only able to screw the ball over the bar .
the second half was as exciting an affair with werder 's naldo going agonizingly close with a rasping free kick but it was to be klose who closed things down for the german side .
again diego was the architect , the pocket-sized brazilian floating over an inch-perfect cross from the right for klose to send a diving header past the keeper and secure his brace , and bremen 's victory .
lackluster leverkusen crash out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen looked resigned to their fate from the start germany ’ s other uefa cup quarter-finalists bayer leverkusen couldn ’ t overturn the 3-0 deficit racked up in the first leg of their clash against spanish side osasuna and suffered further ignominy by losing the second game 1-0 .
osasuna midfielder juanlu gave the spaniards a deserved win when he steered in past rene adler from close range after the leverkusen keeper had palmed a roberto soldado shot into his path just after the hour .
a poor and lacklustre leverkusen side laboured against their opponents and only fashioned one serious attempt on goal when defender jan-ingwer callsen bracker had a header cleared off the line early in the second half .

we examine why the bundesliga has taken such a surreal turn and how individual performances , not team spirit , may determine some clubs ' fortunes . in one respect , the bundesliga has followed its normal pattern this season .
with six games left , a handful of teams are fighting for the title while a couple of others are in the hunt for international competitions . but the top clubs have actually under-performed - with 56 points , table-toppers schalke would have only been in fourth place at this point last year .
and points lost at the top get redistributed down to the bundesliga 's lower rungs . the result is huge mass of mediocrity and an intriguing situation .
the relegation candidates - defined as any team two games or fewer away from the bottom three - now starts at seventh in the table . this unprecedented constellation may give the lie to the old adage that relegation fights are won and lost as a team .
although collective willingness to fight remains crucial , individual creativity - or blundering - could determine who gets to remain in the first division . from flop to top in ten minutes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head to head match-ups are key late in the season case in point : the team that currently occupies the seventh spot in the table - wolfsburg . in their last match , wolfsburg were behind 2-1 , and opponents mainz were riding out what appeared to be a safe victory against a relegation rival . then in the 80th minute , the wolves ' eccentric brazilian playmaker marcelinho fired an out-of-the-blue blast from just outside of the box into the upper left-hand corner of goal . not content with having salvaged a point , marcelinho scored a nearly identical goal seven minutes later from 20 meters out to secure the unlikely 3-2 win . two individual moments of brilliance dramatically altered the table .
without marcelinho 's goals , wolfsburg would be 14th and mainz , currently next-to-last , 13th in the standings . the headlines after the match summed it up : " marcelinho saves the wolves . " to err is stupid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a relegation fight is no time to fall down on the job what applies to genius holds equally true for individual acts of foolishness , frustration , incompetence or just plain bad luck . hamburg had been on a hot streak , but in their last match , at home to stuttgart , a referee overlooked a foul that led to the visitors ' first goal .
but defender änis ben-hatira sealed a bad loss for the hosts , when he was red-carded for a challenge that was reckless in anyone 's book .
now hamburg are only two points clear of the drop zone . in a similar vein , defender joe simunic got sent off just seconds after hertha had tied the score in their last game against bielefeld , which subsequently ended in a draw .
a win would have lifted berlin from the thick of the fray . mistakes by opponents can also help teams avoid relegation .
in leverkusen 's last match , defender karim haggui scored an own goal and set up another for opponents bochum with an awful back pass .
the result : bochum moved out of the bottom three . in none of these game-changing moments did teamwork play much of a role .

bayer leverkusen failed to overturn a 3-0 first leg deficit , losing 1-0 to osasuna . germany striker miroslav klose ended his goal drought in style at the weserstadion on thursday with a brace in werder bremen 's 4-1 win over az alkmaar which secured their place in the uefa cup semi-finals where they will meet espanyol .
the polish-born forward scored in the 36th minute to end his barren spell , which dated back to january 31 and lasted 1158 minutes , to add to tim borowski 's opener - which had been pegged back by moussa dembele 's excellent 32nd minute equalizer .
any doubts that werder - who almost put barcelona out in the champions league group stages - would not be in the final four were settled when klose added their third in the 62nd minute .
inspirational brazilian playmaker diego rounded off the scoring against the plucky dutch with a well deserved goal eight minutes from time , hitting home from the edge of the penalty area after playing a neat 1-2 with klose .
confident klose rediscovers his touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose displayed few signs of suffering from his drought werder coach thomas schaaf said the thought had never entered his mind that klose had lost his touch .
" miroslav always trained hard and never lost confidence , " said schaaf .
" his situation was never as catastrophic as people said .
he knew he had not lost his goal scoring talents and today his work paid off . "
the first half came to a boil after borowski netted in the 19th minute , escaping the attentions of an alkmaar defender to latch onto a delightful lobbed ball from diego to shoot into the far corner of the net .
alkmaar were far from cowed and captain and former glasgow rangers striker shota arveladze almost leveled with a splendid lob from outside the area which took a deflection for a corner .
the dutch side , though , did draw level as dembele produced a fierce left footed shot from just outside the box which beat the diving tim wiese in the left hand corner for his fourth goal of the campaign .
it had coach louis van gaal punching the air in delight , but the former barcelona and dutch national coach was not in the same mood when klose got on the end of aaron hunt 's pass across the five-yard line to score his first goal of the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego slams in his goal to make it 4-1 to werder indeed van gaal was in even more of a fury when what looked like a perfectly good goal was disallowed and he had several words with the fourth official over referee mike riley 's decision .
the hosts should have been 3-1 up a minute later as borowski squared the ball from the right but klose was only able to screw the ball over the bar .
the second half was as exciting an affair with werder 's naldo going agonizingly close with a rasping free kick but it was to be klose who closed things down for the german side .
again diego was the architect , the pocket-sized brazilian floating over an inch-perfect cross from the right for klose to send a diving header past the keeper and secure his brace , and bremen 's victory .
lackluster leverkusen crash out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen looked resigned to their fate from the start germany ’ s other uefa cup quarter-finalists bayer leverkusen couldn ’ t overturn the 3-0 deficit racked up in the first leg of their clash against spanish side osasuna and suffered further ignominy by losing the second game 1-0 .
osasuna midfielder juanlu gave the spaniards a deserved win when he steered in past rene adler from close range after the leverkusen keeper had palmed a roberto soldado shot into his path just after the hour .
a poor and lacklustre leverkusen side laboured against their opponents and only fashioned one serious attempt on goal when defender jan-ingwer callsen bracker had a header cleared off the line early in the second half .

bayer leverkusen failed to overturn a 3-0 first leg deficit , losing 1-0 to osasuna . germany striker miroslav klose ended his goal drought in style at the weserstadion on thursday with a brace in werder bremen 's 4-1 win over az alkmaar which secured their place in the uefa cup semi-finals where they will meet espanyol .
the polish-born forward scored in the 36th minute to end his barren spell , which dated back to january 31 and lasted 1158 minutes , to add to tim borowski 's opener - which had been pegged back by moussa dembele 's excellent 32nd minute equalizer .
any doubts that werder - who almost put barcelona out in the champions league group stages - would not be in the final four were settled when klose added their third in the 62nd minute .
inspirational brazilian playmaker diego rounded off the scoring against the plucky dutch with a well deserved goal eight minutes from time , hitting home from the edge of the penalty area after playing a neat 1-2 with klose .
confident klose rediscovers his touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose displayed few signs of suffering from his drought werder coach thomas schaaf said the thought had never entered his mind that klose had lost his touch .
" miroslav always trained hard and never lost confidence , " said schaaf .
" his situation was never as catastrophic as people said .
he knew he had not lost his goal scoring talents and today his work paid off . "
the first half came to a boil after borowski netted in the 19th minute , escaping the attentions of an alkmaar defender to latch onto a delightful lobbed ball from diego to shoot into the far corner of the net .
alkmaar were far from cowed and captain and former glasgow rangers striker shota arveladze almost leveled with a splendid lob from outside the area which took a deflection for a corner .
the dutch side , though , did draw level as dembele produced a fierce left footed shot from just outside the box which beat the diving tim wiese in the left hand corner for his fourth goal of the campaign .
it had coach louis van gaal punching the air in delight , but the former barcelona and dutch national coach was not in the same mood when klose got on the end of aaron hunt 's pass across the five-yard line to score his first goal of the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego slams in his goal to make it 4-1 to werder indeed van gaal was in even more of a fury when what looked like a perfectly good goal was disallowed and he had several words with the fourth official over referee mike riley 's decision .
the hosts should have been 3-1 up a minute later as borowski squared the ball from the right but klose was only able to screw the ball over the bar .
the second half was as exciting an affair with werder 's naldo going agonizingly close with a rasping free kick but it was to be klose who closed things down for the german side .
again diego was the architect , the pocket-sized brazilian floating over an inch-perfect cross from the right for klose to send a diving header past the keeper and secure his brace , and bremen 's victory .
lackluster leverkusen crash out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen looked resigned to their fate from the start germany ’ s other uefa cup quarter-finalists bayer leverkusen couldn ’ t overturn the 3-0 deficit racked up in the first leg of their clash against spanish side osasuna and suffered further ignominy by losing the second game 1-0 .
osasuna midfielder juanlu gave the spaniards a deserved win when he steered in past rene adler from close range after the leverkusen keeper had palmed a roberto soldado shot into his path just after the hour .
a poor and lacklustre leverkusen side laboured against their opponents and only fashioned one serious attempt on goal when defender jan-ingwer callsen bracker had a header cleared off the line early in the second half .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.04.2007 eu urges restraint over turkish talk of kurdish crackdown großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has been clamping down on kurds and pkk supporters at home and abroad the european commission urged turkey on friday to play a " constructive " role in iraq a day after turkey 's army chief called for a military incursion into northern iraq to hunt turkish kurd rebels . " the stability of iraq is in our common interest , " commission spokeswoman krisztina nagy told reporters in brussels .
" the eu recognizes the constructive role turkey plays in the area and in this context it is important that turkey continues to play such a positive role , " she added .
" the eu is following the situation in the region very closely , " said nagy .
" our hope and the interest of all involved is that possible differences are dealt with in a peaceful and constructive manner . "
in a rare press conference at the army headquarters , general yasar buyukanit pushed on thursday for a cross-border operation into northern iraq to crack down on turkish kurd rebels he said had sought refuge there .
general buyukanit said that it was necessary to launch a cross-border military operation against pkk rebels based in northern iraq there , but that this would require political authorization .
" it is necessary to launch an operation into iraq , " buyukanit told reporters .
" the pkk has huge freedom of movement in iraq . "
missions within turkey target returning fighters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish troops in northern iraq in 2005 he also said the military had launched a number of large-scale operations against kurdish rebels in south-east turkey .
buyukanit said the operations had been launched as snow melting in mountain passes made it easier for pkk rebels to enter turkey from neighboring iraq .
turkey has accused iraqi kurds of tolerating , and even backing the kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has waged a bloody campaign for kurdish self-rule in turkey 's southeast since 1984 .
the conflict has claimed some 37,000 lives .
the turkish military has claimed there are around 5,000 pkk guerrillas based in camps in mountainous northern iraq .
ankara says thousands of militants of the pkk enjoy unrestricted movement in northern iraq and are able to obtain weapons and explosives there .
the group is listed as a terrorist group by turkey and much of the international community .
iraqi kurds taking threats very seriously the kurds in northern iraq are taking the threats by the turkish army to launch a military offensive against kurdish rebels seriously , the president of the autonomous kurdish parliament said friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military has clashed with rebels in southern turkey adnan al-mufti told reporters in arbil , northern iraq that " these threats are nothing new for us , we take them seriously . "
he said the authorities in the autonomous kurdish region of northern iraq would seek the support of the iraqi government .
" we want a dialogue , but those responsible in turkey are not ready for one , " al-mufti added .
when asked why the kurdish authorities , who control three provinces in northern iraq , have not taken action against pkk rebels , al-mufti said that " the situation in iraq is altogether too unstable ; therefore we can not take steps against this party . "
the turkish government has repeatedly called on the united states and iraq to launch its own operations against the pkk in northern iraq .
the organization is black-listed as a terrorist organization by both the us and the eu .
on friday the president of the iraqi parliament mahmoud al- mashhadani warned that all those foreign powers that had a hand in iraq 's internal affairs would have " the hand hacked off . "
observers interpreted this statement as referring to the turkish military threats to intervene in northern iraq . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence feeds doubts on turkey 's eu bid on the verge of opening eu accession talks , turkey is facing growing violence from kurdish separatists and growing opposition from within europe , potentially jeopardizing ankara 's bid to join the bloc .

although jung has voiced support for the us scheme , it is not a view that is universally backed within the german cabinet .

he added : " it is vital for world peace .

although jung has voiced support for the us scheme , it is not a view that is universally backed within the german cabinet .

" europe 's foreign ministers should not miss the opportunity of their forthcoming meeting ... to restore the faith of palestinians in the european union , " oxfam international executive director jeremy hobbs said .
the ministers were due to hold their talks on april 23 and 24 in luxembourg .
" despite welcoming the national unity government , the european union has failed to restore aid payments , " he added in a statement from the british charity .
" with palestinian institutions collapsing and insecurity growing , the resumption of international aid to the palestinian authority is a necessary step to preventing further suffering and securing a just and lasting settlement on the basis of international law . "
the eu was the biggest aid donor to the palestinian government until the hamas militants came to power in march 2006 .
the quartet of middle east mediators - the european union , the united states , the united nations and russia - then suspended direct aid to the palestinian authority .
unethical and ineffective , says oxfam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty has increased , says oxfam since then , the 27-nation eu has redirected its aid , worth 700 million euros -lrb- $ 943 million -rrb- in 2006 , through a special mechanism to help the neediest people while bypassing the government to avoid contact with hamas .
hobbs said that suspending aid and withholding tax revenue was both unethical and ineffective as a policy tool .
" parents have been driven into debt , children taken out of classrooms and whole families deprived of access to medicine and healthcare , " he added .
services meltdown a survey commissioned by oxfam from the palestinian center for public opinion -lrb- pcpo -rrb- found that more than four out of five of 677 families interviewed have seen a drop in their income following the boycott .
half of all the families reported losing more than half their income , a statement from oxfam said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worsening factional violence has made the streets even more dangerous " the number of palestinian people living in poverty has jumped by 30 percent , essential services are facing meltdown , and previously unknown levels of factional violence plague palestinian streets , " the survey said .
ninety percent of the senior managers running schools , hospitals and water services across the west bank and gaza reported that services had been undermined by the boycott .
" the national unity government remains a fragile creation that could collapse without financial support , leading to even greater insecurity , " the report said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.04.2007 eu panel backs plans to cap mobile roaming rates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone companies make much of their money from high roaming costs european union plans to cap the price operators can charge mobile phone users while abroad cleared a key hurdle on thursday when a panel in the european parliament backed the package . despite fierce lobbying from mobile phone operators , the parliament 's industry committee massively supported plans to cap the price of calls made abroad in the eu at 40 cents per minute and 15 cents -lrb- $ 0.54 and $ 0.20 -rrb- for calls received abroad .
the committee 's backing sets the stage for a vote before the full parliament in a plenary session on may 10 in brussels and a final decision by eu telecoms ministers on june 7 in luxembourg .
" we are sending a very clear message to the consumers and telecom operators , " said the bill 's rapporteur , austrian conservative paul ruedig .
" it 's a good basis for our deliberations . "
the plans as adopted by the panel go even farther in the favor of consumers than original propositions from the european commission , which had proposed a 44-cent ceiling on outgoing calls made abroad in the eu and a 15-cent cap on incoming calls .
protecting consumers the eu 's executive arm hopes to see so-called roaming charges fall by as much as 70 percent , thanks to its plans to cap what operators charge customers at the retail level and what they charge each other at the wholesale level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu consumers could benefit from the price caps this summer already the commission drew up the plans to regulate roaming rates last year after finding evidence of huge variations between operators ' prices with roaming calls costing some times up to six times those of local mobile calls .
eu telecoms commissioner viviane reding , who has led the drive for regulation of roaming rates , hailed the committee 's support for her plans as " very good news for europe 's consumers . "
the beuc european consumers association said that while the plans " go in the right direction , " the price caps " are still too high and should be readjusted based on real costs . "
reding is aiming for the package to go into effect in summer so consumers can benefit from lower prices during the holidays abroad , although some eu lawmakers have said its application might not come until the autumn .
" in view of the emerging consensus on the new rules , an early entry into force of the eu roaming regulation is now a very realistic possibility , " she added .
industry up in arms the package has the industry , which argues that fierce competition has already driven down prices , up in arms and it has been lobbying hard to get the plans watered down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone companies can expect the caps to hurt the gsma trade association said that " retail price regulation is inappropriate and unprecedented on the basis of the principles of a market economy . "
it charged that the plans " will force european mobile operators to offer roaming services at below cost and give them no scope to compete with each other on price and on new services . "
the organization has been lobbying for a ceiling of at least 65 cents for outgoing calls abroad and 35 cents for incoming calls .
with roaming charges generating on average 10 percent of operators revenues , reding acknowledged that the regulations would prove to be painful for operators and would probably provoke a " correction " in the share prices . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bahn , vodafone team up on mobile payment scheme global wireless company vodafone will make a fresh foray into the micro-banking business , testing a mobile payment system in partnership with deutsche bahn , the companies announced at the weekend .

the committee 's backing sets the stage for a vote before the full parliament in a plenary session on may 10 in brussels and a final decision by eu telecoms ministers on june 7 in luxembourg .
" we are sending a very clear message to the consumers and telecom operators , " said the bill 's rapporteur , austrian conservative paul ruedig .
" it 's a good basis for our deliberations . "
the plans as adopted by the panel go even farther in the favor of consumers than original propositions from the european commission , which had proposed a 44-cent ceiling on outgoing calls made abroad in the eu and a 15-cent cap on incoming calls .
protecting consumers the eu 's executive arm hopes to see so-called roaming charges fall by as much as 70 percent , thanks to its plans to cap what operators charge customers at the retail level and what they charge each other at the wholesale level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu consumers could benefit from the price caps this summer already the commission drew up the plans to regulate roaming rates last year after finding evidence of huge variations between operators ' prices with roaming calls costing some times up to six times those of local mobile calls .

the beuc european consumers association said that while the plans " go in the right direction , " the price caps " are still too high and should be readjusted based on real costs . "
reding is aiming for the package to go into effect in summer so consumers can benefit from lower prices during the holidays abroad , although some eu lawmakers have said its application might not come until the autumn .
" in view of the emerging consensus on the new rules , an early entry into force of the eu roaming regulation is now a very realistic possibility , " she added .
industry up in arms the package has the industry , which argues that fierce competition has already driven down prices , up in arms and it has been lobbying hard to get the plans watered down .

it charged that the plans " will force european mobile operators to offer roaming services at below cost and give them no scope to compete with each other on price and on new services . "
the organization has been lobbying for a ceiling of at least 65 cents for outgoing calls abroad and 35 cents for incoming calls .
with roaming charges generating on average 10 percent of operators revenues , reding acknowledged that the regulations would prove to be painful for operators and would probably provoke a " correction " in the share prices . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bahn , vodafone team up on mobile payment scheme global wireless company vodafone will make a fresh foray into the micro-banking business , testing a mobile payment system in partnership with deutsche bahn , the companies announced at the weekend .

the committee 's backing sets the stage for a vote before the full parliament in a plenary session on may 10 in brussels and a final decision by eu telecoms ministers on june 7 in luxembourg .
" we are sending a very clear message to the consumers and telecom operators , " said the bill 's rapporteur , austrian conservative paul ruedig .
" it 's a good basis for our deliberations . "
the plans as adopted by the panel go even farther in the favor of consumers than original propositions from the european commission , which had proposed a 44-cent ceiling on outgoing calls made abroad in the eu and a 15-cent cap on incoming calls .
protecting consumers the eu 's executive arm hopes to see so-called roaming charges fall by as much as 70 percent , thanks to its plans to cap what operators charge customers at the retail level and what they charge each other at the wholesale level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu consumers could benefit from the price caps this summer already the commission drew up the plans to regulate roaming rates last year after finding evidence of huge variations between operators ' prices with roaming calls costing some times up to six times those of local mobile calls .
eu telecoms commissioner viviane reding , who has led the drive for regulation of roaming rates , hailed the committee 's support for her plans as " very good news for europe 's consumers . "
the beuc european consumers association said that while the plans " go in the right direction , " the price caps " are still too high and should be readjusted based on real costs . "
reding is aiming for the package to go into effect in summer so consumers can benefit from lower prices during the holidays abroad , although some eu lawmakers have said its application might not come until the autumn .
" in view of the emerging consensus on the new rules , an early entry into force of the eu roaming regulation is now a very realistic possibility , " she added .
industry up in arms the package has the industry , which argues that fierce competition has already driven down prices , up in arms and it has been lobbying hard to get the plans watered down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone companies can expect the caps to hurt the gsma trade association said that " retail price regulation is inappropriate and unprecedented on the basis of the principles of a market economy . "
it charged that the plans " will force european mobile operators to offer roaming services at below cost and give them no scope to compete with each other on price and on new services . "
the organization has been lobbying for a ceiling of at least 65 cents for outgoing calls abroad and 35 cents for incoming calls .
with roaming charges generating on average 10 percent of operators revenues , reding acknowledged that the regulations would prove to be painful for operators and would probably provoke a " correction " in the share prices . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bahn , vodafone team up on mobile payment scheme global wireless company vodafone will make a fresh foray into the micro-banking business , testing a mobile payment system in partnership with deutsche bahn , the companies announced at the weekend .

" two days ago we asked the estonian authorities for a permit to measure the depth of the sea in estonian waters , " she added , according to baltic news service bns .
estonian sources contacted by deutsche presse-agentur dpa confirmed that an informal application has been received , but that more details would be needed before any permit could be issued .
" nord stream have to explain the purpose of the study : what they intend to do , the timetable and what they will need , " ehtel halliste , spokeswoman for the estonian foreign office , told dpa .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war two .
threat of environmental disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one is really sure where the undersea arms dumps are such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment , stroebaek said .
given estonian fears , any routing of the pipeline through estonian waters is likely to be welcomed in tallinn .
" if such an idea were to appear , it means we would automatically be part of the environmental impact assessment scheme , " gromov pointed out .
but the planned pipeline could equally meet with political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .

the fact that the project - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - was negotiated by the two states without consulting the countries between them created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
and in recent months russia has harshly criticized estonian plans to move a red army monument from the centre of tallinn to a less prominent location - leaving many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
whatever the economic and political arguments , the pipeline 's route is likely to take some time to confirm .
according to halliste , once the estonian maritime agency receives an official application , it will have up to four months to decide on issuing a permit .
" when we have the permit from the estonian authorities , the measurement of the sea 's depth will take a few weeks .

" two days ago we asked the estonian authorities for a permit to measure the depth of the sea in estonian waters , " she added , according to baltic news service bns .
estonian sources contacted by deutsche presse-agentur dpa confirmed that an informal application has been received , but that more details would be needed before any permit could be issued .
" nord stream have to explain the purpose of the study : what they intend to do , the timetable and what they will need , " ehtel halliste , spokeswoman for the estonian foreign office , told dpa .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war two .
threat of environmental disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one is really sure where the undersea arms dumps are such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment , stroebaek said .
given estonian fears , any routing of the pipeline through estonian waters is likely to be welcomed in tallinn .
" if such an idea were to appear , it means we would automatically be part of the environmental impact assessment scheme , " gromov pointed out .
but the planned pipeline could equally meet with political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
eu 's eastern neighbors get nervous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas stand-off made everyone in europe jittery as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
the fact that the project - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - was negotiated by the two states without consulting the countries between them created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
and in recent months russia has harshly criticized estonian plans to move a red army monument from the centre of tallinn to a less prominent location - leaving many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
whatever the economic and political arguments , the pipeline 's route is likely to take some time to confirm .
according to halliste , once the estonian maritime agency receives an official application , it will have up to four months to decide on issuing a permit .
" when we have the permit from the estonian authorities , the measurement of the sea 's depth will take a few weeks .

" the stability of iraq is in our common interest , " commission spokeswoman krisztina nagy told reporters in brussels .
" the eu recognizes the constructive role turkey plays in the area and in this context it is important that turkey continues to play such a positive role , " she added .
" the eu is following the situation in the region very closely , " said nagy .
" our hope and the interest of all involved is that possible differences are dealt with in a peaceful and constructive manner . "
in a rare press conference at the army headquarters , general yasar buyukanit pushed on thursday for a cross-border operation into northern iraq to crack down on turkish kurd rebels he said had sought refuge there .
general buyukanit said that it was necessary to launch a cross-border military operation against pkk rebels based in northern iraq there , but that this would require political authorization .
" it is necessary to launch an operation into iraq , " buyukanit told reporters .
" the pkk has huge freedom of movement in iraq . "
missions within turkey target returning fighters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish troops in northern iraq in 2005 he also said the military had launched a number of large-scale operations against kurdish rebels in south-east turkey .
buyukanit said the operations had been launched as snow melting in mountain passes made it easier for pkk rebels to enter turkey from neighboring iraq .
turkey has accused iraqi kurds of tolerating , and even backing the kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has waged a bloody campaign for kurdish self-rule in turkey 's southeast since 1984 .
the conflict has claimed some 37,000 lives .
the turkish military has claimed there are around 5,000 pkk guerrillas based in camps in mountainous northern iraq .

the group is listed as a terrorist group by turkey and much of the international community .

he said the authorities in the autonomous kurdish region of northern iraq would seek the support of the iraqi government .
" we want a dialogue , but those responsible in turkey are not ready for one , " al-mufti added .
when asked why the kurdish authorities , who control three provinces in northern iraq , have not taken action against pkk rebels , al-mufti said that " the situation in iraq is altogether too unstable ; therefore we can not take steps against this party . "
the turkish government has repeatedly called on the united states and iraq to launch its own operations against the pkk in northern iraq .
the organization is black-listed as a terrorist organization by both the us and the eu .

bayer leverkusen failed to overturn a 3-0 first leg deficit , losing 1-0 to osasuna . germany striker miroslav klose ended his goal drought in style at the weserstadion on thursday with a brace in werder bremen 's 4-1 win over az alkmaar which secured their place in the uefa cup semi-finals where they will meet espanyol .
the polish-born forward scored in the 36th minute to end his barren spell , which dated back to january 31 and lasted 1158 minutes , to add to tim borowski 's opener - which had been pegged back by moussa dembele 's excellent 32nd minute equalizer .
any doubts that werder - who almost put barcelona out in the champions league group stages - would not be in the final four were settled when klose added their third in the 62nd minute .
inspirational brazilian playmaker diego rounded off the scoring against the plucky dutch with a well deserved goal eight minutes from time , hitting home from the edge of the penalty area after playing a neat 1-2 with klose .
confident klose rediscovers his touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose displayed few signs of suffering from his drought werder coach thomas schaaf said the thought had never entered his mind that klose had lost his touch .
" miroslav always trained hard and never lost confidence , " said schaaf .
" his situation was never as catastrophic as people said .
he knew he had not lost his goal scoring talents and today his work paid off . "
the first half came to a boil after borowski netted in the 19th minute , escaping the attentions of an alkmaar defender to latch onto a delightful lobbed ball from diego to shoot into the far corner of the net .
alkmaar were far from cowed and captain and former glasgow rangers striker shota arveladze almost leveled with a splendid lob from outside the area which took a deflection for a corner .
the dutch side , though , did draw level as dembele produced a fierce left footed shot from just outside the box which beat the diving tim wiese in the left hand corner for his fourth goal of the campaign .
it had coach louis van gaal punching the air in delight , but the former barcelona and dutch national coach was not in the same mood when klose got on the end of aaron hunt 's pass across the five-yard line to score his first goal of the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego slams in his goal to make it 4-1 to werder indeed van gaal was in even more of a fury when what looked like a perfectly good goal was disallowed and he had several words with the fourth official over referee mike riley 's decision .
the hosts should have been 3-1 up a minute later as borowski squared the ball from the right but klose was only able to screw the ball over the bar .
the second half was as exciting an affair with werder 's naldo going agonizingly close with a rasping free kick but it was to be klose who closed things down for the german side .
again diego was the architect , the pocket-sized brazilian floating over an inch-perfect cross from the right for klose to send a diving header past the keeper and secure his brace , and bremen 's victory .
lackluster leverkusen crash out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen looked resigned to their fate from the start germany ’ s other uefa cup quarter-finalists bayer leverkusen couldn ’ t overturn the 3-0 deficit racked up in the first leg of their clash against spanish side osasuna and suffered further ignominy by losing the second game 1-0 .
osasuna midfielder juanlu gave the spaniards a deserved win when he steered in past rene adler from close range after the leverkusen keeper had palmed a roberto soldado shot into his path just after the hour .
a poor and lacklustre leverkusen side laboured against their opponents and only fashioned one serious attempt on goal when defender jan-ingwer callsen bracker had a header cleared off the line early in the second half .

"
asked about the us plan to install part of the anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic , jung said : " i think it is good that in nato , as with the nato-russia council , we are working together to assuage possible doubts " .
although jung has voiced support for the us scheme , it is not a view that is universally backed within the german cabinet .
but he did insist it was important for the west " to work on a partnership basis with russia " on the matter , he added .
russia should be convinced of the argument so as " to reach an agreement for the protection of populations , for european populations in particular , " he said .
protective measure ? the united states has asked the czech republic to host a radar system and poland to host interceptor rockets as part of its missile defense plans .
washington insists the anti-missile shield is intended as protection against attacks from " rogue states " such as iran .
it points out that the proposed system would be useless against russia 's vast weapons arsenal .
but russia 's president vladimir putin has said it could spark a new arms race and that it was a needless distraction from the fight against terrorism .
preventing a nuclear iran jung also told the european deputies that every possible diplomatic effort should be made " to prevent iran from equipping itself with nuclear arms " .
he added : " it is vital for world peace .
the united states , russia , europe and china must work together . "
president putin had been very clear on one point , he continued . " it is also in russia 's interests that iran does not possess atomic weapons , " jung said .
on april 19 , at nato 's brussels headquarters , the 26 nato allies - including 21 eu member states - will discuss the anti-missile system in the north atlantic council and then with russia at a nato-russia meeting .
russia still critical putin has strongly criticized the plans for the us missile defesce system .
" why is it necessary to put military infrastructure on our border ?
it 's hardly connected to today 's global threats .
what is the real threat ?
terrorism , " putin told a security conference in munich in february .
that speech marked a further worsening of relations between moscow and washington under putin , who has tried to restore russia 's prestige since the economic collapse that followed the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nukes still a threat 50 years after first peace declaration the scientists who signed the göttinger declaration on april 12 , 1957 weren ’ t able to keep nuclear weapons from being stationed in germany .

we examine why the bundesliga has taken such a surreal turn and how individual performances , not team spirit , may determine some clubs ' fortunes . in one respect , the bundesliga has followed its normal pattern this season .
with six games left , a handful of teams are fighting for the title while a couple of others are in the hunt for international competitions . but the top clubs have actually under-performed - with 56 points , table-toppers schalke would have only been in fourth place at this point last year .
and points lost at the top get redistributed down to the bundesliga 's lower rungs . the result is huge mass of mediocrity and an intriguing situation .
the relegation candidates - defined as any team two games or fewer away from the bottom three - now starts at seventh in the table . this unprecedented constellation may give the lie to the old adage that relegation fights are won and lost as a team .
although collective willingness to fight remains crucial , individual creativity - or blundering - could determine who gets to remain in the first division . from flop to top in ten minutes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head to head match-ups are key late in the season case in point : the team that currently occupies the seventh spot in the table - wolfsburg . in their last match , wolfsburg were behind 2-1 , and opponents mainz were riding out what appeared to be a safe victory against a relegation rival . then in the 80th minute , the wolves ' eccentric brazilian playmaker marcelinho fired an out-of-the-blue blast from just outside of the box into the upper left-hand corner of goal . not content with having salvaged a point , marcelinho scored a nearly identical goal seven minutes later from 20 meters out to secure the unlikely 3-2 win . two individual moments of brilliance dramatically altered the table .
without marcelinho 's goals , wolfsburg would be 14th and mainz , currently next-to-last , 13th in the standings . the headlines after the match summed it up : " marcelinho saves the wolves . " to err is stupid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a relegation fight is no time to fall down on the job what applies to genius holds equally true for individual acts of foolishness , frustration , incompetence or just plain bad luck . hamburg had been on a hot streak , but in their last match , at home to stuttgart , a referee overlooked a foul that led to the visitors ' first goal .
but defender änis ben-hatira sealed a bad loss for the hosts , when he was red-carded for a challenge that was reckless in anyone 's book .
now hamburg are only two points clear of the drop zone . in a similar vein , defender joe simunic got sent off just seconds after hertha had tied the score in their last game against bielefeld , which subsequently ended in a draw .
a win would have lifted berlin from the thick of the fray . mistakes by opponents can also help teams avoid relegation .
in leverkusen 's last match , defender karim haggui scored an own goal and set up another for opponents bochum with an awful back pass .
the result : bochum moved out of the bottom three . in none of these game-changing moments did teamwork play much of a role .
so it will be interesting to follow which players emerge as heroes and which as goats in the wild weeks remaining this season . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de götz gone as hertha prepare to fight relegation hertha berlin were in fifth place at the break , but since then they compiled the worst record in the bundesliga .

" the stability of iraq is in our common interest , " commission spokeswoman krisztina nagy told reporters in brussels .
" the eu recognizes the constructive role turkey plays in the area and in this context it is important that turkey continues to play such a positive role , " she added .
" the eu is following the situation in the region very closely , " said nagy .
" our hope and the interest of all involved is that possible differences are dealt with in a peaceful and constructive manner . "
in a rare press conference at the army headquarters , general yasar buyukanit pushed on thursday for a cross-border operation into northern iraq to crack down on turkish kurd rebels he said had sought refuge there .
general buyukanit said that it was necessary to launch a cross-border military operation against pkk rebels based in northern iraq there , but that this would require political authorization .
" it is necessary to launch an operation into iraq , " buyukanit told reporters .
" the pkk has huge freedom of movement in iraq . "
missions within turkey target returning fighters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish troops in northern iraq in 2005 he also said the military had launched a number of large-scale operations against kurdish rebels in south-east turkey .
buyukanit said the operations had been launched as snow melting in mountain passes made it easier for pkk rebels to enter turkey from neighboring iraq .
turkey has accused iraqi kurds of tolerating , and even backing the kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has waged a bloody campaign for kurdish self-rule in turkey 's southeast since 1984 .
the conflict has claimed some 37,000 lives .
the turkish military has claimed there are around 5,000 pkk guerrillas based in camps in mountainous northern iraq .
ankara says thousands of militants of the pkk enjoy unrestricted movement in northern iraq and are able to obtain weapons and explosives there .
the group is listed as a terrorist group by turkey and much of the international community .
iraqi kurds taking threats very seriously the kurds in northern iraq are taking the threats by the turkish army to launch a military offensive against kurdish rebels seriously , the president of the autonomous kurdish parliament said friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military has clashed with rebels in southern turkey adnan al-mufti told reporters in arbil , northern iraq that " these threats are nothing new for us , we take them seriously . "
he said the authorities in the autonomous kurdish region of northern iraq would seek the support of the iraqi government .
" we want a dialogue , but those responsible in turkey are not ready for one , " al-mufti added .
when asked why the kurdish authorities , who control three provinces in northern iraq , have not taken action against pkk rebels , al-mufti said that " the situation in iraq is altogether too unstable ; therefore we can not take steps against this party . "
the turkish government has repeatedly called on the united states and iraq to launch its own operations against the pkk in northern iraq .
the organization is black-listed as a terrorist organization by both the us and the eu .
on friday the president of the iraqi parliament mahmoud al- mashhadani warned that all those foreign powers that had a hand in iraq 's internal affairs would have " the hand hacked off . "

the committee 's backing sets the stage for a vote before the full parliament in a plenary session on may 10 in brussels and a final decision by eu telecoms ministers on june 7 in luxembourg .
" we are sending a very clear message to the consumers and telecom operators , " said the bill 's rapporteur , austrian conservative paul ruedig .
" it 's a good basis for our deliberations . "
the plans as adopted by the panel go even farther in the favor of consumers than original propositions from the european commission , which had proposed a 44-cent ceiling on outgoing calls made abroad in the eu and a 15-cent cap on incoming calls .
protecting consumers the eu 's executive arm hopes to see so-called roaming charges fall by as much as 70 percent , thanks to its plans to cap what operators charge customers at the retail level and what they charge each other at the wholesale level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu consumers could benefit from the price caps this summer already the commission drew up the plans to regulate roaming rates last year after finding evidence of huge variations between operators ' prices with roaming calls costing some times up to six times those of local mobile calls .
eu telecoms commissioner viviane reding , who has led the drive for regulation of roaming rates , hailed the committee 's support for her plans as " very good news for europe 's consumers . "
the beuc european consumers association said that while the plans " go in the right direction , " the price caps " are still too high and should be readjusted based on real costs . "
reding is aiming for the package to go into effect in summer so consumers can benefit from lower prices during the holidays abroad , although some eu lawmakers have said its application might not come until the autumn .
" in view of the emerging consensus on the new rules , an early entry into force of the eu roaming regulation is now a very realistic possibility , " she added .
industry up in arms the package has the industry , which argues that fierce competition has already driven down prices , up in arms and it has been lobbying hard to get the plans watered down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone companies can expect the caps to hurt the gsma trade association said that " retail price regulation is inappropriate and unprecedented on the basis of the principles of a market economy . "
it charged that the plans " will force european mobile operators to offer roaming services at below cost and give them no scope to compete with each other on price and on new services . "
the organization has been lobbying for a ceiling of at least 65 cents for outgoing calls abroad and 35 cents for incoming calls .
with roaming charges generating on average 10 percent of operators revenues , reding acknowledged that the regulations would prove to be painful for operators and would probably provoke a " correction " in the share prices . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bahn , vodafone team up on mobile payment scheme global wireless company vodafone will make a fresh foray into the micro-banking business , testing a mobile payment system in partnership with deutsche bahn , the companies announced at the weekend .

"
asked about the us plan to install part of the anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic , jung said : " i think it is good that in nato , as with the nato-russia council , we are working together to assuage possible doubts " .
although jung has voiced support for the us scheme , it is not a view that is universally backed within the german cabinet .
but he did insist it was important for the west " to work on a partnership basis with russia " on the matter , he added .
russia should be convinced of the argument so as " to reach an agreement for the protection of populations , for european populations in particular , " he said .
protective measure ? the united states has asked the czech republic to host a radar system and poland to host interceptor rockets as part of its missile defense plans .
washington insists the anti-missile shield is intended as protection against attacks from " rogue states " such as iran .
it points out that the proposed system would be useless against russia 's vast weapons arsenal .
but russia 's president vladimir putin has said it could spark a new arms race and that it was a needless distraction from the fight against terrorism .
preventing a nuclear iran jung also told the european deputies that every possible diplomatic effort should be made " to prevent iran from equipping itself with nuclear arms " .
he added : " it is vital for world peace .
the united states , russia , europe and china must work together . "
president putin had been very clear on one point , he continued . " it is also in russia 's interests that iran does not possess atomic weapons , " jung said .
on april 19 , at nato 's brussels headquarters , the 26 nato allies - including 21 eu member states - will discuss the anti-missile system in the north atlantic council and then with russia at a nato-russia meeting .
russia still critical putin has strongly criticized the plans for the us missile defesce system .
" why is it necessary to put military infrastructure on our border ?
it 's hardly connected to today 's global threats .
what is the real threat ?

" two days ago we asked the estonian authorities for a permit to measure the depth of the sea in estonian waters , " she added , according to baltic news service bns .
estonian sources contacted by deutsche presse-agentur dpa confirmed that an informal application has been received , but that more details would be needed before any permit could be issued .
" nord stream have to explain the purpose of the study : what they intend to do , the timetable and what they will need , " ehtel halliste , spokeswoman for the estonian foreign office , told dpa .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war two .
threat of environmental disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one is really sure where the undersea arms dumps are such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment , stroebaek said .
given estonian fears , any routing of the pipeline through estonian waters is likely to be welcomed in tallinn .
" if such an idea were to appear , it means we would automatically be part of the environmental impact assessment scheme , " gromov pointed out .
but the planned pipeline could equally meet with political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
eu 's eastern neighbors get nervous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas stand-off made everyone in europe jittery as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
the fact that the project - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - was negotiated by the two states without consulting the countries between them created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
and in recent months russia has harshly criticized estonian plans to move a red army monument from the centre of tallinn to a less prominent location - leaving many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
whatever the economic and political arguments , the pipeline 's route is likely to take some time to confirm .
according to halliste , once the estonian maritime agency receives an official application , it will have up to four months to decide on issuing a permit .
" when we have the permit from the estonian authorities , the measurement of the sea 's depth will take a few weeks .
we hope we will be ready to say whether we are going to estonia or not in late summer or early autumn , " stroebaek added . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltic sea pipeline consortium considers alternate routes the german-russian consortium planning a major gas pipeline in the baltic sea said it would investigate alternate routes for the project amid concerns that construction could disrupt the environment .

" two days ago we asked the estonian authorities for a permit to measure the depth of the sea in estonian waters , " she added , according to baltic news service bns .
estonian sources contacted by deutsche presse-agentur dpa confirmed that an informal application has been received , but that more details would be needed before any permit could be issued .
" nord stream have to explain the purpose of the study : what they intend to do , the timetable and what they will need , " ehtel halliste , spokeswoman for the estonian foreign office , told dpa .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war two .
threat of environmental disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one is really sure where the undersea arms dumps are such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment , stroebaek said .
given estonian fears , any routing of the pipeline through estonian waters is likely to be welcomed in tallinn .
" if such an idea were to appear , it means we would automatically be part of the environmental impact assessment scheme , " gromov pointed out .
but the planned pipeline could equally meet with political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .

the fact that the project - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - was negotiated by the two states without consulting the countries between them created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
and in recent months russia has harshly criticized estonian plans to move a red army monument from the centre of tallinn to a less prominent location - leaving many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
whatever the economic and political arguments , the pipeline 's route is likely to take some time to confirm .
according to halliste , once the estonian maritime agency receives an official application , it will have up to four months to decide on issuing a permit .
" when we have the permit from the estonian authorities , the measurement of the sea 's depth will take a few weeks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.04.2007 german solar boom shines its light on depressed east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one study says by 2020 , more people could work in solar and related branches than in the car industry german accounts for 55 percent of global solar electricity production and is the world 's market leader .
one of the main benefactors of the solar boom is eastern germany , which has long been under an economic shadow . although germans are renowned for spending much of their six weeks of annual vacation in sunnier climes to escape the frequent gray skies and rain of home , solar energy is turning out to be one of the country 's fastest-growing sectors and could be the light at the end of the tunnel for the struggling east .
the eastern city of frankfurt an der oder is turning into one of the main beneficiaries of the solar upsurge , with three solar production facilities planned for the region .
one , being built by the green energy company conergy , is scheduled to go online in october or november .
inside the shell of a chip factory that never got off the ground another in a long string of economic disappointments for the region workers are busy putting in machines that cut and clean silicon .
when up and running toward the end of this year , conergy hopes to produce about 1.2 million photovoltaic modules , which convert the sun 's energy into electricity , per year and employ around 600 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a welder at the conergy plant in frankfurt an der oder for frankfurt , which symbolizes the economic woes of eastern germany in the wake of reunification , the news of new jobs was like bread for the starving .
" we had a job forum in december , where we and the other two solar companies presented ourselves , " said andreas von brandemer , the plant director at this new location .
" afterwards we had 5,000 people applying for a job in our factory .
the hr people had a lot to do . "
only 100 jobs were on offer at the time , although von brandermer says if all goes to plan , conergy hopes to build a second factory in the city in 2009 and will employ around 1,000 .
germany 's biggest solar company , bonn-based solarworld , is also expanding its presence in the east .
expansion plans at its state-of-the-art production facility in freiburg , in the eastern state of saxony , have a price tag in the hundreds of millions of euros .
" solar valley " eastern germany is attractive so many solar players that it 's been dubbed , perhaps inevitably , " solar valley . "
it is attractive to investors for several reasons : wages in the east are lower then they are in western germany ; massive investment in the years since reunification means the infrastructure is excellent ; and eastern german cities have been generous with tax incentives to lure companies .
but another important reason for potential investors has been the hometown workforce .
frankfurt an der oder was the home of east germany 's semiconductor industry .
the region already has a skilled workforce , although many of those who used to work in the gdr-era semiconductor industry have been out of work for years or been forced to enter different industries .
many are ready to return .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels in the eastern state of brandenburg " so you already have a lot of skilled , knowledgeable workers in the field of handling silicon and that 's a major point for companies considering investing in eastern germany , " said nicholas dobrott , director of renewable energies for the industrial investment council .
andreas kritzski is one of them .
he worked in frankfurt 's semiconductor factory in the gdr era , but lost his job with the plant closed .
he entered retraining programs in construction , did some work in western germany , then lost other jobs as firms folded .
he was out of work for several years before starting at conergy about a month ago .
" the recovery is finally coming , like it was announced all those years ago , " he said .
" people are sending in their applications and waiting excitedly .
like i did , a lot of looking on the internet to find out how solar energy works . "
enough sun although it might be counterintuitive , photovoltaic cells can operate just fine under cloudy skies , since despite the grayness of a rainy day , there is still solar radiation in the air , otherwise it would be dark .
while the sunniest spots in the world , like the sahara desert , have a solar energy potential of about two thousand kilowatt hours per square meter per year , germany 's manages a respectable one thousand , according to henner weithöner of solarpraxis , a company that tracks germany 's solar sector .
" this shows how much even germany or parts of northern europe , how much solar energy we have and what huge potential , " he said .
" we just have to use it . "
germans ' general environmental consciousness has also helped the country take the solar lead .
the green party is a strong presence on the political stage , having been part of the previous governing coalition headed by chancellor gerhard schröder .
renewables law experts say that that administration 's passage of the renewable energies law in 2000 was the momentum behind the current solar surge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge solar facility near the eastern city of leipzig with around 33.500 solar modules the legislation committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 .
it set up generous rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid , and created a market for solar energy .
last year , the solar industry had sales of 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- and employs 53,000 .
according to a report in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , a study carried out by the munich-based consulting firm roland berger estimates that by 2020 , more people could be employed in the environment-related sector than are in the auto industry and engineering .
there are still hurdles to be overcome , especially around the issue of price , and bringing it down .
estimates are that electricity from photovoltaics still needs ten years to become competitive with energy from traditional sources like coal or nuclear .
but solar companies are n't waiting .
they are continuing to invest , counting on technology to eventually bring those prices down .
" if you build up a solar company , lots of manpower is needed , " said weithöner of solarpraxis .
" it is a real job engine for the eastern states .

we examine why the bundesliga has taken such a surreal turn and how individual performances , not team spirit , may determine some clubs ' fortunes . in one respect , the bundesliga has followed its normal pattern this season .
with six games left , a handful of teams are fighting for the title while a couple of others are in the hunt for international competitions . but the top clubs have actually under-performed - with 56 points , table-toppers schalke would have only been in fourth place at this point last year .
and points lost at the top get redistributed down to the bundesliga 's lower rungs . the result is huge mass of mediocrity and an intriguing situation .
the relegation candidates - defined as any team two games or fewer away from the bottom three - now starts at seventh in the table . this unprecedented constellation may give the lie to the old adage that relegation fights are won and lost as a team .

we examine why the bundesliga has taken such a surreal turn and how individual performances , not team spirit , may determine some clubs ' fortunes . in one respect , the bundesliga has followed its normal pattern this season .
with six games left , a handful of teams are fighting for the title while a couple of others are in the hunt for international competitions . but the top clubs have actually under-performed - with 56 points , table-toppers schalke would have only been in fourth place at this point last year .
and points lost at the top get redistributed down to the bundesliga 's lower rungs . the result is huge mass of mediocrity and an intriguing situation .
the relegation candidates - defined as any team two games or fewer away from the bottom three - now starts at seventh in the table . this unprecedented constellation may give the lie to the old adage that relegation fights are won and lost as a team .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.04.2007 eu urges restraint over turkish talk of kurdish crackdown großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has been clamping down on kurds and pkk supporters at home and abroad the european commission urged turkey on friday to play a " constructive " role in iraq a day after turkey 's army chief called for a military incursion into northern iraq to hunt turkish kurd rebels . " the stability of iraq is in our common interest , " commission spokeswoman krisztina nagy told reporters in brussels .
" the eu recognizes the constructive role turkey plays in the area and in this context it is important that turkey continues to play such a positive role , " she added .
" the eu is following the situation in the region very closely , " said nagy .
" our hope and the interest of all involved is that possible differences are dealt with in a peaceful and constructive manner . "
in a rare press conference at the army headquarters , general yasar buyukanit pushed on thursday for a cross-border operation into northern iraq to crack down on turkish kurd rebels he said had sought refuge there .
general buyukanit said that it was necessary to launch a cross-border military operation against pkk rebels based in northern iraq there , but that this would require political authorization .
" it is necessary to launch an operation into iraq , " buyukanit told reporters .
" the pkk has huge freedom of movement in iraq . "
missions within turkey target returning fighters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish troops in northern iraq in 2005 he also said the military had launched a number of large-scale operations against kurdish rebels in south-east turkey .
buyukanit said the operations had been launched as snow melting in mountain passes made it easier for pkk rebels to enter turkey from neighboring iraq .
turkey has accused iraqi kurds of tolerating , and even backing the kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has waged a bloody campaign for kurdish self-rule in turkey 's southeast since 1984 .
the conflict has claimed some 37,000 lives .
the turkish military has claimed there are around 5,000 pkk guerrillas based in camps in mountainous northern iraq .
ankara says thousands of militants of the pkk enjoy unrestricted movement in northern iraq and are able to obtain weapons and explosives there .
the group is listed as a terrorist group by turkey and much of the international community .
iraqi kurds taking threats very seriously the kurds in northern iraq are taking the threats by the turkish army to launch a military offensive against kurdish rebels seriously , the president of the autonomous kurdish parliament said friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military has clashed with rebels in southern turkey adnan al-mufti told reporters in arbil , northern iraq that " these threats are nothing new for us , we take them seriously . "
he said the authorities in the autonomous kurdish region of northern iraq would seek the support of the iraqi government .
" we want a dialogue , but those responsible in turkey are not ready for one , " al-mufti added .
when asked why the kurdish authorities , who control three provinces in northern iraq , have not taken action against pkk rebels , al-mufti said that " the situation in iraq is altogether too unstable ; therefore we can not take steps against this party . "
the turkish government has repeatedly called on the united states and iraq to launch its own operations against the pkk in northern iraq .
the organization is black-listed as a terrorist organization by both the us and the eu .
on friday the president of the iraqi parliament mahmoud al- mashhadani warned that all those foreign powers that had a hand in iraq 's internal affairs would have " the hand hacked off . "
observers interpreted this statement as referring to the turkish military threats to intervene in northern iraq . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence feeds doubts on turkey 's eu bid on the verge of opening eu accession talks , turkey is facing growing violence from kurdish separatists and growing opposition from within europe , potentially jeopardizing ankara 's bid to join the bloc .

" europe 's foreign ministers should not miss the opportunity of their forthcoming meeting ... to restore the faith of palestinians in the european union , " oxfam international executive director jeremy hobbs said .
the ministers were due to hold their talks on april 23 and 24 in luxembourg .
" despite welcoming the national unity government , the european union has failed to restore aid payments , " he added in a statement from the british charity .
" with palestinian institutions collapsing and insecurity growing , the resumption of international aid to the palestinian authority is a necessary step to preventing further suffering and securing a just and lasting settlement on the basis of international law . "
the eu was the biggest aid donor to the palestinian government until the hamas militants came to power in march 2006 .
the quartet of middle east mediators - the european union , the united states , the united nations and russia - then suspended direct aid to the palestinian authority .
unethical and ineffective , says oxfam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty has increased , says oxfam since then , the 27-nation eu has redirected its aid , worth 700 million euros -lrb- $ 943 million -rrb- in 2006 , through a special mechanism to help the neediest people while bypassing the government to avoid contact with hamas .
hobbs said that suspending aid and withholding tax revenue was both unethical and ineffective as a policy tool .
" parents have been driven into debt , children taken out of classrooms and whole families deprived of access to medicine and healthcare , " he added .
services meltdown a survey commissioned by oxfam from the palestinian center for public opinion -lrb- pcpo -rrb- found that more than four out of five of 677 families interviewed have seen a drop in their income following the boycott .
half of all the families reported losing more than half their income , a statement from oxfam said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worsening factional violence has made the streets even more dangerous " the number of palestinian people living in poverty has jumped by 30 percent , essential services are facing meltdown , and previously unknown levels of factional violence plague palestinian streets , " the survey said .
ninety percent of the senior managers running schools , hospitals and water services across the west bank and gaza reported that services had been undermined by the boycott .
" the national unity government remains a fragile creation that could collapse without financial support , leading to even greater insecurity , " the report said .
" the occupied palestinian territories risk becoming a ' failed state , ' destroying the chances of achieving a two-state solution . " dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says no to aiding palestinian unity government new palestinian finance minister salam fayyad has failed to convince the european union to agree to resume aid to the palestinian authority despite what he called a " very acute financial crisis " .

" but if you want to win the league , you have to win in mainz . " schalke coach mirko slomka has minor injury concerns with danish striker soren larsen twisting an ankle in training and halil altintop facing a fitness race to partner in-form striker kevin kuranyi up front .
" a win could be a major milestone for us on the road to the league title , " said slomka . schalke 's main hopes rest on the return of playmaker lincoln from a five-game suspension for the final six matches of the season .
" lincoln is back , he is extremely important for us , " said slomka .
the schalke coach also said he would be happy if bremen lose in dortmund , but that his team must do its own share : " we must win our games . " bitter rivals wish each other the best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi scored twice in the 4-0 win against mainz earlier this season schalke striker kevin kuranyi also hoped the royal blues ’ bitter rivals get a result : " i will never become a dortmund fan but i hope they get three points against bremen . " it only highlights a somewhat bizarre season that rabid local rivals dortmund also want schalke to win .
" it 's crazy , this time we are keeping our fingers crossed for schalke , " said dortmund defender christian wörns .
points for mainz could seriously jeopardize dortmund ’ s top-flight status . werder - who romped to a 4-1 win over az alkmaar in the uefa cup quarter-finals on thursday with miroslav klose ending his goal drought with a double - go to struggling dortmund on sunday , while bayern munich , in fourth , will be looking to put the hurt of their champions league exit behind them against bayer leverkusen on the same day . " it is still about first place .

" hanover are a good counter-attacking side , " said veh .
" they proved that when they beat bayern munich 1-0 earlier this season , but we are confident and in good form .
you can see that at every training session and having 50,000 fans behind us will do the team no end of good , as it has all season . " stuttgart 's top-scorer mario gomez is on the mend after a knee injury , but is still several weeks away from a return . after parting company with ex-coach manager falko götz in midweek after plummeting down the table to ninth having gone nine games without a win , hertha berlin have karsten heine at the helm away to mid-table vfl bochum . relegation battle just as tight as title fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt and bielefeld resume hostilities on saturday in the day 's other games , there is a huge relegation tussle at arminia bielefeld against eintracht frankfurt with the clubs glaring at each other from either side of the relegation line . energie cottbus entertain vfl wolfsburg , with both sides in the hunt for a uefa cup place , while nuremburg should beat mid-table alemannia aachen to try and move up one place into fifth to claim a european place . bottom-side borussia mönchengladbach face hamburg at home on friday night and despite their ominous position six-points adrift at the foot of the table , 53,000 tickets have already been sold as the fans show their support . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen stroll into uefa cup semis as leverkusen crash out werder bremen thrashed az alkmaar 4-1 to reach the uefa cup semi-finals with miroslav klose breaking his short drought with two goals .

" a win could be a major milestone for us on the road to the league title , " said slomka . schalke 's main hopes rest on the return of playmaker lincoln from a five-game suspension for the final six matches of the season .
" lincoln is back , he is extremely important for us , " said slomka .
the schalke coach also said he would be happy if bremen lose in dortmund , but that his team must do its own share : " we must win our games . " bitter rivals wish each other the best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi scored twice in the 4-0 win against mainz earlier this season schalke striker kevin kuranyi also hoped the royal blues ’ bitter rivals get a result : " i will never become a dortmund fan but i hope they get three points against bremen . " it only highlights a somewhat bizarre season that rabid local rivals dortmund also want schalke to win .
" it 's crazy , this time we are keeping our fingers crossed for schalke , " said dortmund defender christian wörns .
points for mainz could seriously jeopardize dortmund ’ s top-flight status . werder - who romped to a 4-1 win over az alkmaar in the uefa cup quarter-finals on thursday with miroslav klose ending his goal drought with a double - go to struggling dortmund on sunday , while bayern munich , in fourth , will be looking to put the hurt of their champions league exit behind them against bayer leverkusen on the same day .

" they proved that when they beat bayern munich 1-0 earlier this season , but we are confident and in good form .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.04.2007 german solar boom shines its light on depressed east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one study says by 2020 , more people could work in solar and related branches than in the car industry german accounts for 55 percent of global solar electricity production and is the world 's market leader .
one of the main benefactors of the solar boom is eastern germany , which has long been under an economic shadow . although germans are renowned for spending much of their six weeks of annual vacation in sunnier climes to escape the frequent gray skies and rain of home , solar energy is turning out to be one of the country 's fastest-growing sectors and could be the light at the end of the tunnel for the struggling east .
the eastern city of frankfurt an der oder is turning into one of the main beneficiaries of the solar upsurge , with three solar production facilities planned for the region .
one , being built by the green energy company conergy , is scheduled to go online in october or november .
inside the shell of a chip factory that never got off the ground another in a long string of economic disappointments for the region workers are busy putting in machines that cut and clean silicon .
when up and running toward the end of this year , conergy hopes to produce about 1.2 million photovoltaic modules , which convert the sun 's energy into electricity , per year and employ around 600 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a welder at the conergy plant in frankfurt an der oder for frankfurt , which symbolizes the economic woes of eastern germany in the wake of reunification , the news of new jobs was like bread for the starving .
" we had a job forum in december , where we and the other two solar companies presented ourselves , " said andreas von brandemer , the plant director at this new location .
" afterwards we had 5,000 people applying for a job in our factory .
the hr people had a lot to do . "
only 100 jobs were on offer at the time , although von brandermer says if all goes to plan , conergy hopes to build a second factory in the city in 2009 and will employ around 1,000 .
germany 's biggest solar company , bonn-based solarworld , is also expanding its presence in the east .
expansion plans at its state-of-the-art production facility in freiburg , in the eastern state of saxony , have a price tag in the hundreds of millions of euros .
" solar valley " eastern germany is attractive so many solar players that it 's been dubbed , perhaps inevitably , " solar valley . "
it is attractive to investors for several reasons : wages in the east are lower then they are in western germany ; massive investment in the years since reunification means the infrastructure is excellent ; and eastern german cities have been generous with tax incentives to lure companies .
but another important reason for potential investors has been the hometown workforce .
frankfurt an der oder was the home of east germany 's semiconductor industry .
the region already has a skilled workforce , although many of those who used to work in the gdr-era semiconductor industry have been out of work for years or been forced to enter different industries .
many are ready to return .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels in the eastern state of brandenburg " so you already have a lot of skilled , knowledgeable workers in the field of handling silicon and that 's a major point for companies considering investing in eastern germany , " said nicholas dobrott , director of renewable energies for the industrial investment council .
andreas kritzski is one of them .
he worked in frankfurt 's semiconductor factory in the gdr era , but lost his job with the plant closed .
he entered retraining programs in construction , did some work in western germany , then lost other jobs as firms folded .
he was out of work for several years before starting at conergy about a month ago .
" the recovery is finally coming , like it was announced all those years ago , " he said .
" people are sending in their applications and waiting excitedly .
like i did , a lot of looking on the internet to find out how solar energy works . "
enough sun although it might be counterintuitive , photovoltaic cells can operate just fine under cloudy skies , since despite the grayness of a rainy day , there is still solar radiation in the air , otherwise it would be dark .
while the sunniest spots in the world , like the sahara desert , have a solar energy potential of about two thousand kilowatt hours per square meter per year , germany 's manages a respectable one thousand , according to henner weithöner of solarpraxis , a company that tracks germany 's solar sector .
" this shows how much even germany or parts of northern europe , how much solar energy we have and what huge potential , " he said .
" we just have to use it . "
germans ' general environmental consciousness has also helped the country take the solar lead .
the green party is a strong presence on the political stage , having been part of the previous governing coalition headed by chancellor gerhard schröder .
renewables law experts say that that administration 's passage of the renewable energies law in 2000 was the momentum behind the current solar surge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge solar facility near the eastern city of leipzig with around 33.500 solar modules the legislation committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 .
it set up generous rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid , and created a market for solar energy .
last year , the solar industry had sales of 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- and employs 53,000 .
according to a report in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , a study carried out by the munich-based consulting firm roland berger estimates that by 2020 , more people could be employed in the environment-related sector than are in the auto industry and engineering .
there are still hurdles to be overcome , especially around the issue of price , and bringing it down .
estimates are that electricity from photovoltaics still needs ten years to become competitive with energy from traditional sources like coal or nuclear .
but solar companies are n't waiting .
they are continuing to invest , counting on technology to eventually bring those prices down .
" if you build up a solar company , lots of manpower is needed , " said weithöner of solarpraxis .
" it is a real job engine for the eastern states .

öttinger had caused a furor on wednesday when he eulogized filbinger , a former navy judge under the third reich , as an " opponent of the nazi regime . " in a statement , merkel said she wished that “ beyond honoring the great life ’ s work of premier hans filbinger , critical questions about the nazi era had also been posed . ”
she said this was especially important “ out of respect for the feelings of the victims ” of the nazi regime . öttinger had outraged political and religious leaders on wednesday when he claimed that “ there is no verdict that hans filbinger handed down that led to someone losing his life . ”
evidence directly contradicts this claim , as nazi-era documents show that filbinger was involved - as a judge and prosecutor - in death sentences against deserters during world war ii . öttinger claimed during the eulogy that filbinger was not a real nazi , but like millions of other germans was forced to bow to the pressure of the times . massive criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans filbinger : criminal or victim ?
in the state capital stuttgart , rabbi joel berger told the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger that öttinger “ better have damned good evidence for publicly claiming filbinger was an opponent of the nazi regime . ” the leader of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , went further , telling afp news service that öttinger ’ s claim was “ dangerous and , for the survivors , an insulting perversion of historical reality . ” öttinger also came under fire from social democrats and the opposition green party .
ute vogt , leader of the social democratic party in baden-württemberg , echoed knobloch ’ s view that öttinger “ is distorting history , ” she told german television .
“ he issued two death sentences .
it ’ s wrong to call filbinger a victim , ” she said . and the simon wiesenthal center , an international organization that hunts down nazi war criminals , has called on öttinger to resign .
“ the öttinger comments are absolutely incredible , ” efraim zuroff , director of the israeli chapter in jerusalem , told reuters news agency .
“ it is unacceptable for a german state premier to deny and whitewash the nazi past of an ex-leader and nazi judge , ” he said , “ and we call for his resignation . ” filbinger resigned over nazi past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filbinger -lrb- left -rrb- after his resignation in 1978 .
lothar spät succeeded him günther öttinger is a prominent political leader of the christian democratic union , which rules in coalition with the center-left social democratic party at the national level but enjoys a wide electoral margin in baden-württemberg , a predominantly conservative state .
in 2005 , öttinger was elected premier of this wealthy southern state and , eight days later , state party leader . for his part , hans filbinger was elected state premier of baden-württemberg in 1966 , and led the state for over a decade .
but in 1978 , he resigned after his role as a nazi judge came to light through a play by rolf hochhuth . filbinger never publicly expressed regret about his nazi past , and the state chapter of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has fiercely defended his record , naming him its honorary chairman in 1979 . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservative premier defends nazi-era judge a leading german conservative defended a notorious nazi-era judge at the man 's funeral , reaping criticism from germany 's central council of jews , among others .

the committee 's backing sets the stage for a vote before the full parliament in a plenary session on may 10 in brussels and a final decision by eu telecoms ministers on june 7 in luxembourg .
" we are sending a very clear message to the consumers and telecom operators , " said the bill 's rapporteur , austrian conservative paul ruedig .
" it 's a good basis for our deliberations . "
the plans as adopted by the panel go even farther in the favor of consumers than original propositions from the european commission , which had proposed a 44-cent ceiling on outgoing calls made abroad in the eu and a 15-cent cap on incoming calls .
protecting consumers the eu 's executive arm hopes to see so-called roaming charges fall by as much as 70 percent , thanks to its plans to cap what operators charge customers at the retail level and what they charge each other at the wholesale level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu consumers could benefit from the price caps this summer already the commission drew up the plans to regulate roaming rates last year after finding evidence of huge variations between operators ' prices with roaming calls costing some times up to six times those of local mobile calls .
eu telecoms commissioner viviane reding , who has led the drive for regulation of roaming rates , hailed the committee 's support for her plans as " very good news for europe 's consumers . "
the beuc european consumers association said that while the plans " go in the right direction , " the price caps " are still too high and should be readjusted based on real costs . "
reding is aiming for the package to go into effect in summer so consumers can benefit from lower prices during the holidays abroad , although some eu lawmakers have said its application might not come until the autumn .
" in view of the emerging consensus on the new rules , an early entry into force of the eu roaming regulation is now a very realistic possibility , " she added .
industry up in arms the package has the industry , which argues that fierce competition has already driven down prices , up in arms and it has been lobbying hard to get the plans watered down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone companies can expect the caps to hurt the gsma trade association said that " retail price regulation is inappropriate and unprecedented on the basis of the principles of a market economy . "
it charged that the plans " will force european mobile operators to offer roaming services at below cost and give them no scope to compete with each other on price and on new services . "
the organization has been lobbying for a ceiling of at least 65 cents for outgoing calls abroad and 35 cents for incoming calls .
with roaming charges generating on average 10 percent of operators revenues , reding acknowledged that the regulations would prove to be painful for operators and would probably provoke a " correction " in the share prices . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bahn , vodafone team up on mobile payment scheme global wireless company vodafone will make a fresh foray into the micro-banking business , testing a mobile payment system in partnership with deutsche bahn , the companies announced at the weekend .

in a rare press conference at the army headquarters , general yasar buyukanit pushed on thursday for a cross-border operation into northern iraq to crack down on turkish kurd rebels he said had sought refuge there .
general buyukanit said that it was necessary to launch a cross-border military operation against pkk rebels based in northern iraq there , but that this would require political authorization .
" it is necessary to launch an operation into iraq , " buyukanit told reporters .
" the pkk has huge freedom of movement in iraq . "
missions within turkey target returning fighters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish troops in northern iraq in 2005 he also said the military had launched a number of large-scale operations against kurdish rebels in south-east turkey .
buyukanit said the operations had been launched as snow melting in mountain passes made it easier for pkk rebels to enter turkey from neighboring iraq .
turkey has accused iraqi kurds of tolerating , and even backing the kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has waged a bloody campaign for kurdish self-rule in turkey 's southeast since 1984 .
the conflict has claimed some 37,000 lives .
the turkish military has claimed there are around 5,000 pkk guerrillas based in camps in mountainous northern iraq .
ankara says thousands of militants of the pkk enjoy unrestricted movement in northern iraq and are able to obtain weapons and explosives there .
the group is listed as a terrorist group by turkey and much of the international community .
iraqi kurds taking threats very seriously the kurds in northern iraq are taking the threats by the turkish army to launch a military offensive against kurdish rebels seriously , the president of the autonomous kurdish parliament said friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military has clashed with rebels in southern turkey adnan al-mufti told reporters in arbil , northern iraq that " these threats are nothing new for us , we take them seriously . "
he said the authorities in the autonomous kurdish region of northern iraq would seek the support of the iraqi government .
" we want a dialogue , but those responsible in turkey are not ready for one , " al-mufti added .
when asked why the kurdish authorities , who control three provinces in northern iraq , have not taken action against pkk rebels , al-mufti said that " the situation in iraq is altogether too unstable ; therefore we can not take steps against this party . "
the turkish government has repeatedly called on the united states and iraq to launch its own operations against the pkk in northern iraq .
the organization is black-listed as a terrorist organization by both the us and the eu .
on friday the president of the iraqi parliament mahmoud al- mashhadani warned that all those foreign powers that had a hand in iraq 's internal affairs would have " the hand hacked off . "
observers interpreted this statement as referring to the turkish military threats to intervene in northern iraq . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence feeds doubts on turkey 's eu bid on the verge of opening eu accession talks , turkey is facing growing violence from kurdish separatists and growing opposition from within europe , potentially jeopardizing ankara 's bid to join the bloc .

" a win could be a major milestone for us on the road to the league title , " said slomka . schalke 's main hopes rest on the return of playmaker lincoln from a five-game suspension for the final six matches of the season .
" lincoln is back , he is extremely important for us , " said slomka .
the schalke coach also said he would be happy if bremen lose in dortmund , but that his team must do its own share : " we must win our games .

bayer leverkusen failed to overturn a 3-0 first leg deficit , losing 1-0 to osasuna . germany striker miroslav klose ended his goal drought in style at the weserstadion on thursday with a brace in werder bremen 's 4-1 win over az alkmaar which secured their place in the uefa cup semi-finals where they will meet espanyol .
the polish-born forward scored in the 36th minute to end his barren spell , which dated back to january 31 and lasted 1158 minutes , to add to tim borowski 's opener - which had been pegged back by moussa dembele 's excellent 32nd minute equalizer .
any doubts that werder - who almost put barcelona out in the champions league group stages - would not be in the final four were settled when klose added their third in the 62nd minute .
inspirational brazilian playmaker diego rounded off the scoring against the plucky dutch with a well deserved goal eight minutes from time , hitting home from the edge of the penalty area after playing a neat 1-2 with klose .
confident klose rediscovers his touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose displayed few signs of suffering from his drought werder coach thomas schaaf said the thought had never entered his mind that klose had lost his touch .
" miroslav always trained hard and never lost confidence , " said schaaf .
" his situation was never as catastrophic as people said .
he knew he had not lost his goal scoring talents and today his work paid off . "
the first half came to a boil after borowski netted in the 19th minute , escaping the attentions of an alkmaar defender to latch onto a delightful lobbed ball from diego to shoot into the far corner of the net .
alkmaar were far from cowed and captain and former glasgow rangers striker shota arveladze almost leveled with a splendid lob from outside the area which took a deflection for a corner .
the dutch side , though , did draw level as dembele produced a fierce left footed shot from just outside the box which beat the diving tim wiese in the left hand corner for his fourth goal of the campaign .
it had coach louis van gaal punching the air in delight , but the former barcelona and dutch national coach was not in the same mood when klose got on the end of aaron hunt 's pass across the five-yard line to score his first goal of the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego slams in his goal to make it 4-1 to werder indeed van gaal was in even more of a fury when what looked like a perfectly good goal was disallowed and he had several words with the fourth official over referee mike riley 's decision .
the hosts should have been 3-1 up a minute later as borowski squared the ball from the right but klose was only able to screw the ball over the bar .
the second half was as exciting an affair with werder 's naldo going agonizingly close with a rasping free kick but it was to be klose who closed things down for the german side .
again diego was the architect , the pocket-sized brazilian floating over an inch-perfect cross from the right for klose to send a diving header past the keeper and secure his brace , and bremen 's victory .
lackluster leverkusen crash out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen looked resigned to their fate from the start germany ’ s other uefa cup quarter-finalists bayer leverkusen couldn ’ t overturn the 3-0 deficit racked up in the first leg of their clash against spanish side osasuna and suffered further ignominy by losing the second game 1-0 .
osasuna midfielder juanlu gave the spaniards a deserved win when he steered in past rene adler from close range after the leverkusen keeper had palmed a roberto soldado shot into his path just after the hour .
a poor and lacklustre leverkusen side laboured against their opponents and only fashioned one serious attempt on goal when defender jan-ingwer callsen bracker had a header cleared off the line early in the second half .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 13.04.2007 german solar boom shines its light on depressed east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one study says by 2020 , more people could work in solar and related branches than in the car industry german accounts for 55 percent of global solar electricity production and is the world 's market leader .
one of the main benefactors of the solar boom is eastern germany , which has long been under an economic shadow . although germans are renowned for spending much of their six weeks of annual vacation in sunnier climes to escape the frequent gray skies and rain of home , solar energy is turning out to be one of the country 's fastest-growing sectors and could be the light at the end of the tunnel for the struggling east .
the eastern city of frankfurt an der oder is turning into one of the main beneficiaries of the solar upsurge , with three solar production facilities planned for the region .
one , being built by the green energy company conergy , is scheduled to go online in october or november .
inside the shell of a chip factory that never got off the ground another in a long string of economic disappointments for the region workers are busy putting in machines that cut and clean silicon .
when up and running toward the end of this year , conergy hopes to produce about 1.2 million photovoltaic modules , which convert the sun 's energy into electricity , per year and employ around 600 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a welder at the conergy plant in frankfurt an der oder for frankfurt , which symbolizes the economic woes of eastern germany in the wake of reunification , the news of new jobs was like bread for the starving .
" we had a job forum in december , where we and the other two solar companies presented ourselves , " said andreas von brandemer , the plant director at this new location .
" afterwards we had 5,000 people applying for a job in our factory .
the hr people had a lot to do . "
only 100 jobs were on offer at the time , although von brandermer says if all goes to plan , conergy hopes to build a second factory in the city in 2009 and will employ around 1,000 .
germany 's biggest solar company , bonn-based solarworld , is also expanding its presence in the east .
expansion plans at its state-of-the-art production facility in freiburg , in the eastern state of saxony , have a price tag in the hundreds of millions of euros .
" solar valley " eastern germany is attractive so many solar players that it 's been dubbed , perhaps inevitably , " solar valley . "
it is attractive to investors for several reasons : wages in the east are lower then they are in western germany ; massive investment in the years since reunification means the infrastructure is excellent ; and eastern german cities have been generous with tax incentives to lure companies .
but another important reason for potential investors has been the hometown workforce .
frankfurt an der oder was the home of east germany 's semiconductor industry .
the region already has a skilled workforce , although many of those who used to work in the gdr-era semiconductor industry have been out of work for years or been forced to enter different industries .
many are ready to return .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels in the eastern state of brandenburg " so you already have a lot of skilled , knowledgeable workers in the field of handling silicon and that 's a major point for companies considering investing in eastern germany , " said nicholas dobrott , director of renewable energies for the industrial investment council .
andreas kritzski is one of them .
he worked in frankfurt 's semiconductor factory in the gdr era , but lost his job with the plant closed .
he entered retraining programs in construction , did some work in western germany , then lost other jobs as firms folded .
he was out of work for several years before starting at conergy about a month ago .
" the recovery is finally coming , like it was announced all those years ago , " he said .
" people are sending in their applications and waiting excitedly .
like i did , a lot of looking on the internet to find out how solar energy works . "
enough sun although it might be counterintuitive , photovoltaic cells can operate just fine under cloudy skies , since despite the grayness of a rainy day , there is still solar radiation in the air , otherwise it would be dark .
while the sunniest spots in the world , like the sahara desert , have a solar energy potential of about two thousand kilowatt hours per square meter per year , germany 's manages a respectable one thousand , according to henner weithöner of solarpraxis , a company that tracks germany 's solar sector .
" this shows how much even germany or parts of northern europe , how much solar energy we have and what huge potential , " he said .
" we just have to use it . "
germans ' general environmental consciousness has also helped the country take the solar lead .
the green party is a strong presence on the political stage , having been part of the previous governing coalition headed by chancellor gerhard schröder .
renewables law experts say that that administration 's passage of the renewable energies law in 2000 was the momentum behind the current solar surge .

it set up generous rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid , and created a market for solar energy .
last year , the solar industry had sales of 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- and employs 53,000 .
according to a report in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , a study carried out by the munich-based consulting firm roland berger estimates that by 2020 , more people could be employed in the environment-related sector than are in the auto industry and engineering .
there are still hurdles to be overcome , especially around the issue of price , and bringing it down .
estimates are that electricity from photovoltaics still needs ten years to become competitive with energy from traditional sources like coal or nuclear .
but solar companies are n't waiting .
they are continuing to invest , counting on technology to eventually bring those prices down .

öttinger had caused a furor on wednesday when he eulogized filbinger , a former navy judge under the third reich , as an " opponent of the nazi regime . " in a statement , merkel said she wished that “ beyond honoring the great life ’ s work of premier hans filbinger , critical questions about the nazi era had also been posed . ”
she said this was especially important “ out of respect for the feelings of the victims ” of the nazi regime . öttinger had outraged political and religious leaders on wednesday when he claimed that “ there is no verdict that hans filbinger handed down that led to someone losing his life . ”
evidence directly contradicts this claim , as nazi-era documents show that filbinger was involved - as a judge and prosecutor - in death sentences against deserters during world war ii . öttinger claimed during the eulogy that filbinger was not a real nazi , but like millions of other germans was forced to bow to the pressure of the times . massive criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans filbinger : criminal or victim ?
in the state capital stuttgart , rabbi joel berger told the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger that öttinger “ better have damned good evidence for publicly claiming filbinger was an opponent of the nazi regime . ” the leader of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , went further , telling afp news service that öttinger ’ s claim was “ dangerous and , for the survivors , an insulting perversion of historical reality . ” öttinger also came under fire from social democrats and the opposition green party .
ute vogt , leader of the social democratic party in baden-württemberg , echoed knobloch ’ s view that öttinger “ is distorting history , ” she told german television .
“ he issued two death sentences .
it ’ s wrong to call filbinger a victim , ” she said . and the simon wiesenthal center , an international organization that hunts down nazi war criminals , has called on öttinger to resign .
“ the öttinger comments are absolutely incredible , ” efraim zuroff , director of the israeli chapter in jerusalem , told reuters news agency .
“ it is unacceptable for a german state premier to deny and whitewash the nazi past of an ex-leader and nazi judge , ” he said , “ and we call for his resignation . ” filbinger resigned over nazi past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filbinger -lrb- left -rrb- after his resignation in 1978 .
lothar spät succeeded him günther öttinger is a prominent political leader of the christian democratic union , which rules in coalition with the center-left social democratic party at the national level but enjoys a wide electoral margin in baden-württemberg , a predominantly conservative state .
in 2005 , öttinger was elected premier of this wealthy southern state and , eight days later , state party leader . for his part , hans filbinger was elected state premier of baden-württemberg in 1966 , and led the state for over a decade .
but in 1978 , he resigned after his role as a nazi judge came to light through a play by rolf hochhuth . filbinger never publicly expressed regret about his nazi past , and the state chapter of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has fiercely defended his record , naming him its honorary chairman in 1979 . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservative premier defends nazi-era judge a leading german conservative defended a notorious nazi-era judge at the man 's funeral , reaping criticism from germany 's central council of jews , among others .

the committee 's backing sets the stage for a vote before the full parliament in a plenary session on may 10 in brussels and a final decision by eu telecoms ministers on june 7 in luxembourg .
" we are sending a very clear message to the consumers and telecom operators , " said the bill 's rapporteur , austrian conservative paul ruedig .
" it 's a good basis for our deliberations . "
the plans as adopted by the panel go even farther in the favor of consumers than original propositions from the european commission , which had proposed a 44-cent ceiling on outgoing calls made abroad in the eu and a 15-cent cap on incoming calls .
protecting consumers the eu 's executive arm hopes to see so-called roaming charges fall by as much as 70 percent , thanks to its plans to cap what operators charge customers at the retail level and what they charge each other at the wholesale level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu consumers could benefit from the price caps this summer already the commission drew up the plans to regulate roaming rates last year after finding evidence of huge variations between operators ' prices with roaming calls costing some times up to six times those of local mobile calls .
eu telecoms commissioner viviane reding , who has led the drive for regulation of roaming rates , hailed the committee 's support for her plans as " very good news for europe 's consumers . "
the beuc european consumers association said that while the plans " go in the right direction , " the price caps " are still too high and should be readjusted based on real costs . "
reding is aiming for the package to go into effect in summer so consumers can benefit from lower prices during the holidays abroad , although some eu lawmakers have said its application might not come until the autumn .
" in view of the emerging consensus on the new rules , an early entry into force of the eu roaming regulation is now a very realistic possibility , " she added .
industry up in arms the package has the industry , which argues that fierce competition has already driven down prices , up in arms and it has been lobbying hard to get the plans watered down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone companies can expect the caps to hurt the gsma trade association said that " retail price regulation is inappropriate and unprecedented on the basis of the principles of a market economy . "
it charged that the plans " will force european mobile operators to offer roaming services at below cost and give them no scope to compete with each other on price and on new services . "
the organization has been lobbying for a ceiling of at least 65 cents for outgoing calls abroad and 35 cents for incoming calls .
with roaming charges generating on average 10 percent of operators revenues , reding acknowledged that the regulations would prove to be painful for operators and would probably provoke a " correction " in the share prices . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bahn , vodafone team up on mobile payment scheme global wireless company vodafone will make a fresh foray into the micro-banking business , testing a mobile payment system in partnership with deutsche bahn , the companies announced at the weekend .

" the stability of iraq is in our common interest , " commission spokeswoman krisztina nagy told reporters in brussels .
" the eu recognizes the constructive role turkey plays in the area and in this context it is important that turkey continues to play such a positive role , " she added .
" the eu is following the situation in the region very closely , " said nagy .
" our hope and the interest of all involved is that possible differences are dealt with in a peaceful and constructive manner . "
in a rare press conference at the army headquarters , general yasar buyukanit pushed on thursday for a cross-border operation into northern iraq to crack down on turkish kurd rebels he said had sought refuge there .
general buyukanit said that it was necessary to launch a cross-border military operation against pkk rebels based in northern iraq there , but that this would require political authorization .
" it is necessary to launch an operation into iraq , " buyukanit told reporters .
" the pkk has huge freedom of movement in iraq . "
missions within turkey target returning fighters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish troops in northern iraq in 2005 he also said the military had launched a number of large-scale operations against kurdish rebels in south-east turkey .
buyukanit said the operations had been launched as snow melting in mountain passes made it easier for pkk rebels to enter turkey from neighboring iraq .
turkey has accused iraqi kurds of tolerating , and even backing the kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has waged a bloody campaign for kurdish self-rule in turkey 's southeast since 1984 .
the conflict has claimed some 37,000 lives .
the turkish military has claimed there are around 5,000 pkk guerrillas based in camps in mountainous northern iraq .
ankara says thousands of militants of the pkk enjoy unrestricted movement in northern iraq and are able to obtain weapons and explosives there .
the group is listed as a terrorist group by turkey and much of the international community .
iraqi kurds taking threats very seriously the kurds in northern iraq are taking the threats by the turkish army to launch a military offensive against kurdish rebels seriously , the president of the autonomous kurdish parliament said friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military has clashed with rebels in southern turkey adnan al-mufti told reporters in arbil , northern iraq that " these threats are nothing new for us , we take them seriously . "
he said the authorities in the autonomous kurdish region of northern iraq would seek the support of the iraqi government .
" we want a dialogue , but those responsible in turkey are not ready for one , " al-mufti added .
when asked why the kurdish authorities , who control three provinces in northern iraq , have not taken action against pkk rebels , al-mufti said that " the situation in iraq is altogether too unstable ; therefore we can not take steps against this party . "
the turkish government has repeatedly called on the united states and iraq to launch its own operations against the pkk in northern iraq .
the organization is black-listed as a terrorist organization by both the us and the eu .
on friday the president of the iraqi parliament mahmoud al- mashhadani warned that all those foreign powers that had a hand in iraq 's internal affairs would have " the hand hacked off . "

"
asked about the us plan to install part of the anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic , jung said : " i think it is good that in nato , as with the nato-russia council , we are working together to assuage possible doubts " .
although jung has voiced support for the us scheme , it is not a view that is universally backed within the german cabinet .
but he did insist it was important for the west " to work on a partnership basis with russia " on the matter , he added .
russia should be convinced of the argument so as " to reach an agreement for the protection of populations , for european populations in particular , " he said .
protective measure ? the united states has asked the czech republic to host a radar system and poland to host interceptor rockets as part of its missile defense plans .
washington insists the anti-missile shield is intended as protection against attacks from " rogue states " such as iran .
it points out that the proposed system would be useless against russia 's vast weapons arsenal .
but russia 's president vladimir putin has said it could spark a new arms race and that it was a needless distraction from the fight against terrorism .

he added : " it is vital for world peace .
the united states , russia , europe and china must work together . "
president putin had been very clear on one point , he continued . " it is also in russia 's interests that iran does not possess atomic weapons , " jung said .
on april 19 , at nato 's brussels headquarters , the 26 nato allies - including 21 eu member states - will discuss the anti-missile system in the north atlantic council and then with russia at a nato-russia meeting .
russia still critical putin has strongly criticized the plans for the us missile defesce system .
" why is it necessary to put military infrastructure on our border ?
it 's hardly connected to today 's global threats .
what is the real threat ?

bayer leverkusen failed to overturn a 3-0 first leg deficit , losing 1-0 to osasuna . germany striker miroslav klose ended his goal drought in style at the weserstadion on thursday with a brace in werder bremen 's 4-1 win over az alkmaar which secured their place in the uefa cup semi-finals where they will meet espanyol .
the polish-born forward scored in the 36th minute to end his barren spell , which dated back to january 31 and lasted 1158 minutes , to add to tim borowski 's opener - which had been pegged back by moussa dembele 's excellent 32nd minute equalizer .
any doubts that werder - who almost put barcelona out in the champions league group stages - would not be in the final four were settled when klose added their third in the 62nd minute .
inspirational brazilian playmaker diego rounded off the scoring against the plucky dutch with a well deserved goal eight minutes from time , hitting home from the edge of the penalty area after playing a neat 1-2 with klose .
confident klose rediscovers his touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose displayed few signs of suffering from his drought werder coach thomas schaaf said the thought had never entered his mind that klose had lost his touch .
" miroslav always trained hard and never lost confidence , " said schaaf .
" his situation was never as catastrophic as people said .
he knew he had not lost his goal scoring talents and today his work paid off . "
the first half came to a boil after borowski netted in the 19th minute , escaping the attentions of an alkmaar defender to latch onto a delightful lobbed ball from diego to shoot into the far corner of the net .
alkmaar were far from cowed and captain and former glasgow rangers striker shota arveladze almost leveled with a splendid lob from outside the area which took a deflection for a corner .
the dutch side , though , did draw level as dembele produced a fierce left footed shot from just outside the box which beat the diving tim wiese in the left hand corner for his fourth goal of the campaign .
it had coach louis van gaal punching the air in delight , but the former barcelona and dutch national coach was not in the same mood when klose got on the end of aaron hunt 's pass across the five-yard line to score his first goal of the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego slams in his goal to make it 4-1 to werder indeed van gaal was in even more of a fury when what looked like a perfectly good goal was disallowed and he had several words with the fourth official over referee mike riley 's decision .
the hosts should have been 3-1 up a minute later as borowski squared the ball from the right but klose was only able to screw the ball over the bar .
the second half was as exciting an affair with werder 's naldo going agonizingly close with a rasping free kick but it was to be klose who closed things down for the german side .
again diego was the architect , the pocket-sized brazilian floating over an inch-perfect cross from the right for klose to send a diving header past the keeper and secure his brace , and bremen 's victory .

the committee 's backing sets the stage for a vote before the full parliament in a plenary session on may 10 in brussels and a final decision by eu telecoms ministers on june 7 in luxembourg .
" we are sending a very clear message to the consumers and telecom operators , " said the bill 's rapporteur , austrian conservative paul ruedig .
" it 's a good basis for our deliberations . "
the plans as adopted by the panel go even farther in the favor of consumers than original propositions from the european commission , which had proposed a 44-cent ceiling on outgoing calls made abroad in the eu and a 15-cent cap on incoming calls .
protecting consumers the eu 's executive arm hopes to see so-called roaming charges fall by as much as 70 percent , thanks to its plans to cap what operators charge customers at the retail level and what they charge each other at the wholesale level .

eu telecoms commissioner viviane reding , who has led the drive for regulation of roaming rates , hailed the committee 's support for her plans as " very good news for europe 's consumers . "
the beuc european consumers association said that while the plans " go in the right direction , " the price caps " are still too high and should be readjusted based on real costs . "
reding is aiming for the package to go into effect in summer so consumers can benefit from lower prices during the holidays abroad , although some eu lawmakers have said its application might not come until the autumn .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.04.2007 german solar boom shines its light on depressed east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one study says by 2020 , more people could work in solar and related branches than in the car industry german accounts for 55 percent of global solar electricity production and is the world 's market leader .
one of the main benefactors of the solar boom is eastern germany , which has long been under an economic shadow . although germans are renowned for spending much of their six weeks of annual vacation in sunnier climes to escape the frequent gray skies and rain of home , solar energy is turning out to be one of the country 's fastest-growing sectors and could be the light at the end of the tunnel for the struggling east .
the eastern city of frankfurt an der oder is turning into one of the main beneficiaries of the solar upsurge , with three solar production facilities planned for the region .
one , being built by the green energy company conergy , is scheduled to go online in october or november .
inside the shell of a chip factory that never got off the ground another in a long string of economic disappointments for the region workers are busy putting in machines that cut and clean silicon .
when up and running toward the end of this year , conergy hopes to produce about 1.2 million photovoltaic modules , which convert the sun 's energy into electricity , per year and employ around 600 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a welder at the conergy plant in frankfurt an der oder for frankfurt , which symbolizes the economic woes of eastern germany in the wake of reunification , the news of new jobs was like bread for the starving .
" we had a job forum in december , where we and the other two solar companies presented ourselves , " said andreas von brandemer , the plant director at this new location .
" afterwards we had 5,000 people applying for a job in our factory .
the hr people had a lot to do . "
only 100 jobs were on offer at the time , although von brandermer says if all goes to plan , conergy hopes to build a second factory in the city in 2009 and will employ around 1,000 .
germany 's biggest solar company , bonn-based solarworld , is also expanding its presence in the east .
expansion plans at its state-of-the-art production facility in freiburg , in the eastern state of saxony , have a price tag in the hundreds of millions of euros .
" solar valley " eastern germany is attractive so many solar players that it 's been dubbed , perhaps inevitably , " solar valley . "
it is attractive to investors for several reasons : wages in the east are lower then they are in western germany ; massive investment in the years since reunification means the infrastructure is excellent ; and eastern german cities have been generous with tax incentives to lure companies .
but another important reason for potential investors has been the hometown workforce .
frankfurt an der oder was the home of east germany 's semiconductor industry .
the region already has a skilled workforce , although many of those who used to work in the gdr-era semiconductor industry have been out of work for years or been forced to enter different industries .
many are ready to return .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels in the eastern state of brandenburg " so you already have a lot of skilled , knowledgeable workers in the field of handling silicon and that 's a major point for companies considering investing in eastern germany , " said nicholas dobrott , director of renewable energies for the industrial investment council .
andreas kritzski is one of them .
he worked in frankfurt 's semiconductor factory in the gdr era , but lost his job with the plant closed .
he entered retraining programs in construction , did some work in western germany , then lost other jobs as firms folded .
he was out of work for several years before starting at conergy about a month ago .
" the recovery is finally coming , like it was announced all those years ago , " he said .
" people are sending in their applications and waiting excitedly .
like i did , a lot of looking on the internet to find out how solar energy works . "
enough sun although it might be counterintuitive , photovoltaic cells can operate just fine under cloudy skies , since despite the grayness of a rainy day , there is still solar radiation in the air , otherwise it would be dark .
while the sunniest spots in the world , like the sahara desert , have a solar energy potential of about two thousand kilowatt hours per square meter per year , germany 's manages a respectable one thousand , according to henner weithöner of solarpraxis , a company that tracks germany 's solar sector .
" this shows how much even germany or parts of northern europe , how much solar energy we have and what huge potential , " he said .
" we just have to use it . "
germans ' general environmental consciousness has also helped the country take the solar lead .
the green party is a strong presence on the political stage , having been part of the previous governing coalition headed by chancellor gerhard schröder .
renewables law experts say that that administration 's passage of the renewable energies law in 2000 was the momentum behind the current solar surge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge solar facility near the eastern city of leipzig with around 33.500 solar modules the legislation committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 .
it set up generous rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid , and created a market for solar energy .
last year , the solar industry had sales of 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- and employs 53,000 .
according to a report in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , a study carried out by the munich-based consulting firm roland berger estimates that by 2020 , more people could be employed in the environment-related sector than are in the auto industry and engineering .
there are still hurdles to be overcome , especially around the issue of price , and bringing it down .
estimates are that electricity from photovoltaics still needs ten years to become competitive with energy from traditional sources like coal or nuclear .
but solar companies are n't waiting .
they are continuing to invest , counting on technology to eventually bring those prices down .
" if you build up a solar company , lots of manpower is needed , " said weithöner of solarpraxis .
" it is a real job engine for the eastern states .

bayer leverkusen failed to overturn a 3-0 first leg deficit , losing 1-0 to osasuna . germany striker miroslav klose ended his goal drought in style at the weserstadion on thursday with a brace in werder bremen 's 4-1 win over az alkmaar which secured their place in the uefa cup semi-finals where they will meet espanyol .
the polish-born forward scored in the 36th minute to end his barren spell , which dated back to january 31 and lasted 1158 minutes , to add to tim borowski 's opener - which had been pegged back by moussa dembele 's excellent 32nd minute equalizer .
any doubts that werder - who almost put barcelona out in the champions league group stages - would not be in the final four were settled when klose added their third in the 62nd minute .
inspirational brazilian playmaker diego rounded off the scoring against the plucky dutch with a well deserved goal eight minutes from time , hitting home from the edge of the penalty area after playing a neat 1-2 with klose .
confident klose rediscovers his touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose displayed few signs of suffering from his drought werder coach thomas schaaf said the thought had never entered his mind that klose had lost his touch .
" miroslav always trained hard and never lost confidence , " said schaaf .
" his situation was never as catastrophic as people said .
he knew he had not lost his goal scoring talents and today his work paid off . "
the first half came to a boil after borowski netted in the 19th minute , escaping the attentions of an alkmaar defender to latch onto a delightful lobbed ball from diego to shoot into the far corner of the net .
alkmaar were far from cowed and captain and former glasgow rangers striker shota arveladze almost leveled with a splendid lob from outside the area which took a deflection for a corner .
the dutch side , though , did draw level as dembele produced a fierce left footed shot from just outside the box which beat the diving tim wiese in the left hand corner for his fourth goal of the campaign .
it had coach louis van gaal punching the air in delight , but the former barcelona and dutch national coach was not in the same mood when klose got on the end of aaron hunt 's pass across the five-yard line to score his first goal of the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego slams in his goal to make it 4-1 to werder indeed van gaal was in even more of a fury when what looked like a perfectly good goal was disallowed and he had several words with the fourth official over referee mike riley 's decision .
the hosts should have been 3-1 up a minute later as borowski squared the ball from the right but klose was only able to screw the ball over the bar .
the second half was as exciting an affair with werder 's naldo going agonizingly close with a rasping free kick but it was to be klose who closed things down for the german side .
again diego was the architect , the pocket-sized brazilian floating over an inch-perfect cross from the right for klose to send a diving header past the keeper and secure his brace , and bremen 's victory .
lackluster leverkusen crash out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen looked resigned to their fate from the start germany ’ s other uefa cup quarter-finalists bayer leverkusen couldn ’ t overturn the 3-0 deficit racked up in the first leg of their clash against spanish side osasuna and suffered further ignominy by losing the second game 1-0 .
osasuna midfielder juanlu gave the spaniards a deserved win when he steered in past rene adler from close range after the leverkusen keeper had palmed a roberto soldado shot into his path just after the hour .
a poor and lacklustre leverkusen side laboured against their opponents and only fashioned one serious attempt on goal when defender jan-ingwer callsen bracker had a header cleared off the line early in the second half .

bayer leverkusen failed to overturn a 3-0 first leg deficit , losing 1-0 to osasuna . germany striker miroslav klose ended his goal drought in style at the weserstadion on thursday with a brace in werder bremen 's 4-1 win over az alkmaar which secured their place in the uefa cup semi-finals where they will meet espanyol .
the polish-born forward scored in the 36th minute to end his barren spell , which dated back to january 31 and lasted 1158 minutes , to add to tim borowski 's opener - which had been pegged back by moussa dembele 's excellent 32nd minute equalizer .
any doubts that werder - who almost put barcelona out in the champions league group stages - would not be in the final four were settled when klose added their third in the 62nd minute .
inspirational brazilian playmaker diego rounded off the scoring against the plucky dutch with a well deserved goal eight minutes from time , hitting home from the edge of the penalty area after playing a neat 1-2 with klose .
confident klose rediscovers his touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose displayed few signs of suffering from his drought werder coach thomas schaaf said the thought had never entered his mind that klose had lost his touch .
" miroslav always trained hard and never lost confidence , " said schaaf .
" his situation was never as catastrophic as people said .
he knew he had not lost his goal scoring talents and today his work paid off . "
the first half came to a boil after borowski netted in the 19th minute , escaping the attentions of an alkmaar defender to latch onto a delightful lobbed ball from diego to shoot into the far corner of the net .
alkmaar were far from cowed and captain and former glasgow rangers striker shota arveladze almost leveled with a splendid lob from outside the area which took a deflection for a corner .
the dutch side , though , did draw level as dembele produced a fierce left footed shot from just outside the box which beat the diving tim wiese in the left hand corner for his fourth goal of the campaign .
it had coach louis van gaal punching the air in delight , but the former barcelona and dutch national coach was not in the same mood when klose got on the end of aaron hunt 's pass across the five-yard line to score his first goal of the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego slams in his goal to make it 4-1 to werder indeed van gaal was in even more of a fury when what looked like a perfectly good goal was disallowed and he had several words with the fourth official over referee mike riley 's decision .
the hosts should have been 3-1 up a minute later as borowski squared the ball from the right but klose was only able to screw the ball over the bar .
the second half was as exciting an affair with werder 's naldo going agonizingly close with a rasping free kick but it was to be klose who closed things down for the german side .
again diego was the architect , the pocket-sized brazilian floating over an inch-perfect cross from the right for klose to send a diving header past the keeper and secure his brace , and bremen 's victory .
lackluster leverkusen crash out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen looked resigned to their fate from the start germany ’ s other uefa cup quarter-finalists bayer leverkusen couldn ’ t overturn the 3-0 deficit racked up in the first leg of their clash against spanish side osasuna and suffered further ignominy by losing the second game 1-0 .
osasuna midfielder juanlu gave the spaniards a deserved win when he steered in past rene adler from close range after the leverkusen keeper had palmed a roberto soldado shot into his path just after the hour .
a poor and lacklustre leverkusen side laboured against their opponents and only fashioned one serious attempt on goal when defender jan-ingwer callsen bracker had a header cleared off the line early in the second half .

one of the main benefactors of the solar boom is eastern germany , which has long been under an economic shadow . although germans are renowned for spending much of their six weeks of annual vacation in sunnier climes to escape the frequent gray skies and rain of home , solar energy is turning out to be one of the country 's fastest-growing sectors and could be the light at the end of the tunnel for the struggling east .
the eastern city of frankfurt an der oder is turning into one of the main beneficiaries of the solar upsurge , with three solar production facilities planned for the region .
one , being built by the green energy company conergy , is scheduled to go online in october or november .
inside the shell of a chip factory that never got off the ground another in a long string of economic disappointments for the region workers are busy putting in machines that cut and clean silicon .
when up and running toward the end of this year , conergy hopes to produce about 1.2 million photovoltaic modules , which convert the sun 's energy into electricity , per year and employ around 600 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a welder at the conergy plant in frankfurt an der oder for frankfurt , which symbolizes the economic woes of eastern germany in the wake of reunification , the news of new jobs was like bread for the starving .
" we had a job forum in december , where we and the other two solar companies presented ourselves , " said andreas von brandemer , the plant director at this new location .
" afterwards we had 5,000 people applying for a job in our factory .
the hr people had a lot to do . "
only 100 jobs were on offer at the time , although von brandermer says if all goes to plan , conergy hopes to build a second factory in the city in 2009 and will employ around 1,000 .
germany 's biggest solar company , bonn-based solarworld , is also expanding its presence in the east .
expansion plans at its state-of-the-art production facility in freiburg , in the eastern state of saxony , have a price tag in the hundreds of millions of euros .
" solar valley " eastern germany is attractive so many solar players that it 's been dubbed , perhaps inevitably , " solar valley . "
it is attractive to investors for several reasons : wages in the east are lower then they are in western germany ; massive investment in the years since reunification means the infrastructure is excellent ; and eastern german cities have been generous with tax incentives to lure companies .
but another important reason for potential investors has been the hometown workforce .
frankfurt an der oder was the home of east germany 's semiconductor industry .
the region already has a skilled workforce , although many of those who used to work in the gdr-era semiconductor industry have been out of work for years or been forced to enter different industries .
many are ready to return .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels in the eastern state of brandenburg " so you already have a lot of skilled , knowledgeable workers in the field of handling silicon and that 's a major point for companies considering investing in eastern germany , " said nicholas dobrott , director of renewable energies for the industrial investment council .
andreas kritzski is one of them .
he worked in frankfurt 's semiconductor factory in the gdr era , but lost his job with the plant closed .
he entered retraining programs in construction , did some work in western germany , then lost other jobs as firms folded .
he was out of work for several years before starting at conergy about a month ago .
" the recovery is finally coming , like it was announced all those years ago , " he said .
" people are sending in their applications and waiting excitedly .
like i did , a lot of looking on the internet to find out how solar energy works . "
enough sun although it might be counterintuitive , photovoltaic cells can operate just fine under cloudy skies , since despite the grayness of a rainy day , there is still solar radiation in the air , otherwise it would be dark .
while the sunniest spots in the world , like the sahara desert , have a solar energy potential of about two thousand kilowatt hours per square meter per year , germany 's manages a respectable one thousand , according to henner weithöner of solarpraxis , a company that tracks germany 's solar sector .
" this shows how much even germany or parts of northern europe , how much solar energy we have and what huge potential , " he said .
" we just have to use it . "
germans ' general environmental consciousness has also helped the country take the solar lead .
the green party is a strong presence on the political stage , having been part of the previous governing coalition headed by chancellor gerhard schröder .
renewables law experts say that that administration 's passage of the renewable energies law in 2000 was the momentum behind the current solar surge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge solar facility near the eastern city of leipzig with around 33.500 solar modules the legislation committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 .
it set up generous rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid , and created a market for solar energy .
last year , the solar industry had sales of 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- and employs 53,000 .
according to a report in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , a study carried out by the munich-based consulting firm roland berger estimates that by 2020 , more people could be employed in the environment-related sector than are in the auto industry and engineering .
there are still hurdles to be overcome , especially around the issue of price , and bringing it down .
estimates are that electricity from photovoltaics still needs ten years to become competitive with energy from traditional sources like coal or nuclear .
but solar companies are n't waiting .
they are continuing to invest , counting on technology to eventually bring those prices down .

one of the main benefactors of the solar boom is eastern germany , which has long been under an economic shadow . although germans are renowned for spending much of their six weeks of annual vacation in sunnier climes to escape the frequent gray skies and rain of home , solar energy is turning out to be one of the country 's fastest-growing sectors and could be the light at the end of the tunnel for the struggling east .
the eastern city of frankfurt an der oder is turning into one of the main beneficiaries of the solar upsurge , with three solar production facilities planned for the region .
one , being built by the green energy company conergy , is scheduled to go online in october or november .
inside the shell of a chip factory that never got off the ground another in a long string of economic disappointments for the region workers are busy putting in machines that cut and clean silicon .
when up and running toward the end of this year , conergy hopes to produce about 1.2 million photovoltaic modules , which convert the sun 's energy into electricity , per year and employ around 600 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a welder at the conergy plant in frankfurt an der oder for frankfurt , which symbolizes the economic woes of eastern germany in the wake of reunification , the news of new jobs was like bread for the starving .
" we had a job forum in december , where we and the other two solar companies presented ourselves , " said andreas von brandemer , the plant director at this new location .
" afterwards we had 5,000 people applying for a job in our factory .
the hr people had a lot to do . "
only 100 jobs were on offer at the time , although von brandermer says if all goes to plan , conergy hopes to build a second factory in the city in 2009 and will employ around 1,000 .
germany 's biggest solar company , bonn-based solarworld , is also expanding its presence in the east .
expansion plans at its state-of-the-art production facility in freiburg , in the eastern state of saxony , have a price tag in the hundreds of millions of euros .
" solar valley " eastern germany is attractive so many solar players that it 's been dubbed , perhaps inevitably , " solar valley . "
it is attractive to investors for several reasons : wages in the east are lower then they are in western germany ; massive investment in the years since reunification means the infrastructure is excellent ; and eastern german cities have been generous with tax incentives to lure companies .
but another important reason for potential investors has been the hometown workforce .
frankfurt an der oder was the home of east germany 's semiconductor industry .
the region already has a skilled workforce , although many of those who used to work in the gdr-era semiconductor industry have been out of work for years or been forced to enter different industries .
many are ready to return .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels in the eastern state of brandenburg " so you already have a lot of skilled , knowledgeable workers in the field of handling silicon and that 's a major point for companies considering investing in eastern germany , " said nicholas dobrott , director of renewable energies for the industrial investment council .
andreas kritzski is one of them .
he worked in frankfurt 's semiconductor factory in the gdr era , but lost his job with the plant closed .
he entered retraining programs in construction , did some work in western germany , then lost other jobs as firms folded .
he was out of work for several years before starting at conergy about a month ago .
" the recovery is finally coming , like it was announced all those years ago , " he said .
" people are sending in their applications and waiting excitedly .
like i did , a lot of looking on the internet to find out how solar energy works . "
enough sun although it might be counterintuitive , photovoltaic cells can operate just fine under cloudy skies , since despite the grayness of a rainy day , there is still solar radiation in the air , otherwise it would be dark .
while the sunniest spots in the world , like the sahara desert , have a solar energy potential of about two thousand kilowatt hours per square meter per year , germany 's manages a respectable one thousand , according to henner weithöner of solarpraxis , a company that tracks germany 's solar sector .
" this shows how much even germany or parts of northern europe , how much solar energy we have and what huge potential , " he said .
" we just have to use it . "
germans ' general environmental consciousness has also helped the country take the solar lead .
the green party is a strong presence on the political stage , having been part of the previous governing coalition headed by chancellor gerhard schröder .
renewables law experts say that that administration 's passage of the renewable energies law in 2000 was the momentum behind the current solar surge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge solar facility near the eastern city of leipzig with around 33.500 solar modules the legislation committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 .
it set up generous rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid , and created a market for solar energy .
last year , the solar industry had sales of 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- and employs 53,000 .
according to a report in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , a study carried out by the munich-based consulting firm roland berger estimates that by 2020 , more people could be employed in the environment-related sector than are in the auto industry and engineering .
there are still hurdles to be overcome , especially around the issue of price , and bringing it down .
estimates are that electricity from photovoltaics still needs ten years to become competitive with energy from traditional sources like coal or nuclear .
but solar companies are n't waiting .
they are continuing to invest , counting on technology to eventually bring those prices down .
" if you build up a solar company , lots of manpower is needed , " said weithöner of solarpraxis .

it set up generous rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid , and created a market for solar energy .
last year , the solar industry had sales of 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- and employs 53,000 .
according to a report in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , a study carried out by the munich-based consulting firm roland berger estimates that by 2020 , more people could be employed in the environment-related sector than are in the auto industry and engineering .
there are still hurdles to be overcome , especially around the issue of price , and bringing it down .
estimates are that electricity from photovoltaics still needs ten years to become competitive with energy from traditional sources like coal or nuclear .
but solar companies are n't waiting .
they are continuing to invest , counting on technology to eventually bring those prices down .
" if you build up a solar company , lots of manpower is needed , " said weithöner of solarpraxis .
" it is a real job engine for the eastern states .

the committee 's backing sets the stage for a vote before the full parliament in a plenary session on may 10 in brussels and a final decision by eu telecoms ministers on june 7 in luxembourg .
" we are sending a very clear message to the consumers and telecom operators , " said the bill 's rapporteur , austrian conservative paul ruedig .
" it 's a good basis for our deliberations . "
the plans as adopted by the panel go even farther in the favor of consumers than original propositions from the european commission , which had proposed a 44-cent ceiling on outgoing calls made abroad in the eu and a 15-cent cap on incoming calls .
protecting consumers the eu 's executive arm hopes to see so-called roaming charges fall by as much as 70 percent , thanks to its plans to cap what operators charge customers at the retail level and what they charge each other at the wholesale level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu consumers could benefit from the price caps this summer already the commission drew up the plans to regulate roaming rates last year after finding evidence of huge variations between operators ' prices with roaming calls costing some times up to six times those of local mobile calls .
eu telecoms commissioner viviane reding , who has led the drive for regulation of roaming rates , hailed the committee 's support for her plans as " very good news for europe 's consumers . "
the beuc european consumers association said that while the plans " go in the right direction , " the price caps " are still too high and should be readjusted based on real costs . "
reding is aiming for the package to go into effect in summer so consumers can benefit from lower prices during the holidays abroad , although some eu lawmakers have said its application might not come until the autumn .
" in view of the emerging consensus on the new rules , an early entry into force of the eu roaming regulation is now a very realistic possibility , " she added .
industry up in arms the package has the industry , which argues that fierce competition has already driven down prices , up in arms and it has been lobbying hard to get the plans watered down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone companies can expect the caps to hurt the gsma trade association said that " retail price regulation is inappropriate and unprecedented on the basis of the principles of a market economy . "
it charged that the plans " will force european mobile operators to offer roaming services at below cost and give them no scope to compete with each other on price and on new services . "
the organization has been lobbying for a ceiling of at least 65 cents for outgoing calls abroad and 35 cents for incoming calls .
with roaming charges generating on average 10 percent of operators revenues , reding acknowledged that the regulations would prove to be painful for operators and would probably provoke a " correction " in the share prices . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bahn , vodafone team up on mobile payment scheme global wireless company vodafone will make a fresh foray into the micro-banking business , testing a mobile payment system in partnership with deutsche bahn , the companies announced at the weekend .

öttinger had caused a furor on wednesday when he eulogized filbinger , a former navy judge under the third reich , as an " opponent of the nazi regime . " in a statement , merkel said she wished that “ beyond honoring the great life ’ s work of premier hans filbinger , critical questions about the nazi era had also been posed . ”
she said this was especially important “ out of respect for the feelings of the victims ” of the nazi regime . öttinger had outraged political and religious leaders on wednesday when he claimed that “ there is no verdict that hans filbinger handed down that led to someone losing his life . ”
evidence directly contradicts this claim , as nazi-era documents show that filbinger was involved - as a judge and prosecutor - in death sentences against deserters during world war ii . öttinger claimed during the eulogy that filbinger was not a real nazi , but like millions of other germans was forced to bow to the pressure of the times . massive criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans filbinger : criminal or victim ?
in the state capital stuttgart , rabbi joel berger told the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger that öttinger “ better have damned good evidence for publicly claiming filbinger was an opponent of the nazi regime . ” the leader of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , went further , telling afp news service that öttinger ’ s claim was “ dangerous and , for the survivors , an insulting perversion of historical reality . ” öttinger also came under fire from social democrats and the opposition green party .
ute vogt , leader of the social democratic party in baden-württemberg , echoed knobloch ’ s view that öttinger “ is distorting history , ” she told german television .
“ he issued two death sentences .
it ’ s wrong to call filbinger a victim , ” she said . and the simon wiesenthal center , an international organization that hunts down nazi war criminals , has called on öttinger to resign .
“ the öttinger comments are absolutely incredible , ” efraim zuroff , director of the israeli chapter in jerusalem , told reuters news agency .
“ it is unacceptable for a german state premier to deny and whitewash the nazi past of an ex-leader and nazi judge , ” he said , “ and we call for his resignation . ” filbinger resigned over nazi past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filbinger -lrb- left -rrb- after his resignation in 1978 .
lothar spät succeeded him günther öttinger is a prominent political leader of the christian democratic union , which rules in coalition with the center-left social democratic party at the national level but enjoys a wide electoral margin in baden-württemberg , a predominantly conservative state .
in 2005 , öttinger was elected premier of this wealthy southern state and , eight days later , state party leader . for his part , hans filbinger was elected state premier of baden-württemberg in 1966 , and led the state for over a decade .

"
asked about the us plan to install part of the anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic , jung said : " i think it is good that in nato , as with the nato-russia council , we are working together to assuage possible doubts " .
although jung has voiced support for the us scheme , it is not a view that is universally backed within the german cabinet .
but he did insist it was important for the west " to work on a partnership basis with russia " on the matter , he added .
russia should be convinced of the argument so as " to reach an agreement for the protection of populations , for european populations in particular , " he said .
protective measure ? the united states has asked the czech republic to host a radar system and poland to host interceptor rockets as part of its missile defense plans .
washington insists the anti-missile shield is intended as protection against attacks from " rogue states " such as iran .
it points out that the proposed system would be useless against russia 's vast weapons arsenal .
but russia 's president vladimir putin has said it could spark a new arms race and that it was a needless distraction from the fight against terrorism .
preventing a nuclear iran jung also told the european deputies that every possible diplomatic effort should be made " to prevent iran from equipping itself with nuclear arms " .
he added : " it is vital for world peace .
the united states , russia , europe and china must work together . "
president putin had been very clear on one point , he continued . " it is also in russia 's interests that iran does not possess atomic weapons , " jung said .
on april 19 , at nato 's brussels headquarters , the 26 nato allies - including 21 eu member states - will discuss the anti-missile system in the north atlantic council and then with russia at a nato-russia meeting .
russia still critical putin has strongly criticized the plans for the us missile defesce system .
" why is it necessary to put military infrastructure on our border ?
it 's hardly connected to today 's global threats .
what is the real threat ?
terrorism , " putin told a security conference in munich in february .
that speech marked a further worsening of relations between moscow and washington under putin , who has tried to restore russia 's prestige since the economic collapse that followed the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nukes still a threat 50 years after first peace declaration the scientists who signed the göttinger declaration on april 12 , 1957 weren ’ t able to keep nuclear weapons from being stationed in germany .
fifty years later , activists are still campaigning for nuclear disarmament .

öttinger had caused a furor on wednesday when he eulogized filbinger , a former navy judge under the third reich , as an " opponent of the nazi regime . " in a statement , merkel said she wished that “ beyond honoring the great life ’ s work of premier hans filbinger , critical questions about the nazi era had also been posed . ”
she said this was especially important “ out of respect for the feelings of the victims ” of the nazi regime . öttinger had outraged political and religious leaders on wednesday when he claimed that “ there is no verdict that hans filbinger handed down that led to someone losing his life . ”
evidence directly contradicts this claim , as nazi-era documents show that filbinger was involved - as a judge and prosecutor - in death sentences against deserters during world war ii . öttinger claimed during the eulogy that filbinger was not a real nazi , but like millions of other germans was forced to bow to the pressure of the times . massive criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans filbinger : criminal or victim ?

“ he issued two death sentences .
it ’ s wrong to call filbinger a victim , ” she said . and the simon wiesenthal center , an international organization that hunts down nazi war criminals , has called on öttinger to resign .
“ the öttinger comments are absolutely incredible , ” efraim zuroff , director of the israeli chapter in jerusalem , told reuters news agency .

öttinger had caused a furor on wednesday when he eulogized filbinger , a former navy judge under the third reich , as an " opponent of the nazi regime . " in a statement , merkel said she wished that “ beyond honoring the great life ’ s work of premier hans filbinger , critical questions about the nazi era had also been posed . ”
she said this was especially important “ out of respect for the feelings of the victims ” of the nazi regime . öttinger had outraged political and religious leaders on wednesday when he claimed that “ there is no verdict that hans filbinger handed down that led to someone losing his life . ”
evidence directly contradicts this claim , as nazi-era documents show that filbinger was involved - as a judge and prosecutor - in death sentences against deserters during world war ii . öttinger claimed during the eulogy that filbinger was not a real nazi , but like millions of other germans was forced to bow to the pressure of the times . massive criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans filbinger : criminal or victim ?
in the state capital stuttgart , rabbi joel berger told the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger that öttinger “ better have damned good evidence for publicly claiming filbinger was an opponent of the nazi regime . ” the leader of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , went further , telling afp news service that öttinger ’ s claim was “ dangerous and , for the survivors , an insulting perversion of historical reality . ” öttinger also came under fire from social democrats and the opposition green party .
ute vogt , leader of the social democratic party in baden-württemberg , echoed knobloch ’ s view that öttinger “ is distorting history , ” she told german television .
“ he issued two death sentences .
it ’ s wrong to call filbinger a victim , ” she said . and the simon wiesenthal center , an international organization that hunts down nazi war criminals , has called on öttinger to resign .
“ the öttinger comments are absolutely incredible , ” efraim zuroff , director of the israeli chapter in jerusalem , told reuters news agency .
“ it is unacceptable for a german state premier to deny and whitewash the nazi past of an ex-leader and nazi judge , ” he said , “ and we call for his resignation . ” filbinger resigned over nazi past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filbinger -lrb- left -rrb- after his resignation in 1978 .
lothar spät succeeded him günther öttinger is a prominent political leader of the christian democratic union , which rules in coalition with the center-left social democratic party at the national level but enjoys a wide electoral margin in baden-württemberg , a predominantly conservative state .
in 2005 , öttinger was elected premier of this wealthy southern state and , eight days later , state party leader . for his part , hans filbinger was elected state premier of baden-württemberg in 1966 , and led the state for over a decade .
but in 1978 , he resigned after his role as a nazi judge came to light through a play by rolf hochhuth . filbinger never publicly expressed regret about his nazi past , and the state chapter of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has fiercely defended his record , naming him its honorary chairman in 1979 . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservative premier defends nazi-era judge a leading german conservative defended a notorious nazi-era judge at the man 's funeral , reaping criticism from germany 's central council of jews , among others .

" two days ago we asked the estonian authorities for a permit to measure the depth of the sea in estonian waters , " she added , according to baltic news service bns .
estonian sources contacted by deutsche presse-agentur dpa confirmed that an informal application has been received , but that more details would be needed before any permit could be issued .
" nord stream have to explain the purpose of the study : what they intend to do , the timetable and what they will need , " ehtel halliste , spokeswoman for the estonian foreign office , told dpa .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war two .
threat of environmental disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one is really sure where the undersea arms dumps are such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment , stroebaek said .
given estonian fears , any routing of the pipeline through estonian waters is likely to be welcomed in tallinn .
" if such an idea were to appear , it means we would automatically be part of the environmental impact assessment scheme , " gromov pointed out .
but the planned pipeline could equally meet with political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
eu 's eastern neighbors get nervous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas stand-off made everyone in europe jittery as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
the fact that the project - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - was negotiated by the two states without consulting the countries between them created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
and in recent months russia has harshly criticized estonian plans to move a red army monument from the centre of tallinn to a less prominent location - leaving many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
whatever the economic and political arguments , the pipeline 's route is likely to take some time to confirm .
according to halliste , once the estonian maritime agency receives an official application , it will have up to four months to decide on issuing a permit .
" when we have the permit from the estonian authorities , the measurement of the sea 's depth will take a few weeks .
we hope we will be ready to say whether we are going to estonia or not in late summer or early autumn , " stroebaek added . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltic sea pipeline consortium considers alternate routes the german-russian consortium planning a major gas pipeline in the baltic sea said it would investigate alternate routes for the project amid concerns that construction could disrupt the environment .

" two days ago we asked the estonian authorities for a permit to measure the depth of the sea in estonian waters , " she added , according to baltic news service bns .
estonian sources contacted by deutsche presse-agentur dpa confirmed that an informal application has been received , but that more details would be needed before any permit could be issued .
" nord stream have to explain the purpose of the study : what they intend to do , the timetable and what they will need , " ehtel halliste , spokeswoman for the estonian foreign office , told dpa .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war two .
threat of environmental disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one is really sure where the undersea arms dumps are such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment , stroebaek said .
given estonian fears , any routing of the pipeline through estonian waters is likely to be welcomed in tallinn .
" if such an idea were to appear , it means we would automatically be part of the environmental impact assessment scheme , " gromov pointed out .
but the planned pipeline could equally meet with political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
eu 's eastern neighbors get nervous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas stand-off made everyone in europe jittery as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
the fact that the project - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - was negotiated by the two states without consulting the countries between them created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
and in recent months russia has harshly criticized estonian plans to move a red army monument from the centre of tallinn to a less prominent location - leaving many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
whatever the economic and political arguments , the pipeline 's route is likely to take some time to confirm .
according to halliste , once the estonian maritime agency receives an official application , it will have up to four months to decide on issuing a permit .
" when we have the permit from the estonian authorities , the measurement of the sea 's depth will take a few weeks .
we hope we will be ready to say whether we are going to estonia or not in late summer or early autumn , " stroebaek added . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltic sea pipeline consortium considers alternate routes the german-russian consortium planning a major gas pipeline in the baltic sea said it would investigate alternate routes for the project amid concerns that construction could disrupt the environment .

"
asked about the us plan to install part of the anti-missile shield in poland and the czech republic , jung said : " i think it is good that in nato , as with the nato-russia council , we are working together to assuage possible doubts " .
although jung has voiced support for the us scheme , it is not a view that is universally backed within the german cabinet .
but he did insist it was important for the west " to work on a partnership basis with russia " on the matter , he added .
russia should be convinced of the argument so as " to reach an agreement for the protection of populations , for european populations in particular , " he said .
protective measure ? the united states has asked the czech republic to host a radar system and poland to host interceptor rockets as part of its missile defense plans .
washington insists the anti-missile shield is intended as protection against attacks from " rogue states " such as iran .
it points out that the proposed system would be useless against russia 's vast weapons arsenal .
but russia 's president vladimir putin has said it could spark a new arms race and that it was a needless distraction from the fight against terrorism .
preventing a nuclear iran jung also told the european deputies that every possible diplomatic effort should be made " to prevent iran from equipping itself with nuclear arms " .
he added : " it is vital for world peace .
the united states , russia , europe and china must work together . "
president putin had been very clear on one point , he continued . " it is also in russia 's interests that iran does not possess atomic weapons , " jung said .
on april 19 , at nato 's brussels headquarters , the 26 nato allies - including 21 eu member states - will discuss the anti-missile system in the north atlantic council and then with russia at a nato-russia meeting .
russia still critical putin has strongly criticized the plans for the us missile defesce system .
" why is it necessary to put military infrastructure on our border ?
it 's hardly connected to today 's global threats .
what is the real threat ?
terrorism , " putin told a security conference in munich in february .
that speech marked a further worsening of relations between moscow and washington under putin , who has tried to restore russia 's prestige since the economic collapse that followed the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nukes still a threat 50 years after first peace declaration the scientists who signed the göttinger declaration on april 12 , 1957 weren ’ t able to keep nuclear weapons from being stationed in germany .

" two days ago we asked the estonian authorities for a permit to measure the depth of the sea in estonian waters , " she added , according to baltic news service bns .
estonian sources contacted by deutsche presse-agentur dpa confirmed that an informal application has been received , but that more details would be needed before any permit could be issued .
" nord stream have to explain the purpose of the study : what they intend to do , the timetable and what they will need , " ehtel halliste , spokeswoman for the estonian foreign office , told dpa .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war two .
threat of environmental disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one is really sure where the undersea arms dumps are such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment , stroebaek said .
given estonian fears , any routing of the pipeline through estonian waters is likely to be welcomed in tallinn .
" if such an idea were to appear , it means we would automatically be part of the environmental impact assessment scheme , " gromov pointed out .
but the planned pipeline could equally meet with political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
eu 's eastern neighbors get nervous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas stand-off made everyone in europe jittery as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
the fact that the project - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - was negotiated by the two states without consulting the countries between them created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
and in recent months russia has harshly criticized estonian plans to move a red army monument from the centre of tallinn to a less prominent location - leaving many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
whatever the economic and political arguments , the pipeline 's route is likely to take some time to confirm .
according to halliste , once the estonian maritime agency receives an official application , it will have up to four months to decide on issuing a permit .
" when we have the permit from the estonian authorities , the measurement of the sea 's depth will take a few weeks .
we hope we will be ready to say whether we are going to estonia or not in late summer or early autumn , " stroebaek added . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltic sea pipeline consortium considers alternate routes the german-russian consortium planning a major gas pipeline in the baltic sea said it would investigate alternate routes for the project amid concerns that construction could disrupt the environment .

threat of environmental disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one is really sure where the undersea arms dumps are such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment , stroebaek said .
given estonian fears , any routing of the pipeline through estonian waters is likely to be welcomed in tallinn .
" if such an idea were to appear , it means we would automatically be part of the environmental impact assessment scheme , " gromov pointed out .
but the planned pipeline could equally meet with political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
eu 's eastern neighbors get nervous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas stand-off made everyone in europe jittery as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
the fact that the project - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - was negotiated by the two states without consulting the countries between them created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
and in recent months russia has harshly criticized estonian plans to move a red army monument from the centre of tallinn to a less prominent location - leaving many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
whatever the economic and political arguments , the pipeline 's route is likely to take some time to confirm .
according to halliste , once the estonian maritime agency receives an official application , it will have up to four months to decide on issuing a permit .
" when we have the permit from the estonian authorities , the measurement of the sea 's depth will take a few weeks .
we hope we will be ready to say whether we are going to estonia or not in late summer or early autumn , " stroebaek added . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltic sea pipeline consortium considers alternate routes the german-russian consortium planning a major gas pipeline in the baltic sea said it would investigate alternate routes for the project amid concerns that construction could disrupt the environment .
-lrb- 05.04.2007 -rrb- baltic pipeline creates waves in scandinavian countries finland is the latest country to express its displeasure at the planned route for the russian-german pipeline through the baltic sea .
helsinki wants more studies conducted before construction goes ahead .
-lrb- 03.03.2007 -rrb- baltic sea gas pipeline meets european resistance resistance to a planned russian gas pipeline in the baltic sea is growing in europe .
sweden is especially uneasy about the project .
besides environmental concerns , some swedish politicians fear it may be used for spying .

" but if you want to win the league , you have to win in mainz . " schalke coach mirko slomka has minor injury concerns with danish striker soren larsen twisting an ankle in training and halil altintop facing a fitness race to partner in-form striker kevin kuranyi up front .
" a win could be a major milestone for us on the road to the league title , " said slomka . schalke 's main hopes rest on the return of playmaker lincoln from a five-game suspension for the final six matches of the season .
" lincoln is back , he is extremely important for us , " said slomka .
the schalke coach also said he would be happy if bremen lose in dortmund , but that his team must do its own share : " we must win our games . " bitter rivals wish each other the best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi scored twice in the 4-0 win against mainz earlier this season schalke striker kevin kuranyi also hoped the royal blues ’ bitter rivals get a result : " i will never become a dortmund fan but i hope they get three points against bremen . " it only highlights a somewhat bizarre season that rabid local rivals dortmund also want schalke to win .
" it 's crazy , this time we are keeping our fingers crossed for schalke , " said dortmund defender christian wörns .
points for mainz could seriously jeopardize dortmund ’ s top-flight status . werder - who romped to a 4-1 win over az alkmaar in the uefa cup quarter-finals on thursday with miroslav klose ending his goal drought with a double - go to struggling dortmund on sunday , while bayern munich , in fourth , will be looking to put the hurt of their champions league exit behind them against bayer leverkusen on the same day . " it is still about first place .
but we have to win all our matches , " said munich midfielder owen hargreaves . stuttgart look to capitalize in saturday clash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the only way is up for stuttgart 's title hopefuls so third-placed vfb stuttgart 's coach armin veh knows his side must win at home to hanover on saturday in front of their faithful fans to keep the pressure on the sides above them . " hanover are a good counter-attacking side , " said veh .
" they proved that when they beat bayern munich 1-0 earlier this season , but we are confident and in good form .
you can see that at every training session and having 50,000 fans behind us will do the team no end of good , as it has all season . " stuttgart 's top-scorer mario gomez is on the mend after a knee injury , but is still several weeks away from a return . after parting company with ex-coach manager falko götz in midweek after plummeting down the table to ninth having gone nine games without a win , hertha berlin have karsten heine at the helm away to mid-table vfl bochum . relegation battle just as tight as title fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt and bielefeld resume hostilities on saturday in the day 's other games , there is a huge relegation tussle at arminia bielefeld against eintracht frankfurt with the clubs glaring at each other from either side of the relegation line . energie cottbus entertain vfl wolfsburg , with both sides in the hunt for a uefa cup place , while nuremburg should beat mid-table alemannia aachen to try and move up one place into fifth to claim a european place . bottom-side borussia mönchengladbach face hamburg at home on friday night and despite their ominous position six-points adrift at the foot of the table , 53,000 tickets have already been sold as the fans show their support . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen stroll into uefa cup semis as leverkusen crash out werder bremen thrashed az alkmaar 4-1 to reach the uefa cup semi-finals with miroslav klose breaking his short drought with two goals .

bayer leverkusen failed to overturn a 3-0 first leg deficit , losing 1-0 to osasuna . germany striker miroslav klose ended his goal drought in style at the weserstadion on thursday with a brace in werder bremen 's 4-1 win over az alkmaar which secured their place in the uefa cup semi-finals where they will meet espanyol .
the polish-born forward scored in the 36th minute to end his barren spell , which dated back to january 31 and lasted 1158 minutes , to add to tim borowski 's opener - which had been pegged back by moussa dembele 's excellent 32nd minute equalizer .
any doubts that werder - who almost put barcelona out in the champions league group stages - would not be in the final four were settled when klose added their third in the 62nd minute .
inspirational brazilian playmaker diego rounded off the scoring against the plucky dutch with a well deserved goal eight minutes from time , hitting home from the edge of the penalty area after playing a neat 1-2 with klose .
confident klose rediscovers his touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose displayed few signs of suffering from his drought werder coach thomas schaaf said the thought had never entered his mind that klose had lost his touch .
" miroslav always trained hard and never lost confidence , " said schaaf .
" his situation was never as catastrophic as people said .
he knew he had not lost his goal scoring talents and today his work paid off . "
the first half came to a boil after borowski netted in the 19th minute , escaping the attentions of an alkmaar defender to latch onto a delightful lobbed ball from diego to shoot into the far corner of the net .
alkmaar were far from cowed and captain and former glasgow rangers striker shota arveladze almost leveled with a splendid lob from outside the area which took a deflection for a corner .
the dutch side , though , did draw level as dembele produced a fierce left footed shot from just outside the box which beat the diving tim wiese in the left hand corner for his fourth goal of the campaign .
it had coach louis van gaal punching the air in delight , but the former barcelona and dutch national coach was not in the same mood when klose got on the end of aaron hunt 's pass across the five-yard line to score his first goal of the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego slams in his goal to make it 4-1 to werder indeed van gaal was in even more of a fury when what looked like a perfectly good goal was disallowed and he had several words with the fourth official over referee mike riley 's decision .
the hosts should have been 3-1 up a minute later as borowski squared the ball from the right but klose was only able to screw the ball over the bar .
the second half was as exciting an affair with werder 's naldo going agonizingly close with a rasping free kick but it was to be klose who closed things down for the german side .
again diego was the architect , the pocket-sized brazilian floating over an inch-perfect cross from the right for klose to send a diving header past the keeper and secure his brace , and bremen 's victory .
lackluster leverkusen crash out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen looked resigned to their fate from the start germany ’ s other uefa cup quarter-finalists bayer leverkusen couldn ’ t overturn the 3-0 deficit racked up in the first leg of their clash against spanish side osasuna and suffered further ignominy by losing the second game 1-0 .
osasuna midfielder juanlu gave the spaniards a deserved win when he steered in past rene adler from close range after the leverkusen keeper had palmed a roberto soldado shot into his path just after the hour .
a poor and lacklustre leverkusen side laboured against their opponents and only fashioned one serious attempt on goal when defender jan-ingwer callsen bracker had a header cleared off the line early in the second half .

bayer leverkusen failed to overturn a 3-0 first leg deficit , losing 1-0 to osasuna . germany striker miroslav klose ended his goal drought in style at the weserstadion on thursday with a brace in werder bremen 's 4-1 win over az alkmaar which secured their place in the uefa cup semi-finals where they will meet espanyol .
the polish-born forward scored in the 36th minute to end his barren spell , which dated back to january 31 and lasted 1158 minutes , to add to tim borowski 's opener - which had been pegged back by moussa dembele 's excellent 32nd minute equalizer .
any doubts that werder - who almost put barcelona out in the champions league group stages - would not be in the final four were settled when klose added their third in the 62nd minute .
inspirational brazilian playmaker diego rounded off the scoring against the plucky dutch with a well deserved goal eight minutes from time , hitting home from the edge of the penalty area after playing a neat 1-2 with klose .
confident klose rediscovers his touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose displayed few signs of suffering from his drought werder coach thomas schaaf said the thought had never entered his mind that klose had lost his touch .
" miroslav always trained hard and never lost confidence , " said schaaf .
" his situation was never as catastrophic as people said .
he knew he had not lost his goal scoring talents and today his work paid off . "
the first half came to a boil after borowski netted in the 19th minute , escaping the attentions of an alkmaar defender to latch onto a delightful lobbed ball from diego to shoot into the far corner of the net .
alkmaar were far from cowed and captain and former glasgow rangers striker shota arveladze almost leveled with a splendid lob from outside the area which took a deflection for a corner .
the dutch side , though , did draw level as dembele produced a fierce left footed shot from just outside the box which beat the diving tim wiese in the left hand corner for his fourth goal of the campaign .
it had coach louis van gaal punching the air in delight , but the former barcelona and dutch national coach was not in the same mood when klose got on the end of aaron hunt 's pass across the five-yard line to score his first goal of the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego slams in his goal to make it 4-1 to werder indeed van gaal was in even more of a fury when what looked like a perfectly good goal was disallowed and he had several words with the fourth official over referee mike riley 's decision .
the hosts should have been 3-1 up a minute later as borowski squared the ball from the right but klose was only able to screw the ball over the bar .
the second half was as exciting an affair with werder 's naldo going agonizingly close with a rasping free kick but it was to be klose who closed things down for the german side .

the committee 's backing sets the stage for a vote before the full parliament in a plenary session on may 10 in brussels and a final decision by eu telecoms ministers on june 7 in luxembourg .
" we are sending a very clear message to the consumers and telecom operators , " said the bill 's rapporteur , austrian conservative paul ruedig .
" it 's a good basis for our deliberations . "
the plans as adopted by the panel go even farther in the favor of consumers than original propositions from the european commission , which had proposed a 44-cent ceiling on outgoing calls made abroad in the eu and a 15-cent cap on incoming calls .
protecting consumers the eu 's executive arm hopes to see so-called roaming charges fall by as much as 70 percent , thanks to its plans to cap what operators charge customers at the retail level and what they charge each other at the wholesale level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu consumers could benefit from the price caps this summer already the commission drew up the plans to regulate roaming rates last year after finding evidence of huge variations between operators ' prices with roaming calls costing some times up to six times those of local mobile calls .
eu telecoms commissioner viviane reding , who has led the drive for regulation of roaming rates , hailed the committee 's support for her plans as " very good news for europe 's consumers . "
the beuc european consumers association said that while the plans " go in the right direction , " the price caps " are still too high and should be readjusted based on real costs . "
reding is aiming for the package to go into effect in summer so consumers can benefit from lower prices during the holidays abroad , although some eu lawmakers have said its application might not come until the autumn .
" in view of the emerging consensus on the new rules , an early entry into force of the eu roaming regulation is now a very realistic possibility , " she added .
industry up in arms the package has the industry , which argues that fierce competition has already driven down prices , up in arms and it has been lobbying hard to get the plans watered down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone companies can expect the caps to hurt the gsma trade association said that " retail price regulation is inappropriate and unprecedented on the basis of the principles of a market economy . "
it charged that the plans " will force european mobile operators to offer roaming services at below cost and give them no scope to compete with each other on price and on new services . "
the organization has been lobbying for a ceiling of at least 65 cents for outgoing calls abroad and 35 cents for incoming calls .
with roaming charges generating on average 10 percent of operators revenues , reding acknowledged that the regulations would prove to be painful for operators and would probably provoke a " correction " in the share prices . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bahn , vodafone team up on mobile payment scheme global wireless company vodafone will make a fresh foray into the micro-banking business , testing a mobile payment system in partnership with deutsche bahn , the companies announced at the weekend .

" europe 's foreign ministers should not miss the opportunity of their forthcoming meeting ... to restore the faith of palestinians in the european union , " oxfam international executive director jeremy hobbs said .
the ministers were due to hold their talks on april 23 and 24 in luxembourg .
" despite welcoming the national unity government , the european union has failed to restore aid payments , " he added in a statement from the british charity .
" with palestinian institutions collapsing and insecurity growing , the resumption of international aid to the palestinian authority is a necessary step to preventing further suffering and securing a just and lasting settlement on the basis of international law . "
the eu was the biggest aid donor to the palestinian government until the hamas militants came to power in march 2006 .
the quartet of middle east mediators - the european union , the united states , the united nations and russia - then suspended direct aid to the palestinian authority .
unethical and ineffective , says oxfam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty has increased , says oxfam since then , the 27-nation eu has redirected its aid , worth 700 million euros -lrb- $ 943 million -rrb- in 2006 , through a special mechanism to help the neediest people while bypassing the government to avoid contact with hamas .
hobbs said that suspending aid and withholding tax revenue was both unethical and ineffective as a policy tool .
" parents have been driven into debt , children taken out of classrooms and whole families deprived of access to medicine and healthcare , " he added .
services meltdown a survey commissioned by oxfam from the palestinian center for public opinion -lrb- pcpo -rrb- found that more than four out of five of 677 families interviewed have seen a drop in their income following the boycott .
half of all the families reported losing more than half their income , a statement from oxfam said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worsening factional violence has made the streets even more dangerous " the number of palestinian people living in poverty has jumped by 30 percent , essential services are facing meltdown , and previously unknown levels of factional violence plague palestinian streets , " the survey said .
ninety percent of the senior managers running schools , hospitals and water services across the west bank and gaza reported that services had been undermined by the boycott .
" the national unity government remains a fragile creation that could collapse without financial support , leading to even greater insecurity , " the report said .
" the occupied palestinian territories risk becoming a ' failed state , ' destroying the chances of achieving a two-state solution .

the committee 's backing sets the stage for a vote before the full parliament in a plenary session on may 10 in brussels and a final decision by eu telecoms ministers on june 7 in luxembourg .
" we are sending a very clear message to the consumers and telecom operators , " said the bill 's rapporteur , austrian conservative paul ruedig .
" it 's a good basis for our deliberations . "
the plans as adopted by the panel go even farther in the favor of consumers than original propositions from the european commission , which had proposed a 44-cent ceiling on outgoing calls made abroad in the eu and a 15-cent cap on incoming calls .
protecting consumers the eu 's executive arm hopes to see so-called roaming charges fall by as much as 70 percent , thanks to its plans to cap what operators charge customers at the retail level and what they charge each other at the wholesale level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu consumers could benefit from the price caps this summer already the commission drew up the plans to regulate roaming rates last year after finding evidence of huge variations between operators ' prices with roaming calls costing some times up to six times those of local mobile calls .
eu telecoms commissioner viviane reding , who has led the drive for regulation of roaming rates , hailed the committee 's support for her plans as " very good news for europe 's consumers . "
the beuc european consumers association said that while the plans " go in the right direction , " the price caps " are still too high and should be readjusted based on real costs . "
reding is aiming for the package to go into effect in summer so consumers can benefit from lower prices during the holidays abroad , although some eu lawmakers have said its application might not come until the autumn .
" in view of the emerging consensus on the new rules , an early entry into force of the eu roaming regulation is now a very realistic possibility , " she added .
industry up in arms the package has the industry , which argues that fierce competition has already driven down prices , up in arms and it has been lobbying hard to get the plans watered down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone companies can expect the caps to hurt the gsma trade association said that " retail price regulation is inappropriate and unprecedented on the basis of the principles of a market economy . "
it charged that the plans " will force european mobile operators to offer roaming services at below cost and give them no scope to compete with each other on price and on new services . "
the organization has been lobbying for a ceiling of at least 65 cents for outgoing calls abroad and 35 cents for incoming calls .
with roaming charges generating on average 10 percent of operators revenues , reding acknowledged that the regulations would prove to be painful for operators and would probably provoke a " correction " in the share prices . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bahn , vodafone team up on mobile payment scheme global wireless company vodafone will make a fresh foray into the micro-banking business , testing a mobile payment system in partnership with deutsche bahn , the companies announced at the weekend .
-lrb- 19.03.2007 -rrb- eu hopes for summer deal on mobile phone roaming rates eu telecoms ministers have reached broad agreement on trimming the high cost of using mobile phones abroad , raising hopes for a " roaming fees " deal to be sealed by the end of june .

" two days ago we asked the estonian authorities for a permit to measure the depth of the sea in estonian waters , " she added , according to baltic news service bns .
estonian sources contacted by deutsche presse-agentur dpa confirmed that an informal application has been received , but that more details would be needed before any permit could be issued .
" nord stream have to explain the purpose of the study : what they intend to do , the timetable and what they will need , " ehtel halliste , spokeswoman for the estonian foreign office , told dpa .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war two .
threat of environmental disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one is really sure where the undersea arms dumps are such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment , stroebaek said .
given estonian fears , any routing of the pipeline through estonian waters is likely to be welcomed in tallinn .
" if such an idea were to appear , it means we would automatically be part of the environmental impact assessment scheme , " gromov pointed out .
but the planned pipeline could equally meet with political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
eu 's eastern neighbors get nervous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas stand-off made everyone in europe jittery as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
the fact that the project - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - was negotiated by the two states without consulting the countries between them created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
and in recent months russia has harshly criticized estonian plans to move a red army monument from the centre of tallinn to a less prominent location - leaving many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
whatever the economic and political arguments , the pipeline 's route is likely to take some time to confirm .
according to halliste , once the estonian maritime agency receives an official application , it will have up to four months to decide on issuing a permit .
" when we have the permit from the estonian authorities , the measurement of the sea 's depth will take a few weeks .

estonian sources contacted by deutsche presse-agentur dpa confirmed that an informal application has been received , but that more details would be needed before any permit could be issued .
" nord stream have to explain the purpose of the study : what they intend to do , the timetable and what they will need , " ehtel halliste , spokeswoman for the estonian foreign office , told dpa .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war two .
threat of environmental disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one is really sure where the undersea arms dumps are such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment , stroebaek said .
given estonian fears , any routing of the pipeline through estonian waters is likely to be welcomed in tallinn .
" if such an idea were to appear , it means we would automatically be part of the environmental impact assessment scheme , " gromov pointed out .
but the planned pipeline could equally meet with political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
eu 's eastern neighbors get nervous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas stand-off made everyone in europe jittery as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
the fact that the project - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - was negotiated by the two states without consulting the countries between them created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
and in recent months russia has harshly criticized estonian plans to move a red army monument from the centre of tallinn to a less prominent location - leaving many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
whatever the economic and political arguments , the pipeline 's route is likely to take some time to confirm .
according to halliste , once the estonian maritime agency receives an official application , it will have up to four months to decide on issuing a permit .
" when we have the permit from the estonian authorities , the measurement of the sea 's depth will take a few weeks .
we hope we will be ready to say whether we are going to estonia or not in late summer or early autumn , " stroebaek added . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltic sea pipeline consortium considers alternate routes the german-russian consortium planning a major gas pipeline in the baltic sea said it would investigate alternate routes for the project amid concerns that construction could disrupt the environment .

" europe 's foreign ministers should not miss the opportunity of their forthcoming meeting ... to restore the faith of palestinians in the european union , " oxfam international executive director jeremy hobbs said .
the ministers were due to hold their talks on april 23 and 24 in luxembourg .
" despite welcoming the national unity government , the european union has failed to restore aid payments , " he added in a statement from the british charity .
" with palestinian institutions collapsing and insecurity growing , the resumption of international aid to the palestinian authority is a necessary step to preventing further suffering and securing a just and lasting settlement on the basis of international law . "
the eu was the biggest aid donor to the palestinian government until the hamas militants came to power in march 2006 .
the quartet of middle east mediators - the european union , the united states , the united nations and russia - then suspended direct aid to the palestinian authority .
unethical and ineffective , says oxfam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty has increased , says oxfam since then , the 27-nation eu has redirected its aid , worth 700 million euros -lrb- $ 943 million -rrb- in 2006 , through a special mechanism to help the neediest people while bypassing the government to avoid contact with hamas .
hobbs said that suspending aid and withholding tax revenue was both unethical and ineffective as a policy tool .
" parents have been driven into debt , children taken out of classrooms and whole families deprived of access to medicine and healthcare , " he added .
services meltdown a survey commissioned by oxfam from the palestinian center for public opinion -lrb- pcpo -rrb- found that more than four out of five of 677 families interviewed have seen a drop in their income following the boycott .
half of all the families reported losing more than half their income , a statement from oxfam said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worsening factional violence has made the streets even more dangerous " the number of palestinian people living in poverty has jumped by 30 percent , essential services are facing meltdown , and previously unknown levels of factional violence plague palestinian streets , " the survey said .
ninety percent of the senior managers running schools , hospitals and water services across the west bank and gaza reported that services had been undermined by the boycott .
" the national unity government remains a fragile creation that could collapse without financial support , leading to even greater insecurity , " the report said .
" the occupied palestinian territories risk becoming a ' failed state , ' destroying the chances of achieving a two-state solution . " dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says no to aiding palestinian unity government new palestinian finance minister salam fayyad has failed to convince the european union to agree to resume aid to the palestinian authority despite what he called a " very acute financial crisis " .

one of the main benefactors of the solar boom is eastern germany , which has long been under an economic shadow . although germans are renowned for spending much of their six weeks of annual vacation in sunnier climes to escape the frequent gray skies and rain of home , solar energy is turning out to be one of the country 's fastest-growing sectors and could be the light at the end of the tunnel for the struggling east .
the eastern city of frankfurt an der oder is turning into one of the main beneficiaries of the solar upsurge , with three solar production facilities planned for the region .
one , being built by the green energy company conergy , is scheduled to go online in october or november .
inside the shell of a chip factory that never got off the ground another in a long string of economic disappointments for the region workers are busy putting in machines that cut and clean silicon .
when up and running toward the end of this year , conergy hopes to produce about 1.2 million photovoltaic modules , which convert the sun 's energy into electricity , per year and employ around 600 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a welder at the conergy plant in frankfurt an der oder for frankfurt , which symbolizes the economic woes of eastern germany in the wake of reunification , the news of new jobs was like bread for the starving .
" we had a job forum in december , where we and the other two solar companies presented ourselves , " said andreas von brandemer , the plant director at this new location .
" afterwards we had 5,000 people applying for a job in our factory .
the hr people had a lot to do . "
only 100 jobs were on offer at the time , although von brandermer says if all goes to plan , conergy hopes to build a second factory in the city in 2009 and will employ around 1,000 .
germany 's biggest solar company , bonn-based solarworld , is also expanding its presence in the east .
expansion plans at its state-of-the-art production facility in freiburg , in the eastern state of saxony , have a price tag in the hundreds of millions of euros .
" solar valley " eastern germany is attractive so many solar players that it 's been dubbed , perhaps inevitably , " solar valley . "
it is attractive to investors for several reasons : wages in the east are lower then they are in western germany ; massive investment in the years since reunification means the infrastructure is excellent ; and eastern german cities have been generous with tax incentives to lure companies .
but another important reason for potential investors has been the hometown workforce .
frankfurt an der oder was the home of east germany 's semiconductor industry .
the region already has a skilled workforce , although many of those who used to work in the gdr-era semiconductor industry have been out of work for years or been forced to enter different industries .
many are ready to return .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels in the eastern state of brandenburg " so you already have a lot of skilled , knowledgeable workers in the field of handling silicon and that 's a major point for companies considering investing in eastern germany , " said nicholas dobrott , director of renewable energies for the industrial investment council .
andreas kritzski is one of them .
he worked in frankfurt 's semiconductor factory in the gdr era , but lost his job with the plant closed .
he entered retraining programs in construction , did some work in western germany , then lost other jobs as firms folded .
he was out of work for several years before starting at conergy about a month ago .
" the recovery is finally coming , like it was announced all those years ago , " he said .
" people are sending in their applications and waiting excitedly .
like i did , a lot of looking on the internet to find out how solar energy works . "
enough sun although it might be counterintuitive , photovoltaic cells can operate just fine under cloudy skies , since despite the grayness of a rainy day , there is still solar radiation in the air , otherwise it would be dark .
while the sunniest spots in the world , like the sahara desert , have a solar energy potential of about two thousand kilowatt hours per square meter per year , germany 's manages a respectable one thousand , according to henner weithöner of solarpraxis , a company that tracks germany 's solar sector .
" this shows how much even germany or parts of northern europe , how much solar energy we have and what huge potential , " he said .
" we just have to use it . "
germans ' general environmental consciousness has also helped the country take the solar lead .
the green party is a strong presence on the political stage , having been part of the previous governing coalition headed by chancellor gerhard schröder .
renewables law experts say that that administration 's passage of the renewable energies law in 2000 was the momentum behind the current solar surge .

it set up generous rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid , and created a market for solar energy .
last year , the solar industry had sales of 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- and employs 53,000 .
according to a report in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , a study carried out by the munich-based consulting firm roland berger estimates that by 2020 , more people could be employed in the environment-related sector than are in the auto industry and engineering .
there are still hurdles to be overcome , especially around the issue of price , and bringing it down .
estimates are that electricity from photovoltaics still needs ten years to become competitive with energy from traditional sources like coal or nuclear .
but solar companies are n't waiting .
they are continuing to invest , counting on technology to eventually bring those prices down .

one of the main benefactors of the solar boom is eastern germany , which has long been under an economic shadow . although germans are renowned for spending much of their six weeks of annual vacation in sunnier climes to escape the frequent gray skies and rain of home , solar energy is turning out to be one of the country 's fastest-growing sectors and could be the light at the end of the tunnel for the struggling east .
the eastern city of frankfurt an der oder is turning into one of the main beneficiaries of the solar upsurge , with three solar production facilities planned for the region .
one , being built by the green energy company conergy , is scheduled to go online in october or november .
inside the shell of a chip factory that never got off the ground another in a long string of economic disappointments for the region workers are busy putting in machines that cut and clean silicon .
when up and running toward the end of this year , conergy hopes to produce about 1.2 million photovoltaic modules , which convert the sun 's energy into electricity , per year and employ around 600 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a welder at the conergy plant in frankfurt an der oder for frankfurt , which symbolizes the economic woes of eastern germany in the wake of reunification , the news of new jobs was like bread for the starving .
" we had a job forum in december , where we and the other two solar companies presented ourselves , " said andreas von brandemer , the plant director at this new location .
" afterwards we had 5,000 people applying for a job in our factory .
the hr people had a lot to do . "
only 100 jobs were on offer at the time , although von brandermer says if all goes to plan , conergy hopes to build a second factory in the city in 2009 and will employ around 1,000 .
germany 's biggest solar company , bonn-based solarworld , is also expanding its presence in the east .
expansion plans at its state-of-the-art production facility in freiburg , in the eastern state of saxony , have a price tag in the hundreds of millions of euros .
" solar valley " eastern germany is attractive so many solar players that it 's been dubbed , perhaps inevitably , " solar valley . "
it is attractive to investors for several reasons : wages in the east are lower then they are in western germany ; massive investment in the years since reunification means the infrastructure is excellent ; and eastern german cities have been generous with tax incentives to lure companies .
but another important reason for potential investors has been the hometown workforce .
frankfurt an der oder was the home of east germany 's semiconductor industry .
the region already has a skilled workforce , although many of those who used to work in the gdr-era semiconductor industry have been out of work for years or been forced to enter different industries .
many are ready to return .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels in the eastern state of brandenburg " so you already have a lot of skilled , knowledgeable workers in the field of handling silicon and that 's a major point for companies considering investing in eastern germany , " said nicholas dobrott , director of renewable energies for the industrial investment council .
andreas kritzski is one of them .
he worked in frankfurt 's semiconductor factory in the gdr era , but lost his job with the plant closed .
he entered retraining programs in construction , did some work in western germany , then lost other jobs as firms folded .
he was out of work for several years before starting at conergy about a month ago .
" the recovery is finally coming , like it was announced all those years ago , " he said .
" people are sending in their applications and waiting excitedly .
like i did , a lot of looking on the internet to find out how solar energy works . "
enough sun although it might be counterintuitive , photovoltaic cells can operate just fine under cloudy skies , since despite the grayness of a rainy day , there is still solar radiation in the air , otherwise it would be dark .
while the sunniest spots in the world , like the sahara desert , have a solar energy potential of about two thousand kilowatt hours per square meter per year , germany 's manages a respectable one thousand , according to henner weithöner of solarpraxis , a company that tracks germany 's solar sector .
" this shows how much even germany or parts of northern europe , how much solar energy we have and what huge potential , " he said .
" we just have to use it . "
germans ' general environmental consciousness has also helped the country take the solar lead .
the green party is a strong presence on the political stage , having been part of the previous governing coalition headed by chancellor gerhard schröder .
renewables law experts say that that administration 's passage of the renewable energies law in 2000 was the momentum behind the current solar surge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge solar facility near the eastern city of leipzig with around 33.500 solar modules the legislation committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 .
it set up generous rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid , and created a market for solar energy .
last year , the solar industry had sales of 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- and employs 53,000 .
according to a report in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , a study carried out by the munich-based consulting firm roland berger estimates that by 2020 , more people could be employed in the environment-related sector than are in the auto industry and engineering .
there are still hurdles to be overcome , especially around the issue of price , and bringing it down .
estimates are that electricity from photovoltaics still needs ten years to become competitive with energy from traditional sources like coal or nuclear .
but solar companies are n't waiting .
they are continuing to invest , counting on technology to eventually bring those prices down .
" if you build up a solar company , lots of manpower is needed , " said weithöner of solarpraxis .

the committee 's backing sets the stage for a vote before the full parliament in a plenary session on may 10 in brussels and a final decision by eu telecoms ministers on june 7 in luxembourg .
" we are sending a very clear message to the consumers and telecom operators , " said the bill 's rapporteur , austrian conservative paul ruedig .
" it 's a good basis for our deliberations . "
the plans as adopted by the panel go even farther in the favor of consumers than original propositions from the european commission , which had proposed a 44-cent ceiling on outgoing calls made abroad in the eu and a 15-cent cap on incoming calls .
protecting consumers the eu 's executive arm hopes to see so-called roaming charges fall by as much as 70 percent , thanks to its plans to cap what operators charge customers at the retail level and what they charge each other at the wholesale level .

eu telecoms commissioner viviane reding , who has led the drive for regulation of roaming rates , hailed the committee 's support for her plans as " very good news for europe 's consumers . "
the beuc european consumers association said that while the plans " go in the right direction , " the price caps " are still too high and should be readjusted based on real costs . "
reding is aiming for the package to go into effect in summer so consumers can benefit from lower prices during the holidays abroad , although some eu lawmakers have said its application might not come until the autumn .
" in view of the emerging consensus on the new rules , an early entry into force of the eu roaming regulation is now a very realistic possibility , " she added .

the organization has been lobbying for a ceiling of at least 65 cents for outgoing calls abroad and 35 cents for incoming calls .

the committee 's backing sets the stage for a vote before the full parliament in a plenary session on may 10 in brussels and a final decision by eu telecoms ministers on june 7 in luxembourg .
" we are sending a very clear message to the consumers and telecom operators , " said the bill 's rapporteur , austrian conservative paul ruedig .
" it 's a good basis for our deliberations . "
the plans as adopted by the panel go even farther in the favor of consumers than original propositions from the european commission , which had proposed a 44-cent ceiling on outgoing calls made abroad in the eu and a 15-cent cap on incoming calls .
protecting consumers the eu 's executive arm hopes to see so-called roaming charges fall by as much as 70 percent , thanks to its plans to cap what operators charge customers at the retail level and what they charge each other at the wholesale level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu consumers could benefit from the price caps this summer already the commission drew up the plans to regulate roaming rates last year after finding evidence of huge variations between operators ' prices with roaming calls costing some times up to six times those of local mobile calls .
eu telecoms commissioner viviane reding , who has led the drive for regulation of roaming rates , hailed the committee 's support for her plans as " very good news for europe 's consumers . "
the beuc european consumers association said that while the plans " go in the right direction , " the price caps " are still too high and should be readjusted based on real costs . "
reding is aiming for the package to go into effect in summer so consumers can benefit from lower prices during the holidays abroad , although some eu lawmakers have said its application might not come until the autumn .
" in view of the emerging consensus on the new rules , an early entry into force of the eu roaming regulation is now a very realistic possibility , " she added .
industry up in arms the package has the industry , which argues that fierce competition has already driven down prices , up in arms and it has been lobbying hard to get the plans watered down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone companies can expect the caps to hurt the gsma trade association said that " retail price regulation is inappropriate and unprecedented on the basis of the principles of a market economy . "
it charged that the plans " will force european mobile operators to offer roaming services at below cost and give them no scope to compete with each other on price and on new services . "
the organization has been lobbying for a ceiling of at least 65 cents for outgoing calls abroad and 35 cents for incoming calls .
with roaming charges generating on average 10 percent of operators revenues , reding acknowledged that the regulations would prove to be painful for operators and would probably provoke a " correction " in the share prices . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bahn , vodafone team up on mobile payment scheme global wireless company vodafone will make a fresh foray into the micro-banking business , testing a mobile payment system in partnership with deutsche bahn , the companies announced at the weekend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.04.2007 german solar boom shines its light on depressed east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one study says by 2020 , more people could work in solar and related branches than in the car industry german accounts for 55 percent of global solar electricity production and is the world 's market leader .
one of the main benefactors of the solar boom is eastern germany , which has long been under an economic shadow . although germans are renowned for spending much of their six weeks of annual vacation in sunnier climes to escape the frequent gray skies and rain of home , solar energy is turning out to be one of the country 's fastest-growing sectors and could be the light at the end of the tunnel for the struggling east .
the eastern city of frankfurt an der oder is turning into one of the main beneficiaries of the solar upsurge , with three solar production facilities planned for the region .
one , being built by the green energy company conergy , is scheduled to go online in october or november .
inside the shell of a chip factory that never got off the ground another in a long string of economic disappointments for the region workers are busy putting in machines that cut and clean silicon .
when up and running toward the end of this year , conergy hopes to produce about 1.2 million photovoltaic modules , which convert the sun 's energy into electricity , per year and employ around 600 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a welder at the conergy plant in frankfurt an der oder for frankfurt , which symbolizes the economic woes of eastern germany in the wake of reunification , the news of new jobs was like bread for the starving .
" we had a job forum in december , where we and the other two solar companies presented ourselves , " said andreas von brandemer , the plant director at this new location .
" afterwards we had 5,000 people applying for a job in our factory .
the hr people had a lot to do . "
only 100 jobs were on offer at the time , although von brandermer says if all goes to plan , conergy hopes to build a second factory in the city in 2009 and will employ around 1,000 .
germany 's biggest solar company , bonn-based solarworld , is also expanding its presence in the east .
expansion plans at its state-of-the-art production facility in freiburg , in the eastern state of saxony , have a price tag in the hundreds of millions of euros .
" solar valley " eastern germany is attractive so many solar players that it 's been dubbed , perhaps inevitably , " solar valley . "
it is attractive to investors for several reasons : wages in the east are lower then they are in western germany ; massive investment in the years since reunification means the infrastructure is excellent ; and eastern german cities have been generous with tax incentives to lure companies .
but another important reason for potential investors has been the hometown workforce .
frankfurt an der oder was the home of east germany 's semiconductor industry .
the region already has a skilled workforce , although many of those who used to work in the gdr-era semiconductor industry have been out of work for years or been forced to enter different industries .
many are ready to return .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels in the eastern state of brandenburg " so you already have a lot of skilled , knowledgeable workers in the field of handling silicon and that 's a major point for companies considering investing in eastern germany , " said nicholas dobrott , director of renewable energies for the industrial investment council .
andreas kritzski is one of them .
he worked in frankfurt 's semiconductor factory in the gdr era , but lost his job with the plant closed .
he entered retraining programs in construction , did some work in western germany , then lost other jobs as firms folded .
he was out of work for several years before starting at conergy about a month ago .
" the recovery is finally coming , like it was announced all those years ago , " he said .
" people are sending in their applications and waiting excitedly .
like i did , a lot of looking on the internet to find out how solar energy works . "
enough sun although it might be counterintuitive , photovoltaic cells can operate just fine under cloudy skies , since despite the grayness of a rainy day , there is still solar radiation in the air , otherwise it would be dark .
while the sunniest spots in the world , like the sahara desert , have a solar energy potential of about two thousand kilowatt hours per square meter per year , germany 's manages a respectable one thousand , according to henner weithöner of solarpraxis , a company that tracks germany 's solar sector .
" this shows how much even germany or parts of northern europe , how much solar energy we have and what huge potential , " he said .
" we just have to use it . "
germans ' general environmental consciousness has also helped the country take the solar lead .
the green party is a strong presence on the political stage , having been part of the previous governing coalition headed by chancellor gerhard schröder .
renewables law experts say that that administration 's passage of the renewable energies law in 2000 was the momentum behind the current solar surge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge solar facility near the eastern city of leipzig with around 33.500 solar modules the legislation committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 .
it set up generous rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid , and created a market for solar energy .
last year , the solar industry had sales of 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- and employs 53,000 .
according to a report in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , a study carried out by the munich-based consulting firm roland berger estimates that by 2020 , more people could be employed in the environment-related sector than are in the auto industry and engineering .
there are still hurdles to be overcome , especially around the issue of price , and bringing it down .
estimates are that electricity from photovoltaics still needs ten years to become competitive with energy from traditional sources like coal or nuclear .
but solar companies are n't waiting .
they are continuing to invest , counting on technology to eventually bring those prices down .
" if you build up a solar company , lots of manpower is needed , " said weithöner of solarpraxis .
" it is a real job engine for the eastern states .

" europe 's foreign ministers should not miss the opportunity of their forthcoming meeting ... to restore the faith of palestinians in the european union , " oxfam international executive director jeremy hobbs said .
the ministers were due to hold their talks on april 23 and 24 in luxembourg .
" despite welcoming the national unity government , the european union has failed to restore aid payments , " he added in a statement from the british charity .
" with palestinian institutions collapsing and insecurity growing , the resumption of international aid to the palestinian authority is a necessary step to preventing further suffering and securing a just and lasting settlement on the basis of international law . "
the eu was the biggest aid donor to the palestinian government until the hamas militants came to power in march 2006 .
the quartet of middle east mediators - the european union , the united states , the united nations and russia - then suspended direct aid to the palestinian authority .
unethical and ineffective , says oxfam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty has increased , says oxfam since then , the 27-nation eu has redirected its aid , worth 700 million euros -lrb- $ 943 million -rrb- in 2006 , through a special mechanism to help the neediest people while bypassing the government to avoid contact with hamas .
hobbs said that suspending aid and withholding tax revenue was both unethical and ineffective as a policy tool .
" parents have been driven into debt , children taken out of classrooms and whole families deprived of access to medicine and healthcare , " he added .
services meltdown a survey commissioned by oxfam from the palestinian center for public opinion -lrb- pcpo -rrb- found that more than four out of five of 677 families interviewed have seen a drop in their income following the boycott .
half of all the families reported losing more than half their income , a statement from oxfam said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worsening factional violence has made the streets even more dangerous " the number of palestinian people living in poverty has jumped by 30 percent , essential services are facing meltdown , and previously unknown levels of factional violence plague palestinian streets , " the survey said .
ninety percent of the senior managers running schools , hospitals and water services across the west bank and gaza reported that services had been undermined by the boycott .
" the national unity government remains a fragile creation that could collapse without financial support , leading to even greater insecurity , " the report said .
" the occupied palestinian territories risk becoming a ' failed state , ' destroying the chances of achieving a two-state solution .

in a rare press conference at the army headquarters , general yasar buyukanit pushed on thursday for a cross-border operation into northern iraq to crack down on turkish kurd rebels he said had sought refuge there .
general buyukanit said that it was necessary to launch a cross-border military operation against pkk rebels based in northern iraq there , but that this would require political authorization .

turkey has accused iraqi kurds of tolerating , and even backing the kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has waged a bloody campaign for kurdish self-rule in turkey 's southeast since 1984 .

" we want a dialogue , but those responsible in turkey are not ready for one , " al-mufti added .
when asked why the kurdish authorities , who control three provinces in northern iraq , have not taken action against pkk rebels , al-mufti said that " the situation in iraq is altogether too unstable ; therefore we can not take steps against this party . "
the turkish government has repeatedly called on the united states and iraq to launch its own operations against the pkk in northern iraq .
the organization is black-listed as a terrorist organization by both the us and the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.04.2007 bitterly disputed german-russian gas pipeline heads for estonia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns that the pipeline may disturb world war ii weapons dumped in the sea a controversial pipeline to carry russian gas under the baltic sea to germany could run through estonian waters , an official from the consortium behind the project said on friday . the nord stream consortium " sees a possibility that the pipeline could go through estonian waters , " spokeswoman neel stroebaek told reporters .
" two days ago we asked the estonian authorities for a permit to measure the depth of the sea in estonian waters , " she added , according to baltic news service bns .
estonian sources contacted by deutsche presse-agentur dpa confirmed that an informal application has been received , but that more details would be needed before any permit could be issued .
" nord stream have to explain the purpose of the study : what they intend to do , the timetable and what they will need , " ehtel halliste , spokeswoman for the estonian foreign office , told dpa .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war two .
threat of environmental disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one is really sure where the undersea arms dumps are such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment , stroebaek said .
given estonian fears , any routing of the pipeline through estonian waters is likely to be welcomed in tallinn .
" if such an idea were to appear , it means we would automatically be part of the environmental impact assessment scheme , " gromov pointed out .
but the planned pipeline could equally meet with political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
eu 's eastern neighbors get nervous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas stand-off made everyone in europe jittery as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
the fact that the project - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - was negotiated by the two states without consulting the countries between them created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
and in recent months russia has harshly criticized estonian plans to move a red army monument from the centre of tallinn to a less prominent location - leaving many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
whatever the economic and political arguments , the pipeline 's route is likely to take some time to confirm .
according to halliste , once the estonian maritime agency receives an official application , it will have up to four months to decide on issuing a permit .
" when we have the permit from the estonian authorities , the measurement of the sea 's depth will take a few weeks .
we hope we will be ready to say whether we are going to estonia or not in late summer or early autumn , " stroebaek added . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltic sea pipeline consortium considers alternate routes the german-russian consortium planning a major gas pipeline in the baltic sea said it would investigate alternate routes for the project amid concerns that construction could disrupt the environment .

" a win could be a major milestone for us on the road to the league title , " said slomka . schalke 's main hopes rest on the return of playmaker lincoln from a five-game suspension for the final six matches of the season .
" lincoln is back , he is extremely important for us , " said slomka .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.04.2007 eu urges restraint over turkish talk of kurdish crackdown großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has been clamping down on kurds and pkk supporters at home and abroad the european commission urged turkey on friday to play a " constructive " role in iraq a day after turkey 's army chief called for a military incursion into northern iraq to hunt turkish kurd rebels . " the stability of iraq is in our common interest , " commission spokeswoman krisztina nagy told reporters in brussels .
" the eu recognizes the constructive role turkey plays in the area and in this context it is important that turkey continues to play such a positive role , " she added .
" the eu is following the situation in the region very closely , " said nagy .
" our hope and the interest of all involved is that possible differences are dealt with in a peaceful and constructive manner . "
in a rare press conference at the army headquarters , general yasar buyukanit pushed on thursday for a cross-border operation into northern iraq to crack down on turkish kurd rebels he said had sought refuge there .
general buyukanit said that it was necessary to launch a cross-border military operation against pkk rebels based in northern iraq there , but that this would require political authorization .
" it is necessary to launch an operation into iraq , " buyukanit told reporters .
" the pkk has huge freedom of movement in iraq . "
missions within turkey target returning fighters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish troops in northern iraq in 2005 he also said the military had launched a number of large-scale operations against kurdish rebels in south-east turkey .
buyukanit said the operations had been launched as snow melting in mountain passes made it easier for pkk rebels to enter turkey from neighboring iraq .
turkey has accused iraqi kurds of tolerating , and even backing the kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has waged a bloody campaign for kurdish self-rule in turkey 's southeast since 1984 .
the conflict has claimed some 37,000 lives .
the turkish military has claimed there are around 5,000 pkk guerrillas based in camps in mountainous northern iraq .
ankara says thousands of militants of the pkk enjoy unrestricted movement in northern iraq and are able to obtain weapons and explosives there .
the group is listed as a terrorist group by turkey and much of the international community .
iraqi kurds taking threats very seriously the kurds in northern iraq are taking the threats by the turkish army to launch a military offensive against kurdish rebels seriously , the president of the autonomous kurdish parliament said friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military has clashed with rebels in southern turkey adnan al-mufti told reporters in arbil , northern iraq that " these threats are nothing new for us , we take them seriously . "
he said the authorities in the autonomous kurdish region of northern iraq would seek the support of the iraqi government .
" we want a dialogue , but those responsible in turkey are not ready for one , " al-mufti added .
when asked why the kurdish authorities , who control three provinces in northern iraq , have not taken action against pkk rebels , al-mufti said that " the situation in iraq is altogether too unstable ; therefore we can not take steps against this party . "
the turkish government has repeatedly called on the united states and iraq to launch its own operations against the pkk in northern iraq .
the organization is black-listed as a terrorist organization by both the us and the eu .
on friday the president of the iraqi parliament mahmoud al- mashhadani warned that all those foreign powers that had a hand in iraq 's internal affairs would have " the hand hacked off . "
observers interpreted this statement as referring to the turkish military threats to intervene in northern iraq . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence feeds doubts on turkey 's eu bid on the verge of opening eu accession talks , turkey is facing growing violence from kurdish separatists and growing opposition from within europe , potentially jeopardizing ankara 's bid to join the bloc .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.04.2007 eu urges restraint over turkish talk of kurdish crackdown großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has been clamping down on kurds and pkk supporters at home and abroad the european commission urged turkey on friday to play a " constructive " role in iraq a day after turkey 's army chief called for a military incursion into northern iraq to hunt turkish kurd rebels . " the stability of iraq is in our common interest , " commission spokeswoman krisztina nagy told reporters in brussels .
" the eu recognizes the constructive role turkey plays in the area and in this context it is important that turkey continues to play such a positive role , " she added .
" the eu is following the situation in the region very closely , " said nagy .
" our hope and the interest of all involved is that possible differences are dealt with in a peaceful and constructive manner . "
in a rare press conference at the army headquarters , general yasar buyukanit pushed on thursday for a cross-border operation into northern iraq to crack down on turkish kurd rebels he said had sought refuge there .
general buyukanit said that it was necessary to launch a cross-border military operation against pkk rebels based in northern iraq there , but that this would require political authorization .
" it is necessary to launch an operation into iraq , " buyukanit told reporters .
" the pkk has huge freedom of movement in iraq . "
missions within turkey target returning fighters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish troops in northern iraq in 2005 he also said the military had launched a number of large-scale operations against kurdish rebels in south-east turkey .
buyukanit said the operations had been launched as snow melting in mountain passes made it easier for pkk rebels to enter turkey from neighboring iraq .
turkey has accused iraqi kurds of tolerating , and even backing the kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has waged a bloody campaign for kurdish self-rule in turkey 's southeast since 1984 .
the conflict has claimed some 37,000 lives .
the turkish military has claimed there are around 5,000 pkk guerrillas based in camps in mountainous northern iraq .
ankara says thousands of militants of the pkk enjoy unrestricted movement in northern iraq and are able to obtain weapons and explosives there .
the group is listed as a terrorist group by turkey and much of the international community .
iraqi kurds taking threats very seriously the kurds in northern iraq are taking the threats by the turkish army to launch a military offensive against kurdish rebels seriously , the president of the autonomous kurdish parliament said friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military has clashed with rebels in southern turkey adnan al-mufti told reporters in arbil , northern iraq that " these threats are nothing new for us , we take them seriously . "
he said the authorities in the autonomous kurdish region of northern iraq would seek the support of the iraqi government .
" we want a dialogue , but those responsible in turkey are not ready for one , " al-mufti added .
when asked why the kurdish authorities , who control three provinces in northern iraq , have not taken action against pkk rebels , al-mufti said that " the situation in iraq is altogether too unstable ; therefore we can not take steps against this party . "
the turkish government has repeatedly called on the united states and iraq to launch its own operations against the pkk in northern iraq .
the organization is black-listed as a terrorist organization by both the us and the eu .
on friday the president of the iraqi parliament mahmoud al- mashhadani warned that all those foreign powers that had a hand in iraq 's internal affairs would have " the hand hacked off . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.04.2007 bitterly disputed german-russian gas pipeline heads for estonia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns that the pipeline may disturb world war ii weapons dumped in the sea a controversial pipeline to carry russian gas under the baltic sea to germany could run through estonian waters , an official from the consortium behind the project said on friday . the nord stream consortium " sees a possibility that the pipeline could go through estonian waters , " spokeswoman neel stroebaek told reporters .
" two days ago we asked the estonian authorities for a permit to measure the depth of the sea in estonian waters , " she added , according to baltic news service bns .
estonian sources contacted by deutsche presse-agentur dpa confirmed that an informal application has been received , but that more details would be needed before any permit could be issued .
" nord stream have to explain the purpose of the study : what they intend to do , the timetable and what they will need , " ehtel halliste , spokeswoman for the estonian foreign office , told dpa .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war two .
threat of environmental disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one is really sure where the undersea arms dumps are such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment , stroebaek said .
given estonian fears , any routing of the pipeline through estonian waters is likely to be welcomed in tallinn .
" if such an idea were to appear , it means we would automatically be part of the environmental impact assessment scheme , " gromov pointed out .
but the planned pipeline could equally meet with political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
eu 's eastern neighbors get nervous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas stand-off made everyone in europe jittery as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
the fact that the project - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - was negotiated by the two states without consulting the countries between them created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
and in recent months russia has harshly criticized estonian plans to move a red army monument from the centre of tallinn to a less prominent location - leaving many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
whatever the economic and political arguments , the pipeline 's route is likely to take some time to confirm .
according to halliste , once the estonian maritime agency receives an official application , it will have up to four months to decide on issuing a permit .
" when we have the permit from the estonian authorities , the measurement of the sea 's depth will take a few weeks .
we hope we will be ready to say whether we are going to estonia or not in late summer or early autumn , " stroebaek added . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltic sea pipeline consortium considers alternate routes the german-russian consortium planning a major gas pipeline in the baltic sea said it would investigate alternate routes for the project amid concerns that construction could disrupt the environment .

" despite welcoming the national unity government , the european union has failed to restore aid payments , " he added in a statement from the british charity .
" with palestinian institutions collapsing and insecurity growing , the resumption of international aid to the palestinian authority is a necessary step to preventing further suffering and securing a just and lasting settlement on the basis of international law . "
the eu was the biggest aid donor to the palestinian government until the hamas militants came to power in march 2006 .

bayer leverkusen failed to overturn a 3-0 first leg deficit , losing 1-0 to osasuna . germany striker miroslav klose ended his goal drought in style at the weserstadion on thursday with a brace in werder bremen 's 4-1 win over az alkmaar which secured their place in the uefa cup semi-finals where they will meet espanyol .
the polish-born forward scored in the 36th minute to end his barren spell , which dated back to january 31 and lasted 1158 minutes , to add to tim borowski 's opener - which had been pegged back by moussa dembele 's excellent 32nd minute equalizer .
any doubts that werder - who almost put barcelona out in the champions league group stages - would not be in the final four were settled when klose added their third in the 62nd minute .
inspirational brazilian playmaker diego rounded off the scoring against the plucky dutch with a well deserved goal eight minutes from time , hitting home from the edge of the penalty area after playing a neat 1-2 with klose .
confident klose rediscovers his touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose displayed few signs of suffering from his drought werder coach thomas schaaf said the thought had never entered his mind that klose had lost his touch .
" miroslav always trained hard and never lost confidence , " said schaaf .
" his situation was never as catastrophic as people said .
he knew he had not lost his goal scoring talents and today his work paid off . "
the first half came to a boil after borowski netted in the 19th minute , escaping the attentions of an alkmaar defender to latch onto a delightful lobbed ball from diego to shoot into the far corner of the net .
alkmaar were far from cowed and captain and former glasgow rangers striker shota arveladze almost leveled with a splendid lob from outside the area which took a deflection for a corner .
the dutch side , though , did draw level as dembele produced a fierce left footed shot from just outside the box which beat the diving tim wiese in the left hand corner for his fourth goal of the campaign .
it had coach louis van gaal punching the air in delight , but the former barcelona and dutch national coach was not in the same mood when klose got on the end of aaron hunt 's pass across the five-yard line to score his first goal of the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego slams in his goal to make it 4-1 to werder indeed van gaal was in even more of a fury when what looked like a perfectly good goal was disallowed and he had several words with the fourth official over referee mike riley 's decision .
the hosts should have been 3-1 up a minute later as borowski squared the ball from the right but klose was only able to screw the ball over the bar .
the second half was as exciting an affair with werder 's naldo going agonizingly close with a rasping free kick but it was to be klose who closed things down for the german side .
again diego was the architect , the pocket-sized brazilian floating over an inch-perfect cross from the right for klose to send a diving header past the keeper and secure his brace , and bremen 's victory .
lackluster leverkusen crash out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen looked resigned to their fate from the start germany ’ s other uefa cup quarter-finalists bayer leverkusen couldn ’ t overturn the 3-0 deficit racked up in the first leg of their clash against spanish side osasuna and suffered further ignominy by losing the second game 1-0 .
osasuna midfielder juanlu gave the spaniards a deserved win when he steered in past rene adler from close range after the leverkusen keeper had palmed a roberto soldado shot into his path just after the hour .
a poor and lacklustre leverkusen side laboured against their opponents and only fashioned one serious attempt on goal when defender jan-ingwer callsen bracker had a header cleared off the line early in the second half .

bayer leverkusen failed to overturn a 3-0 first leg deficit , losing 1-0 to osasuna . germany striker miroslav klose ended his goal drought in style at the weserstadion on thursday with a brace in werder bremen 's 4-1 win over az alkmaar which secured their place in the uefa cup semi-finals where they will meet espanyol .
the polish-born forward scored in the 36th minute to end his barren spell , which dated back to january 31 and lasted 1158 minutes , to add to tim borowski 's opener - which had been pegged back by moussa dembele 's excellent 32nd minute equalizer .
any doubts that werder - who almost put barcelona out in the champions league group stages - would not be in the final four were settled when klose added their third in the 62nd minute .
inspirational brazilian playmaker diego rounded off the scoring against the plucky dutch with a well deserved goal eight minutes from time , hitting home from the edge of the penalty area after playing a neat 1-2 with klose .
confident klose rediscovers his touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose displayed few signs of suffering from his drought werder coach thomas schaaf said the thought had never entered his mind that klose had lost his touch .
" miroslav always trained hard and never lost confidence , " said schaaf .
" his situation was never as catastrophic as people said .
he knew he had not lost his goal scoring talents and today his work paid off . "
the first half came to a boil after borowski netted in the 19th minute , escaping the attentions of an alkmaar defender to latch onto a delightful lobbed ball from diego to shoot into the far corner of the net .
alkmaar were far from cowed and captain and former glasgow rangers striker shota arveladze almost leveled with a splendid lob from outside the area which took a deflection for a corner .
the dutch side , though , did draw level as dembele produced a fierce left footed shot from just outside the box which beat the diving tim wiese in the left hand corner for his fourth goal of the campaign .
it had coach louis van gaal punching the air in delight , but the former barcelona and dutch national coach was not in the same mood when klose got on the end of aaron hunt 's pass across the five-yard line to score his first goal of the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego slams in his goal to make it 4-1 to werder indeed van gaal was in even more of a fury when what looked like a perfectly good goal was disallowed and he had several words with the fourth official over referee mike riley 's decision .
the hosts should have been 3-1 up a minute later as borowski squared the ball from the right but klose was only able to screw the ball over the bar .
the second half was as exciting an affair with werder 's naldo going agonizingly close with a rasping free kick but it was to be klose who closed things down for the german side .
again diego was the architect , the pocket-sized brazilian floating over an inch-perfect cross from the right for klose to send a diving header past the keeper and secure his brace , and bremen 's victory .
lackluster leverkusen crash out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen looked resigned to their fate from the start germany ’ s other uefa cup quarter-finalists bayer leverkusen couldn ’ t overturn the 3-0 deficit racked up in the first leg of their clash against spanish side osasuna and suffered further ignominy by losing the second game 1-0 .
osasuna midfielder juanlu gave the spaniards a deserved win when he steered in past rene adler from close range after the leverkusen keeper had palmed a roberto soldado shot into his path just after the hour .
a poor and lacklustre leverkusen side laboured against their opponents and only fashioned one serious attempt on goal when defender jan-ingwer callsen bracker had a header cleared off the line early in the second half .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.04.2007 eu panel backs plans to cap mobile roaming rates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone companies make much of their money from high roaming costs european union plans to cap the price operators can charge mobile phone users while abroad cleared a key hurdle on thursday when a panel in the european parliament backed the package . despite fierce lobbying from mobile phone operators , the parliament 's industry committee massively supported plans to cap the price of calls made abroad in the eu at 40 cents per minute and 15 cents -lrb- $ 0.54 and $ 0.20 -rrb- for calls received abroad .
the committee 's backing sets the stage for a vote before the full parliament in a plenary session on may 10 in brussels and a final decision by eu telecoms ministers on june 7 in luxembourg .
" we are sending a very clear message to the consumers and telecom operators , " said the bill 's rapporteur , austrian conservative paul ruedig .
" it 's a good basis for our deliberations . "
the plans as adopted by the panel go even farther in the favor of consumers than original propositions from the european commission , which had proposed a 44-cent ceiling on outgoing calls made abroad in the eu and a 15-cent cap on incoming calls .
protecting consumers the eu 's executive arm hopes to see so-called roaming charges fall by as much as 70 percent , thanks to its plans to cap what operators charge customers at the retail level and what they charge each other at the wholesale level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu consumers could benefit from the price caps this summer already the commission drew up the plans to regulate roaming rates last year after finding evidence of huge variations between operators ' prices with roaming calls costing some times up to six times those of local mobile calls .
eu telecoms commissioner viviane reding , who has led the drive for regulation of roaming rates , hailed the committee 's support for her plans as " very good news for europe 's consumers . "
the beuc european consumers association said that while the plans " go in the right direction , " the price caps " are still too high and should be readjusted based on real costs . "
reding is aiming for the package to go into effect in summer so consumers can benefit from lower prices during the holidays abroad , although some eu lawmakers have said its application might not come until the autumn .
" in view of the emerging consensus on the new rules , an early entry into force of the eu roaming regulation is now a very realistic possibility , " she added .
industry up in arms the package has the industry , which argues that fierce competition has already driven down prices , up in arms and it has been lobbying hard to get the plans watered down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone companies can expect the caps to hurt the gsma trade association said that " retail price regulation is inappropriate and unprecedented on the basis of the principles of a market economy . "
it charged that the plans " will force european mobile operators to offer roaming services at below cost and give them no scope to compete with each other on price and on new services . "
the organization has been lobbying for a ceiling of at least 65 cents for outgoing calls abroad and 35 cents for incoming calls .
with roaming charges generating on average 10 percent of operators revenues , reding acknowledged that the regulations would prove to be painful for operators and would probably provoke a " correction " in the share prices . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bahn , vodafone team up on mobile payment scheme global wireless company vodafone will make a fresh foray into the micro-banking business , testing a mobile payment system in partnership with deutsche bahn , the companies announced at the weekend .

" two days ago we asked the estonian authorities for a permit to measure the depth of the sea in estonian waters , " she added , according to baltic news service bns .
estonian sources contacted by deutsche presse-agentur dpa confirmed that an informal application has been received , but that more details would be needed before any permit could be issued .
" nord stream have to explain the purpose of the study : what they intend to do , the timetable and what they will need , " ehtel halliste , spokeswoman for the estonian foreign office , told dpa .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war two .
threat of environmental disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one is really sure where the undersea arms dumps are such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment , stroebaek said .
given estonian fears , any routing of the pipeline through estonian waters is likely to be welcomed in tallinn .
" if such an idea were to appear , it means we would automatically be part of the environmental impact assessment scheme , " gromov pointed out .
but the planned pipeline could equally meet with political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
eu 's eastern neighbors get nervous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas stand-off made everyone in europe jittery as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
the fact that the project - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - was negotiated by the two states without consulting the countries between them created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
and in recent months russia has harshly criticized estonian plans to move a red army monument from the centre of tallinn to a less prominent location - leaving many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
whatever the economic and political arguments , the pipeline 's route is likely to take some time to confirm .
according to halliste , once the estonian maritime agency receives an official application , it will have up to four months to decide on issuing a permit .
" when we have the permit from the estonian authorities , the measurement of the sea 's depth will take a few weeks .
we hope we will be ready to say whether we are going to estonia or not in late summer or early autumn , " stroebaek added . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltic sea pipeline consortium considers alternate routes the german-russian consortium planning a major gas pipeline in the baltic sea said it would investigate alternate routes for the project amid concerns that construction could disrupt the environment .

we examine why the bundesliga has taken such a surreal turn and how individual performances , not team spirit , may determine some clubs ' fortunes . in one respect , the bundesliga has followed its normal pattern this season .
with six games left , a handful of teams are fighting for the title while a couple of others are in the hunt for international competitions . but the top clubs have actually under-performed - with 56 points , table-toppers schalke would have only been in fourth place at this point last year .
and points lost at the top get redistributed down to the bundesliga 's lower rungs . the result is huge mass of mediocrity and an intriguing situation .
the relegation candidates - defined as any team two games or fewer away from the bottom three - now starts at seventh in the table . this unprecedented constellation may give the lie to the old adage that relegation fights are won and lost as a team .
although collective willingness to fight remains crucial , individual creativity - or blundering - could determine who gets to remain in the first division . from flop to top in ten minutes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head to head match-ups are key late in the season case in point : the team that currently occupies the seventh spot in the table - wolfsburg . in their last match , wolfsburg were behind 2-1 , and opponents mainz were riding out what appeared to be a safe victory against a relegation rival . then in the 80th minute , the wolves ' eccentric brazilian playmaker marcelinho fired an out-of-the-blue blast from just outside of the box into the upper left-hand corner of goal . not content with having salvaged a point , marcelinho scored a nearly identical goal seven minutes later from 20 meters out to secure the unlikely 3-2 win . two individual moments of brilliance dramatically altered the table .
without marcelinho 's goals , wolfsburg would be 14th and mainz , currently next-to-last , 13th in the standings . the headlines after the match summed it up : " marcelinho saves the wolves . " to err is stupid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a relegation fight is no time to fall down on the job what applies to genius holds equally true for individual acts of foolishness , frustration , incompetence or just plain bad luck . hamburg had been on a hot streak , but in their last match , at home to stuttgart , a referee overlooked a foul that led to the visitors ' first goal .
but defender änis ben-hatira sealed a bad loss for the hosts , when he was red-carded for a challenge that was reckless in anyone 's book .
now hamburg are only two points clear of the drop zone . in a similar vein , defender joe simunic got sent off just seconds after hertha had tied the score in their last game against bielefeld , which subsequently ended in a draw .
a win would have lifted berlin from the thick of the fray . mistakes by opponents can also help teams avoid relegation .
in leverkusen 's last match , defender karim haggui scored an own goal and set up another for opponents bochum with an awful back pass .
the result : bochum moved out of the bottom three . in none of these game-changing moments did teamwork play much of a role .
so it will be interesting to follow which players emerge as heroes and which as goats in the wild weeks remaining this season . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de götz gone as hertha prepare to fight relegation hertha berlin were in fifth place at the break , but since then they compiled the worst record in the bundesliga .

the committee 's backing sets the stage for a vote before the full parliament in a plenary session on may 10 in brussels and a final decision by eu telecoms ministers on june 7 in luxembourg .
" we are sending a very clear message to the consumers and telecom operators , " said the bill 's rapporteur , austrian conservative paul ruedig .
" it 's a good basis for our deliberations . "
the plans as adopted by the panel go even farther in the favor of consumers than original propositions from the european commission , which had proposed a 44-cent ceiling on outgoing calls made abroad in the eu and a 15-cent cap on incoming calls .
protecting consumers the eu 's executive arm hopes to see so-called roaming charges fall by as much as 70 percent , thanks to its plans to cap what operators charge customers at the retail level and what they charge each other at the wholesale level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu consumers could benefit from the price caps this summer already the commission drew up the plans to regulate roaming rates last year after finding evidence of huge variations between operators ' prices with roaming calls costing some times up to six times those of local mobile calls .
eu telecoms commissioner viviane reding , who has led the drive for regulation of roaming rates , hailed the committee 's support for her plans as " very good news for europe 's consumers . "
the beuc european consumers association said that while the plans " go in the right direction , " the price caps " are still too high and should be readjusted based on real costs . "
reding is aiming for the package to go into effect in summer so consumers can benefit from lower prices during the holidays abroad , although some eu lawmakers have said its application might not come until the autumn .
" in view of the emerging consensus on the new rules , an early entry into force of the eu roaming regulation is now a very realistic possibility , " she added .
industry up in arms the package has the industry , which argues that fierce competition has already driven down prices , up in arms and it has been lobbying hard to get the plans watered down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone companies can expect the caps to hurt the gsma trade association said that " retail price regulation is inappropriate and unprecedented on the basis of the principles of a market economy . "
it charged that the plans " will force european mobile operators to offer roaming services at below cost and give them no scope to compete with each other on price and on new services . "
the organization has been lobbying for a ceiling of at least 65 cents for outgoing calls abroad and 35 cents for incoming calls .
with roaming charges generating on average 10 percent of operators revenues , reding acknowledged that the regulations would prove to be painful for operators and would probably provoke a " correction " in the share prices . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bahn , vodafone team up on mobile payment scheme global wireless company vodafone will make a fresh foray into the micro-banking business , testing a mobile payment system in partnership with deutsche bahn , the companies announced at the weekend .

the committee 's backing sets the stage for a vote before the full parliament in a plenary session on may 10 in brussels and a final decision by eu telecoms ministers on june 7 in luxembourg .
" we are sending a very clear message to the consumers and telecom operators , " said the bill 's rapporteur , austrian conservative paul ruedig .
" it 's a good basis for our deliberations . "
the plans as adopted by the panel go even farther in the favor of consumers than original propositions from the european commission , which had proposed a 44-cent ceiling on outgoing calls made abroad in the eu and a 15-cent cap on incoming calls .
protecting consumers the eu 's executive arm hopes to see so-called roaming charges fall by as much as 70 percent , thanks to its plans to cap what operators charge customers at the retail level and what they charge each other at the wholesale level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu consumers could benefit from the price caps this summer already the commission drew up the plans to regulate roaming rates last year after finding evidence of huge variations between operators ' prices with roaming calls costing some times up to six times those of local mobile calls .
eu telecoms commissioner viviane reding , who has led the drive for regulation of roaming rates , hailed the committee 's support for her plans as " very good news for europe 's consumers . "
the beuc european consumers association said that while the plans " go in the right direction , " the price caps " are still too high and should be readjusted based on real costs . "
reding is aiming for the package to go into effect in summer so consumers can benefit from lower prices during the holidays abroad , although some eu lawmakers have said its application might not come until the autumn .
" in view of the emerging consensus on the new rules , an early entry into force of the eu roaming regulation is now a very realistic possibility , " she added .
industry up in arms the package has the industry , which argues that fierce competition has already driven down prices , up in arms and it has been lobbying hard to get the plans watered down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phone companies can expect the caps to hurt the gsma trade association said that " retail price regulation is inappropriate and unprecedented on the basis of the principles of a market economy . "
it charged that the plans " will force european mobile operators to offer roaming services at below cost and give them no scope to compete with each other on price and on new services . "
the organization has been lobbying for a ceiling of at least 65 cents for outgoing calls abroad and 35 cents for incoming calls .
with roaming charges generating on average 10 percent of operators revenues , reding acknowledged that the regulations would prove to be painful for operators and would probably provoke a " correction " in the share prices . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bahn , vodafone team up on mobile payment scheme global wireless company vodafone will make a fresh foray into the micro-banking business , testing a mobile payment system in partnership with deutsche bahn , the companies announced at the weekend .

" europe 's foreign ministers should not miss the opportunity of their forthcoming meeting ... to restore the faith of palestinians in the european union , " oxfam international executive director jeremy hobbs said .
the ministers were due to hold their talks on april 23 and 24 in luxembourg .
" despite welcoming the national unity government , the european union has failed to restore aid payments , " he added in a statement from the british charity .
" with palestinian institutions collapsing and insecurity growing , the resumption of international aid to the palestinian authority is a necessary step to preventing further suffering and securing a just and lasting settlement on the basis of international law . "
the eu was the biggest aid donor to the palestinian government until the hamas militants came to power in march 2006 .
the quartet of middle east mediators - the european union , the united states , the united nations and russia - then suspended direct aid to the palestinian authority .
unethical and ineffective , says oxfam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty has increased , says oxfam since then , the 27-nation eu has redirected its aid , worth 700 million euros -lrb- $ 943 million -rrb- in 2006 , through a special mechanism to help the neediest people while bypassing the government to avoid contact with hamas .
hobbs said that suspending aid and withholding tax revenue was both unethical and ineffective as a policy tool .
" parents have been driven into debt , children taken out of classrooms and whole families deprived of access to medicine and healthcare , " he added .
services meltdown a survey commissioned by oxfam from the palestinian center for public opinion -lrb- pcpo -rrb- found that more than four out of five of 677 families interviewed have seen a drop in their income following the boycott .
half of all the families reported losing more than half their income , a statement from oxfam said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worsening factional violence has made the streets even more dangerous " the number of palestinian people living in poverty has jumped by 30 percent , essential services are facing meltdown , and previously unknown levels of factional violence plague palestinian streets , " the survey said .
ninety percent of the senior managers running schools , hospitals and water services across the west bank and gaza reported that services had been undermined by the boycott .
" the national unity government remains a fragile creation that could collapse without financial support , leading to even greater insecurity , " the report said .
" the occupied palestinian territories risk becoming a ' failed state , ' destroying the chances of achieving a two-state solution . " dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says no to aiding palestinian unity government new palestinian finance minister salam fayyad has failed to convince the european union to agree to resume aid to the palestinian authority despite what he called a " very acute financial crisis " .
-lrb- 11.04.2007 -rrb- eu countries reach out to non-hamas palestinian ministers european union countries were prepared to reach out to non-hamas members of the new palestinian unity government on tuesday , but it will be some time before the eu restores direct aid , officials said .
-lrb- 20.03.2007 -rrb- eu to keep palestinian aid embargo in place the european union will only resume ties with the palestinian government if it accepts the principles of the international quartet on the middle east , including recognizing israel , eu foreign ministers said .

" with palestinian institutions collapsing and insecurity growing , the resumption of international aid to the palestinian authority is a necessary step to preventing further suffering and securing a just and lasting settlement on the basis of international law . "

the eu was the biggest aid donor to the palestinian government until the hamas militants came to power in march 2006 .
the quartet of middle east mediators - the european union , the united states , the united nations and russia - then suspended direct aid to the palestinian authority .
unethical and ineffective , says oxfam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty has increased , says oxfam since then , the 27-nation eu has redirected its aid , worth 700 million euros -lrb- $ 943 million -rrb- in 2006 , through a special mechanism to help the neediest people while bypassing the government to avoid contact with hamas .
hobbs said that suspending aid and withholding tax revenue was both unethical and ineffective as a policy tool .
" parents have been driven into debt , children taken out of classrooms and whole families deprived of access to medicine and healthcare , " he added .
services meltdown a survey commissioned by oxfam from the palestinian center for public opinion -lrb- pcpo -rrb- found that more than four out of five of 677 families interviewed have seen a drop in their income following the boycott .
half of all the families reported losing more than half their income , a statement from oxfam said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worsening factional violence has made the streets even more dangerous " the number of palestinian people living in poverty has jumped by 30 percent , essential services are facing meltdown , and previously unknown levels of factional violence plague palestinian streets , " the survey said .
ninety percent of the senior managers running schools , hospitals and water services across the west bank and gaza reported that services had been undermined by the boycott .
" the national unity government remains a fragile creation that could collapse without financial support , leading to even greater insecurity , " the report said .
" the occupied palestinian territories risk becoming a ' failed state , ' destroying the chances of achieving a two-state solution . " dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says no to aiding palestinian unity government new palestinian finance minister salam fayyad has failed to convince the european union to agree to resume aid to the palestinian authority despite what he called a " very acute financial crisis " .
-lrb- 11.04.2007 -rrb- eu countries reach out to non-hamas palestinian ministers european union countries were prepared to reach out to non-hamas members of the new palestinian unity government on tuesday , but it will be some time before the eu restores direct aid , officials said .
-lrb- 20.03.2007 -rrb- eu to keep palestinian aid embargo in place the european union will only resume ties with the palestinian government if it accepts the principles of the international quartet on the middle east , including recognizing israel , eu foreign ministers said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.04.2007 bitterly disputed german-russian gas pipeline heads for estonia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns that the pipeline may disturb world war ii weapons dumped in the sea a controversial pipeline to carry russian gas under the baltic sea to germany could run through estonian waters , an official from the consortium behind the project said on friday . the nord stream consortium " sees a possibility that the pipeline could go through estonian waters , " spokeswoman neel stroebaek told reporters .
" two days ago we asked the estonian authorities for a permit to measure the depth of the sea in estonian waters , " she added , according to baltic news service bns .
estonian sources contacted by deutsche presse-agentur dpa confirmed that an informal application has been received , but that more details would be needed before any permit could be issued .
" nord stream have to explain the purpose of the study : what they intend to do , the timetable and what they will need , " ehtel halliste , spokeswoman for the estonian foreign office , told dpa .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war two .
threat of environmental disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one is really sure where the undersea arms dumps are such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment , stroebaek said .
given estonian fears , any routing of the pipeline through estonian waters is likely to be welcomed in tallinn .
" if such an idea were to appear , it means we would automatically be part of the environmental impact assessment scheme , " gromov pointed out .
but the planned pipeline could equally meet with political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
eu 's eastern neighbors get nervous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas stand-off made everyone in europe jittery as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
the fact that the project - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - was negotiated by the two states without consulting the countries between them created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
and in recent months russia has harshly criticized estonian plans to move a red army monument from the centre of tallinn to a less prominent location - leaving many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
whatever the economic and political arguments , the pipeline 's route is likely to take some time to confirm .
according to halliste , once the estonian maritime agency receives an official application , it will have up to four months to decide on issuing a permit .
" when we have the permit from the estonian authorities , the measurement of the sea 's depth will take a few weeks .
we hope we will be ready to say whether we are going to estonia or not in late summer or early autumn , " stroebaek added . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltic sea pipeline consortium considers alternate routes the german-russian consortium planning a major gas pipeline in the baltic sea said it would investigate alternate routes for the project amid concerns that construction could disrupt the environment .

" two days ago we asked the estonian authorities for a permit to measure the depth of the sea in estonian waters , " she added , according to baltic news service bns .
estonian sources contacted by deutsche presse-agentur dpa confirmed that an informal application has been received , but that more details would be needed before any permit could be issued .
" nord stream have to explain the purpose of the study : what they intend to do , the timetable and what they will need , " ehtel halliste , spokeswoman for the estonian foreign office , told dpa .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war two .
threat of environmental disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one is really sure where the undersea arms dumps are such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment , stroebaek said .
given estonian fears , any routing of the pipeline through estonian waters is likely to be welcomed in tallinn .
" if such an idea were to appear , it means we would automatically be part of the environmental impact assessment scheme , " gromov pointed out .
but the planned pipeline could equally meet with political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
eu 's eastern neighbors get nervous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas stand-off made everyone in europe jittery as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
the fact that the project - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - was negotiated by the two states without consulting the countries between them created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
and in recent months russia has harshly criticized estonian plans to move a red army monument from the centre of tallinn to a less prominent location - leaving many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
whatever the economic and political arguments , the pipeline 's route is likely to take some time to confirm .
according to halliste , once the estonian maritime agency receives an official application , it will have up to four months to decide on issuing a permit .
" when we have the permit from the estonian authorities , the measurement of the sea 's depth will take a few weeks .
we hope we will be ready to say whether we are going to estonia or not in late summer or early autumn , " stroebaek added . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltic sea pipeline consortium considers alternate routes the german-russian consortium planning a major gas pipeline in the baltic sea said it would investigate alternate routes for the project amid concerns that construction could disrupt the environment .

" two days ago we asked the estonian authorities for a permit to measure the depth of the sea in estonian waters , " she added , according to baltic news service bns .
estonian sources contacted by deutsche presse-agentur dpa confirmed that an informal application has been received , but that more details would be needed before any permit could be issued .
" nord stream have to explain the purpose of the study : what they intend to do , the timetable and what they will need , " ehtel halliste , spokeswoman for the estonian foreign office , told dpa .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war two .
threat of environmental disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one is really sure where the undersea arms dumps are such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment , stroebaek said .
given estonian fears , any routing of the pipeline through estonian waters is likely to be welcomed in tallinn .
" if such an idea were to appear , it means we would automatically be part of the environmental impact assessment scheme , " gromov pointed out .
but the planned pipeline could equally meet with political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
eu 's eastern neighbors get nervous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas stand-off made everyone in europe jittery as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
the fact that the project - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - was negotiated by the two states without consulting the countries between them created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
and in recent months russia has harshly criticized estonian plans to move a red army monument from the centre of tallinn to a less prominent location - leaving many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
whatever the economic and political arguments , the pipeline 's route is likely to take some time to confirm .
according to halliste , once the estonian maritime agency receives an official application , it will have up to four months to decide on issuing a permit .
" when we have the permit from the estonian authorities , the measurement of the sea 's depth will take a few weeks .
we hope we will be ready to say whether we are going to estonia or not in late summer or early autumn , " stroebaek added . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltic sea pipeline consortium considers alternate routes the german-russian consortium planning a major gas pipeline in the baltic sea said it would investigate alternate routes for the project amid concerns that construction could disrupt the environment .

" the stability of iraq is in our common interest , " commission spokeswoman krisztina nagy told reporters in brussels .
" the eu recognizes the constructive role turkey plays in the area and in this context it is important that turkey continues to play such a positive role , " she added .
" the eu is following the situation in the region very closely , " said nagy .
" our hope and the interest of all involved is that possible differences are dealt with in a peaceful and constructive manner . "
in a rare press conference at the army headquarters , general yasar buyukanit pushed on thursday for a cross-border operation into northern iraq to crack down on turkish kurd rebels he said had sought refuge there .
general buyukanit said that it was necessary to launch a cross-border military operation against pkk rebels based in northern iraq there , but that this would require political authorization .

buyukanit said the operations had been launched as snow melting in mountain passes made it easier for pkk rebels to enter turkey from neighboring iraq .
turkey has accused iraqi kurds of tolerating , and even backing the kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has waged a bloody campaign for kurdish self-rule in turkey 's southeast since 1984 .

when asked why the kurdish authorities , who control three provinces in northern iraq , have not taken action against pkk rebels , al-mufti said that " the situation in iraq is altogether too unstable ; therefore we can not take steps against this party . "
the turkish government has repeatedly called on the united states and iraq to launch its own operations against the pkk in northern iraq .
the organization is black-listed as a terrorist organization by both the us and the eu .

" the stability of iraq is in our common interest , " commission spokeswoman krisztina nagy told reporters in brussels .
" the eu recognizes the constructive role turkey plays in the area and in this context it is important that turkey continues to play such a positive role , " she added .
" the eu is following the situation in the region very closely , " said nagy .
" our hope and the interest of all involved is that possible differences are dealt with in a peaceful and constructive manner . "
in a rare press conference at the army headquarters , general yasar buyukanit pushed on thursday for a cross-border operation into northern iraq to crack down on turkish kurd rebels he said had sought refuge there .
general buyukanit said that it was necessary to launch a cross-border military operation against pkk rebels based in northern iraq there , but that this would require political authorization .
" it is necessary to launch an operation into iraq , " buyukanit told reporters .
" the pkk has huge freedom of movement in iraq . "
missions within turkey target returning fighters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish troops in northern iraq in 2005 he also said the military had launched a number of large-scale operations against kurdish rebels in south-east turkey .
buyukanit said the operations had been launched as snow melting in mountain passes made it easier for pkk rebels to enter turkey from neighboring iraq .
turkey has accused iraqi kurds of tolerating , and even backing the kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has waged a bloody campaign for kurdish self-rule in turkey 's southeast since 1984 .
the conflict has claimed some 37,000 lives .
the turkish military has claimed there are around 5,000 pkk guerrillas based in camps in mountainous northern iraq .
ankara says thousands of militants of the pkk enjoy unrestricted movement in northern iraq and are able to obtain weapons and explosives there .
the group is listed as a terrorist group by turkey and much of the international community .
iraqi kurds taking threats very seriously the kurds in northern iraq are taking the threats by the turkish army to launch a military offensive against kurdish rebels seriously , the president of the autonomous kurdish parliament said friday .

öttinger had caused a furor on wednesday when he eulogized filbinger , a former navy judge under the third reich , as an " opponent of the nazi regime . " in a statement , merkel said she wished that “ beyond honoring the great life ’ s work of premier hans filbinger , critical questions about the nazi era had also been posed . ”
she said this was especially important “ out of respect for the feelings of the victims ” of the nazi regime . öttinger had outraged political and religious leaders on wednesday when he claimed that “ there is no verdict that hans filbinger handed down that led to someone losing his life . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.04.2007 german solar boom shines its light on depressed east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one study says by 2020 , more people could work in solar and related branches than in the car industry german accounts for 55 percent of global solar electricity production and is the world 's market leader .
one of the main benefactors of the solar boom is eastern germany , which has long been under an economic shadow . although germans are renowned for spending much of their six weeks of annual vacation in sunnier climes to escape the frequent gray skies and rain of home , solar energy is turning out to be one of the country 's fastest-growing sectors and could be the light at the end of the tunnel for the struggling east .
the eastern city of frankfurt an der oder is turning into one of the main beneficiaries of the solar upsurge , with three solar production facilities planned for the region .
one , being built by the green energy company conergy , is scheduled to go online in october or november .
inside the shell of a chip factory that never got off the ground another in a long string of economic disappointments for the region workers are busy putting in machines that cut and clean silicon .
when up and running toward the end of this year , conergy hopes to produce about 1.2 million photovoltaic modules , which convert the sun 's energy into electricity , per year and employ around 600 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a welder at the conergy plant in frankfurt an der oder for frankfurt , which symbolizes the economic woes of eastern germany in the wake of reunification , the news of new jobs was like bread for the starving .
" we had a job forum in december , where we and the other two solar companies presented ourselves , " said andreas von brandemer , the plant director at this new location .
" afterwards we had 5,000 people applying for a job in our factory .
the hr people had a lot to do . "
only 100 jobs were on offer at the time , although von brandermer says if all goes to plan , conergy hopes to build a second factory in the city in 2009 and will employ around 1,000 .
germany 's biggest solar company , bonn-based solarworld , is also expanding its presence in the east .
expansion plans at its state-of-the-art production facility in freiburg , in the eastern state of saxony , have a price tag in the hundreds of millions of euros .
" solar valley " eastern germany is attractive so many solar players that it 's been dubbed , perhaps inevitably , " solar valley . "
it is attractive to investors for several reasons : wages in the east are lower then they are in western germany ; massive investment in the years since reunification means the infrastructure is excellent ; and eastern german cities have been generous with tax incentives to lure companies .
but another important reason for potential investors has been the hometown workforce .
frankfurt an der oder was the home of east germany 's semiconductor industry .
the region already has a skilled workforce , although many of those who used to work in the gdr-era semiconductor industry have been out of work for years or been forced to enter different industries .
many are ready to return .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels in the eastern state of brandenburg " so you already have a lot of skilled , knowledgeable workers in the field of handling silicon and that 's a major point for companies considering investing in eastern germany , " said nicholas dobrott , director of renewable energies for the industrial investment council .
andreas kritzski is one of them .
he worked in frankfurt 's semiconductor factory in the gdr era , but lost his job with the plant closed .
he entered retraining programs in construction , did some work in western germany , then lost other jobs as firms folded .
he was out of work for several years before starting at conergy about a month ago .
" the recovery is finally coming , like it was announced all those years ago , " he said .
" people are sending in their applications and waiting excitedly .
like i did , a lot of looking on the internet to find out how solar energy works . "
enough sun although it might be counterintuitive , photovoltaic cells can operate just fine under cloudy skies , since despite the grayness of a rainy day , there is still solar radiation in the air , otherwise it would be dark .
while the sunniest spots in the world , like the sahara desert , have a solar energy potential of about two thousand kilowatt hours per square meter per year , germany 's manages a respectable one thousand , according to henner weithöner of solarpraxis , a company that tracks germany 's solar sector .
" this shows how much even germany or parts of northern europe , how much solar energy we have and what huge potential , " he said .
" we just have to use it . "
germans ' general environmental consciousness has also helped the country take the solar lead .
the green party is a strong presence on the political stage , having been part of the previous governing coalition headed by chancellor gerhard schröder .
renewables law experts say that that administration 's passage of the renewable energies law in 2000 was the momentum behind the current solar surge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge solar facility near the eastern city of leipzig with around 33.500 solar modules the legislation committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 .
it set up generous rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid , and created a market for solar energy .
last year , the solar industry had sales of 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- and employs 53,000 .
according to a report in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , a study carried out by the munich-based consulting firm roland berger estimates that by 2020 , more people could be employed in the environment-related sector than are in the auto industry and engineering .
there are still hurdles to be overcome , especially around the issue of price , and bringing it down .
estimates are that electricity from photovoltaics still needs ten years to become competitive with energy from traditional sources like coal or nuclear .
but solar companies are n't waiting .
they are continuing to invest , counting on technology to eventually bring those prices down .
" if you build up a solar company , lots of manpower is needed , " said weithöner of solarpraxis .
" it is a real job engine for the eastern states .

one of the main benefactors of the solar boom is eastern germany , which has long been under an economic shadow . although germans are renowned for spending much of their six weeks of annual vacation in sunnier climes to escape the frequent gray skies and rain of home , solar energy is turning out to be one of the country 's fastest-growing sectors and could be the light at the end of the tunnel for the struggling east .
the eastern city of frankfurt an der oder is turning into one of the main beneficiaries of the solar upsurge , with three solar production facilities planned for the region .
one , being built by the green energy company conergy , is scheduled to go online in october or november .
inside the shell of a chip factory that never got off the ground another in a long string of economic disappointments for the region workers are busy putting in machines that cut and clean silicon .
when up and running toward the end of this year , conergy hopes to produce about 1.2 million photovoltaic modules , which convert the sun 's energy into electricity , per year and employ around 600 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a welder at the conergy plant in frankfurt an der oder for frankfurt , which symbolizes the economic woes of eastern germany in the wake of reunification , the news of new jobs was like bread for the starving .
" we had a job forum in december , where we and the other two solar companies presented ourselves , " said andreas von brandemer , the plant director at this new location .
" afterwards we had 5,000 people applying for a job in our factory .
the hr people had a lot to do . "
only 100 jobs were on offer at the time , although von brandermer says if all goes to plan , conergy hopes to build a second factory in the city in 2009 and will employ around 1,000 .
germany 's biggest solar company , bonn-based solarworld , is also expanding its presence in the east .
expansion plans at its state-of-the-art production facility in freiburg , in the eastern state of saxony , have a price tag in the hundreds of millions of euros .
" solar valley " eastern germany is attractive so many solar players that it 's been dubbed , perhaps inevitably , " solar valley . "
it is attractive to investors for several reasons : wages in the east are lower then they are in western germany ; massive investment in the years since reunification means the infrastructure is excellent ; and eastern german cities have been generous with tax incentives to lure companies .
but another important reason for potential investors has been the hometown workforce .
frankfurt an der oder was the home of east germany 's semiconductor industry .
the region already has a skilled workforce , although many of those who used to work in the gdr-era semiconductor industry have been out of work for years or been forced to enter different industries .
many are ready to return .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels in the eastern state of brandenburg " so you already have a lot of skilled , knowledgeable workers in the field of handling silicon and that 's a major point for companies considering investing in eastern germany , " said nicholas dobrott , director of renewable energies for the industrial investment council .
andreas kritzski is one of them .
he worked in frankfurt 's semiconductor factory in the gdr era , but lost his job with the plant closed .
he entered retraining programs in construction , did some work in western germany , then lost other jobs as firms folded .
he was out of work for several years before starting at conergy about a month ago .
" the recovery is finally coming , like it was announced all those years ago , " he said .
" people are sending in their applications and waiting excitedly .
like i did , a lot of looking on the internet to find out how solar energy works . "
enough sun although it might be counterintuitive , photovoltaic cells can operate just fine under cloudy skies , since despite the grayness of a rainy day , there is still solar radiation in the air , otherwise it would be dark .
while the sunniest spots in the world , like the sahara desert , have a solar energy potential of about two thousand kilowatt hours per square meter per year , germany 's manages a respectable one thousand , according to henner weithöner of solarpraxis , a company that tracks germany 's solar sector .
" this shows how much even germany or parts of northern europe , how much solar energy we have and what huge potential , " he said .
" we just have to use it . "
germans ' general environmental consciousness has also helped the country take the solar lead .
the green party is a strong presence on the political stage , having been part of the previous governing coalition headed by chancellor gerhard schröder .
renewables law experts say that that administration 's passage of the renewable energies law in 2000 was the momentum behind the current solar surge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge solar facility near the eastern city of leipzig with around 33.500 solar modules the legislation committed the country to at least doubling the percentage of renewable energy in the overall supply by 2010 .
it set up generous rates for renewable energy providers who feed into the electricity grid , and created a market for solar energy .
last year , the solar industry had sales of 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- and employs 53,000 .
according to a report in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , a study carried out by the munich-based consulting firm roland berger estimates that by 2020 , more people could be employed in the environment-related sector than are in the auto industry and engineering .
there are still hurdles to be overcome , especially around the issue of price , and bringing it down .
estimates are that electricity from photovoltaics still needs ten years to become competitive with energy from traditional sources like coal or nuclear .
but solar companies are n't waiting .
they are continuing to invest , counting on technology to eventually bring those prices down .
" if you build up a solar company , lots of manpower is needed , " said weithöner of solarpraxis .

one of the main benefactors of the solar boom is eastern germany , which has long been under an economic shadow . although germans are renowned for spending much of their six weeks of annual vacation in sunnier climes to escape the frequent gray skies and rain of home , solar energy is turning out to be one of the country 's fastest-growing sectors and could be the light at the end of the tunnel for the struggling east .
the eastern city of frankfurt an der oder is turning into one of the main beneficiaries of the solar upsurge , with three solar production facilities planned for the region .
one , being built by the green energy company conergy , is scheduled to go online in october or november .
inside the shell of a chip factory that never got off the ground another in a long string of economic disappointments for the region workers are busy putting in machines that cut and clean silicon .
when up and running toward the end of this year , conergy hopes to produce about 1.2 million photovoltaic modules , which convert the sun 's energy into electricity , per year and employ around 600 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a welder at the conergy plant in frankfurt an der oder for frankfurt , which symbolizes the economic woes of eastern germany in the wake of reunification , the news of new jobs was like bread for the starving .
" we had a job forum in december , where we and the other two solar companies presented ourselves , " said andreas von brandemer , the plant director at this new location .
" afterwards we had 5,000 people applying for a job in our factory .
the hr people had a lot to do . "
only 100 jobs were on offer at the time , although von brandermer says if all goes to plan , conergy hopes to build a second factory in the city in 2009 and will employ around 1,000 .
germany 's biggest solar company , bonn-based solarworld , is also expanding its presence in the east .
expansion plans at its state-of-the-art production facility in freiburg , in the eastern state of saxony , have a price tag in the hundreds of millions of euros .
" solar valley " eastern germany is attractive so many solar players that it 's been dubbed , perhaps inevitably , " solar valley . "
it is attractive to investors for several reasons : wages in the east are lower then they are in western germany ; massive investment in the years since reunification means the infrastructure is excellent ; and eastern german cities have been generous with tax incentives to lure companies .
but another important reason for potential investors has been the hometown workforce .
frankfurt an der oder was the home of east germany 's semiconductor industry .
the region already has a skilled workforce , although many of those who used to work in the gdr-era semiconductor industry have been out of work for years or been forced to enter different industries .
many are ready to return .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels in the eastern state of brandenburg " so you already have a lot of skilled , knowledgeable workers in the field of handling silicon and that 's a major point for companies considering investing in eastern germany , " said nicholas dobrott , director of renewable energies for the industrial investment council .
andreas kritzski is one of them .
he worked in frankfurt 's semiconductor factory in the gdr era , but lost his job with the plant closed .
he entered retraining programs in construction , did some work in western germany , then lost other jobs as firms folded .
he was out of work for several years before starting at conergy about a month ago .
" the recovery is finally coming , like it was announced all those years ago , " he said .
" people are sending in their applications and waiting excitedly .
like i did , a lot of looking on the internet to find out how solar energy works . "
enough sun although it might be counterintuitive , photovoltaic cells can operate just fine under cloudy skies , since despite the grayness of a rainy day , there is still solar radiation in the air , otherwise it would be dark .

" a win could be a major milestone for us on the road to the league title , " said slomka . schalke 's main hopes rest on the return of playmaker lincoln from a five-game suspension for the final six matches of the season .
" lincoln is back , he is extremely important for us , " said slomka .
the schalke coach also said he would be happy if bremen lose in dortmund , but that his team must do its own share : " we must win our games .

bayer leverkusen failed to overturn a 3-0 first leg deficit , losing 1-0 to osasuna . germany striker miroslav klose ended his goal drought in style at the weserstadion on thursday with a brace in werder bremen 's 4-1 win over az alkmaar which secured their place in the uefa cup semi-finals where they will meet espanyol .
the polish-born forward scored in the 36th minute to end his barren spell , which dated back to january 31 and lasted 1158 minutes , to add to tim borowski 's opener - which had been pegged back by moussa dembele 's excellent 32nd minute equalizer .
any doubts that werder - who almost put barcelona out in the champions league group stages - would not be in the final four were settled when klose added their third in the 62nd minute .
inspirational brazilian playmaker diego rounded off the scoring against the plucky dutch with a well deserved goal eight minutes from time , hitting home from the edge of the penalty area after playing a neat 1-2 with klose .
confident klose rediscovers his touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose displayed few signs of suffering from his drought werder coach thomas schaaf said the thought had never entered his mind that klose had lost his touch .
" miroslav always trained hard and never lost confidence , " said schaaf .
" his situation was never as catastrophic as people said .
he knew he had not lost his goal scoring talents and today his work paid off . "
the first half came to a boil after borowski netted in the 19th minute , escaping the attentions of an alkmaar defender to latch onto a delightful lobbed ball from diego to shoot into the far corner of the net .
alkmaar were far from cowed and captain and former glasgow rangers striker shota arveladze almost leveled with a splendid lob from outside the area which took a deflection for a corner .
the dutch side , though , did draw level as dembele produced a fierce left footed shot from just outside the box which beat the diving tim wiese in the left hand corner for his fourth goal of the campaign .
it had coach louis van gaal punching the air in delight , but the former barcelona and dutch national coach was not in the same mood when klose got on the end of aaron hunt 's pass across the five-yard line to score his first goal of the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego slams in his goal to make it 4-1 to werder indeed van gaal was in even more of a fury when what looked like a perfectly good goal was disallowed and he had several words with the fourth official over referee mike riley 's decision .
the hosts should have been 3-1 up a minute later as borowski squared the ball from the right but klose was only able to screw the ball over the bar .
the second half was as exciting an affair with werder 's naldo going agonizingly close with a rasping free kick but it was to be klose who closed things down for the german side .
again diego was the architect , the pocket-sized brazilian floating over an inch-perfect cross from the right for klose to send a diving header past the keeper and secure his brace , and bremen 's victory .

bayer leverkusen failed to overturn a 3-0 first leg deficit , losing 1-0 to osasuna . germany striker miroslav klose ended his goal drought in style at the weserstadion on thursday with a brace in werder bremen 's 4-1 win over az alkmaar which secured their place in the uefa cup semi-finals where they will meet espanyol .
the polish-born forward scored in the 36th minute to end his barren spell , which dated back to january 31 and lasted 1158 minutes , to add to tim borowski 's opener - which had been pegged back by moussa dembele 's excellent 32nd minute equalizer .
any doubts that werder - who almost put barcelona out in the champions league group stages - would not be in the final four were settled when klose added their third in the 62nd minute .
inspirational brazilian playmaker diego rounded off the scoring against the plucky dutch with a well deserved goal eight minutes from time , hitting home from the edge of the penalty area after playing a neat 1-2 with klose .
confident klose rediscovers his touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose displayed few signs of suffering from his drought werder coach thomas schaaf said the thought had never entered his mind that klose had lost his touch .
" miroslav always trained hard and never lost confidence , " said schaaf .
" his situation was never as catastrophic as people said .
he knew he had not lost his goal scoring talents and today his work paid off . "
the first half came to a boil after borowski netted in the 19th minute , escaping the attentions of an alkmaar defender to latch onto a delightful lobbed ball from diego to shoot into the far corner of the net .
alkmaar were far from cowed and captain and former glasgow rangers striker shota arveladze almost leveled with a splendid lob from outside the area which took a deflection for a corner .
the dutch side , though , did draw level as dembele produced a fierce left footed shot from just outside the box which beat the diving tim wiese in the left hand corner for his fourth goal of the campaign .
it had coach louis van gaal punching the air in delight , but the former barcelona and dutch national coach was not in the same mood when klose got on the end of aaron hunt 's pass across the five-yard line to score his first goal of the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego slams in his goal to make it 4-1 to werder indeed van gaal was in even more of a fury when what looked like a perfectly good goal was disallowed and he had several words with the fourth official over referee mike riley 's decision .
the hosts should have been 3-1 up a minute later as borowski squared the ball from the right but klose was only able to screw the ball over the bar .
the second half was as exciting an affair with werder 's naldo going agonizingly close with a rasping free kick but it was to be klose who closed things down for the german side .
again diego was the architect , the pocket-sized brazilian floating over an inch-perfect cross from the right for klose to send a diving header past the keeper and secure his brace , and bremen 's victory .

bayer leverkusen failed to overturn a 3-0 first leg deficit , losing 1-0 to osasuna . germany striker miroslav klose ended his goal drought in style at the weserstadion on thursday with a brace in werder bremen 's 4-1 win over az alkmaar which secured their place in the uefa cup semi-finals where they will meet espanyol .
the polish-born forward scored in the 36th minute to end his barren spell , which dated back to january 31 and lasted 1158 minutes , to add to tim borowski 's opener - which had been pegged back by moussa dembele 's excellent 32nd minute equalizer .
any doubts that werder - who almost put barcelona out in the champions league group stages - would not be in the final four were settled when klose added their third in the 62nd minute .
inspirational brazilian playmaker diego rounded off the scoring against the plucky dutch with a well deserved goal eight minutes from time , hitting home from the edge of the penalty area after playing a neat 1-2 with klose .
confident klose rediscovers his touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose displayed few signs of suffering from his drought werder coach thomas schaaf said the thought had never entered his mind that klose had lost his touch .
" miroslav always trained hard and never lost confidence , " said schaaf .
" his situation was never as catastrophic as people said .
he knew he had not lost his goal scoring talents and today his work paid off . "
the first half came to a boil after borowski netted in the 19th minute , escaping the attentions of an alkmaar defender to latch onto a delightful lobbed ball from diego to shoot into the far corner of the net .
alkmaar were far from cowed and captain and former glasgow rangers striker shota arveladze almost leveled with a splendid lob from outside the area which took a deflection for a corner .
the dutch side , though , did draw level as dembele produced a fierce left footed shot from just outside the box which beat the diving tim wiese in the left hand corner for his fourth goal of the campaign .
it had coach louis van gaal punching the air in delight , but the former barcelona and dutch national coach was not in the same mood when klose got on the end of aaron hunt 's pass across the five-yard line to score his first goal of the competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego slams in his goal to make it 4-1 to werder indeed van gaal was in even more of a fury when what looked like a perfectly good goal was disallowed and he had several words with the fourth official over referee mike riley 's decision .
the hosts should have been 3-1 up a minute later as borowski squared the ball from the right but klose was only able to screw the ball over the bar .
the second half was as exciting an affair with werder 's naldo going agonizingly close with a rasping free kick but it was to be klose who closed things down for the german side .
again diego was the architect , the pocket-sized brazilian floating over an inch-perfect cross from the right for klose to send a diving header past the keeper and secure his brace , and bremen 's victory .
lackluster leverkusen crash out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen looked resigned to their fate from the start germany ’ s other uefa cup quarter-finalists bayer leverkusen couldn ’ t overturn the 3-0 deficit racked up in the first leg of their clash against spanish side osasuna and suffered further ignominy by losing the second game 1-0 .

öttinger had caused a furor on wednesday when he eulogized filbinger , a former navy judge under the third reich , as an " opponent of the nazi regime . " in a statement , merkel said she wished that “ beyond honoring the great life ’ s work of premier hans filbinger , critical questions about the nazi era had also been posed . ”
she said this was especially important “ out of respect for the feelings of the victims ” of the nazi regime . öttinger had outraged political and religious leaders on wednesday when he claimed that “ there is no verdict that hans filbinger handed down that led to someone losing his life . ”
evidence directly contradicts this claim , as nazi-era documents show that filbinger was involved - as a judge and prosecutor - in death sentences against deserters during world war ii . öttinger claimed during the eulogy that filbinger was not a real nazi , but like millions of other germans was forced to bow to the pressure of the times . massive criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans filbinger : criminal or victim ?
in the state capital stuttgart , rabbi joel berger told the daily kölner stadt-anzeiger that öttinger “ better have damned good evidence for publicly claiming filbinger was an opponent of the nazi regime . ” the leader of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , went further , telling afp news service that öttinger ’ s claim was “ dangerous and , for the survivors , an insulting perversion of historical reality . ” öttinger also came under fire from social democrats and the opposition green party .
ute vogt , leader of the social democratic party in baden-württemberg , echoed knobloch ’ s view that öttinger “ is distorting history , ” she told german television .
“ he issued two death sentences .
it ’ s wrong to call filbinger a victim , ” she said . and the simon wiesenthal center , an international organization that hunts down nazi war criminals , has called on öttinger to resign .
“ the öttinger comments are absolutely incredible , ” efraim zuroff , director of the israeli chapter in jerusalem , told reuters news agency .
“ it is unacceptable for a german state premier to deny and whitewash the nazi past of an ex-leader and nazi judge , ” he said , “ and we call for his resignation . ” filbinger resigned over nazi past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filbinger -lrb- left -rrb- after his resignation in 1978 .
lothar spät succeeded him günther öttinger is a prominent political leader of the christian democratic union , which rules in coalition with the center-left social democratic party at the national level but enjoys a wide electoral margin in baden-württemberg , a predominantly conservative state .
in 2005 , öttinger was elected premier of this wealthy southern state and , eight days later , state party leader . for his part , hans filbinger was elected state premier of baden-württemberg in 1966 , and led the state for over a decade .
but in 1978 , he resigned after his role as a nazi judge came to light through a play by rolf hochhuth . filbinger never publicly expressed regret about his nazi past , and the state chapter of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has fiercely defended his record , naming him its honorary chairman in 1979 . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : conservative premier defends nazi-era judge a leading german conservative defended a notorious nazi-era judge at the man 's funeral , reaping criticism from germany 's central council of jews , among others .

it is the third primate -lrb- after humans and chimps -rrb- to have the secrets of its dna laid bare .
the work , led by the baylor college of medicine in houston , texas , is reported in the journal science .
researchers say the information will help them understand better the evolutionary relationships between humans and their closest relatives .
it will also have major implications for the study of human health and disease .
macaques are used worldwide as laboratory " models " to study medical conditions as diverse as hiv and heart disease .
the international team behind the sequencing effort incorporates more than 170 scientists from 35 institutions .
they say in their analysis that the rhesus macaque , chimp and humans share about 97.5 % of the same genes .
the researchers identified about 200 genes that show evidence of positive selection during evolution , making them potential candidates for determining the differences among primate species .
these genes are said to be involved in hair formation , immune response , membrane proteins and sperm-egg fusion .
also , the geneticists found some instances where the normal form of the macaque protein looks like the diseased human protein .
one example found is phenylketonuria -lrb- pku -rrb- which can lead to brain damage and mental retardation because the human lacks an important enzyme .
the research indicates macaques diverged from our ancestors 25 million years ago .

under the old business rate relief scheme they did not have to pay tax .
llanycrwys community council in north carmarthenshire , which has set its annual precept -lrb- tax income -rrb- at £ 750 , has been landed with a bill of £ 604 .
the labour-run welsh assembly government said the changes brought in on 1 april doubled the number of businesses eligible for rate relief .
joan stacey , clerk to llanycrwys community council , said : " it was quite a shock to get a bill for £ 604 - we only ask for £ 750 a year to spend on the community . "
nearby cynwyl gaeo council , which took over the running of the public toilets in its area from carmarthenshire council , has also been hit .
clerk mary jones said : " every week we have to pay for someone to clean the toilets .
relief scheme " when we took them over we spent £ 3,000 on making them suitable for disabled people . "
the welsh assembly government said the original rate relief scheme had been designed to help businesses in rural areas hit by the outbreak of foot and mouth .
" the new scheme applies from 1 april and almost half of all businesses across the whole of wales will benefit , " said a spokesperson .
they said it compared to 21 % of businesses in mainly rural areas that qualified under the old system .
serious issue the welsh liberal democrats said the issue of sustaining public toilet facilities was a serious one - particularly in rural areas of wales where they supported tourism .
" perhaps in this case carmarthenshire council and the tourism department at the assembly government should offer more help , " said a spokesperson .
welsh conservative assembly leader and finance spokesman nick bourne said : " there are genuine concerns about the levels of taxation facing businesses and communities across wales .
" we want to ensure business rates are kept to as low a level as possible to allow more businesses and more communities to invest more of their own money into their own futures . "

after six hours of surgery , chang po-yu is said to be doing well and in a stable condition in hospital .
his attacker is one of a pair of nile crocodiles kept at shoushan zoo , in the southern taiwanese city of kaohsiung .
nile crocodiles are known to be man-eaters , but are also listed as an endangered species .
new-found fame the incident , which was dramatically caught on camera , occurred when mr chang had his arm through the crocodile 's enclosure to administer the anaesthetic .
believing the animal was successfully anesthetised , mr chang tried to remove the syringe , but the crocodile suddenly turned and bit off his left arm , holding it in its mouth .
as the vet was rushed to hospital , zoo employees tried to retrieve the severed arm by shooting two bullets at the crocodile 's neck .
although the bullets failed to penetrate the reptile 's hide , the effect was enough to cause it to drop the arm .
" it probably was shocked , and opened its mouth to let go of the limb , " zoo official chen po-tsun was quoted as saying .
after his operation , mr chang was seen on television waving and smiling to reporters from his hospital bed .
according to media reports , his girlfriend and mother seemed more worried than he was , with his friends voicing concern about how soon he would be able to play the piano .
as for the crocodile , it is also doing well .
it has found fame as a result of the incident , attracting many visitors to its enclosure .

after six hours of surgery , chang po-yu is said to be doing well and in a stable condition in hospital .
his attacker is one of a pair of nile crocodiles kept at shoushan zoo , in the southern taiwanese city of kaohsiung .
nile crocodiles are known to be man-eaters , but are also listed as an endangered species .
new-found fame the incident , which was dramatically caught on camera , occurred when mr chang had his arm through the crocodile 's enclosure to administer the anaesthetic .
believing the animal was successfully anesthetised , mr chang tried to remove the syringe , but the crocodile suddenly turned and bit off his left arm , holding it in its mouth .
as the vet was rushed to hospital , zoo employees tried to retrieve the severed arm by shooting two bullets at the crocodile 's neck .
although the bullets failed to penetrate the reptile 's hide , the effect was enough to cause it to drop the arm .
" it probably was shocked , and opened its mouth to let go of the limb , " zoo official chen po-tsun was quoted as saying .
after his operation , mr chang was seen on television waving and smiling to reporters from his hospital bed .
according to media reports , his girlfriend and mother seemed more worried than he was , with his friends voicing concern about how soon he would be able to play the piano .

the zimmers - whose lead singer is 90-year-old alf carretta - have recorded a unique version of the who 's my generation , which is released in may .
the 40-strong band , which includes some centenarians , recorded my generation at the legendary studio two at abbey road - the very place where the beatles recorded most of their hits .
isolation leading figures from the music industry - including a top u2 producer - have thrown their weight behind the group , which was the brainchild of documentary maker tim samuels , who has made a series about disenfranchised groups fighting back .
he has brought together the 40 old people , including pensioners tired of life in old age homes and those suffering from social isolation in their own communities .
" this is about old people sticking it back to the society that has cast them aside , " says samuels .
the zimmers gathered at abbey road to record their song " we wanted to take them on a rock ' n ' roll journey that would challenge all our preconceptions of oaps and give them a great time . "
for lead singer alf carretta , from london , potential rock stardom at the age of 90 has been unexpected .

the zimmers ' video of my generation is already starting to become a cult hit on the internet , with tens of thousands of hits on sites including youtube , while the group have their own page on myspace .

" old people are highly entertaining to talk to .
their experiences , the things they talk about are just fantastic - really , really exciting .
people forget that they know a lot and they 've been through a lot . "
the video was shot by grammy-winning director geoff wonfor , the man behind band aid and live aid , who is also a passionate champion of senior citizens .
" i 've just always got on well with old people and have a great love and respect for them .
my mother lived to the age of 89 and my father was 92 , and i loved them both so much .
i did this because it 's a really great cause and very close to my heart , " adds mr wonfor .

the diary is published every thursday .
to always see the latest edition , please click here and bookmark this page .
the man the opinion polls say will be the next president of france has been out and about in the loire valley .
nicolas sarkozy has shaken hands with people restoring a chateau , chatted with youngsters learning hairdressing and made his triumphant way out of a hall in tours packed close with supporters .
he has passionately defended his controversial record .
i love election campaigns and watching politicians in action .
but most people get their politics not in the flesh but from people like me , tv reporters .
and in france for the next couple of weeks they 'll be getting a rather odd picture .
let 's put it this way .
would it make any difference to the result of the next british general election if gordon brown and david cameron were given exactly the same air time as nick griffin of the british national party -lrb- bnp -rrb- or the candidates of the socialist workers party ?
that 's what has to happen in france .
the presidential election has two rounds , and the first vote serves to narrow a large field to a simple two-horse race for the second round .
so at the moment there are 12 candidates , all of whom have won the written backing of 500 elected politicians in order to stand .
segolene royal is battling to consolidate left-wing support here 's the rub .
by law french radio and tv have to give all the candidates the same amount of air time .
all broadcasters know the horrors of stop-watch balance .
many is the time i 've got the message " the editor says can you get the snp in ? "
" well tell him ' yes ' but i 'll need another minute . "
" he 'll give you 45 seconds . "
it may be vital for democracy , but it does n't make for elegant television .
but british law and the bbc 's own guidelines are as nothing compared to the rigour of french law .
to include a short 20-second clip of each candidate a report would be four minutes long without the reporter saying a word of introduction .
so each and every report would have to be at least five minutes long .
the upshot is that of course it does n't happen .
there are special election programmes , but the news deals in opinion polls and generalities .
left-wing rebels but this has one unexpected bonus .
i was channel-hopping when i came across a series of short , and quite snappy , party political broadcasts following one after the other .
you might think this sounds dull viewing , but it is a lot more interesting , and gives you a much better perspective , than something tagged on before or after the news .
the best watch was oliver besancenot , the trotskyite postman .
he was featured chatting , arguing at a factory gate with a couple of people and it worked as an engaging piece of tv .
madame royal was deliberately presidential .
but what came across to me was the scale of the opposition she faces , and i do n't mean mr sarkozy .
le pen stunned france by reaching the runoff in 2002 it used to be a slogan of republicans in france : " no enemies to the left ! "
this is not something segolene is likely to say .
in broadcast after broadcast , the same message was repeated : the threat of globalisation , the trampled rights of workers , the ravages of capitalism and economic liberalism .
this of course is not just the result of a strict broadcasting law .
the left is more fractured and marxism more alive in france than anywhere else in europe .
in britain , there are of course marxist groups , but most people seem to believe that capitalism is the only currently possible economic system and arguments are about redistribution and restrictions within it .
it is such an accepted belief that it feels rather odd writing it down .
but in france that is not so .
this has a very real effect on this election .
the practical effect of a vote for the communist party , the revolutionary communist league , the alternative globalisation party , workers struggle or the workers party is to take a vote away from ms royal .
i am not trying to undermine the glorious unpredictability of democracy .
of course workers struggle could leap from the 6 % it got last time to victory .
but do n't hold your breath ..
what many on the left fear is a repeat of 2002 , when the smaller parties leeched support from lionel jospin to allow far-right leader jean-marie le pen through to the second round .
of course , mr sarkozy faces a similar threat from smaller parities of the right , but his real problem is with the other two realistic contenders - le pen and francois bayrou .
campaign contrasts in the packed hall in tours , sarkozy 's passionate discourse on immigration and integration gets them stamping their feet .
i 'm sitting on the steps of a temporary stand next to a woman in her mid-twenties .
as sarkozy came to one climactic point of his argument the twenty-something woman next to me exclaimed " voila ! " - as if he was providing the clinching point that had eluded her in past arguments with friends .
throughout his speech she had been muttering " c 'est vrai , c 'est vrai " -lrb- true , true ! -rrb- .
a few seats away a smart woman , her grey hair cut elegantly short , smartly punched the air and waved a poster , almost in imitation of political activists she had seen on tv .
i did n't get the feeling it was something she did very often .
i have been to three segolene royal rallies and there is a palpable difference .
the socialist party supporters are happy to back someone who could win , who shares at least some of their values .
here it is the man himself they are backing .
outside i talk to a woman who says she lived in london for a long while .
she wants sarkozy as her president , but wants to justify her choice .
" in america i would not be a republican , " she tells me , continuing : " he and tony blair are -lrb- she pressed her palms together -rrb- are they not ? "
certainly in the hall i did n't hear a single idea that would be shockingly out of place in a labour manifesto , i did n't hear anything that could not have come from the lips of john reid or david blunkett .
on second thoughts , i 'm not sure i can imagine them singing the marseillaise .
my new friend says she remembers " when your country was poor , " adding that french socialists are like the labour party of those days .
but the labour party in those days did n't have french tv guidelines giving marxist factions valuable air time .
please use the post form below to comment on any of the issues raised in the diary .
in my part of la france profonde , my neighbours will vote for anyone who promises to get the stifling beaurocracy off their backs and let them earn a living .
unfortunately , they do n't see anyone among the candidates able or willing to do so , so their vote will be cast for one of the usual suspects - a career politician wary of upsetting any of the ' social partners ' - and only appearances will change in france after the presidential election. doris ward , argenton chateau france having lived in france for the last 2 years i really enjoy the different appraoch the french have to politics .
people are very open with their opinions and really enjoy the fight. it is a great change from the ' soundbite ' contect over the channel .
however no-one seems to really want to rock the boat and unfortunately in our global world this boat is heading for reefs .
james hodson , montgenevre , france i wish the bbc was more aware that international opinion can have an effect on national choice of politics .
a quick analysis of all the political candidates agenda -reveals that sarkozy is only interested in becoming president and nothing more -lrb- social change takes years unless it comes from a police state -rrb- and royal is the only real opposition to sarkozy .
favourite candidates are bové -lrb- sustainability -rrb- and voynet -lrb- green -rrb- although french friends holding votes agree they will vote royal to ensure the safety of their fellow citizens -lrb- citizen in the sense people who live here -rrb- .
penelope , paris those who compare jean-marie le pen 's movement to the bnp and brand him " far-right " or an " extremist " prove that they have no understanding of what is happening in france today .
le pen will get more than 20 % of the votes and will be in the second round .
do n't forget that he has consistently improved his scores in the presidential elections and ended up with 17 % last time .
also his electorate is the most loyal of all with over 80 % faithfuls .
add that mégret and the populist party have joined forces with him , that 's another good 2 % .
i vote josé bové so i believe my comments are unbiased .
gaston favresse , london as a french citizen living in sweden , i shall next sunday vote for the only leader possible.jean marie le pen .
france and the rest of europe need a wake up call .
the left and the right are the same .
the time hascomefor a massive rebellion against muslim immigration , and the dictators in bruxelles .
i rather votefor a party that says clearly what it thinks than the hypocritical lefties or rightists. c.simon , sweden i 'm a french citizen born in mauritius .
well it 's incredible to see how polls can direct people views in two directions - mrs royal and mr sarkosy .
what about the others ?
what is the the margin of error of these polls 5 % - 10 % or 0 % as they wish us to beleive ? ? ?
if so probably again we 'll see another 2002 when no poll institute gave the right predictions .
published polls which do not give their margin of error are rubish when they give a winner by a 2 % margin .
bhageerutty kishore , bourg en bresse , france we droped equal airtime rules in the states back in the 90 's and to be honest third parties have done at least as well or better since then .
nick michelewicz , keene , new hampshire , usa the socialists are the biggest threat to this country as they have an actual chance of being elected in the second round .
how ségolène can justify her ridiculous program is beyond me , case in point : increasing minimum wage to 1.500 ? a month ... how ? with good will and a rose !
as the median -lrb- not average ! -rrb- salary hovers between 1250 and 1400 i wonder how on earth she will be able to find 200 extra euros a month for the majority of french workers , it does n't make sense , she peddles populist ideals and her campaign is focused on the criticising of the right .
she has no authority , no economic sense and is the epitome of the gauche caviar .
why does it have to be so bad to earn money and make a good living , somehow it is inextricably linked to the french instilled catholic morals , that despite the laïcité of the state , continues to permeate society .
in france the less you talk about money and the poorer and more charitable you portray yourself the better you are .
henrik nordling , paris , france to those of you that likes our " same time for everyone policy " never heard or seen the people begging for or votes .
they are away from reality , because they do n't have a chance to win .
they always say the same damn speech , because they do n't have any other idea ... ideas from one century ago , ideas that were proven to be big mistakes ...
they 're not even funny .
when i was a kid , mother told me maggie was evil .
today , i think we really would need someone like her , someone that would not stop when two or three demonstrator would show up ... just to move on one day .
nick , paris , france i have lived here 4 years .
i have a multi ethnic group of friends .
they are basically afraid of sarkozy .
this is man who stands on tiptoes when he is photographed .
who wants to stop immigration , who calls poor people scum .
he is openly hunting votes from the national front .
he has immense energy when he talks , and power of conviction , and perhaps is too excitable , making some comment he might already be going crazy .
by contrast the problem is royale is so serene she is turning into a non-entity , she does n't seem to want it badly enough and she is not leading at all but telling the french a load of policies but nothing about how it will happen .
this is her big error , if she ranted about the state of the country and showed people what she willing to do to fix it she would walk this election .
she smiles and talks in droning voice almost like a ' stepford mum ' .
bayrou looks like he will win through because of fear of one and apathy for the other .
those english or other nationalites touting sarko would do well to be very attentive to what he says .
this is a man who admires bush us middle eastern policy , it is a man many fear could be the new french emperor .
europe is not his cup of tea. collie , nice as a young british person working in france i would say one of the biggest problems here is the lack of trust the older generation have in the young .
people here think it 's strange that a 21-year old should have completed university and be working full time as in britain , and the baby-boom generation just seems to be sitting on all the wealth and positions of responsibility without opening up to the young .
often all twenty-somethings can do is spend years at university or doing poorly paid " stages " -lrb- work placements -rrb- rather than being encouraged to start contributing to the economy .
henry rich , paris , france france is probably fine for all the middle-aged people living in it that benefited from lots of perks handed out when the economy was doing fine and employment was high during the 30 glorieuses .
to answer those that say france is doing fine , i will say that it is for those people !
but it certainly is not for young people who have to beg for jobs , get paid nothing , have no perks , have high real estate prices and live at home .
i am living in the us , and as a young person , i am doing very well for myself .
everyday young people leave france just like me -lrb- 300,000 just in london alone -rrb- .
france seriously needs to think to liberalize its economy , so that more jobs can be created . until then , the brain drain and the lack of investments will continue .
after all , who wants to put their money in a place where the government takes most of it .
peter , washington dc despite all the claims about " égalité , fraternité et liberté " , france is still a monarchy , but with an all-powerful president as head of state instead of a powerless king or queen -lrb- as in britain and the netherlands -rrb- .
the country is ruled accordingly and hence nothing changes .
everything in the name of " la gloire " and nothing in the name of progress .
pity .
albert , amsterdam sarkozy would like to apply for liberalism but can not even pronounce the word .
the ps : officially the hymn is still " the international " and capitalism is not an accepted system -lrb- i predict ps will split up -rrb- .
labor party is assimilated with far right .
most of young people want to become " fonctionnaire " very few chance i come back to this funny country expect of course for holidays or retirement .
didier lebon , french expat - bruxelles french people are capable of the best and the worst beleive me !
with us , you have to expect the unexpected .
that is , one week only before the first round , i have still hope / faith that the majority of the people will hear the two speeches of sarkozy and royal and realise , in all honesty , that the first one has very dangerous ideas and the second is our only hope .
but even on the best case sceanario of segolene , being elected , she better keeps her promises , otherwise some very hard time is awaiting france , let me tell you - i shoud know , i am french myself .
the task is not going to be easy .
vanina st martin , edinburgh , scotland i think those that are denigrating this relative stability in british and american politics are missing the whole point of this article .
what is being argued -lrb- and quite correctly , i may add -rrb- is in fact that british and american politics is less colourful than french politics because of this airtime regulation - but that their political systems are better off in terms of stability and effectiveness because of this .
the gentleman who brought up italian politics brings a great point .
if it 's ' colour ' you 're after , italy is even ' better ' than france .
but just as the french system finally pales relative to the anglo-saxon ones in terms of providing results to its people , does this mean that you would trade your french system for an even less effective but more colourful one in italy -lrb- or india -rrb- ?
if so , i 'm sure there are a lot of italians and indians who would jump at that offer .
h. juneja , london , uk france may be experiencing difficulty economically and with immigration , but as a nation it should be admired for doing two things : following its own path , and being open to a real political spectrum .
one thing notably lacking amongst these commments is a sense of shared history between francophones and anglophones - canada is predicted to sky rocket to over 50 million citizens by 2040 , easily rivalling france and the uk in population ... we have the great benefit of both nations ' political and social heritage and it has done us very well .
british stoicism and french joi-de-vivre make for a vigorous and lively culture , and it should not be forgotten that whether the tories win the next election in the uk or sarkozy does win in france , the essence of their cultures wo n't change and the politicians ultimately will have to be true to the average citizen 's concept of their nation .
the us aside , doomsday scenarios just are n't realistic in the modern europe .
nathan jenkins , london , canada the only advice i can give the french people is ... do n't try to emulate britain .
if i had the means , i would have moved to france 20 years ago .
alex maricic , fife , scotland what the french want is someone who is not afraid to take on the criminals who , in the last 30 years , have turned safe and pleasant french " banlieues " into territories occupied by work-shy , integrists , anti-french delinquents issued from uncontrolled immigration .
jean-luc royer , england what amazes me is that the candidates are allowed to get away with so much .
the french tv journalists are so subservient .
what is needed is for each candidate to be given a good paxman-style grilling and then a live debate amonst themselves with a strong chairman .
john ette , le pradet , france being an american studying and working in france , i find the presidential election very interesting .
i am not sure who will win but , either way politics and democracy is alive and kicking in france and i hope it will always stay that way .
i would love it if in the usa we could have more than just two choices and two parties for our presidential elections coming up next year .
my french friends are very open about their views on the canidates and we love discussing our different perspectives of each canidate and speculating on how they would change france .
i find that the journalist of this article has n't given serious thought or consideration to the way of life and history of the french people and their political system .
having lived here for almost 2 years i was a bit offended by the tone of his article and i am not even french .
i wish the best for france and hope that no matter who wins they will do the best they can for their country and its citizens .
erin , lille , france as all the real power now rests in brussels and strasbourg maybe it ? s time for eu citizens to stop paying attention , as so many have already done , to local national elections and concentrate on how they are being represented within european institutions .
where it seems democracy plays second fiddle to bureaucracy i propose that national election candidates receive zero free air time as a first step towards shifting our attention .
a change that would be simultaneously cost effective , popular and egalitarian. mike sell , founex , switzerland i am a french citizen , living in malaysia and expect to vote in the april presidential elections .
i love my country and believe most french people are very lucky to have been born french even though , like everywhere else things could be much improved .
i am also one of the apparently unprecedented large number of undecided voters .
to put it more more simply , i find it hard to decide which of the candidates is the least unpalatable .
mitterrand , de gaulle , pompidou , giscard d 'estaing had stature , a rationally thought out political programme and a coherent vision of what france should be , whether you agreed with them or not .
this lot -lrb- royal , sarkozy , bayrou , le pen et al -rrb- are a bunch of undistinguished politicians scrambling for power .
pauvre france !
i 'll still vote because i believe it is a duty -lrb- hard won over the centuries -rrb- but without any conviction .
christine sathiah , penang , malaysia i have to say i enjoy reading rich english people living in limousin / aquitaine / languedoc-roussillon complaining about the french welfare system in happy oblivion of the rest of france , which would be destroyed in the way so many northern , scottish and welsh towns were by unrestricted thatcherism in the 1980s .
certainly , france needs economic reform if it is to go forward from where it is now , but the sort of ruthless cutthroat politics that sarkozy is advocating is frightening for people in the north of france , where the collapse of industry is still felt very strongly , and where a " tough " immigration policy would create tensions that do n't need to be exacerbated .
mark brown , lens , france i think france 's " equal time " standard , while perhaps cumbersome from a tv producer 's standpoint , is far superior to the system in the us where presidential candidates are given large endowments of public money to produce 30 second tv commercials .
the result is an enormously inefficent use of public and private resources to fund essentially smear campaigns where issue-oriented discussion is practically non-existent .
however , this would probably upset the us media lobby , so do n't expect change any time soon .
mike taylor , ann arbor , michigan usa have lived in both countries and in france presently .
sorry to disappoint everyone but there is no ideal political system wheather from the states , great britain or france and i agree with the negative points concerning the us + gb .
however the particularity of france is that the french people have been living with the myth of the " 30 glorieuses " -lrb- the best 30 economic years after ww2 -rrb- and kept to believe that it could continue for another 30 . and there is now a huge gap between the state paid employees -lrb- in the energy , and transport big dept -rrb- who enjoy work security and numerous privileges and the rest : self-employed , low payed workers from small firms , shopkeepers . who do not enjoy eany goodies and have to pay their electricity and gas and telephone bills full rate -lrb- unlike employees of edf -lrb- for electricty -rrb- or france telecom ... -rrb- i would like to know if employees from the different electricity co. in gb or us pay their electricity at reduced rate ?
sometimes you feel ! in france you are in a republic with some old fashion aristocratic / monarchist remaining that everyone moans about but not one politician dares talking about let alone question its democratic values ...
to finish france will always be a great country of contradictions where poeple love laws which loks perfect on paper but impossible to apply in real . i just hope that this time french people will refuse to be kept in the dark or above the clouds of the real economic situation -lrb- one of the highest european debt , a shrinking pension system . -rrb- and that we have to accept and adapt to this new globalisation of everything -lrb- from economy to terrorism -rrb- and think hard and suggest a real alternative ...
elisabeth , france + england i 've lived all over europe and for the last five years in paris and much as i love the city , country , culture , way of life etc .
i have to honestly say that i 've never been worse off financially .
i would probably qualify for housing benefit and several other subsidies but i 'm restricted from earning overtime .
it is a crazy situation .
if i was american i 'd vote democrat and have always considered myself centre-left but in france sarkozy is seen as extreme and if that 's the case , well i 'm extreme too. john healy , paris , france the issue of air time in the media is undermined by the way the media portait a candidate in news pieces .
for example , n sarkozy will win debates after debates but the media in france will mention his name every time there are riots for whatever reasons .
also , royal was shown as the messiah until she messed it up herself .
suddenly bayrou turns up and the media almost openly present him as the ' if you do n't want sarkozy in , vote for this no-mark ' .
basically the media -lrb- most of which has leftist ideals -rrb- do n't want sarkozy in and will do whatever they can to sink him .
shameful but so typical of the french elite -lrb- media and politics -rrb- which has put the country in this situation in the first place .
nick , london le pen 's score last time was not the fault of the minor candidates !
the first turn was won by the " leave me alone i 'm on holiday " party ; in fact the level of abstentionwas higher than the score of any candidate !
judy wood , lyon , france france desperately needs economic reform and the successful integration of immigrants into french society .
sarkozy may be able to deliver on the former but will fail miserably on the latter .
his record as interior minister is shocking in this respect and his potential election may only highten the tensions between les banlieues and the police .
royal would keep france economically uncompetitive for the duration of her presidential term and her foreign policy gaffes so far do not inspire confidence .
sarkozy will easily win the first round with royal trailing in second , but sarkozy is a polarising figure and i would not be surprised to see segolene becoming president .
ben lonsdale , manchester i am no prophet , but i forecast there will be no one from the left in the runoff .
sarkozy and le pen will eventually be the final contenders .
why ?
because french do not confess they are voting for le pen in opinion polls .
because the old far right leader has not been campaigning himself , letting his daughter marine le pen on the front line .
and she succeeded in giving a softer image of her father .
because he has criticised recent measures against smokers and speed checks and such type of demagogic speech is very popular with french .
because nothing has really changed since 21st of april 2002 but there has been the riots at the end of 2005 and the ones in gare du nord end of march 2007 and this is fuelling the protesting votes in favour of le pen .
there will be a new shock on the 22nd of april 2007 when le pen is placed in the final race .
i am no prophet , but sarkozy will be the next french president .
and what about royal in all this ?
pardon me ...
who did you say ?
antoine de champs , tours , france olivier besancenot sounds like a man who knows what he is talking about ... rightly condemning the appalling neo-liberal capitalism that has festered under both the right and the so-called left in france for far too long .
it is the unmitigated disater of the capitalist system that has created the massive unemployment and alienation , discrimination , and injustice throughout france on a vast scale.how refreshing then to hear someone putting forward a real alternative to the much hated neo-liberal capitalist nightmare of more disatrous privatisation plans for big business , which both sarkozy and royal defend .
how refreshing then to hear someone condemn the violence and discrimination of the french police .
how refreshing to hear someone defend public services and public sector workers , the right to a stable and decent job and present ideas about creating a genuine socialist alternative to capitalism .
another world is possible and another france is necessary .
segolene royal seems to be presenting the same old failed blairite right wing ideas.think again !
p.black , uk i think a new generation of politicians is now there for france , but i 'm not sure , the coming president will be accepted by the whole population .
i 'm a wee bit anxious for france 's future .
f.roux , bourges , france , you are wrong to underestimate the importance of francois bayrou and only to focus on the main both political parities : the right and the left nicolas , paris , france i 've lived in france for many years , and run a business with my husband .
yes - france has a wonderful way of life , a health system second to none , but economically , france is on its knees .
the loony left - more like an extreme version of michael foot 's socialist vision - is desperate to protect the social benefits which have been acquired over 30 years and which cripple the economy .
socialist politicians declare proudly that they do not own shares , a nasty right-wing habit of investing in industry .
madame royal claims to speak for the lowly-paid while benefiting from her salaries and perks .
in the meantime , my husband and i pay away 60 % of our earnings to support a lumbering state with its 6 million civil servants .
good luck to sarko , he 's the best of a mediocre bunch , the only one who might just bring a little egalité to france .
madeleine dickson , limoges , france an item that should be more prominent on the election agenda on both sides of politics is what should be done about the future of the world 's largest nickel deposit , new caledonia .
the country is at boiling point from a mining perspective and some leadership from france is much neeeded , after all it is her duty to do so .
sebastien carpin , brisbane , australia i agree that equal airtime for all of the candidates is a strength of the french system , but referring to the disparaging of the american electoral system as coca-cola v pepsi : in 2002 , did n't it eventually come down to le pen or chirac ?
far-right vs right ... how 's that for choice ?
khalil , boston , ma , usa i am a french citizen and have lived in the usa since the age of 8 .
i often hear many negative comments about france and europe .
i believe that these comments are born of jealousy .
while france may have its problems as everyone does i find the french approach and thought process refreshing and full of life .
i believe in the french process and have every confidence that france will prosper and the french will continue to preserve their language , culture and unique way of life in an increasing dull anglo-american world of politically correct " grey zone " .
how nice to know that there is still a country that has not sold out .
in the us , where everything including values and principles is for sale , i find it to be stale and the people in part uninterested and unmotivated beyond reaching for the next burger or bag of junk food to put a few more kilos on their already large frame , to put it nicely .
france has and will continue to be a society of free thinkers who are not afraid to voice their thoughts .
vive la france ! ! !
arthur brown , lb usa the french left needs to unite and fight for a radical redistribution of wealth and the urgent transformation of the deeply corrupt capitalist system to a socially just , participative and profoundly democratic , co-operative green socialist society based on the sustainable common ownership of the means of production .
this is an alternative as global capitalism runs amok , wreaking havoc and global climate chaos in its wake .
capitalism is doomed !
another france is possible and highly necessary .
patrick black , uk i am a sixth-form student and as i am talking about le pen in my oral exam the french elections are naturally very interesting to me .
i do n't think le pen will win -lrb- and , after extensive research the vast number of anti-semitic comments he has made over the years , i sincerely hope he wo n't win as well -rrb- but i am not convinced by either sarkozy or royal .
sarkozy seems very underhand , a man who you would imagine to be right-handed but to keep his wallet in his left-hand pocket ; royal should not be let anywhere near a microphone when it comes to foreign policy .
i do n't know much about bayrou , but i would not be appalled if he won - he appears to be the best of a bad bunch .
chris stanley , stroud , england much like american political races , advertising a politician is a political party 's biggest concern .
the bnp and ump have marketed their candidates to match the sentiment and feeling of their constituents , ms. royal feels scripted , however has an uncanny ability to improvise her responses to well thought-out questions from the press .
sarkozy swears to carry out his party 's goals but incorporates his own ideas .
however he is sheepishly stubborn towards alternative methods of carrying out policies .
i think many voters will vote based on their feelings towards each candidate and not on what policies would be best for the country .
finn raftery , seattle , united states in principle , it 's democratic to provide the same air time for all politicians who manage to get 500 mayor 's signatures in order to run for presidency .
unfortunately , the result is the exact opposite .
those who only want to rant , and have no political platform because they know that they will never be elected , feel free to lobotomize political discourse in france .
the result has been 25 years of meaningless hypocrisy .
hardly anything said has any relation to reality and as a result , very little if anything is done to address the real issues .
worse , the extremism of so many statements , along with the infamous " acquis sociaux " , on which no one will give an inch , lull people into hating work , which is , of course , " a form of oppression " of the " monstrous capitalist exploiters " .
ho hum .
and worse still , if and when sarkozy wins , the undemocratic left will not accept the result of the democratic process .
any reform will be met by attempts to totally block france by massive protest movements .
pity .
douglas mccarthy , paris , france picking up from what richard tomlinson wrote , as a british citizen living in france why will i lose my right to vote in the uk national elections when i complete my fifteenth year abroad ?
that is truly losing one 's vote , in our so-called eu of equals .
john ward , metz , france the problem in france is that french society in recent years has been turned upside down and they do not know what to do about it .
france has seen a rapid rise in immigration , unemployment and violence .
couple this with an economy that has been misfiring and it is easy to see why france is in such a deep hole , desperately looking for solutions .
it may hurt french pride , but modelling itself on great britain and taking the best of what the british have done , whilst keeping the best of french could really sort out modern france .
take immigration - why can the french not embrace multiculturalism as the british have ?
what about the economy - the british do n't seem that worried about globalisation , so why are we ? ..
the british have barely any marxists , simply because there is no place for them .
in france they offer a solution to a problem , britain has no problem -lrb- relatively -rrb- and therefore no heavy solutions need offering .
france needs to think seriously , politicians need to step back , be brave and say things that actually the french may not want to hear .
unfortunately , owing to this election , that is not going to happen , and france is not going to get any better .
frederic lacroix , paris , francais eric paul - you seem to fundamentally misunderstand american political campaigns and related us legislation .
section 315 of the us communications act details the equal time rule regulating us political campaigns .
it and subsequent amendments are very well crafted and might inform you more completely .
i do think that france 's strict equal air time rule is to be admired and is something modern democracies should strive for ; as some already do , though perhaps not in such an austere manner .
n. campbell , new orleans , usa personally i feel sorry for the french .
there is no-one worthy of the presidency today .
the choice is awful , but what must be understood is that the first round is the real choice and public opinion , the second is a knock-out to get rid of the worst candidate .
maybe they should really start thinking about voting for and not against .
be warned they are heading for thatcherism if they vote sarkozy , and we british all know what that did !
we are still paying .
i live , but sadly do n't vote , in france and have done for 15 years , this is my 3rd election .
v.miller , nancy , france the role of president urgently needs reforming -lrb- as does the whole constitution -rrb- , as no one is very sure about which role -lrb- s -rrb- he has , especially if confronted with an opposition parliament .
these elections have been the most exciting in decades , yet i do believe that none of the candidates will take the necessary stance to reform the institutions .
i also fear that due to the huge division of france into pro- and anti-sarkozy , we might very possibly end up with a cohabitation for the next five years .
the most striking aspect of this campaign is the increasing role of the media , especially television .
the majority of the french electorate will not seek information about the candidates but will expect it to come to them , mainly through television and radio -lrb- still a very popular medium , especially the morning and afternoon news -rrb- .
in such a system , the most able orators and communicators have a clear advantage .
unfortunately , these happen to be mm sarkozy and le pen .
quentin liger , london , uk well , the french system may have the advantage that we look at the candidates ' ideas and not only at how much cash they raise for their campaign .
living in the us , i came to realize that no matter what you believe in , money is the only driving force toward a warm seat at the white house .
emmanuel gilles , bronx , usa from the popularity of sarkozy , i 'd say any leanings toward marxism here are fleeing in the face of growing economic and globalization problems .
he 's a scary guy , sarko , the way he reaches for the far-right votes and disarms his critics by saying , " is it wrong to talk about national identity ?
is that a bad word ? "
because of course they ca n't say that without alienating a lot of french people !
many of my french friends here agree that the election is pitiful .
there is no one offering any real solutions to the problems threatening this country .
but it would be nice to hear more about bayrou .
he 's the most sensible by far , and the only one really trying to address the issues of immigration and discrimination .
maria alexander , aix-en-provence , france i 've had enough of this france-bashing : it is still one of the best countries to live , and i would n't even think of moving to the rainy , crowded country ruled by the nhs-dicta .
here , life is good and relaxed , the best education and health system , i pay only a little bit more than what i used to pay in the us as taxes .
the political life has not been anaesthetized like it has been in anglo-saxon countries - and we all know where that leads us : bush , born-again christians , evolution-revisionists and co .
funny that some of the french-bashing is coming from expats in france .
if it is so bad , what are you guys doing here ? : -rrb- france has a lot of problems , sure , but it is still " better " than the rest - nothing is ever perfect ..
baris tarim , caen , france one must recognise the plethora of choices available to french voters .
charles de gaulle said there are as many ideas in france as there are cheeses .
this is perfectly represented in this election with for example le pen 's far right and laguiller 's far left .
i think these extremist ideals reveal a great deal about the sense of upheaval in french society and shows how fragmented a society it is .
the unemployment , lack of economic growth , immigration are all thorny issues which are as divisive as they are polemic and the longer these particular problems last , the more it adds to le pen 's following .
as for le pen , he will always get that 10 % -15 % he consistently gets in elections because of how determined his supporters are .
his recent success though is down to a series of socio-economic problems which a series of governments , both right-wing and left-wing , have failed to solve .
cormac mac gabhann , dublin , ireland having lived in france for some time , it strikes me that its system of high job protection and generous social benefits serves only to ensure that the underprivileged few are condemned live with few prospects , a life spent literally on the margins : on the council estates bordering the big cities , dependant on the state .
no surprise that the signs of social fracture and growing dissatisfaction are plain to see .
so much for equality , freedom and brotherhood !
i do n't like sarkozy much as a person , but he seems to be the only candidate willing to undertake the drastic liberalisation that france so desperately needs .
dominic higgins , london , england eu citizens are entitled to vote in eu elections , local council and industrial tribunal elections , so richard tomlinson 's complaint is not fully accurate .
there is always the option of acquiring french nationality for the other elections .
i have done so and this is one of the reasons why .
david buick , rennes , france to mr tomlinson : as an eu citizen and permanent resident in an eu country other than your own , you are allowed to vote -lrb- and stand -rrb- in local elections : that includes city council , county council and " region " council elections .
then , just as i was not allowed to vote in the general election when i lived in the uk , you are not allowed to vote in the presidential election in france .
julien randon-furling , paris , france in my extended conversations with french citizens from all walks of life , it surprises me that most are not too far apart on issues like immigration and globalization .
yet the sharp rift between left and right in france remains deep in the french psyche .
it reaches down to a visceral level that defies logic and plays into the political strategies of career politicians .
is it possible for france to keep democracy but ditch its self-seeking party system ?
donald williams , springfield , massachusetts , usa i think it 's great that you have so many choices in france and that there is a law enforcing equal time to all .
your system makes me jealous as an american .
we are forced to choose between only two candidates who are in fact almost identical anyway .
all other parties or independents are refused any time by the media .
mark ellis , york , usa your article lacks the respect that we deserve .
you dismiss us without really looking at who we are and what we do .
the french communist party , of which i am a member , has 130,000 members and 13,000 persons that hold public offices .
your own liberal party has far fewer members .
who are you to dismiss the views of the citizens in any of these parties ?
i should remind you that many dismissed the views of democrats in the early 18th century , yet europe was transformed .
you seem to believe marxists have no place in politics today .
i , on the other hand , find your clinging to a monarchy outdated and a drain on your state 's finances .
i suppose you have the right to maintain a royal family .
i would prefer to maintain our low rate of child poverty and fight for a socialist state .
russell yates , meaux , france i am following my first election as a french resident , though not voter , and agree that the short presentations by each contender each day are very snappy and engaging .
saying something different each time holds the interest too .
the galloping music that opens each space is also attention-grabbing .
trouble is , they all sound so sincere and seem so nice !
what is important , i think , is that yes they are reading prepared material , not reacting to questions , but at least they get to finish what they have to say without being constantly interrupted .
-lrb- so many presenters take so long introducing their guest that the guest with a fascinating point to make often barely says hello before the time slot is over . -rrb-
especially in the morning , i think a straight , uninterrupted performance is more attractive than voices shouting all at once and seeing all the candidates does help sort who is who and what they stand for .
how often have you gone to vote without any idea of the face behind the name on the ballot paper ?
angela sheard , romans-sur-isère , france .
i have n't seen any evidence that a single candidate is facing up to the french budget deficit .
the whole country is living on the never-never , and that ca n't go on for ever .
andrew h , london uk the tone of the article implies that it is french democracy that is bizarre for at least attempting to ensure that all parties have an opportunity to make their platforms known .
an alternative view would be that allowing more ' popular ' parties more airtime -lrb- as in england -rrb- vastly reduces the chance of smaller parties acquiring the votes that would entitle them to greater coverage next time round .
the game is rigged from the start , and yet this is considered the norm from which the french deviate .
danny millum , london it is a very good thing that all candidates are given the same time on tv .
it means that democracy and debate are still alive and that economics and finance , and tv companies , can not impose their rule completely .
france therefore avoids to quite a large extent horrors such as the pepsi / coke us election system .
the issue is not so much about keeping marxism alive , however relevant that philosophy remains , but to avoid as much as possible that " la chose politique " becomes only a matter of experts and professional politicians , an intoxicating show in which the ordinary citizen would be only a spectator ...
thinking can only be a dynamic process when all possiblities are considered , even those which at the moment seem unreasonable .
that is why i wish that france remains as much as possible the laboratory of ideas it has been since at least the 18th century .
finance only likes ideas which like finance , which are compatible with it and i want to think freely .
as for the british system , i do n't think the british have a relation to politics which could be compared to the one the french have .
the british seem very consensual and traditional and i do n't want a two-party system for france .
eric paul , nice , france france is nothing like as poor as the uk was under wilson and callaghan .
yet talking about singing the marseillaise has some of the same desperation to find a bit of national pride as union jack underpants had in the carnaby street of the sixties .
it is odd that the country that put liberty into its national motto should have such a fear of liberalism - as if it and its multicultural cousin will come and eat them and their way of life .
but until the french realise that the rest of the world does n't owe them a living and they ca n't protect everything french by throwing protectionist money at it from higher and higher taxes , they will continue to suffer from high unemployment and the high taxes that most try to avoid paying .
there is nothing incompatible between a healthy yet well-regulated market economy and the french way of life .
but it does n't take twelve people to plant the season 's flowers on a roundabout !
ben lenthall , cahors , france another excellent analysis by mark ...
pity only that he left out francois bayrou , who tries to introduce a new political style in france .
for me it seems obvious that france has a more lively democratic culture than the uk .
compare this very open election with the passing on of power from blair to brown in the uk .
the absence of a real democratic debate in the uk is quite a shame for a country that likes to paint itself as the stalwart of democratic rule .
ronald gruenebaum , brussels , belgium unfortunately france is not the western european country where you can spot the highest level of support for the jurassic marxist ideology .
when it comes to sound representation in the two chambers of parliament this misfortune is still an italian privilege .
french marxists are a sideshow with no real power , fragmented maybe colourful.the real black spot in france is the far right - as jurassic and out of date as the marxists in italy but for france misfortune , still with some real power .
enrico ferrero , hellerup , denmark whether the french vote right or left , a man or woman , the french policy of neocolonialism and active support for unpopular puppets in africa shall continue relentlessly .
mofor tangmo edward , cameroon i think mr mardell has unknowingly or wittingly left out the factor that underlies french politics at present , fear ; unemployment , violent behaviour , poverty , institutions that no longer are able to respond to the concerns of the majority ...
paul hubball , france i am an eu citizen , am a permanent resident in france , pay my taxes here , but am not allowed to vote in the elections .
how can it be legal under eu law that we -lrb- and we are many -rrb- are excluded from the democratic process ?
richard tomlinson , mandelieu , france i am a french citizen , and , within the forseeable future , a permanent resident and taxpayer in the uk !
i cherish my right and duty to vote , and will be voting for the french president on sunday and have been frustrated at not being able to vote at important uk elections in the uk , especially when i see so many uk citizens not exercising their right to vote ! -lrb- it cost many people their lives or their freedom to ask for the right to vote , in some countries there still is no right to vote , yet , nowadays , both in the uk and in france , so many people ca n't be bothered ! ! ! -rrb-
but , i have lived here long enough now to apply for british citizenship -lrb- and am married to a british citizen -rrb- .
thankfully , now , i do not have to renounce my french nationality to do that !
-lrb- you used to be able to be only french , nothing else , or else renounce the french nationality -rrb- so , i will apply for british citizenship , it costs £ 268 , and takes up to 8 months to process , but at least i will be able to vote on uk issues and for the uk government !
richard t , perhaps you could investigate whether there is a similar possibility for you to gain these rights in france ?
helgaflower , cheltenham , uk to reply to richard tomlinson , i am a permanent resident in the uk , paying my taxes here , have been living here for 6 years now , and not allowed to vote here in the elections , because i am not a british citizen .
so england is not that much different in that case .
but i have always been a person who adored france , the culture , the country .
i have never lived there , but i am aware that burocracy makes it difficult sometimes , but with so many english people moving there , it ca n't be that bad , can it ?
they should stop complaining about it , or move back here if it 's so problematic over there .
em , manchester to richard tomlinson : under eu law an eu citizen legally resident in another member state can vote and stand in the the local and european elections , therefore you can do that in france -lrb- i 've done it in belgium -rrb- .
however , no eu member state allows non-citizens to vote in parliamentary or presidential elections , so nothing special about france there .
your anger should be directed at the british government because it is uk law which takes away your right to vote in the uk after 15 years outside of the country , something that many other european countries do not do .
it is undemocratic , but it 's got nothing to do with the eu .
rebecca , brussels to mr tomlinson , you can vote for local election in france like most of the european countries .
if you want to vote you can ask for the french citizenship thierry le romancer , paris france name your e-mail address town & country comments the bbc may edit your comments and not all emails will be published .

the diary is published every thursday .
to always see the latest edition , please click here and bookmark this page .
the man the opinion polls say will be the next president of france has been out and about in the loire valley .
nicolas sarkozy has shaken hands with people restoring a chateau , chatted with youngsters learning hairdressing and made his triumphant way out of a hall in tours packed close with supporters .
he has passionately defended his controversial record .
i love election campaigns and watching politicians in action .
but most people get their politics not in the flesh but from people like me , tv reporters .
and in france for the next couple of weeks they 'll be getting a rather odd picture .
let 's put it this way .
would it make any difference to the result of the next british general election if gordon brown and david cameron were given exactly the same air time as nick griffin of the british national party -lrb- bnp -rrb- or the candidates of the socialist workers party ?
that 's what has to happen in france .
the presidential election has two rounds , and the first vote serves to narrow a large field to a simple two-horse race for the second round .
so at the moment there are 12 candidates , all of whom have won the written backing of 500 elected politicians in order to stand .
segolene royal is battling to consolidate left-wing support here 's the rub .
by law french radio and tv have to give all the candidates the same amount of air time .
all broadcasters know the horrors of stop-watch balance .
many is the time i 've got the message " the editor says can you get the snp in ? "
" well tell him ' yes ' but i 'll need another minute . "
" he 'll give you 45 seconds . "
it may be vital for democracy , but it does n't make for elegant television .
but british law and the bbc 's own guidelines are as nothing compared to the rigour of french law .
to include a short 20-second clip of each candidate a report would be four minutes long without the reporter saying a word of introduction .
so each and every report would have to be at least five minutes long .
the upshot is that of course it does n't happen .
there are special election programmes , but the news deals in opinion polls and generalities .
left-wing rebels but this has one unexpected bonus .
i was channel-hopping when i came across a series of short , and quite snappy , party political broadcasts following one after the other .
you might think this sounds dull viewing , but it is a lot more interesting , and gives you a much better perspective , than something tagged on before or after the news .
the best watch was oliver besancenot , the trotskyite postman .
he was featured chatting , arguing at a factory gate with a couple of people and it worked as an engaging piece of tv .
madame royal was deliberately presidential .
but what came across to me was the scale of the opposition she faces , and i do n't mean mr sarkozy .
le pen stunned france by reaching the runoff in 2002 it used to be a slogan of republicans in france : " no enemies to the left ! "
this is not something segolene is likely to say .
in broadcast after broadcast , the same message was repeated : the threat of globalisation , the trampled rights of workers , the ravages of capitalism and economic liberalism .
this of course is not just the result of a strict broadcasting law .
the left is more fractured and marxism more alive in france than anywhere else in europe .
in britain , there are of course marxist groups , but most people seem to believe that capitalism is the only currently possible economic system and arguments are about redistribution and restrictions within it .
it is such an accepted belief that it feels rather odd writing it down .
but in france that is not so .
this has a very real effect on this election .
the practical effect of a vote for the communist party , the revolutionary communist league , the alternative globalisation party , workers struggle or the workers party is to take a vote away from ms royal .
i am not trying to undermine the glorious unpredictability of democracy .
of course workers struggle could leap from the 6 % it got last time to victory .
but do n't hold your breath ..
what many on the left fear is a repeat of 2002 , when the smaller parties leeched support from lionel jospin to allow far-right leader jean-marie le pen through to the second round .
of course , mr sarkozy faces a similar threat from smaller parities of the right , but his real problem is with the other two realistic contenders - le pen and francois bayrou .
campaign contrasts in the packed hall in tours , sarkozy 's passionate discourse on immigration and integration gets them stamping their feet .
i 'm sitting on the steps of a temporary stand next to a woman in her mid-twenties .
as sarkozy came to one climactic point of his argument the twenty-something woman next to me exclaimed " voila ! " - as if he was providing the clinching point that had eluded her in past arguments with friends .
throughout his speech she had been muttering " c 'est vrai , c 'est vrai " -lrb- true , true ! -rrb- .
a few seats away a smart woman , her grey hair cut elegantly short , smartly punched the air and waved a poster , almost in imitation of political activists she had seen on tv .
i did n't get the feeling it was something she did very often .
i have been to three segolene royal rallies and there is a palpable difference .
the socialist party supporters are happy to back someone who could win , who shares at least some of their values .
here it is the man himself they are backing .
outside i talk to a woman who says she lived in london for a long while .
she wants sarkozy as her president , but wants to justify her choice .
" in america i would not be a republican , " she tells me , continuing : " he and tony blair are -lrb- she pressed her palms together -rrb- are they not ? "
certainly in the hall i did n't hear a single idea that would be shockingly out of place in a labour manifesto , i did n't hear anything that could not have come from the lips of john reid or david blunkett .
on second thoughts , i 'm not sure i can imagine them singing the marseillaise .
my new friend says she remembers " when your country was poor , " adding that french socialists are like the labour party of those days .
but the labour party in those days did n't have french tv guidelines giving marxist factions valuable air time .
please use the post form below to comment on any of the issues raised in the diary .
in my part of la france profonde , my neighbours will vote for anyone who promises to get the stifling beaurocracy off their backs and let them earn a living .
unfortunately , they do n't see anyone among the candidates able or willing to do so , so their vote will be cast for one of the usual suspects - a career politician wary of upsetting any of the ' social partners ' - and only appearances will change in france after the presidential election. doris ward , argenton chateau france having lived in france for the last 2 years i really enjoy the different appraoch the french have to politics .
people are very open with their opinions and really enjoy the fight. it is a great change from the ' soundbite ' contect over the channel .
however no-one seems to really want to rock the boat and unfortunately in our global world this boat is heading for reefs .
james hodson , montgenevre , france i wish the bbc was more aware that international opinion can have an effect on national choice of politics .
a quick analysis of all the political candidates agenda -reveals that sarkozy is only interested in becoming president and nothing more -lrb- social change takes years unless it comes from a police state -rrb- and royal is the only real opposition to sarkozy .
favourite candidates are bové -lrb- sustainability -rrb- and voynet -lrb- green -rrb- although french friends holding votes agree they will vote royal to ensure the safety of their fellow citizens -lrb- citizen in the sense people who live here -rrb- .
penelope , paris those who compare jean-marie le pen 's movement to the bnp and brand him " far-right " or an " extremist " prove that they have no understanding of what is happening in france today .
le pen will get more than 20 % of the votes and will be in the second round .
do n't forget that he has consistently improved his scores in the presidential elections and ended up with 17 % last time .
also his electorate is the most loyal of all with over 80 % faithfuls .
add that mégret and the populist party have joined forces with him , that 's another good 2 % .
i vote josé bové so i believe my comments are unbiased .
gaston favresse , london as a french citizen living in sweden , i shall next sunday vote for the only leader possible.jean marie le pen .
france and the rest of europe need a wake up call .
the left and the right are the same .
the time hascomefor a massive rebellion against muslim immigration , and the dictators in bruxelles .
i rather votefor a party that says clearly what it thinks than the hypocritical lefties or rightists. c.simon , sweden i 'm a french citizen born in mauritius .
well it 's incredible to see how polls can direct people views in two directions - mrs royal and mr sarkosy .
what about the others ?
what is the the margin of error of these polls 5 % - 10 % or 0 % as they wish us to beleive ? ? ?
if so probably again we 'll see another 2002 when no poll institute gave the right predictions .
published polls which do not give their margin of error are rubish when they give a winner by a 2 % margin .
bhageerutty kishore , bourg en bresse , france we droped equal airtime rules in the states back in the 90 's and to be honest third parties have done at least as well or better since then .
nick michelewicz , keene , new hampshire , usa the socialists are the biggest threat to this country as they have an actual chance of being elected in the second round .
how ségolène can justify her ridiculous program is beyond me , case in point : increasing minimum wage to 1.500 ? a month ... how ? with good will and a rose !
as the median -lrb- not average ! -rrb- salary hovers between 1250 and 1400 i wonder how on earth she will be able to find 200 extra euros a month for the majority of french workers , it does n't make sense , she peddles populist ideals and her campaign is focused on the criticising of the right .
she has no authority , no economic sense and is the epitome of the gauche caviar .
why does it have to be so bad to earn money and make a good living , somehow it is inextricably linked to the french instilled catholic morals , that despite the laïcité of the state , continues to permeate society .
in france the less you talk about money and the poorer and more charitable you portray yourself the better you are .
henrik nordling , paris , france to those of you that likes our " same time for everyone policy " never heard or seen the people begging for or votes .
they are away from reality , because they do n't have a chance to win .
they always say the same damn speech , because they do n't have any other idea ... ideas from one century ago , ideas that were proven to be big mistakes ...
they 're not even funny .
when i was a kid , mother told me maggie was evil .
today , i think we really would need someone like her , someone that would not stop when two or three demonstrator would show up ... just to move on one day .
nick , paris , france i have lived here 4 years .
i have a multi ethnic group of friends .
they are basically afraid of sarkozy .
this is man who stands on tiptoes when he is photographed .
who wants to stop immigration , who calls poor people scum .
he is openly hunting votes from the national front .
he has immense energy when he talks , and power of conviction , and perhaps is too excitable , making some comment he might already be going crazy .
by contrast the problem is royale is so serene she is turning into a non-entity , she does n't seem to want it badly enough and she is not leading at all but telling the french a load of policies but nothing about how it will happen .
this is her big error , if she ranted about the state of the country and showed people what she willing to do to fix it she would walk this election .
she smiles and talks in droning voice almost like a ' stepford mum ' .
bayrou looks like he will win through because of fear of one and apathy for the other .
those english or other nationalites touting sarko would do well to be very attentive to what he says .
this is a man who admires bush us middle eastern policy , it is a man many fear could be the new french emperor .
europe is not his cup of tea. collie , nice as a young british person working in france i would say one of the biggest problems here is the lack of trust the older generation have in the young .
people here think it 's strange that a 21-year old should have completed university and be working full time as in britain , and the baby-boom generation just seems to be sitting on all the wealth and positions of responsibility without opening up to the young .
often all twenty-somethings can do is spend years at university or doing poorly paid " stages " -lrb- work placements -rrb- rather than being encouraged to start contributing to the economy .
henry rich , paris , france france is probably fine for all the middle-aged people living in it that benefited from lots of perks handed out when the economy was doing fine and employment was high during the 30 glorieuses .
to answer those that say france is doing fine , i will say that it is for those people !
but it certainly is not for young people who have to beg for jobs , get paid nothing , have no perks , have high real estate prices and live at home .
i am living in the us , and as a young person , i am doing very well for myself .
everyday young people leave france just like me -lrb- 300,000 just in london alone -rrb- .
france seriously needs to think to liberalize its economy , so that more jobs can be created . until then , the brain drain and the lack of investments will continue .
after all , who wants to put their money in a place where the government takes most of it .
peter , washington dc despite all the claims about " égalité , fraternité et liberté " , france is still a monarchy , but with an all-powerful president as head of state instead of a powerless king or queen -lrb- as in britain and the netherlands -rrb- .
the country is ruled accordingly and hence nothing changes .
everything in the name of " la gloire " and nothing in the name of progress .
pity .
albert , amsterdam sarkozy would like to apply for liberalism but can not even pronounce the word .
the ps : officially the hymn is still " the international " and capitalism is not an accepted system -lrb- i predict ps will split up -rrb- .
labor party is assimilated with far right .
most of young people want to become " fonctionnaire " very few chance i come back to this funny country expect of course for holidays or retirement .
didier lebon , french expat - bruxelles french people are capable of the best and the worst beleive me !
with us , you have to expect the unexpected .
that is , one week only before the first round , i have still hope / faith that the majority of the people will hear the two speeches of sarkozy and royal and realise , in all honesty , that the first one has very dangerous ideas and the second is our only hope .
but even on the best case sceanario of segolene , being elected , she better keeps her promises , otherwise some very hard time is awaiting france , let me tell you - i shoud know , i am french myself .
the task is not going to be easy .
vanina st martin , edinburgh , scotland i think those that are denigrating this relative stability in british and american politics are missing the whole point of this article .
what is being argued -lrb- and quite correctly , i may add -rrb- is in fact that british and american politics is less colourful than french politics because of this airtime regulation - but that their political systems are better off in terms of stability and effectiveness because of this .
the gentleman who brought up italian politics brings a great point .
if it 's ' colour ' you 're after , italy is even ' better ' than france .
but just as the french system finally pales relative to the anglo-saxon ones in terms of providing results to its people , does this mean that you would trade your french system for an even less effective but more colourful one in italy -lrb- or india -rrb- ?
if so , i 'm sure there are a lot of italians and indians who would jump at that offer .
h. juneja , london , uk france may be experiencing difficulty economically and with immigration , but as a nation it should be admired for doing two things : following its own path , and being open to a real political spectrum .
one thing notably lacking amongst these commments is a sense of shared history between francophones and anglophones - canada is predicted to sky rocket to over 50 million citizens by 2040 , easily rivalling france and the uk in population ... we have the great benefit of both nations ' political and social heritage and it has done us very well .
british stoicism and french joi-de-vivre make for a vigorous and lively culture , and it should not be forgotten that whether the tories win the next election in the uk or sarkozy does win in france , the essence of their cultures wo n't change and the politicians ultimately will have to be true to the average citizen 's concept of their nation .
the us aside , doomsday scenarios just are n't realistic in the modern europe .
nathan jenkins , london , canada the only advice i can give the french people is ... do n't try to emulate britain .
if i had the means , i would have moved to france 20 years ago .
alex maricic , fife , scotland what the french want is someone who is not afraid to take on the criminals who , in the last 30 years , have turned safe and pleasant french " banlieues " into territories occupied by work-shy , integrists , anti-french delinquents issued from uncontrolled immigration .
jean-luc royer , england what amazes me is that the candidates are allowed to get away with so much .
the french tv journalists are so subservient .
what is needed is for each candidate to be given a good paxman-style grilling and then a live debate amonst themselves with a strong chairman .
john ette , le pradet , france being an american studying and working in france , i find the presidential election very interesting .
i am not sure who will win but , either way politics and democracy is alive and kicking in france and i hope it will always stay that way .
i would love it if in the usa we could have more than just two choices and two parties for our presidential elections coming up next year .
my french friends are very open about their views on the canidates and we love discussing our different perspectives of each canidate and speculating on how they would change france .
i find that the journalist of this article has n't given serious thought or consideration to the way of life and history of the french people and their political system .
having lived here for almost 2 years i was a bit offended by the tone of his article and i am not even french .
i wish the best for france and hope that no matter who wins they will do the best they can for their country and its citizens .
erin , lille , france as all the real power now rests in brussels and strasbourg maybe it ? s time for eu citizens to stop paying attention , as so many have already done , to local national elections and concentrate on how they are being represented within european institutions .
where it seems democracy plays second fiddle to bureaucracy i propose that national election candidates receive zero free air time as a first step towards shifting our attention .
a change that would be simultaneously cost effective , popular and egalitarian. mike sell , founex , switzerland i am a french citizen , living in malaysia and expect to vote in the april presidential elections .
i love my country and believe most french people are very lucky to have been born french even though , like everywhere else things could be much improved .
i am also one of the apparently unprecedented large number of undecided voters .
to put it more more simply , i find it hard to decide which of the candidates is the least unpalatable .
mitterrand , de gaulle , pompidou , giscard d 'estaing had stature , a rationally thought out political programme and a coherent vision of what france should be , whether you agreed with them or not .
this lot -lrb- royal , sarkozy , bayrou , le pen et al -rrb- are a bunch of undistinguished politicians scrambling for power .
pauvre france !
i 'll still vote because i believe it is a duty -lrb- hard won over the centuries -rrb- but without any conviction .
christine sathiah , penang , malaysia i have to say i enjoy reading rich english people living in limousin / aquitaine / languedoc-roussillon complaining about the french welfare system in happy oblivion of the rest of france , which would be destroyed in the way so many northern , scottish and welsh towns were by unrestricted thatcherism in the 1980s .
certainly , france needs economic reform if it is to go forward from where it is now , but the sort of ruthless cutthroat politics that sarkozy is advocating is frightening for people in the north of france , where the collapse of industry is still felt very strongly , and where a " tough " immigration policy would create tensions that do n't need to be exacerbated .
mark brown , lens , france i think france 's " equal time " standard , while perhaps cumbersome from a tv producer 's standpoint , is far superior to the system in the us where presidential candidates are given large endowments of public money to produce 30 second tv commercials .
the result is an enormously inefficent use of public and private resources to fund essentially smear campaigns where issue-oriented discussion is practically non-existent .
however , this would probably upset the us media lobby , so do n't expect change any time soon .
mike taylor , ann arbor , michigan usa have lived in both countries and in france presently .
sorry to disappoint everyone but there is no ideal political system wheather from the states , great britain or france and i agree with the negative points concerning the us + gb .
however the particularity of france is that the french people have been living with the myth of the " 30 glorieuses " -lrb- the best 30 economic years after ww2 -rrb- and kept to believe that it could continue for another 30 . and there is now a huge gap between the state paid employees -lrb- in the energy , and transport big dept -rrb- who enjoy work security and numerous privileges and the rest : self-employed , low payed workers from small firms , shopkeepers . who do not enjoy eany goodies and have to pay their electricity and gas and telephone bills full rate -lrb- unlike employees of edf -lrb- for electricty -rrb- or france telecom ... -rrb- i would like to know if employees from the different electricity co. in gb or us pay their electricity at reduced rate ?
sometimes you feel ! in france you are in a republic with some old fashion aristocratic / monarchist remaining that everyone moans about but not one politician dares talking about let alone question its democratic values ...
to finish france will always be a great country of contradictions where poeple love laws which loks perfect on paper but impossible to apply in real . i just hope that this time french people will refuse to be kept in the dark or above the clouds of the real economic situation -lrb- one of the highest european debt , a shrinking pension system . -rrb- and that we have to accept and adapt to this new globalisation of everything -lrb- from economy to terrorism -rrb- and think hard and suggest a real alternative ...
elisabeth , france + england i 've lived all over europe and for the last five years in paris and much as i love the city , country , culture , way of life etc .
i have to honestly say that i 've never been worse off financially .
i would probably qualify for housing benefit and several other subsidies but i 'm restricted from earning overtime .
it is a crazy situation .
if i was american i 'd vote democrat and have always considered myself centre-left but in france sarkozy is seen as extreme and if that 's the case , well i 'm extreme too. john healy , paris , france the issue of air time in the media is undermined by the way the media portait a candidate in news pieces .
for example , n sarkozy will win debates after debates but the media in france will mention his name every time there are riots for whatever reasons .
also , royal was shown as the messiah until she messed it up herself .
suddenly bayrou turns up and the media almost openly present him as the ' if you do n't want sarkozy in , vote for this no-mark ' .
basically the media -lrb- most of which has leftist ideals -rrb- do n't want sarkozy in and will do whatever they can to sink him .
shameful but so typical of the french elite -lrb- media and politics -rrb- which has put the country in this situation in the first place .
nick , london le pen 's score last time was not the fault of the minor candidates !
the first turn was won by the " leave me alone i 'm on holiday " party ; in fact the level of abstentionwas higher than the score of any candidate !
judy wood , lyon , france france desperately needs economic reform and the successful integration of immigrants into french society .
sarkozy may be able to deliver on the former but will fail miserably on the latter .
his record as interior minister is shocking in this respect and his potential election may only highten the tensions between les banlieues and the police .
royal would keep france economically uncompetitive for the duration of her presidential term and her foreign policy gaffes so far do not inspire confidence .
sarkozy will easily win the first round with royal trailing in second , but sarkozy is a polarising figure and i would not be surprised to see segolene becoming president .
ben lonsdale , manchester i am no prophet , but i forecast there will be no one from the left in the runoff .
sarkozy and le pen will eventually be the final contenders .
why ?
because french do not confess they are voting for le pen in opinion polls .
because the old far right leader has not been campaigning himself , letting his daughter marine le pen on the front line .
and she succeeded in giving a softer image of her father .
because he has criticised recent measures against smokers and speed checks and such type of demagogic speech is very popular with french .
because nothing has really changed since 21st of april 2002 but there has been the riots at the end of 2005 and the ones in gare du nord end of march 2007 and this is fuelling the protesting votes in favour of le pen .
there will be a new shock on the 22nd of april 2007 when le pen is placed in the final race .
i am no prophet , but sarkozy will be the next french president .
and what about royal in all this ?
pardon me ...
who did you say ?
antoine de champs , tours , france olivier besancenot sounds like a man who knows what he is talking about ... rightly condemning the appalling neo-liberal capitalism that has festered under both the right and the so-called left in france for far too long .
it is the unmitigated disater of the capitalist system that has created the massive unemployment and alienation , discrimination , and injustice throughout france on a vast scale.how refreshing then to hear someone putting forward a real alternative to the much hated neo-liberal capitalist nightmare of more disatrous privatisation plans for big business , which both sarkozy and royal defend .
how refreshing then to hear someone condemn the violence and discrimination of the french police .
how refreshing to hear someone defend public services and public sector workers , the right to a stable and decent job and present ideas about creating a genuine socialist alternative to capitalism .
another world is possible and another france is necessary .
segolene royal seems to be presenting the same old failed blairite right wing ideas.think again !
p.black , uk i think a new generation of politicians is now there for france , but i 'm not sure , the coming president will be accepted by the whole population .
i 'm a wee bit anxious for france 's future .
f.roux , bourges , france , you are wrong to underestimate the importance of francois bayrou and only to focus on the main both political parities : the right and the left nicolas , paris , france i 've lived in france for many years , and run a business with my husband .
yes - france has a wonderful way of life , a health system second to none , but economically , france is on its knees .
the loony left - more like an extreme version of michael foot 's socialist vision - is desperate to protect the social benefits which have been acquired over 30 years and which cripple the economy .
socialist politicians declare proudly that they do not own shares , a nasty right-wing habit of investing in industry .
madame royal claims to speak for the lowly-paid while benefiting from her salaries and perks .
in the meantime , my husband and i pay away 60 % of our earnings to support a lumbering state with its 6 million civil servants .
good luck to sarko , he 's the best of a mediocre bunch , the only one who might just bring a little egalité to france .
madeleine dickson , limoges , france an item that should be more prominent on the election agenda on both sides of politics is what should be done about the future of the world 's largest nickel deposit , new caledonia .
the country is at boiling point from a mining perspective and some leadership from france is much neeeded , after all it is her duty to do so .
sebastien carpin , brisbane , australia i agree that equal airtime for all of the candidates is a strength of the french system , but referring to the disparaging of the american electoral system as coca-cola v pepsi : in 2002 , did n't it eventually come down to le pen or chirac ?
far-right vs right ... how 's that for choice ?
khalil , boston , ma , usa i am a french citizen and have lived in the usa since the age of 8 .
i often hear many negative comments about france and europe .
i believe that these comments are born of jealousy .
while france may have its problems as everyone does i find the french approach and thought process refreshing and full of life .
i believe in the french process and have every confidence that france will prosper and the french will continue to preserve their language , culture and unique way of life in an increasing dull anglo-american world of politically correct " grey zone " .
how nice to know that there is still a country that has not sold out .
in the us , where everything including values and principles is for sale , i find it to be stale and the people in part uninterested and unmotivated beyond reaching for the next burger or bag of junk food to put a few more kilos on their already large frame , to put it nicely .
france has and will continue to be a society of free thinkers who are not afraid to voice their thoughts .
vive la france ! ! !
arthur brown , lb usa the french left needs to unite and fight for a radical redistribution of wealth and the urgent transformation of the deeply corrupt capitalist system to a socially just , participative and profoundly democratic , co-operative green socialist society based on the sustainable common ownership of the means of production .
this is an alternative as global capitalism runs amok , wreaking havoc and global climate chaos in its wake .
capitalism is doomed !
another france is possible and highly necessary .
patrick black , uk i am a sixth-form student and as i am talking about le pen in my oral exam the french elections are naturally very interesting to me .
i do n't think le pen will win -lrb- and , after extensive research the vast number of anti-semitic comments he has made over the years , i sincerely hope he wo n't win as well -rrb- but i am not convinced by either sarkozy or royal .
sarkozy seems very underhand , a man who you would imagine to be right-handed but to keep his wallet in his left-hand pocket ; royal should not be let anywhere near a microphone when it comes to foreign policy .
i do n't know much about bayrou , but i would not be appalled if he won - he appears to be the best of a bad bunch .
chris stanley , stroud , england much like american political races , advertising a politician is a political party 's biggest concern .
the bnp and ump have marketed their candidates to match the sentiment and feeling of their constituents , ms. royal feels scripted , however has an uncanny ability to improvise her responses to well thought-out questions from the press .
sarkozy swears to carry out his party 's goals but incorporates his own ideas .
however he is sheepishly stubborn towards alternative methods of carrying out policies .
i think many voters will vote based on their feelings towards each candidate and not on what policies would be best for the country .
finn raftery , seattle , united states in principle , it 's democratic to provide the same air time for all politicians who manage to get 500 mayor 's signatures in order to run for presidency .
unfortunately , the result is the exact opposite .
those who only want to rant , and have no political platform because they know that they will never be elected , feel free to lobotomize political discourse in france .
the result has been 25 years of meaningless hypocrisy .
hardly anything said has any relation to reality and as a result , very little if anything is done to address the real issues .
worse , the extremism of so many statements , along with the infamous " acquis sociaux " , on which no one will give an inch , lull people into hating work , which is , of course , " a form of oppression " of the " monstrous capitalist exploiters " .
ho hum .
and worse still , if and when sarkozy wins , the undemocratic left will not accept the result of the democratic process .
any reform will be met by attempts to totally block france by massive protest movements .
pity .
douglas mccarthy , paris , france picking up from what richard tomlinson wrote , as a british citizen living in france why will i lose my right to vote in the uk national elections when i complete my fifteenth year abroad ?
that is truly losing one 's vote , in our so-called eu of equals .
john ward , metz , france the problem in france is that french society in recent years has been turned upside down and they do not know what to do about it .
france has seen a rapid rise in immigration , unemployment and violence .
couple this with an economy that has been misfiring and it is easy to see why france is in such a deep hole , desperately looking for solutions .
it may hurt french pride , but modelling itself on great britain and taking the best of what the british have done , whilst keeping the best of french could really sort out modern france .
take immigration - why can the french not embrace multiculturalism as the british have ?
what about the economy - the british do n't seem that worried about globalisation , so why are we ? ..
the british have barely any marxists , simply because there is no place for them .
in france they offer a solution to a problem , britain has no problem -lrb- relatively -rrb- and therefore no heavy solutions need offering .
france needs to think seriously , politicians need to step back , be brave and say things that actually the french may not want to hear .
unfortunately , owing to this election , that is not going to happen , and france is not going to get any better .
frederic lacroix , paris , francais eric paul - you seem to fundamentally misunderstand american political campaigns and related us legislation .
section 315 of the us communications act details the equal time rule regulating us political campaigns .
it and subsequent amendments are very well crafted and might inform you more completely .
i do think that france 's strict equal air time rule is to be admired and is something modern democracies should strive for ; as some already do , though perhaps not in such an austere manner .
n. campbell , new orleans , usa personally i feel sorry for the french .
there is no-one worthy of the presidency today .
the choice is awful , but what must be understood is that the first round is the real choice and public opinion , the second is a knock-out to get rid of the worst candidate .
maybe they should really start thinking about voting for and not against .
be warned they are heading for thatcherism if they vote sarkozy , and we british all know what that did !
we are still paying .
i live , but sadly do n't vote , in france and have done for 15 years , this is my 3rd election .
v.miller , nancy , france the role of president urgently needs reforming -lrb- as does the whole constitution -rrb- , as no one is very sure about which role -lrb- s -rrb- he has , especially if confronted with an opposition parliament .
these elections have been the most exciting in decades , yet i do believe that none of the candidates will take the necessary stance to reform the institutions .
i also fear that due to the huge division of france into pro- and anti-sarkozy , we might very possibly end up with a cohabitation for the next five years .
the most striking aspect of this campaign is the increasing role of the media , especially television .
the majority of the french electorate will not seek information about the candidates but will expect it to come to them , mainly through television and radio -lrb- still a very popular medium , especially the morning and afternoon news -rrb- .
in such a system , the most able orators and communicators have a clear advantage .
unfortunately , these happen to be mm sarkozy and le pen .
quentin liger , london , uk well , the french system may have the advantage that we look at the candidates ' ideas and not only at how much cash they raise for their campaign .
living in the us , i came to realize that no matter what you believe in , money is the only driving force toward a warm seat at the white house .
emmanuel gilles , bronx , usa from the popularity of sarkozy , i 'd say any leanings toward marxism here are fleeing in the face of growing economic and globalization problems .
he 's a scary guy , sarko , the way he reaches for the far-right votes and disarms his critics by saying , " is it wrong to talk about national identity ?
is that a bad word ? "
because of course they ca n't say that without alienating a lot of french people !
many of my french friends here agree that the election is pitiful .
there is no one offering any real solutions to the problems threatening this country .
but it would be nice to hear more about bayrou .
he 's the most sensible by far , and the only one really trying to address the issues of immigration and discrimination .
maria alexander , aix-en-provence , france i 've had enough of this france-bashing : it is still one of the best countries to live , and i would n't even think of moving to the rainy , crowded country ruled by the nhs-dicta .
here , life is good and relaxed , the best education and health system , i pay only a little bit more than what i used to pay in the us as taxes .
the political life has not been anaesthetized like it has been in anglo-saxon countries - and we all know where that leads us : bush , born-again christians , evolution-revisionists and co .
funny that some of the french-bashing is coming from expats in france .
if it is so bad , what are you guys doing here ? : -rrb- france has a lot of problems , sure , but it is still " better " than the rest - nothing is ever perfect ..
baris tarim , caen , france one must recognise the plethora of choices available to french voters .
charles de gaulle said there are as many ideas in france as there are cheeses .
this is perfectly represented in this election with for example le pen 's far right and laguiller 's far left .
i think these extremist ideals reveal a great deal about the sense of upheaval in french society and shows how fragmented a society it is .
the unemployment , lack of economic growth , immigration are all thorny issues which are as divisive as they are polemic and the longer these particular problems last , the more it adds to le pen 's following .
as for le pen , he will always get that 10 % -15 % he consistently gets in elections because of how determined his supporters are .
his recent success though is down to a series of socio-economic problems which a series of governments , both right-wing and left-wing , have failed to solve .
cormac mac gabhann , dublin , ireland having lived in france for some time , it strikes me that its system of high job protection and generous social benefits serves only to ensure that the underprivileged few are condemned live with few prospects , a life spent literally on the margins : on the council estates bordering the big cities , dependant on the state .
no surprise that the signs of social fracture and growing dissatisfaction are plain to see .
so much for equality , freedom and brotherhood !
i do n't like sarkozy much as a person , but he seems to be the only candidate willing to undertake the drastic liberalisation that france so desperately needs .
dominic higgins , london , england eu citizens are entitled to vote in eu elections , local council and industrial tribunal elections , so richard tomlinson 's complaint is not fully accurate .
there is always the option of acquiring french nationality for the other elections .
i have done so and this is one of the reasons why .
david buick , rennes , france to mr tomlinson : as an eu citizen and permanent resident in an eu country other than your own , you are allowed to vote -lrb- and stand -rrb- in local elections : that includes city council , county council and " region " council elections .
then , just as i was not allowed to vote in the general election when i lived in the uk , you are not allowed to vote in the presidential election in france .
julien randon-furling , paris , france in my extended conversations with french citizens from all walks of life , it surprises me that most are not too far apart on issues like immigration and globalization .
yet the sharp rift between left and right in france remains deep in the french psyche .
it reaches down to a visceral level that defies logic and plays into the political strategies of career politicians .
is it possible for france to keep democracy but ditch its self-seeking party system ?
donald williams , springfield , massachusetts , usa i think it 's great that you have so many choices in france and that there is a law enforcing equal time to all .
your system makes me jealous as an american .
we are forced to choose between only two candidates who are in fact almost identical anyway .
all other parties or independents are refused any time by the media .
mark ellis , york , usa your article lacks the respect that we deserve .
you dismiss us without really looking at who we are and what we do .
the french communist party , of which i am a member , has 130,000 members and 13,000 persons that hold public offices .
your own liberal party has far fewer members .
who are you to dismiss the views of the citizens in any of these parties ?
i should remind you that many dismissed the views of democrats in the early 18th century , yet europe was transformed .
you seem to believe marxists have no place in politics today .
i , on the other hand , find your clinging to a monarchy outdated and a drain on your state 's finances .
i suppose you have the right to maintain a royal family .
i would prefer to maintain our low rate of child poverty and fight for a socialist state .
russell yates , meaux , france i am following my first election as a french resident , though not voter , and agree that the short presentations by each contender each day are very snappy and engaging .
saying something different each time holds the interest too .
the galloping music that opens each space is also attention-grabbing .
trouble is , they all sound so sincere and seem so nice !
what is important , i think , is that yes they are reading prepared material , not reacting to questions , but at least they get to finish what they have to say without being constantly interrupted .
-lrb- so many presenters take so long introducing their guest that the guest with a fascinating point to make often barely says hello before the time slot is over . -rrb-
especially in the morning , i think a straight , uninterrupted performance is more attractive than voices shouting all at once and seeing all the candidates does help sort who is who and what they stand for .
how often have you gone to vote without any idea of the face behind the name on the ballot paper ?
angela sheard , romans-sur-isère , france .
i have n't seen any evidence that a single candidate is facing up to the french budget deficit .
the whole country is living on the never-never , and that ca n't go on for ever .
andrew h , london uk the tone of the article implies that it is french democracy that is bizarre for at least attempting to ensure that all parties have an opportunity to make their platforms known .
an alternative view would be that allowing more ' popular ' parties more airtime -lrb- as in england -rrb- vastly reduces the chance of smaller parties acquiring the votes that would entitle them to greater coverage next time round .
the game is rigged from the start , and yet this is considered the norm from which the french deviate .
danny millum , london it is a very good thing that all candidates are given the same time on tv .
it means that democracy and debate are still alive and that economics and finance , and tv companies , can not impose their rule completely .
france therefore avoids to quite a large extent horrors such as the pepsi / coke us election system .
the issue is not so much about keeping marxism alive , however relevant that philosophy remains , but to avoid as much as possible that " la chose politique " becomes only a matter of experts and professional politicians , an intoxicating show in which the ordinary citizen would be only a spectator ...
thinking can only be a dynamic process when all possiblities are considered , even those which at the moment seem unreasonable .
that is why i wish that france remains as much as possible the laboratory of ideas it has been since at least the 18th century .
finance only likes ideas which like finance , which are compatible with it and i want to think freely .
as for the british system , i do n't think the british have a relation to politics which could be compared to the one the french have .
the british seem very consensual and traditional and i do n't want a two-party system for france .
eric paul , nice , france france is nothing like as poor as the uk was under wilson and callaghan .
yet talking about singing the marseillaise has some of the same desperation to find a bit of national pride as union jack underpants had in the carnaby street of the sixties .
it is odd that the country that put liberty into its national motto should have such a fear of liberalism - as if it and its multicultural cousin will come and eat them and their way of life .
but until the french realise that the rest of the world does n't owe them a living and they ca n't protect everything french by throwing protectionist money at it from higher and higher taxes , they will continue to suffer from high unemployment and the high taxes that most try to avoid paying .
there is nothing incompatible between a healthy yet well-regulated market economy and the french way of life .
but it does n't take twelve people to plant the season 's flowers on a roundabout !
ben lenthall , cahors , france another excellent analysis by mark ...
pity only that he left out francois bayrou , who tries to introduce a new political style in france .
for me it seems obvious that france has a more lively democratic culture than the uk .
compare this very open election with the passing on of power from blair to brown in the uk .
the absence of a real democratic debate in the uk is quite a shame for a country that likes to paint itself as the stalwart of democratic rule .
ronald gruenebaum , brussels , belgium unfortunately france is not the western european country where you can spot the highest level of support for the jurassic marxist ideology .
when it comes to sound representation in the two chambers of parliament this misfortune is still an italian privilege .
french marxists are a sideshow with no real power , fragmented maybe colourful.the real black spot in france is the far right - as jurassic and out of date as the marxists in italy but for france misfortune , still with some real power .
enrico ferrero , hellerup , denmark whether the french vote right or left , a man or woman , the french policy of neocolonialism and active support for unpopular puppets in africa shall continue relentlessly .
mofor tangmo edward , cameroon i think mr mardell has unknowingly or wittingly left out the factor that underlies french politics at present , fear ; unemployment , violent behaviour , poverty , institutions that no longer are able to respond to the concerns of the majority ...
paul hubball , france i am an eu citizen , am a permanent resident in france , pay my taxes here , but am not allowed to vote in the elections .
how can it be legal under eu law that we -lrb- and we are many -rrb- are excluded from the democratic process ?
richard tomlinson , mandelieu , france i am a french citizen , and , within the forseeable future , a permanent resident and taxpayer in the uk !
i cherish my right and duty to vote , and will be voting for the french president on sunday and have been frustrated at not being able to vote at important uk elections in the uk , especially when i see so many uk citizens not exercising their right to vote ! -lrb- it cost many people their lives or their freedom to ask for the right to vote , in some countries there still is no right to vote , yet , nowadays , both in the uk and in france , so many people ca n't be bothered ! ! ! -rrb-
but , i have lived here long enough now to apply for british citizenship -lrb- and am married to a british citizen -rrb- .
thankfully , now , i do not have to renounce my french nationality to do that !
-lrb- you used to be able to be only french , nothing else , or else renounce the french nationality -rrb- so , i will apply for british citizenship , it costs £ 268 , and takes up to 8 months to process , but at least i will be able to vote on uk issues and for the uk government !
richard t , perhaps you could investigate whether there is a similar possibility for you to gain these rights in france ?
helgaflower , cheltenham , uk to reply to richard tomlinson , i am a permanent resident in the uk , paying my taxes here , have been living here for 6 years now , and not allowed to vote here in the elections , because i am not a british citizen .
so england is not that much different in that case .
but i have always been a person who adored france , the culture , the country .
i have never lived there , but i am aware that burocracy makes it difficult sometimes , but with so many english people moving there , it ca n't be that bad , can it ?
they should stop complaining about it , or move back here if it 's so problematic over there .
em , manchester to richard tomlinson : under eu law an eu citizen legally resident in another member state can vote and stand in the the local and european elections , therefore you can do that in france -lrb- i 've done it in belgium -rrb- .
however , no eu member state allows non-citizens to vote in parliamentary or presidential elections , so nothing special about france there .
your anger should be directed at the british government because it is uk law which takes away your right to vote in the uk after 15 years outside of the country , something that many other european countries do not do .
it is undemocratic , but it 's got nothing to do with the eu .
rebecca , brussels to mr tomlinson , you can vote for local election in france like most of the european countries .
if you want to vote you can ask for the french citizenship thierry le romancer , paris france name your e-mail address town & country comments the bbc may edit your comments and not all emails will be published .

the diary is published every thursday .
to always see the latest edition , please click here and bookmark this page .
the man the opinion polls say will be the next president of france has been out and about in the loire valley .
nicolas sarkozy has shaken hands with people restoring a chateau , chatted with youngsters learning hairdressing and made his triumphant way out of a hall in tours packed close with supporters .
he has passionately defended his controversial record .
i love election campaigns and watching politicians in action .
but most people get their politics not in the flesh but from people like me , tv reporters .
and in france for the next couple of weeks they 'll be getting a rather odd picture .
let 's put it this way .
would it make any difference to the result of the next british general election if gordon brown and david cameron were given exactly the same air time as nick griffin of the british national party -lrb- bnp -rrb- or the candidates of the socialist workers party ?
that 's what has to happen in france .
the presidential election has two rounds , and the first vote serves to narrow a large field to a simple two-horse race for the second round .
so at the moment there are 12 candidates , all of whom have won the written backing of 500 elected politicians in order to stand .
segolene royal is battling to consolidate left-wing support here 's the rub .
by law french radio and tv have to give all the candidates the same amount of air time .
all broadcasters know the horrors of stop-watch balance .
many is the time i 've got the message " the editor says can you get the snp in ? "
" well tell him ' yes ' but i 'll need another minute . "
" he 'll give you 45 seconds . "
it may be vital for democracy , but it does n't make for elegant television .
but british law and the bbc 's own guidelines are as nothing compared to the rigour of french law .
to include a short 20-second clip of each candidate a report would be four minutes long without the reporter saying a word of introduction .
so each and every report would have to be at least five minutes long .
the upshot is that of course it does n't happen .
there are special election programmes , but the news deals in opinion polls and generalities .
left-wing rebels but this has one unexpected bonus .
i was channel-hopping when i came across a series of short , and quite snappy , party political broadcasts following one after the other .
you might think this sounds dull viewing , but it is a lot more interesting , and gives you a much better perspective , than something tagged on before or after the news .
the best watch was oliver besancenot , the trotskyite postman .
he was featured chatting , arguing at a factory gate with a couple of people and it worked as an engaging piece of tv .
madame royal was deliberately presidential .
but what came across to me was the scale of the opposition she faces , and i do n't mean mr sarkozy .
le pen stunned france by reaching the runoff in 2002 it used to be a slogan of republicans in france : " no enemies to the left ! "
this is not something segolene is likely to say .
in broadcast after broadcast , the same message was repeated : the threat of globalisation , the trampled rights of workers , the ravages of capitalism and economic liberalism .
this of course is not just the result of a strict broadcasting law .
the left is more fractured and marxism more alive in france than anywhere else in europe .
in britain , there are of course marxist groups , but most people seem to believe that capitalism is the only currently possible economic system and arguments are about redistribution and restrictions within it .
it is such an accepted belief that it feels rather odd writing it down .
but in france that is not so .
this has a very real effect on this election .
the practical effect of a vote for the communist party , the revolutionary communist league , the alternative globalisation party , workers struggle or the workers party is to take a vote away from ms royal .
i am not trying to undermine the glorious unpredictability of democracy .
of course workers struggle could leap from the 6 % it got last time to victory .
but do n't hold your breath ..
what many on the left fear is a repeat of 2002 , when the smaller parties leeched support from lionel jospin to allow far-right leader jean-marie le pen through to the second round .
of course , mr sarkozy faces a similar threat from smaller parities of the right , but his real problem is with the other two realistic contenders - le pen and francois bayrou .
campaign contrasts in the packed hall in tours , sarkozy 's passionate discourse on immigration and integration gets them stamping their feet .
i 'm sitting on the steps of a temporary stand next to a woman in her mid-twenties .
as sarkozy came to one climactic point of his argument the twenty-something woman next to me exclaimed " voila ! " - as if he was providing the clinching point that had eluded her in past arguments with friends .
throughout his speech she had been muttering " c 'est vrai , c 'est vrai " -lrb- true , true ! -rrb- .
a few seats away a smart woman , her grey hair cut elegantly short , smartly punched the air and waved a poster , almost in imitation of political activists she had seen on tv .
i did n't get the feeling it was something she did very often .
i have been to three segolene royal rallies and there is a palpable difference .
the socialist party supporters are happy to back someone who could win , who shares at least some of their values .
here it is the man himself they are backing .
outside i talk to a woman who says she lived in london for a long while .
she wants sarkozy as her president , but wants to justify her choice .
" in america i would not be a republican , " she tells me , continuing : " he and tony blair are -lrb- she pressed her palms together -rrb- are they not ? "
certainly in the hall i did n't hear a single idea that would be shockingly out of place in a labour manifesto , i did n't hear anything that could not have come from the lips of john reid or david blunkett .
on second thoughts , i 'm not sure i can imagine them singing the marseillaise .
my new friend says she remembers " when your country was poor , " adding that french socialists are like the labour party of those days .
but the labour party in those days did n't have french tv guidelines giving marxist factions valuable air time .
please use the post form below to comment on any of the issues raised in the diary .
in my part of la france profonde , my neighbours will vote for anyone who promises to get the stifling beaurocracy off their backs and let them earn a living .
unfortunately , they do n't see anyone among the candidates able or willing to do so , so their vote will be cast for one of the usual suspects - a career politician wary of upsetting any of the ' social partners ' - and only appearances will change in france after the presidential election. doris ward , argenton chateau france having lived in france for the last 2 years i really enjoy the different appraoch the french have to politics .
people are very open with their opinions and really enjoy the fight. it is a great change from the ' soundbite ' contect over the channel .
however no-one seems to really want to rock the boat and unfortunately in our global world this boat is heading for reefs .
james hodson , montgenevre , france i wish the bbc was more aware that international opinion can have an effect on national choice of politics .
a quick analysis of all the political candidates agenda -reveals that sarkozy is only interested in becoming president and nothing more -lrb- social change takes years unless it comes from a police state -rrb- and royal is the only real opposition to sarkozy .
favourite candidates are bové -lrb- sustainability -rrb- and voynet -lrb- green -rrb- although french friends holding votes agree they will vote royal to ensure the safety of their fellow citizens -lrb- citizen in the sense people who live here -rrb- .
penelope , paris those who compare jean-marie le pen 's movement to the bnp and brand him " far-right " or an " extremist " prove that they have no understanding of what is happening in france today .
le pen will get more than 20 % of the votes and will be in the second round .
do n't forget that he has consistently improved his scores in the presidential elections and ended up with 17 % last time .
also his electorate is the most loyal of all with over 80 % faithfuls .
add that mégret and the populist party have joined forces with him , that 's another good 2 % .
i vote josé bové so i believe my comments are unbiased .
gaston favresse , london as a french citizen living in sweden , i shall next sunday vote for the only leader possible.jean marie le pen .
france and the rest of europe need a wake up call .
the left and the right are the same .
the time hascomefor a massive rebellion against muslim immigration , and the dictators in bruxelles .
i rather votefor a party that says clearly what it thinks than the hypocritical lefties or rightists. c.simon , sweden i 'm a french citizen born in mauritius .
well it 's incredible to see how polls can direct people views in two directions - mrs royal and mr sarkosy .
what about the others ?
what is the the margin of error of these polls 5 % - 10 % or 0 % as they wish us to beleive ? ? ?
if so probably again we 'll see another 2002 when no poll institute gave the right predictions .
published polls which do not give their margin of error are rubish when they give a winner by a 2 % margin .
bhageerutty kishore , bourg en bresse , france we droped equal airtime rules in the states back in the 90 's and to be honest third parties have done at least as well or better since then .
nick michelewicz , keene , new hampshire , usa the socialists are the biggest threat to this country as they have an actual chance of being elected in the second round .
how ségolène can justify her ridiculous program is beyond me , case in point : increasing minimum wage to 1.500 ? a month ... how ? with good will and a rose !
as the median -lrb- not average ! -rrb- salary hovers between 1250 and 1400 i wonder how on earth she will be able to find 200 extra euros a month for the majority of french workers , it does n't make sense , she peddles populist ideals and her campaign is focused on the criticising of the right .
she has no authority , no economic sense and is the epitome of the gauche caviar .
why does it have to be so bad to earn money and make a good living , somehow it is inextricably linked to the french instilled catholic morals , that despite the laïcité of the state , continues to permeate society .
in france the less you talk about money and the poorer and more charitable you portray yourself the better you are .
henrik nordling , paris , france to those of you that likes our " same time for everyone policy " never heard or seen the people begging for or votes .
they are away from reality , because they do n't have a chance to win .
they always say the same damn speech , because they do n't have any other idea ... ideas from one century ago , ideas that were proven to be big mistakes ...
they 're not even funny .
when i was a kid , mother told me maggie was evil .
today , i think we really would need someone like her , someone that would not stop when two or three demonstrator would show up ... just to move on one day .
nick , paris , france i have lived here 4 years .
i have a multi ethnic group of friends .
they are basically afraid of sarkozy .
this is man who stands on tiptoes when he is photographed .
who wants to stop immigration , who calls poor people scum .
he is openly hunting votes from the national front .
he has immense energy when he talks , and power of conviction , and perhaps is too excitable , making some comment he might already be going crazy .
by contrast the problem is royale is so serene she is turning into a non-entity , she does n't seem to want it badly enough and she is not leading at all but telling the french a load of policies but nothing about how it will happen .
this is her big error , if she ranted about the state of the country and showed people what she willing to do to fix it she would walk this election .
she smiles and talks in droning voice almost like a ' stepford mum ' .
bayrou looks like he will win through because of fear of one and apathy for the other .
those english or other nationalites touting sarko would do well to be very attentive to what he says .
this is a man who admires bush us middle eastern policy , it is a man many fear could be the new french emperor .
europe is not his cup of tea. collie , nice as a young british person working in france i would say one of the biggest problems here is the lack of trust the older generation have in the young .
people here think it 's strange that a 21-year old should have completed university and be working full time as in britain , and the baby-boom generation just seems to be sitting on all the wealth and positions of responsibility without opening up to the young .
often all twenty-somethings can do is spend years at university or doing poorly paid " stages " -lrb- work placements -rrb- rather than being encouraged to start contributing to the economy .
henry rich , paris , france france is probably fine for all the middle-aged people living in it that benefited from lots of perks handed out when the economy was doing fine and employment was high during the 30 glorieuses .
to answer those that say france is doing fine , i will say that it is for those people !
but it certainly is not for young people who have to beg for jobs , get paid nothing , have no perks , have high real estate prices and live at home .
i am living in the us , and as a young person , i am doing very well for myself .
everyday young people leave france just like me -lrb- 300,000 just in london alone -rrb- .
france seriously needs to think to liberalize its economy , so that more jobs can be created . until then , the brain drain and the lack of investments will continue .
after all , who wants to put their money in a place where the government takes most of it .
peter , washington dc despite all the claims about " égalité , fraternité et liberté " , france is still a monarchy , but with an all-powerful president as head of state instead of a powerless king or queen -lrb- as in britain and the netherlands -rrb- .
the country is ruled accordingly and hence nothing changes .
everything in the name of " la gloire " and nothing in the name of progress .
pity .
albert , amsterdam sarkozy would like to apply for liberalism but can not even pronounce the word .
the ps : officially the hymn is still " the international " and capitalism is not an accepted system -lrb- i predict ps will split up -rrb- .
labor party is assimilated with far right .
most of young people want to become " fonctionnaire " very few chance i come back to this funny country expect of course for holidays or retirement .
didier lebon , french expat - bruxelles french people are capable of the best and the worst beleive me !
with us , you have to expect the unexpected .
that is , one week only before the first round , i have still hope / faith that the majority of the people will hear the two speeches of sarkozy and royal and realise , in all honesty , that the first one has very dangerous ideas and the second is our only hope .
but even on the best case sceanario of segolene , being elected , she better keeps her promises , otherwise some very hard time is awaiting france , let me tell you - i shoud know , i am french myself .
the task is not going to be easy .
vanina st martin , edinburgh , scotland i think those that are denigrating this relative stability in british and american politics are missing the whole point of this article .
what is being argued -lrb- and quite correctly , i may add -rrb- is in fact that british and american politics is less colourful than french politics because of this airtime regulation - but that their political systems are better off in terms of stability and effectiveness because of this .
the gentleman who brought up italian politics brings a great point .
if it 's ' colour ' you 're after , italy is even ' better ' than france .
but just as the french system finally pales relative to the anglo-saxon ones in terms of providing results to its people , does this mean that you would trade your french system for an even less effective but more colourful one in italy -lrb- or india -rrb- ?
if so , i 'm sure there are a lot of italians and indians who would jump at that offer .
h. juneja , london , uk france may be experiencing difficulty economically and with immigration , but as a nation it should be admired for doing two things : following its own path , and being open to a real political spectrum .
one thing notably lacking amongst these commments is a sense of shared history between francophones and anglophones - canada is predicted to sky rocket to over 50 million citizens by 2040 , easily rivalling france and the uk in population ... we have the great benefit of both nations ' political and social heritage and it has done us very well .
british stoicism and french joi-de-vivre make for a vigorous and lively culture , and it should not be forgotten that whether the tories win the next election in the uk or sarkozy does win in france , the essence of their cultures wo n't change and the politicians ultimately will have to be true to the average citizen 's concept of their nation .
the us aside , doomsday scenarios just are n't realistic in the modern europe .
nathan jenkins , london , canada the only advice i can give the french people is ... do n't try to emulate britain .
if i had the means , i would have moved to france 20 years ago .
alex maricic , fife , scotland what the french want is someone who is not afraid to take on the criminals who , in the last 30 years , have turned safe and pleasant french " banlieues " into territories occupied by work-shy , integrists , anti-french delinquents issued from uncontrolled immigration .
jean-luc royer , england what amazes me is that the candidates are allowed to get away with so much .
the french tv journalists are so subservient .
what is needed is for each candidate to be given a good paxman-style grilling and then a live debate amonst themselves with a strong chairman .
john ette , le pradet , france being an american studying and working in france , i find the presidential election very interesting .
i am not sure who will win but , either way politics and democracy is alive and kicking in france and i hope it will always stay that way .
i would love it if in the usa we could have more than just two choices and two parties for our presidential elections coming up next year .
my french friends are very open about their views on the canidates and we love discussing our different perspectives of each canidate and speculating on how they would change france .
i find that the journalist of this article has n't given serious thought or consideration to the way of life and history of the french people and their political system .
having lived here for almost 2 years i was a bit offended by the tone of his article and i am not even french .
i wish the best for france and hope that no matter who wins they will do the best they can for their country and its citizens .
erin , lille , france as all the real power now rests in brussels and strasbourg maybe it ? s time for eu citizens to stop paying attention , as so many have already done , to local national elections and concentrate on how they are being represented within european institutions .
where it seems democracy plays second fiddle to bureaucracy i propose that national election candidates receive zero free air time as a first step towards shifting our attention .
a change that would be simultaneously cost effective , popular and egalitarian. mike sell , founex , switzerland i am a french citizen , living in malaysia and expect to vote in the april presidential elections .
i love my country and believe most french people are very lucky to have been born french even though , like everywhere else things could be much improved .
i am also one of the apparently unprecedented large number of undecided voters .
to put it more more simply , i find it hard to decide which of the candidates is the least unpalatable .
mitterrand , de gaulle , pompidou , giscard d 'estaing had stature , a rationally thought out political programme and a coherent vision of what france should be , whether you agreed with them or not .
this lot -lrb- royal , sarkozy , bayrou , le pen et al -rrb- are a bunch of undistinguished politicians scrambling for power .
pauvre france !
i 'll still vote because i believe it is a duty -lrb- hard won over the centuries -rrb- but without any conviction .
christine sathiah , penang , malaysia i have to say i enjoy reading rich english people living in limousin / aquitaine / languedoc-roussillon complaining about the french welfare system in happy oblivion of the rest of france , which would be destroyed in the way so many northern , scottish and welsh towns were by unrestricted thatcherism in the 1980s .
certainly , france needs economic reform if it is to go forward from where it is now , but the sort of ruthless cutthroat politics that sarkozy is advocating is frightening for people in the north of france , where the collapse of industry is still felt very strongly , and where a " tough " immigration policy would create tensions that do n't need to be exacerbated .
mark brown , lens , france i think france 's " equal time " standard , while perhaps cumbersome from a tv producer 's standpoint , is far superior to the system in the us where presidential candidates are given large endowments of public money to produce 30 second tv commercials .
the result is an enormously inefficent use of public and private resources to fund essentially smear campaigns where issue-oriented discussion is practically non-existent .
however , this would probably upset the us media lobby , so do n't expect change any time soon .
mike taylor , ann arbor , michigan usa have lived in both countries and in france presently .
sorry to disappoint everyone but there is no ideal political system wheather from the states , great britain or france and i agree with the negative points concerning the us + gb .
however the particularity of france is that the french people have been living with the myth of the " 30 glorieuses " -lrb- the best 30 economic years after ww2 -rrb- and kept to believe that it could continue for another 30 . and there is now a huge gap between the state paid employees -lrb- in the energy , and transport big dept -rrb- who enjoy work security and numerous privileges and the rest : self-employed , low payed workers from small firms , shopkeepers . who do not enjoy eany goodies and have to pay their electricity and gas and telephone bills full rate -lrb- unlike employees of edf -lrb- for electricty -rrb- or france telecom ... -rrb- i would like to know if employees from the different electricity co. in gb or us pay their electricity at reduced rate ?
sometimes you feel ! in france you are in a republic with some old fashion aristocratic / monarchist remaining that everyone moans about but not one politician dares talking about let alone question its democratic values ...
to finish france will always be a great country of contradictions where poeple love laws which loks perfect on paper but impossible to apply in real . i just hope that this time french people will refuse to be kept in the dark or above the clouds of the real economic situation -lrb- one of the highest european debt , a shrinking pension system . -rrb- and that we have to accept and adapt to this new globalisation of everything -lrb- from economy to terrorism -rrb- and think hard and suggest a real alternative ...
elisabeth , france + england i 've lived all over europe and for the last five years in paris and much as i love the city , country , culture , way of life etc .
i have to honestly say that i 've never been worse off financially .
i would probably qualify for housing benefit and several other subsidies but i 'm restricted from earning overtime .
it is a crazy situation .
if i was american i 'd vote democrat and have always considered myself centre-left but in france sarkozy is seen as extreme and if that 's the case , well i 'm extreme too. john healy , paris , france the issue of air time in the media is undermined by the way the media portait a candidate in news pieces .
for example , n sarkozy will win debates after debates but the media in france will mention his name every time there are riots for whatever reasons .
also , royal was shown as the messiah until she messed it up herself .
suddenly bayrou turns up and the media almost openly present him as the ' if you do n't want sarkozy in , vote for this no-mark ' .
basically the media -lrb- most of which has leftist ideals -rrb- do n't want sarkozy in and will do whatever they can to sink him .
shameful but so typical of the french elite -lrb- media and politics -rrb- which has put the country in this situation in the first place .
nick , london le pen 's score last time was not the fault of the minor candidates !
the first turn was won by the " leave me alone i 'm on holiday " party ; in fact the level of abstentionwas higher than the score of any candidate !
judy wood , lyon , france france desperately needs economic reform and the successful integration of immigrants into french society .
sarkozy may be able to deliver on the former but will fail miserably on the latter .
his record as interior minister is shocking in this respect and his potential election may only highten the tensions between les banlieues and the police .
royal would keep france economically uncompetitive for the duration of her presidential term and her foreign policy gaffes so far do not inspire confidence .
sarkozy will easily win the first round with royal trailing in second , but sarkozy is a polarising figure and i would not be surprised to see segolene becoming president .
ben lonsdale , manchester i am no prophet , but i forecast there will be no one from the left in the runoff .
sarkozy and le pen will eventually be the final contenders .
why ?
because french do not confess they are voting for le pen in opinion polls .
because the old far right leader has not been campaigning himself , letting his daughter marine le pen on the front line .
and she succeeded in giving a softer image of her father .
because he has criticised recent measures against smokers and speed checks and such type of demagogic speech is very popular with french .
because nothing has really changed since 21st of april 2002 but there has been the riots at the end of 2005 and the ones in gare du nord end of march 2007 and this is fuelling the protesting votes in favour of le pen .
there will be a new shock on the 22nd of april 2007 when le pen is placed in the final race .
i am no prophet , but sarkozy will be the next french president .
and what about royal in all this ?
pardon me ...
who did you say ?
antoine de champs , tours , france olivier besancenot sounds like a man who knows what he is talking about ... rightly condemning the appalling neo-liberal capitalism that has festered under both the right and the so-called left in france for far too long .
it is the unmitigated disater of the capitalist system that has created the massive unemployment and alienation , discrimination , and injustice throughout france on a vast scale.how refreshing then to hear someone putting forward a real alternative to the much hated neo-liberal capitalist nightmare of more disatrous privatisation plans for big business , which both sarkozy and royal defend .
how refreshing then to hear someone condemn the violence and discrimination of the french police .
how refreshing to hear someone defend public services and public sector workers , the right to a stable and decent job and present ideas about creating a genuine socialist alternative to capitalism .
another world is possible and another france is necessary .
segolene royal seems to be presenting the same old failed blairite right wing ideas.think again !
p.black , uk i think a new generation of politicians is now there for france , but i 'm not sure , the coming president will be accepted by the whole population .
i 'm a wee bit anxious for france 's future .
f.roux , bourges , france , you are wrong to underestimate the importance of francois bayrou and only to focus on the main both political parities : the right and the left nicolas , paris , france i 've lived in france for many years , and run a business with my husband .
yes - france has a wonderful way of life , a health system second to none , but economically , france is on its knees .
the loony left - more like an extreme version of michael foot 's socialist vision - is desperate to protect the social benefits which have been acquired over 30 years and which cripple the economy .
socialist politicians declare proudly that they do not own shares , a nasty right-wing habit of investing in industry .
madame royal claims to speak for the lowly-paid while benefiting from her salaries and perks .
in the meantime , my husband and i pay away 60 % of our earnings to support a lumbering state with its 6 million civil servants .
good luck to sarko , he 's the best of a mediocre bunch , the only one who might just bring a little egalité to france .
madeleine dickson , limoges , france an item that should be more prominent on the election agenda on both sides of politics is what should be done about the future of the world 's largest nickel deposit , new caledonia .
the country is at boiling point from a mining perspective and some leadership from france is much neeeded , after all it is her duty to do so .
sebastien carpin , brisbane , australia i agree that equal airtime for all of the candidates is a strength of the french system , but referring to the disparaging of the american electoral system as coca-cola v pepsi : in 2002 , did n't it eventually come down to le pen or chirac ?
far-right vs right ... how 's that for choice ?
khalil , boston , ma , usa i am a french citizen and have lived in the usa since the age of 8 .
i often hear many negative comments about france and europe .
i believe that these comments are born of jealousy .
while france may have its problems as everyone does i find the french approach and thought process refreshing and full of life .
i believe in the french process and have every confidence that france will prosper and the french will continue to preserve their language , culture and unique way of life in an increasing dull anglo-american world of politically correct " grey zone " .
how nice to know that there is still a country that has not sold out .
in the us , where everything including values and principles is for sale , i find it to be stale and the people in part uninterested and unmotivated beyond reaching for the next burger or bag of junk food to put a few more kilos on their already large frame , to put it nicely .
france has and will continue to be a society of free thinkers who are not afraid to voice their thoughts .
vive la france ! ! !
arthur brown , lb usa the french left needs to unite and fight for a radical redistribution of wealth and the urgent transformation of the deeply corrupt capitalist system to a socially just , participative and profoundly democratic , co-operative green socialist society based on the sustainable common ownership of the means of production .
this is an alternative as global capitalism runs amok , wreaking havoc and global climate chaos in its wake .
capitalism is doomed !
another france is possible and highly necessary .
patrick black , uk i am a sixth-form student and as i am talking about le pen in my oral exam the french elections are naturally very interesting to me .
i do n't think le pen will win -lrb- and , after extensive research the vast number of anti-semitic comments he has made over the years , i sincerely hope he wo n't win as well -rrb- but i am not convinced by either sarkozy or royal .
sarkozy seems very underhand , a man who you would imagine to be right-handed but to keep his wallet in his left-hand pocket ; royal should not be let anywhere near a microphone when it comes to foreign policy .
i do n't know much about bayrou , but i would not be appalled if he won - he appears to be the best of a bad bunch .
chris stanley , stroud , england much like american political races , advertising a politician is a political party 's biggest concern .
the bnp and ump have marketed their candidates to match the sentiment and feeling of their constituents , ms. royal feels scripted , however has an uncanny ability to improvise her responses to well thought-out questions from the press .
sarkozy swears to carry out his party 's goals but incorporates his own ideas .
however he is sheepishly stubborn towards alternative methods of carrying out policies .
i think many voters will vote based on their feelings towards each candidate and not on what policies would be best for the country .
finn raftery , seattle , united states in principle , it 's democratic to provide the same air time for all politicians who manage to get 500 mayor 's signatures in order to run for presidency .
unfortunately , the result is the exact opposite .
those who only want to rant , and have no political platform because they know that they will never be elected , feel free to lobotomize political discourse in france .
the result has been 25 years of meaningless hypocrisy .
hardly anything said has any relation to reality and as a result , very little if anything is done to address the real issues .
worse , the extremism of so many statements , along with the infamous " acquis sociaux " , on which no one will give an inch , lull people into hating work , which is , of course , " a form of oppression " of the " monstrous capitalist exploiters " .
ho hum .
and worse still , if and when sarkozy wins , the undemocratic left will not accept the result of the democratic process .
any reform will be met by attempts to totally block france by massive protest movements .
pity .
douglas mccarthy , paris , france picking up from what richard tomlinson wrote , as a british citizen living in france why will i lose my right to vote in the uk national elections when i complete my fifteenth year abroad ?
that is truly losing one 's vote , in our so-called eu of equals .
john ward , metz , france the problem in france is that french society in recent years has been turned upside down and they do not know what to do about it .
france has seen a rapid rise in immigration , unemployment and violence .
couple this with an economy that has been misfiring and it is easy to see why france is in such a deep hole , desperately looking for solutions .
it may hurt french pride , but modelling itself on great britain and taking the best of what the british have done , whilst keeping the best of french could really sort out modern france .
take immigration - why can the french not embrace multiculturalism as the british have ?
what about the economy - the british do n't seem that worried about globalisation , so why are we ? ..
the british have barely any marxists , simply because there is no place for them .
in france they offer a solution to a problem , britain has no problem -lrb- relatively -rrb- and therefore no heavy solutions need offering .
france needs to think seriously , politicians need to step back , be brave and say things that actually the french may not want to hear .
unfortunately , owing to this election , that is not going to happen , and france is not going to get any better .
frederic lacroix , paris , francais eric paul - you seem to fundamentally misunderstand american political campaigns and related us legislation .
section 315 of the us communications act details the equal time rule regulating us political campaigns .
it and subsequent amendments are very well crafted and might inform you more completely .
i do think that france 's strict equal air time rule is to be admired and is something modern democracies should strive for ; as some already do , though perhaps not in such an austere manner .
n. campbell , new orleans , usa personally i feel sorry for the french .
there is no-one worthy of the presidency today .
the choice is awful , but what must be understood is that the first round is the real choice and public opinion , the second is a knock-out to get rid of the worst candidate .
maybe they should really start thinking about voting for and not against .
be warned they are heading for thatcherism if they vote sarkozy , and we british all know what that did !
we are still paying .
i live , but sadly do n't vote , in france and have done for 15 years , this is my 3rd election .
v.miller , nancy , france the role of president urgently needs reforming -lrb- as does the whole constitution -rrb- , as no one is very sure about which role -lrb- s -rrb- he has , especially if confronted with an opposition parliament .
these elections have been the most exciting in decades , yet i do believe that none of the candidates will take the necessary stance to reform the institutions .
i also fear that due to the huge division of france into pro- and anti-sarkozy , we might very possibly end up with a cohabitation for the next five years .
the most striking aspect of this campaign is the increasing role of the media , especially television .
the majority of the french electorate will not seek information about the candidates but will expect it to come to them , mainly through television and radio -lrb- still a very popular medium , especially the morning and afternoon news -rrb- .
in such a system , the most able orators and communicators have a clear advantage .
unfortunately , these happen to be mm sarkozy and le pen .
quentin liger , london , uk well , the french system may have the advantage that we look at the candidates ' ideas and not only at how much cash they raise for their campaign .
living in the us , i came to realize that no matter what you believe in , money is the only driving force toward a warm seat at the white house .
emmanuel gilles , bronx , usa from the popularity of sarkozy , i 'd say any leanings toward marxism here are fleeing in the face of growing economic and globalization problems .
he 's a scary guy , sarko , the way he reaches for the far-right votes and disarms his critics by saying , " is it wrong to talk about national identity ?
is that a bad word ? "
because of course they ca n't say that without alienating a lot of french people !
many of my french friends here agree that the election is pitiful .
there is no one offering any real solutions to the problems threatening this country .
but it would be nice to hear more about bayrou .
he 's the most sensible by far , and the only one really trying to address the issues of immigration and discrimination .
maria alexander , aix-en-provence , france i 've had enough of this france-bashing : it is still one of the best countries to live , and i would n't even think of moving to the rainy , crowded country ruled by the nhs-dicta .
here , life is good and relaxed , the best education and health system , i pay only a little bit more than what i used to pay in the us as taxes .
the political life has not been anaesthetized like it has been in anglo-saxon countries - and we all know where that leads us : bush , born-again christians , evolution-revisionists and co .
funny that some of the french-bashing is coming from expats in france .
if it is so bad , what are you guys doing here ? : -rrb- france has a lot of problems , sure , but it is still " better " than the rest - nothing is ever perfect ..
baris tarim , caen , france one must recognise the plethora of choices available to french voters .
charles de gaulle said there are as many ideas in france as there are cheeses .
this is perfectly represented in this election with for example le pen 's far right and laguiller 's far left .
i think these extremist ideals reveal a great deal about the sense of upheaval in french society and shows how fragmented a society it is .
the unemployment , lack of economic growth , immigration are all thorny issues which are as divisive as they are polemic and the longer these particular problems last , the more it adds to le pen 's following .
as for le pen , he will always get that 10 % -15 % he consistently gets in elections because of how determined his supporters are .
his recent success though is down to a series of socio-economic problems which a series of governments , both right-wing and left-wing , have failed to solve .
cormac mac gabhann , dublin , ireland having lived in france for some time , it strikes me that its system of high job protection and generous social benefits serves only to ensure that the underprivileged few are condemned live with few prospects , a life spent literally on the margins : on the council estates bordering the big cities , dependant on the state .
no surprise that the signs of social fracture and growing dissatisfaction are plain to see .
so much for equality , freedom and brotherhood !
i do n't like sarkozy much as a person , but he seems to be the only candidate willing to undertake the drastic liberalisation that france so desperately needs .
dominic higgins , london , england eu citizens are entitled to vote in eu elections , local council and industrial tribunal elections , so richard tomlinson 's complaint is not fully accurate .
there is always the option of acquiring french nationality for the other elections .
i have done so and this is one of the reasons why .
david buick , rennes , france to mr tomlinson : as an eu citizen and permanent resident in an eu country other than your own , you are allowed to vote -lrb- and stand -rrb- in local elections : that includes city council , county council and " region " council elections .
then , just as i was not allowed to vote in the general election when i lived in the uk , you are not allowed to vote in the presidential election in france .
julien randon-furling , paris , france in my extended conversations with french citizens from all walks of life , it surprises me that most are not too far apart on issues like immigration and globalization .
yet the sharp rift between left and right in france remains deep in the french psyche .
it reaches down to a visceral level that defies logic and plays into the political strategies of career politicians .
is it possible for france to keep democracy but ditch its self-seeking party system ?
donald williams , springfield , massachusetts , usa i think it 's great that you have so many choices in france and that there is a law enforcing equal time to all .
your system makes me jealous as an american .
we are forced to choose between only two candidates who are in fact almost identical anyway .
all other parties or independents are refused any time by the media .
mark ellis , york , usa your article lacks the respect that we deserve .
you dismiss us without really looking at who we are and what we do .
the french communist party , of which i am a member , has 130,000 members and 13,000 persons that hold public offices .
your own liberal party has far fewer members .
who are you to dismiss the views of the citizens in any of these parties ?
i should remind you that many dismissed the views of democrats in the early 18th century , yet europe was transformed .
you seem to believe marxists have no place in politics today .
i , on the other hand , find your clinging to a monarchy outdated and a drain on your state 's finances .
i suppose you have the right to maintain a royal family .
i would prefer to maintain our low rate of child poverty and fight for a socialist state .
russell yates , meaux , france i am following my first election as a french resident , though not voter , and agree that the short presentations by each contender each day are very snappy and engaging .
saying something different each time holds the interest too .
the galloping music that opens each space is also attention-grabbing .
trouble is , they all sound so sincere and seem so nice !
what is important , i think , is that yes they are reading prepared material , not reacting to questions , but at least they get to finish what they have to say without being constantly interrupted .
-lrb- so many presenters take so long introducing their guest that the guest with a fascinating point to make often barely says hello before the time slot is over . -rrb-
especially in the morning , i think a straight , uninterrupted performance is more attractive than voices shouting all at once and seeing all the candidates does help sort who is who and what they stand for .
how often have you gone to vote without any idea of the face behind the name on the ballot paper ?
angela sheard , romans-sur-isère , france .
i have n't seen any evidence that a single candidate is facing up to the french budget deficit .
the whole country is living on the never-never , and that ca n't go on for ever .
andrew h , london uk the tone of the article implies that it is french democracy that is bizarre for at least attempting to ensure that all parties have an opportunity to make their platforms known .
an alternative view would be that allowing more ' popular ' parties more airtime -lrb- as in england -rrb- vastly reduces the chance of smaller parties acquiring the votes that would entitle them to greater coverage next time round .
the game is rigged from the start , and yet this is considered the norm from which the french deviate .
danny millum , london it is a very good thing that all candidates are given the same time on tv .
it means that democracy and debate are still alive and that economics and finance , and tv companies , can not impose their rule completely .
france therefore avoids to quite a large extent horrors such as the pepsi / coke us election system .
the issue is not so much about keeping marxism alive , however relevant that philosophy remains , but to avoid as much as possible that " la chose politique " becomes only a matter of experts and professional politicians , an intoxicating show in which the ordinary citizen would be only a spectator ...
thinking can only be a dynamic process when all possiblities are considered , even those which at the moment seem unreasonable .
that is why i wish that france remains as much as possible the laboratory of ideas it has been since at least the 18th century .
finance only likes ideas which like finance , which are compatible with it and i want to think freely .
as for the british system , i do n't think the british have a relation to politics which could be compared to the one the french have .
the british seem very consensual and traditional and i do n't want a two-party system for france .
eric paul , nice , france france is nothing like as poor as the uk was under wilson and callaghan .
yet talking about singing the marseillaise has some of the same desperation to find a bit of national pride as union jack underpants had in the carnaby street of the sixties .
it is odd that the country that put liberty into its national motto should have such a fear of liberalism - as if it and its multicultural cousin will come and eat them and their way of life .
but until the french realise that the rest of the world does n't owe them a living and they ca n't protect everything french by throwing protectionist money at it from higher and higher taxes , they will continue to suffer from high unemployment and the high taxes that most try to avoid paying .
there is nothing incompatible between a healthy yet well-regulated market economy and the french way of life .
but it does n't take twelve people to plant the season 's flowers on a roundabout !
ben lenthall , cahors , france another excellent analysis by mark ...
pity only that he left out francois bayrou , who tries to introduce a new political style in france .
for me it seems obvious that france has a more lively democratic culture than the uk .
compare this very open election with the passing on of power from blair to brown in the uk .
the absence of a real democratic debate in the uk is quite a shame for a country that likes to paint itself as the stalwart of democratic rule .
ronald gruenebaum , brussels , belgium unfortunately france is not the western european country where you can spot the highest level of support for the jurassic marxist ideology .
when it comes to sound representation in the two chambers of parliament this misfortune is still an italian privilege .
french marxists are a sideshow with no real power , fragmented maybe colourful.the real black spot in france is the far right - as jurassic and out of date as the marxists in italy but for france misfortune , still with some real power .
enrico ferrero , hellerup , denmark whether the french vote right or left , a man or woman , the french policy of neocolonialism and active support for unpopular puppets in africa shall continue relentlessly .
mofor tangmo edward , cameroon i think mr mardell has unknowingly or wittingly left out the factor that underlies french politics at present , fear ; unemployment , violent behaviour , poverty , institutions that no longer are able to respond to the concerns of the majority ...
paul hubball , france i am an eu citizen , am a permanent resident in france , pay my taxes here , but am not allowed to vote in the elections .
how can it be legal under eu law that we -lrb- and we are many -rrb- are excluded from the democratic process ?
richard tomlinson , mandelieu , france i am a french citizen , and , within the forseeable future , a permanent resident and taxpayer in the uk !
i cherish my right and duty to vote , and will be voting for the french president on sunday and have been frustrated at not being able to vote at important uk elections in the uk , especially when i see so many uk citizens not exercising their right to vote ! -lrb- it cost many people their lives or their freedom to ask for the right to vote , in some countries there still is no right to vote , yet , nowadays , both in the uk and in france , so many people ca n't be bothered ! ! ! -rrb-
but , i have lived here long enough now to apply for british citizenship -lrb- and am married to a british citizen -rrb- .
thankfully , now , i do not have to renounce my french nationality to do that !
-lrb- you used to be able to be only french , nothing else , or else renounce the french nationality -rrb- so , i will apply for british citizenship , it costs £ 268 , and takes up to 8 months to process , but at least i will be able to vote on uk issues and for the uk government !
richard t , perhaps you could investigate whether there is a similar possibility for you to gain these rights in france ?
helgaflower , cheltenham , uk to reply to richard tomlinson , i am a permanent resident in the uk , paying my taxes here , have been living here for 6 years now , and not allowed to vote here in the elections , because i am not a british citizen .
so england is not that much different in that case .
but i have always been a person who adored france , the culture , the country .
i have never lived there , but i am aware that burocracy makes it difficult sometimes , but with so many english people moving there , it ca n't be that bad , can it ?
they should stop complaining about it , or move back here if it 's so problematic over there .
em , manchester to richard tomlinson : under eu law an eu citizen legally resident in another member state can vote and stand in the the local and european elections , therefore you can do that in france -lrb- i 've done it in belgium -rrb- .
however , no eu member state allows non-citizens to vote in parliamentary or presidential elections , so nothing special about france there .
your anger should be directed at the british government because it is uk law which takes away your right to vote in the uk after 15 years outside of the country , something that many other european countries do not do .
it is undemocratic , but it 's got nothing to do with the eu .
rebecca , brussels to mr tomlinson , you can vote for local election in france like most of the european countries .
if you want to vote you can ask for the french citizenship thierry le romancer , paris france name your e-mail address town & country comments the bbc may edit your comments and not all emails will be published .

the diary is published every thursday .
to always see the latest edition , please click here and bookmark this page .
the man the opinion polls say will be the next president of france has been out and about in the loire valley .
nicolas sarkozy has shaken hands with people restoring a chateau , chatted with youngsters learning hairdressing and made his triumphant way out of a hall in tours packed close with supporters .
he has passionately defended his controversial record .
i love election campaigns and watching politicians in action .
but most people get their politics not in the flesh but from people like me , tv reporters .
and in france for the next couple of weeks they 'll be getting a rather odd picture .
let 's put it this way .
would it make any difference to the result of the next british general election if gordon brown and david cameron were given exactly the same air time as nick griffin of the british national party -lrb- bnp -rrb- or the candidates of the socialist workers party ?
that 's what has to happen in france .
the presidential election has two rounds , and the first vote serves to narrow a large field to a simple two-horse race for the second round .
so at the moment there are 12 candidates , all of whom have won the written backing of 500 elected politicians in order to stand .
segolene royal is battling to consolidate left-wing support here 's the rub .
by law french radio and tv have to give all the candidates the same amount of air time .
all broadcasters know the horrors of stop-watch balance .
many is the time i 've got the message " the editor says can you get the snp in ? "
" well tell him ' yes ' but i 'll need another minute . "
" he 'll give you 45 seconds . "
it may be vital for democracy , but it does n't make for elegant television .
but british law and the bbc 's own guidelines are as nothing compared to the rigour of french law .
to include a short 20-second clip of each candidate a report would be four minutes long without the reporter saying a word of introduction .
so each and every report would have to be at least five minutes long .
the upshot is that of course it does n't happen .
there are special election programmes , but the news deals in opinion polls and generalities .
left-wing rebels but this has one unexpected bonus .
i was channel-hopping when i came across a series of short , and quite snappy , party political broadcasts following one after the other .
you might think this sounds dull viewing , but it is a lot more interesting , and gives you a much better perspective , than something tagged on before or after the news .
the best watch was oliver besancenot , the trotskyite postman .
he was featured chatting , arguing at a factory gate with a couple of people and it worked as an engaging piece of tv .
madame royal was deliberately presidential .
but what came across to me was the scale of the opposition she faces , and i do n't mean mr sarkozy .
le pen stunned france by reaching the runoff in 2002 it used to be a slogan of republicans in france : " no enemies to the left ! "
this is not something segolene is likely to say .
in broadcast after broadcast , the same message was repeated : the threat of globalisation , the trampled rights of workers , the ravages of capitalism and economic liberalism .
this of course is not just the result of a strict broadcasting law .
the left is more fractured and marxism more alive in france than anywhere else in europe .
in britain , there are of course marxist groups , but most people seem to believe that capitalism is the only currently possible economic system and arguments are about redistribution and restrictions within it .
it is such an accepted belief that it feels rather odd writing it down .
but in france that is not so .
this has a very real effect on this election .
the practical effect of a vote for the communist party , the revolutionary communist league , the alternative globalisation party , workers struggle or the workers party is to take a vote away from ms royal .
i am not trying to undermine the glorious unpredictability of democracy .
of course workers struggle could leap from the 6 % it got last time to victory .
but do n't hold your breath ..
what many on the left fear is a repeat of 2002 , when the smaller parties leeched support from lionel jospin to allow far-right leader jean-marie le pen through to the second round .
of course , mr sarkozy faces a similar threat from smaller parities of the right , but his real problem is with the other two realistic contenders - le pen and francois bayrou .
campaign contrasts in the packed hall in tours , sarkozy 's passionate discourse on immigration and integration gets them stamping their feet .
i 'm sitting on the steps of a temporary stand next to a woman in her mid-twenties .
as sarkozy came to one climactic point of his argument the twenty-something woman next to me exclaimed " voila ! " - as if he was providing the clinching point that had eluded her in past arguments with friends .
throughout his speech she had been muttering " c 'est vrai , c 'est vrai " -lrb- true , true ! -rrb- .
a few seats away a smart woman , her grey hair cut elegantly short , smartly punched the air and waved a poster , almost in imitation of political activists she had seen on tv .
i did n't get the feeling it was something she did very often .
i have been to three segolene royal rallies and there is a palpable difference .
the socialist party supporters are happy to back someone who could win , who shares at least some of their values .
here it is the man himself they are backing .
outside i talk to a woman who says she lived in london for a long while .
she wants sarkozy as her president , but wants to justify her choice .
" in america i would not be a republican , " she tells me , continuing : " he and tony blair are -lrb- she pressed her palms together -rrb- are they not ? "
certainly in the hall i did n't hear a single idea that would be shockingly out of place in a labour manifesto , i did n't hear anything that could not have come from the lips of john reid or david blunkett .
on second thoughts , i 'm not sure i can imagine them singing the marseillaise .
my new friend says she remembers " when your country was poor , " adding that french socialists are like the labour party of those days .
but the labour party in those days did n't have french tv guidelines giving marxist factions valuable air time .
please use the post form below to comment on any of the issues raised in the diary .
in my part of la france profonde , my neighbours will vote for anyone who promises to get the stifling beaurocracy off their backs and let them earn a living .
unfortunately , they do n't see anyone among the candidates able or willing to do so , so their vote will be cast for one of the usual suspects - a career politician wary of upsetting any of the ' social partners ' - and only appearances will change in france after the presidential election. doris ward , argenton chateau france having lived in france for the last 2 years i really enjoy the different appraoch the french have to politics .
people are very open with their opinions and really enjoy the fight. it is a great change from the ' soundbite ' contect over the channel .
however no-one seems to really want to rock the boat and unfortunately in our global world this boat is heading for reefs .
james hodson , montgenevre , france i wish the bbc was more aware that international opinion can have an effect on national choice of politics .
a quick analysis of all the political candidates agenda -reveals that sarkozy is only interested in becoming president and nothing more -lrb- social change takes years unless it comes from a police state -rrb- and royal is the only real opposition to sarkozy .
favourite candidates are bové -lrb- sustainability -rrb- and voynet -lrb- green -rrb- although french friends holding votes agree they will vote royal to ensure the safety of their fellow citizens -lrb- citizen in the sense people who live here -rrb- .
penelope , paris those who compare jean-marie le pen 's movement to the bnp and brand him " far-right " or an " extremist " prove that they have no understanding of what is happening in france today .
le pen will get more than 20 % of the votes and will be in the second round .
do n't forget that he has consistently improved his scores in the presidential elections and ended up with 17 % last time .
also his electorate is the most loyal of all with over 80 % faithfuls .
add that mégret and the populist party have joined forces with him , that 's another good 2 % .
i vote josé bové so i believe my comments are unbiased .
gaston favresse , london as a french citizen living in sweden , i shall next sunday vote for the only leader possible.jean marie le pen .
france and the rest of europe need a wake up call .
the left and the right are the same .
the time hascomefor a massive rebellion against muslim immigration , and the dictators in bruxelles .
i rather votefor a party that says clearly what it thinks than the hypocritical lefties or rightists. c.simon , sweden i 'm a french citizen born in mauritius .
well it 's incredible to see how polls can direct people views in two directions - mrs royal and mr sarkosy .
what about the others ?
what is the the margin of error of these polls 5 % - 10 % or 0 % as they wish us to beleive ? ? ?
if so probably again we 'll see another 2002 when no poll institute gave the right predictions .
published polls which do not give their margin of error are rubish when they give a winner by a 2 % margin .
bhageerutty kishore , bourg en bresse , france we droped equal airtime rules in the states back in the 90 's and to be honest third parties have done at least as well or better since then .
nick michelewicz , keene , new hampshire , usa the socialists are the biggest threat to this country as they have an actual chance of being elected in the second round .
how ségolène can justify her ridiculous program is beyond me , case in point : increasing minimum wage to 1.500 ? a month ... how ? with good will and a rose !
as the median -lrb- not average ! -rrb- salary hovers between 1250 and 1400 i wonder how on earth she will be able to find 200 extra euros a month for the majority of french workers , it does n't make sense , she peddles populist ideals and her campaign is focused on the criticising of the right .
she has no authority , no economic sense and is the epitome of the gauche caviar .
why does it have to be so bad to earn money and make a good living , somehow it is inextricably linked to the french instilled catholic morals , that despite the laïcité of the state , continues to permeate society .
in france the less you talk about money and the poorer and more charitable you portray yourself the better you are .
henrik nordling , paris , france to those of you that likes our " same time for everyone policy " never heard or seen the people begging for or votes .
they are away from reality , because they do n't have a chance to win .
they always say the same damn speech , because they do n't have any other idea ... ideas from one century ago , ideas that were proven to be big mistakes ...
they 're not even funny .
when i was a kid , mother told me maggie was evil .
today , i think we really would need someone like her , someone that would not stop when two or three demonstrator would show up ... just to move on one day .
nick , paris , france i have lived here 4 years .
i have a multi ethnic group of friends .
they are basically afraid of sarkozy .
this is man who stands on tiptoes when he is photographed .
who wants to stop immigration , who calls poor people scum .
he is openly hunting votes from the national front .
he has immense energy when he talks , and power of conviction , and perhaps is too excitable , making some comment he might already be going crazy .
by contrast the problem is royale is so serene she is turning into a non-entity , she does n't seem to want it badly enough and she is not leading at all but telling the french a load of policies but nothing about how it will happen .
this is her big error , if she ranted about the state of the country and showed people what she willing to do to fix it she would walk this election .
she smiles and talks in droning voice almost like a ' stepford mum ' .
bayrou looks like he will win through because of fear of one and apathy for the other .
those english or other nationalites touting sarko would do well to be very attentive to what he says .
this is a man who admires bush us middle eastern policy , it is a man many fear could be the new french emperor .
europe is not his cup of tea. collie , nice as a young british person working in france i would say one of the biggest problems here is the lack of trust the older generation have in the young .
people here think it 's strange that a 21-year old should have completed university and be working full time as in britain , and the baby-boom generation just seems to be sitting on all the wealth and positions of responsibility without opening up to the young .
often all twenty-somethings can do is spend years at university or doing poorly paid " stages " -lrb- work placements -rrb- rather than being encouraged to start contributing to the economy .
henry rich , paris , france france is probably fine for all the middle-aged people living in it that benefited from lots of perks handed out when the economy was doing fine and employment was high during the 30 glorieuses .
to answer those that say france is doing fine , i will say that it is for those people !
but it certainly is not for young people who have to beg for jobs , get paid nothing , have no perks , have high real estate prices and live at home .
i am living in the us , and as a young person , i am doing very well for myself .
everyday young people leave france just like me -lrb- 300,000 just in london alone -rrb- .
france seriously needs to think to liberalize its economy , so that more jobs can be created . until then , the brain drain and the lack of investments will continue .
after all , who wants to put their money in a place where the government takes most of it .
peter , washington dc despite all the claims about " égalité , fraternité et liberté " , france is still a monarchy , but with an all-powerful president as head of state instead of a powerless king or queen -lrb- as in britain and the netherlands -rrb- .
the country is ruled accordingly and hence nothing changes .
everything in the name of " la gloire " and nothing in the name of progress .
pity .
albert , amsterdam sarkozy would like to apply for liberalism but can not even pronounce the word .
the ps : officially the hymn is still " the international " and capitalism is not an accepted system -lrb- i predict ps will split up -rrb- .
labor party is assimilated with far right .
most of young people want to become " fonctionnaire " very few chance i come back to this funny country expect of course for holidays or retirement .
didier lebon , french expat - bruxelles french people are capable of the best and the worst beleive me !
with us , you have to expect the unexpected .
that is , one week only before the first round , i have still hope / faith that the majority of the people will hear the two speeches of sarkozy and royal and realise , in all honesty , that the first one has very dangerous ideas and the second is our only hope .
but even on the best case sceanario of segolene , being elected , she better keeps her promises , otherwise some very hard time is awaiting france , let me tell you - i shoud know , i am french myself .
the task is not going to be easy .
vanina st martin , edinburgh , scotland i think those that are denigrating this relative stability in british and american politics are missing the whole point of this article .
what is being argued -lrb- and quite correctly , i may add -rrb- is in fact that british and american politics is less colourful than french politics because of this airtime regulation - but that their political systems are better off in terms of stability and effectiveness because of this .
the gentleman who brought up italian politics brings a great point .
if it 's ' colour ' you 're after , italy is even ' better ' than france .
but just as the french system finally pales relative to the anglo-saxon ones in terms of providing results to its people , does this mean that you would trade your french system for an even less effective but more colourful one in italy -lrb- or india -rrb- ?
if so , i 'm sure there are a lot of italians and indians who would jump at that offer .
h. juneja , london , uk france may be experiencing difficulty economically and with immigration , but as a nation it should be admired for doing two things : following its own path , and being open to a real political spectrum .
one thing notably lacking amongst these commments is a sense of shared history between francophones and anglophones - canada is predicted to sky rocket to over 50 million citizens by 2040 , easily rivalling france and the uk in population ... we have the great benefit of both nations ' political and social heritage and it has done us very well .
british stoicism and french joi-de-vivre make for a vigorous and lively culture , and it should not be forgotten that whether the tories win the next election in the uk or sarkozy does win in france , the essence of their cultures wo n't change and the politicians ultimately will have to be true to the average citizen 's concept of their nation .
the us aside , doomsday scenarios just are n't realistic in the modern europe .
nathan jenkins , london , canada the only advice i can give the french people is ... do n't try to emulate britain .
if i had the means , i would have moved to france 20 years ago .
alex maricic , fife , scotland what the french want is someone who is not afraid to take on the criminals who , in the last 30 years , have turned safe and pleasant french " banlieues " into territories occupied by work-shy , integrists , anti-french delinquents issued from uncontrolled immigration .
jean-luc royer , england what amazes me is that the candidates are allowed to get away with so much .
the french tv journalists are so subservient .
what is needed is for each candidate to be given a good paxman-style grilling and then a live debate amonst themselves with a strong chairman .
john ette , le pradet , france being an american studying and working in france , i find the presidential election very interesting .
i am not sure who will win but , either way politics and democracy is alive and kicking in france and i hope it will always stay that way .
i would love it if in the usa we could have more than just two choices and two parties for our presidential elections coming up next year .
my french friends are very open about their views on the canidates and we love discussing our different perspectives of each canidate and speculating on how they would change france .
i find that the journalist of this article has n't given serious thought or consideration to the way of life and history of the french people and their political system .
having lived here for almost 2 years i was a bit offended by the tone of his article and i am not even french .
i wish the best for france and hope that no matter who wins they will do the best they can for their country and its citizens .
erin , lille , france as all the real power now rests in brussels and strasbourg maybe it ? s time for eu citizens to stop paying attention , as so many have already done , to local national elections and concentrate on how they are being represented within european institutions .
where it seems democracy plays second fiddle to bureaucracy i propose that national election candidates receive zero free air time as a first step towards shifting our attention .
a change that would be simultaneously cost effective , popular and egalitarian. mike sell , founex , switzerland i am a french citizen , living in malaysia and expect to vote in the april presidential elections .
i love my country and believe most french people are very lucky to have been born french even though , like everywhere else things could be much improved .
i am also one of the apparently unprecedented large number of undecided voters .
to put it more more simply , i find it hard to decide which of the candidates is the least unpalatable .
mitterrand , de gaulle , pompidou , giscard d 'estaing had stature , a rationally thought out political programme and a coherent vision of what france should be , whether you agreed with them or not .
this lot -lrb- royal , sarkozy , bayrou , le pen et al -rrb- are a bunch of undistinguished politicians scrambling for power .
pauvre france !
i 'll still vote because i believe it is a duty -lrb- hard won over the centuries -rrb- but without any conviction .
christine sathiah , penang , malaysia i have to say i enjoy reading rich english people living in limousin / aquitaine / languedoc-roussillon complaining about the french welfare system in happy oblivion of the rest of france , which would be destroyed in the way so many northern , scottish and welsh towns were by unrestricted thatcherism in the 1980s .
certainly , france needs economic reform if it is to go forward from where it is now , but the sort of ruthless cutthroat politics that sarkozy is advocating is frightening for people in the north of france , where the collapse of industry is still felt very strongly , and where a " tough " immigration policy would create tensions that do n't need to be exacerbated .
mark brown , lens , france i think france 's " equal time " standard , while perhaps cumbersome from a tv producer 's standpoint , is far superior to the system in the us where presidential candidates are given large endowments of public money to produce 30 second tv commercials .
the result is an enormously inefficent use of public and private resources to fund essentially smear campaigns where issue-oriented discussion is practically non-existent .
however , this would probably upset the us media lobby , so do n't expect change any time soon .
mike taylor , ann arbor , michigan usa have lived in both countries and in france presently .
sorry to disappoint everyone but there is no ideal political system wheather from the states , great britain or france and i agree with the negative points concerning the us + gb .
however the particularity of france is that the french people have been living with the myth of the " 30 glorieuses " -lrb- the best 30 economic years after ww2 -rrb- and kept to believe that it could continue for another 30 . and there is now a huge gap between the state paid employees -lrb- in the energy , and transport big dept -rrb- who enjoy work security and numerous privileges and the rest : self-employed , low payed workers from small firms , shopkeepers . who do not enjoy eany goodies and have to pay their electricity and gas and telephone bills full rate -lrb- unlike employees of edf -lrb- for electricty -rrb- or france telecom ... -rrb- i would like to know if employees from the different electricity co. in gb or us pay their electricity at reduced rate ?
sometimes you feel ! in france you are in a republic with some old fashion aristocratic / monarchist remaining that everyone moans about but not one politician dares talking about let alone question its democratic values ...
to finish france will always be a great country of contradictions where poeple love laws which loks perfect on paper but impossible to apply in real . i just hope that this time french people will refuse to be kept in the dark or above the clouds of the real economic situation -lrb- one of the highest european debt , a shrinking pension system . -rrb- and that we have to accept and adapt to this new globalisation of everything -lrb- from economy to terrorism -rrb- and think hard and suggest a real alternative ...
elisabeth , france + england i 've lived all over europe and for the last five years in paris and much as i love the city , country , culture , way of life etc .
i have to honestly say that i 've never been worse off financially .
i would probably qualify for housing benefit and several other subsidies but i 'm restricted from earning overtime .
it is a crazy situation .
if i was american i 'd vote democrat and have always considered myself centre-left but in france sarkozy is seen as extreme and if that 's the case , well i 'm extreme too. john healy , paris , france the issue of air time in the media is undermined by the way the media portait a candidate in news pieces .
for example , n sarkozy will win debates after debates but the media in france will mention his name every time there are riots for whatever reasons .
also , royal was shown as the messiah until she messed it up herself .
suddenly bayrou turns up and the media almost openly present him as the ' if you do n't want sarkozy in , vote for this no-mark ' .
basically the media -lrb- most of which has leftist ideals -rrb- do n't want sarkozy in and will do whatever they can to sink him .
shameful but so typical of the french elite -lrb- media and politics -rrb- which has put the country in this situation in the first place .
nick , london le pen 's score last time was not the fault of the minor candidates !
the first turn was won by the " leave me alone i 'm on holiday " party ; in fact the level of abstentionwas higher than the score of any candidate !
judy wood , lyon , france france desperately needs economic reform and the successful integration of immigrants into french society .
sarkozy may be able to deliver on the former but will fail miserably on the latter .
his record as interior minister is shocking in this respect and his potential election may only highten the tensions between les banlieues and the police .
royal would keep france economically uncompetitive for the duration of her presidential term and her foreign policy gaffes so far do not inspire confidence .
sarkozy will easily win the first round with royal trailing in second , but sarkozy is a polarising figure and i would not be surprised to see segolene becoming president .
ben lonsdale , manchester i am no prophet , but i forecast there will be no one from the left in the runoff .
sarkozy and le pen will eventually be the final contenders .
why ?
because french do not confess they are voting for le pen in opinion polls .
because the old far right leader has not been campaigning himself , letting his daughter marine le pen on the front line .
and she succeeded in giving a softer image of her father .
because he has criticised recent measures against smokers and speed checks and such type of demagogic speech is very popular with french .
because nothing has really changed since 21st of april 2002 but there has been the riots at the end of 2005 and the ones in gare du nord end of march 2007 and this is fuelling the protesting votes in favour of le pen .
there will be a new shock on the 22nd of april 2007 when le pen is placed in the final race .
i am no prophet , but sarkozy will be the next french president .
and what about royal in all this ?
pardon me ...
who did you say ?
antoine de champs , tours , france olivier besancenot sounds like a man who knows what he is talking about ... rightly condemning the appalling neo-liberal capitalism that has festered under both the right and the so-called left in france for far too long .
it is the unmitigated disater of the capitalist system that has created the massive unemployment and alienation , discrimination , and injustice throughout france on a vast scale.how refreshing then to hear someone putting forward a real alternative to the much hated neo-liberal capitalist nightmare of more disatrous privatisation plans for big business , which both sarkozy and royal defend .
how refreshing then to hear someone condemn the violence and discrimination of the french police .
how refreshing to hear someone defend public services and public sector workers , the right to a stable and decent job and present ideas about creating a genuine socialist alternative to capitalism .
another world is possible and another france is necessary .
segolene royal seems to be presenting the same old failed blairite right wing ideas.think again !
p.black , uk i think a new generation of politicians is now there for france , but i 'm not sure , the coming president will be accepted by the whole population .
i 'm a wee bit anxious for france 's future .
f.roux , bourges , france , you are wrong to underestimate the importance of francois bayrou and only to focus on the main both political parities : the right and the left nicolas , paris , france i 've lived in france for many years , and run a business with my husband .
yes - france has a wonderful way of life , a health system second to none , but economically , france is on its knees .
the loony left - more like an extreme version of michael foot 's socialist vision - is desperate to protect the social benefits which have been acquired over 30 years and which cripple the economy .
socialist politicians declare proudly that they do not own shares , a nasty right-wing habit of investing in industry .
madame royal claims to speak for the lowly-paid while benefiting from her salaries and perks .
in the meantime , my husband and i pay away 60 % of our earnings to support a lumbering state with its 6 million civil servants .
good luck to sarko , he 's the best of a mediocre bunch , the only one who might just bring a little egalité to france .
madeleine dickson , limoges , france an item that should be more prominent on the election agenda on both sides of politics is what should be done about the future of the world 's largest nickel deposit , new caledonia .
the country is at boiling point from a mining perspective and some leadership from france is much neeeded , after all it is her duty to do so .
sebastien carpin , brisbane , australia i agree that equal airtime for all of the candidates is a strength of the french system , but referring to the disparaging of the american electoral system as coca-cola v pepsi : in 2002 , did n't it eventually come down to le pen or chirac ?
far-right vs right ... how 's that for choice ?
khalil , boston , ma , usa i am a french citizen and have lived in the usa since the age of 8 .
i often hear many negative comments about france and europe .
i believe that these comments are born of jealousy .
while france may have its problems as everyone does i find the french approach and thought process refreshing and full of life .
i believe in the french process and have every confidence that france will prosper and the french will continue to preserve their language , culture and unique way of life in an increasing dull anglo-american world of politically correct " grey zone " .
how nice to know that there is still a country that has not sold out .
in the us , where everything including values and principles is for sale , i find it to be stale and the people in part uninterested and unmotivated beyond reaching for the next burger or bag of junk food to put a few more kilos on their already large frame , to put it nicely .
france has and will continue to be a society of free thinkers who are not afraid to voice their thoughts .
vive la france ! ! !
arthur brown , lb usa the french left needs to unite and fight for a radical redistribution of wealth and the urgent transformation of the deeply corrupt capitalist system to a socially just , participative and profoundly democratic , co-operative green socialist society based on the sustainable common ownership of the means of production .
this is an alternative as global capitalism runs amok , wreaking havoc and global climate chaos in its wake .
capitalism is doomed !
another france is possible and highly necessary .
patrick black , uk i am a sixth-form student and as i am talking about le pen in my oral exam the french elections are naturally very interesting to me .
i do n't think le pen will win -lrb- and , after extensive research the vast number of anti-semitic comments he has made over the years , i sincerely hope he wo n't win as well -rrb- but i am not convinced by either sarkozy or royal .
sarkozy seems very underhand , a man who you would imagine to be right-handed but to keep his wallet in his left-hand pocket ; royal should not be let anywhere near a microphone when it comes to foreign policy .
i do n't know much about bayrou , but i would not be appalled if he won - he appears to be the best of a bad bunch .
chris stanley , stroud , england much like american political races , advertising a politician is a political party 's biggest concern .
the bnp and ump have marketed their candidates to match the sentiment and feeling of their constituents , ms. royal feels scripted , however has an uncanny ability to improvise her responses to well thought-out questions from the press .
sarkozy swears to carry out his party 's goals but incorporates his own ideas .
however he is sheepishly stubborn towards alternative methods of carrying out policies .
i think many voters will vote based on their feelings towards each candidate and not on what policies would be best for the country .
finn raftery , seattle , united states in principle , it 's democratic to provide the same air time for all politicians who manage to get 500 mayor 's signatures in order to run for presidency .
unfortunately , the result is the exact opposite .
those who only want to rant , and have no political platform because they know that they will never be elected , feel free to lobotomize political discourse in france .
the result has been 25 years of meaningless hypocrisy .
hardly anything said has any relation to reality and as a result , very little if anything is done to address the real issues .
worse , the extremism of so many statements , along with the infamous " acquis sociaux " , on which no one will give an inch , lull people into hating work , which is , of course , " a form of oppression " of the " monstrous capitalist exploiters " .
ho hum .
and worse still , if and when sarkozy wins , the undemocratic left will not accept the result of the democratic process .
any reform will be met by attempts to totally block france by massive protest movements .
pity .
douglas mccarthy , paris , france picking up from what richard tomlinson wrote , as a british citizen living in france why will i lose my right to vote in the uk national elections when i complete my fifteenth year abroad ?
that is truly losing one 's vote , in our so-called eu of equals .
john ward , metz , france the problem in france is that french society in recent years has been turned upside down and they do not know what to do about it .
france has seen a rapid rise in immigration , unemployment and violence .
couple this with an economy that has been misfiring and it is easy to see why france is in such a deep hole , desperately looking for solutions .
it may hurt french pride , but modelling itself on great britain and taking the best of what the british have done , whilst keeping the best of french could really sort out modern france .
take immigration - why can the french not embrace multiculturalism as the british have ?
what about the economy - the british do n't seem that worried about globalisation , so why are we ? ..
the british have barely any marxists , simply because there is no place for them .
in france they offer a solution to a problem , britain has no problem -lrb- relatively -rrb- and therefore no heavy solutions need offering .
france needs to think seriously , politicians need to step back , be brave and say things that actually the french may not want to hear .
unfortunately , owing to this election , that is not going to happen , and france is not going to get any better .
frederic lacroix , paris , francais eric paul - you seem to fundamentally misunderstand american political campaigns and related us legislation .
section 315 of the us communications act details the equal time rule regulating us political campaigns .
it and subsequent amendments are very well crafted and might inform you more completely .
i do think that france 's strict equal air time rule is to be admired and is something modern democracies should strive for ; as some already do , though perhaps not in such an austere manner .
n. campbell , new orleans , usa personally i feel sorry for the french .
there is no-one worthy of the presidency today .
the choice is awful , but what must be understood is that the first round is the real choice and public opinion , the second is a knock-out to get rid of the worst candidate .
maybe they should really start thinking about voting for and not against .
be warned they are heading for thatcherism if they vote sarkozy , and we british all know what that did !
we are still paying .
i live , but sadly do n't vote , in france and have done for 15 years , this is my 3rd election .
v.miller , nancy , france the role of president urgently needs reforming -lrb- as does the whole constitution -rrb- , as no one is very sure about which role -lrb- s -rrb- he has , especially if confronted with an opposition parliament .
these elections have been the most exciting in decades , yet i do believe that none of the candidates will take the necessary stance to reform the institutions .
i also fear that due to the huge division of france into pro- and anti-sarkozy , we might very possibly end up with a cohabitation for the next five years .
the most striking aspect of this campaign is the increasing role of the media , especially television .
the majority of the french electorate will not seek information about the candidates but will expect it to come to them , mainly through television and radio -lrb- still a very popular medium , especially the morning and afternoon news -rrb- .
in such a system , the most able orators and communicators have a clear advantage .
unfortunately , these happen to be mm sarkozy and le pen .
quentin liger , london , uk well , the french system may have the advantage that we look at the candidates ' ideas and not only at how much cash they raise for their campaign .
living in the us , i came to realize that no matter what you believe in , money is the only driving force toward a warm seat at the white house .
emmanuel gilles , bronx , usa from the popularity of sarkozy , i 'd say any leanings toward marxism here are fleeing in the face of growing economic and globalization problems .
he 's a scary guy , sarko , the way he reaches for the far-right votes and disarms his critics by saying , " is it wrong to talk about national identity ?
is that a bad word ? "
because of course they ca n't say that without alienating a lot of french people !
many of my french friends here agree that the election is pitiful .
there is no one offering any real solutions to the problems threatening this country .
but it would be nice to hear more about bayrou .
he 's the most sensible by far , and the only one really trying to address the issues of immigration and discrimination .
maria alexander , aix-en-provence , france i 've had enough of this france-bashing : it is still one of the best countries to live , and i would n't even think of moving to the rainy , crowded country ruled by the nhs-dicta .
here , life is good and relaxed , the best education and health system , i pay only a little bit more than what i used to pay in the us as taxes .
the political life has not been anaesthetized like it has been in anglo-saxon countries - and we all know where that leads us : bush , born-again christians , evolution-revisionists and co .
funny that some of the french-bashing is coming from expats in france .
if it is so bad , what are you guys doing here ? : -rrb- france has a lot of problems , sure , but it is still " better " than the rest - nothing is ever perfect ..
baris tarim , caen , france one must recognise the plethora of choices available to french voters .
charles de gaulle said there are as many ideas in france as there are cheeses .
this is perfectly represented in this election with for example le pen 's far right and laguiller 's far left .
i think these extremist ideals reveal a great deal about the sense of upheaval in french society and shows how fragmented a society it is .
the unemployment , lack of economic growth , immigration are all thorny issues which are as divisive as they are polemic and the longer these particular problems last , the more it adds to le pen 's following .
as for le pen , he will always get that 10 % -15 % he consistently gets in elections because of how determined his supporters are .
his recent success though is down to a series of socio-economic problems which a series of governments , both right-wing and left-wing , have failed to solve .
cormac mac gabhann , dublin , ireland having lived in france for some time , it strikes me that its system of high job protection and generous social benefits serves only to ensure that the underprivileged few are condemned live with few prospects , a life spent literally on the margins : on the council estates bordering the big cities , dependant on the state .
no surprise that the signs of social fracture and growing dissatisfaction are plain to see .
so much for equality , freedom and brotherhood !
i do n't like sarkozy much as a person , but he seems to be the only candidate willing to undertake the drastic liberalisation that france so desperately needs .
dominic higgins , london , england eu citizens are entitled to vote in eu elections , local council and industrial tribunal elections , so richard tomlinson 's complaint is not fully accurate .
there is always the option of acquiring french nationality for the other elections .
i have done so and this is one of the reasons why .
david buick , rennes , france to mr tomlinson : as an eu citizen and permanent resident in an eu country other than your own , you are allowed to vote -lrb- and stand -rrb- in local elections : that includes city council , county council and " region " council elections .
then , just as i was not allowed to vote in the general election when i lived in the uk , you are not allowed to vote in the presidential election in france .
julien randon-furling , paris , france in my extended conversations with french citizens from all walks of life , it surprises me that most are not too far apart on issues like immigration and globalization .
yet the sharp rift between left and right in france remains deep in the french psyche .
it reaches down to a visceral level that defies logic and plays into the political strategies of career politicians .
is it possible for france to keep democracy but ditch its self-seeking party system ?
donald williams , springfield , massachusetts , usa i think it 's great that you have so many choices in france and that there is a law enforcing equal time to all .
your system makes me jealous as an american .
we are forced to choose between only two candidates who are in fact almost identical anyway .
all other parties or independents are refused any time by the media .
mark ellis , york , usa your article lacks the respect that we deserve .
you dismiss us without really looking at who we are and what we do .
the french communist party , of which i am a member , has 130,000 members and 13,000 persons that hold public offices .
your own liberal party has far fewer members .
who are you to dismiss the views of the citizens in any of these parties ?
i should remind you that many dismissed the views of democrats in the early 18th century , yet europe was transformed .
you seem to believe marxists have no place in politics today .
i , on the other hand , find your clinging to a monarchy outdated and a drain on your state 's finances .
i suppose you have the right to maintain a royal family .
i would prefer to maintain our low rate of child poverty and fight for a socialist state .
russell yates , meaux , france i am following my first election as a french resident , though not voter , and agree that the short presentations by each contender each day are very snappy and engaging .
saying something different each time holds the interest too .
the galloping music that opens each space is also attention-grabbing .
trouble is , they all sound so sincere and seem so nice !
what is important , i think , is that yes they are reading prepared material , not reacting to questions , but at least they get to finish what they have to say without being constantly interrupted .
-lrb- so many presenters take so long introducing their guest that the guest with a fascinating point to make often barely says hello before the time slot is over . -rrb-
especially in the morning , i think a straight , uninterrupted performance is more attractive than voices shouting all at once and seeing all the candidates does help sort who is who and what they stand for .
how often have you gone to vote without any idea of the face behind the name on the ballot paper ?
angela sheard , romans-sur-isère , france .
i have n't seen any evidence that a single candidate is facing up to the french budget deficit .
the whole country is living on the never-never , and that ca n't go on for ever .
andrew h , london uk the tone of the article implies that it is french democracy that is bizarre for at least attempting to ensure that all parties have an opportunity to make their platforms known .
an alternative view would be that allowing more ' popular ' parties more airtime -lrb- as in england -rrb- vastly reduces the chance of smaller parties acquiring the votes that would entitle them to greater coverage next time round .
the game is rigged from the start , and yet this is considered the norm from which the french deviate .
danny millum , london it is a very good thing that all candidates are given the same time on tv .
it means that democracy and debate are still alive and that economics and finance , and tv companies , can not impose their rule completely .
france therefore avoids to quite a large extent horrors such as the pepsi / coke us election system .
the issue is not so much about keeping marxism alive , however relevant that philosophy remains , but to avoid as much as possible that " la chose politique " becomes only a matter of experts and professional politicians , an intoxicating show in which the ordinary citizen would be only a spectator ...
thinking can only be a dynamic process when all possiblities are considered , even those which at the moment seem unreasonable .
that is why i wish that france remains as much as possible the laboratory of ideas it has been since at least the 18th century .
finance only likes ideas which like finance , which are compatible with it and i want to think freely .
as for the british system , i do n't think the british have a relation to politics which could be compared to the one the french have .
the british seem very consensual and traditional and i do n't want a two-party system for france .
eric paul , nice , france france is nothing like as poor as the uk was under wilson and callaghan .
yet talking about singing the marseillaise has some of the same desperation to find a bit of national pride as union jack underpants had in the carnaby street of the sixties .
it is odd that the country that put liberty into its national motto should have such a fear of liberalism - as if it and its multicultural cousin will come and eat them and their way of life .
but until the french realise that the rest of the world does n't owe them a living and they ca n't protect everything french by throwing protectionist money at it from higher and higher taxes , they will continue to suffer from high unemployment and the high taxes that most try to avoid paying .
there is nothing incompatible between a healthy yet well-regulated market economy and the french way of life .
but it does n't take twelve people to plant the season 's flowers on a roundabout !
ben lenthall , cahors , france another excellent analysis by mark ...
pity only that he left out francois bayrou , who tries to introduce a new political style in france .
for me it seems obvious that france has a more lively democratic culture than the uk .
compare this very open election with the passing on of power from blair to brown in the uk .
the absence of a real democratic debate in the uk is quite a shame for a country that likes to paint itself as the stalwart of democratic rule .
ronald gruenebaum , brussels , belgium unfortunately france is not the western european country where you can spot the highest level of support for the jurassic marxist ideology .
when it comes to sound representation in the two chambers of parliament this misfortune is still an italian privilege .
french marxists are a sideshow with no real power , fragmented maybe colourful.the real black spot in france is the far right - as jurassic and out of date as the marxists in italy but for france misfortune , still with some real power .
enrico ferrero , hellerup , denmark whether the french vote right or left , a man or woman , the french policy of neocolonialism and active support for unpopular puppets in africa shall continue relentlessly .
mofor tangmo edward , cameroon i think mr mardell has unknowingly or wittingly left out the factor that underlies french politics at present , fear ; unemployment , violent behaviour , poverty , institutions that no longer are able to respond to the concerns of the majority ...
paul hubball , france i am an eu citizen , am a permanent resident in france , pay my taxes here , but am not allowed to vote in the elections .
how can it be legal under eu law that we -lrb- and we are many -rrb- are excluded from the democratic process ?
richard tomlinson , mandelieu , france i am a french citizen , and , within the forseeable future , a permanent resident and taxpayer in the uk !
i cherish my right and duty to vote , and will be voting for the french president on sunday and have been frustrated at not being able to vote at important uk elections in the uk , especially when i see so many uk citizens not exercising their right to vote ! -lrb- it cost many people their lives or their freedom to ask for the right to vote , in some countries there still is no right to vote , yet , nowadays , both in the uk and in france , so many people ca n't be bothered ! ! ! -rrb-
but , i have lived here long enough now to apply for british citizenship -lrb- and am married to a british citizen -rrb- .
thankfully , now , i do not have to renounce my french nationality to do that !
-lrb- you used to be able to be only french , nothing else , or else renounce the french nationality -rrb- so , i will apply for british citizenship , it costs £ 268 , and takes up to 8 months to process , but at least i will be able to vote on uk issues and for the uk government !
richard t , perhaps you could investigate whether there is a similar possibility for you to gain these rights in france ?
helgaflower , cheltenham , uk to reply to richard tomlinson , i am a permanent resident in the uk , paying my taxes here , have been living here for 6 years now , and not allowed to vote here in the elections , because i am not a british citizen .
so england is not that much different in that case .
but i have always been a person who adored france , the culture , the country .
i have never lived there , but i am aware that burocracy makes it difficult sometimes , but with so many english people moving there , it ca n't be that bad , can it ?
they should stop complaining about it , or move back here if it 's so problematic over there .
em , manchester to richard tomlinson : under eu law an eu citizen legally resident in another member state can vote and stand in the the local and european elections , therefore you can do that in france -lrb- i 've done it in belgium -rrb- .
however , no eu member state allows non-citizens to vote in parliamentary or presidential elections , so nothing special about france there .
your anger should be directed at the british government because it is uk law which takes away your right to vote in the uk after 15 years outside of the country , something that many other european countries do not do .
it is undemocratic , but it 's got nothing to do with the eu .
rebecca , brussels to mr tomlinson , you can vote for local election in france like most of the european countries .
if you want to vote you can ask for the french citizenship thierry le romancer , paris france name your e-mail address town & country comments the bbc may edit your comments and not all emails will be published .

the man the opinion polls say will be the next president of france has been out and about in the loire valley .
nicolas sarkozy has shaken hands with people restoring a chateau , chatted with youngsters learning hairdressing and made his triumphant way out of a hall in tours packed close with supporters .
he has passionately defended his controversial record .
i love election campaigns and watching politicians in action .
but most people get their politics not in the flesh but from people like me , tv reporters .
and in france for the next couple of weeks they 'll be getting a rather odd picture .
let 's put it this way .
would it make any difference to the result of the next british general election if gordon brown and david cameron were given exactly the same air time as nick griffin of the british national party -lrb- bnp -rrb- or the candidates of the socialist workers party ?
that 's what has to happen in france .
the presidential election has two rounds , and the first vote serves to narrow a large field to a simple two-horse race for the second round .
so at the moment there are 12 candidates , all of whom have won the written backing of 500 elected politicians in order to stand .
segolene royal is battling to consolidate left-wing support here 's the rub .
by law french radio and tv have to give all the candidates the same amount of air time .
all broadcasters know the horrors of stop-watch balance .
many is the time i 've got the message " the editor says can you get the snp in ? "
" well tell him ' yes ' but i 'll need another minute . "
" he 'll give you 45 seconds . "
it may be vital for democracy , but it does n't make for elegant television .
but british law and the bbc 's own guidelines are as nothing compared to the rigour of french law .
to include a short 20-second clip of each candidate a report would be four minutes long without the reporter saying a word of introduction .
so each and every report would have to be at least five minutes long .
the upshot is that of course it does n't happen .
there are special election programmes , but the news deals in opinion polls and generalities .
left-wing rebels but this has one unexpected bonus .
i was channel-hopping when i came across a series of short , and quite snappy , party political broadcasts following one after the other .
you might think this sounds dull viewing , but it is a lot more interesting , and gives you a much better perspective , than something tagged on before or after the news .
the best watch was oliver besancenot , the trotskyite postman .
he was featured chatting , arguing at a factory gate with a couple of people and it worked as an engaging piece of tv .
madame royal was deliberately presidential .
but what came across to me was the scale of the opposition she faces , and i do n't mean mr sarkozy .
le pen stunned france by reaching the runoff in 2002 it used to be a slogan of republicans in france : " no enemies to the left ! "
this is not something segolene is likely to say .
in broadcast after broadcast , the same message was repeated : the threat of globalisation , the trampled rights of workers , the ravages of capitalism and economic liberalism .
this of course is not just the result of a strict broadcasting law .
the left is more fractured and marxism more alive in france than anywhere else in europe .
in britain , there are of course marxist groups , but most people seem to believe that capitalism is the only currently possible economic system and arguments are about redistribution and restrictions within it .
it is such an accepted belief that it feels rather odd writing it down .
but in france that is not so .
this has a very real effect on this election .
the practical effect of a vote for the communist party , the revolutionary communist league , the alternative globalisation party , workers struggle or the workers party is to take a vote away from ms royal .
i am not trying to undermine the glorious unpredictability of democracy .
of course workers struggle could leap from the 6 % it got last time to victory .
but do n't hold your breath ..
what many on the left fear is a repeat of 2002 , when the smaller parties leeched support from lionel jospin to allow far-right leader jean-marie le pen through to the second round .
of course , mr sarkozy faces a similar threat from smaller parities of the right , but his real problem is with the other two realistic contenders - le pen and francois bayrou .
campaign contrasts in the packed hall in tours , sarkozy 's passionate discourse on immigration and integration gets them stamping their feet .
i 'm sitting on the steps of a temporary stand next to a woman in her mid-twenties .
as sarkozy came to one climactic point of his argument the twenty-something woman next to me exclaimed " voila ! " - as if he was providing the clinching point that had eluded her in past arguments with friends .
throughout his speech she had been muttering " c 'est vrai , c 'est vrai " -lrb- true , true ! -rrb- .
a few seats away a smart woman , her grey hair cut elegantly short , smartly punched the air and waved a poster , almost in imitation of political activists she had seen on tv .
i did n't get the feeling it was something she did very often .
i have been to three segolene royal rallies and there is a palpable difference .
the socialist party supporters are happy to back someone who could win , who shares at least some of their values .
here it is the man himself they are backing .
outside i talk to a woman who says she lived in london for a long while .
she wants sarkozy as her president , but wants to justify her choice .
" in america i would not be a republican , " she tells me , continuing : " he and tony blair are -lrb- she pressed her palms together -rrb- are they not ? "
certainly in the hall i did n't hear a single idea that would be shockingly out of place in a labour manifesto , i did n't hear anything that could not have come from the lips of john reid or david blunkett .
on second thoughts , i 'm not sure i can imagine them singing the marseillaise .
my new friend says she remembers " when your country was poor , " adding that french socialists are like the labour party of those days .
but the labour party in those days did n't have french tv guidelines giving marxist factions valuable air time .
please use the post form below to comment on any of the issues raised in the diary .
in my part of la france profonde , my neighbours will vote for anyone who promises to get the stifling beaurocracy off their backs and let them earn a living .
unfortunately , they do n't see anyone among the candidates able or willing to do so , so their vote will be cast for one of the usual suspects - a career politician wary of upsetting any of the ' social partners ' - and only appearances will change in france after the presidential election. doris ward , argenton chateau france having lived in france for the last 2 years i really enjoy the different appraoch the french have to politics .
people are very open with their opinions and really enjoy the fight. it is a great change from the ' soundbite ' contect over the channel .
however no-one seems to really want to rock the boat and unfortunately in our global world this boat is heading for reefs .
james hodson , montgenevre , france i wish the bbc was more aware that international opinion can have an effect on national choice of politics .
a quick analysis of all the political candidates agenda -reveals that sarkozy is only interested in becoming president and nothing more -lrb- social change takes years unless it comes from a police state -rrb- and royal is the only real opposition to sarkozy .
favourite candidates are bové -lrb- sustainability -rrb- and voynet -lrb- green -rrb- although french friends holding votes agree they will vote royal to ensure the safety of their fellow citizens -lrb- citizen in the sense people who live here -rrb- .
penelope , paris those who compare jean-marie le pen 's movement to the bnp and brand him " far-right " or an " extremist " prove that they have no understanding of what is happening in france today .
le pen will get more than 20 % of the votes and will be in the second round .
do n't forget that he has consistently improved his scores in the presidential elections and ended up with 17 % last time .
also his electorate is the most loyal of all with over 80 % faithfuls .
add that mégret and the populist party have joined forces with him , that 's another good 2 % .
i vote josé bové so i believe my comments are unbiased .
gaston favresse , london as a french citizen living in sweden , i shall next sunday vote for the only leader possible.jean marie le pen .
france and the rest of europe need a wake up call .
the left and the right are the same .
the time hascomefor a massive rebellion against muslim immigration , and the dictators in bruxelles .
i rather votefor a party that says clearly what it thinks than the hypocritical lefties or rightists. c.simon , sweden i 'm a french citizen born in mauritius .
well it 's incredible to see how polls can direct people views in two directions - mrs royal and mr sarkosy .
what about the others ?
what is the the margin of error of these polls 5 % - 10 % or 0 % as they wish us to beleive ? ? ?
if so probably again we 'll see another 2002 when no poll institute gave the right predictions .
published polls which do not give their margin of error are rubish when they give a winner by a 2 % margin .
bhageerutty kishore , bourg en bresse , france we droped equal airtime rules in the states back in the 90 's and to be honest third parties have done at least as well or better since then .
nick michelewicz , keene , new hampshire , usa the socialists are the biggest threat to this country as they have an actual chance of being elected in the second round .
how ségolène can justify her ridiculous program is beyond me , case in point : increasing minimum wage to 1.500 ? a month ... how ? with good will and a rose !
as the median -lrb- not average ! -rrb- salary hovers between 1250 and 1400 i wonder how on earth she will be able to find 200 extra euros a month for the majority of french workers , it does n't make sense , she peddles populist ideals and her campaign is focused on the criticising of the right .
she has no authority , no economic sense and is the epitome of the gauche caviar .
why does it have to be so bad to earn money and make a good living , somehow it is inextricably linked to the french instilled catholic morals , that despite the laïcité of the state , continues to permeate society .
in france the less you talk about money and the poorer and more charitable you portray yourself the better you are .
henrik nordling , paris , france to those of you that likes our " same time for everyone policy " never heard or seen the people begging for or votes .
they are away from reality , because they do n't have a chance to win .
they always say the same damn speech , because they do n't have any other idea ... ideas from one century ago , ideas that were proven to be big mistakes ...
they 're not even funny .
when i was a kid , mother told me maggie was evil .
today , i think we really would need someone like her , someone that would not stop when two or three demonstrator would show up ... just to move on one day .
nick , paris , france i have lived here 4 years .
i have a multi ethnic group of friends .
they are basically afraid of sarkozy .
this is man who stands on tiptoes when he is photographed .
who wants to stop immigration , who calls poor people scum .
he is openly hunting votes from the national front .
he has immense energy when he talks , and power of conviction , and perhaps is too excitable , making some comment he might already be going crazy .
by contrast the problem is royale is so serene she is turning into a non-entity , she does n't seem to want it badly enough and she is not leading at all but telling the french a load of policies but nothing about how it will happen .
this is her big error , if she ranted about the state of the country and showed people what she willing to do to fix it she would walk this election .
she smiles and talks in droning voice almost like a ' stepford mum ' .
bayrou looks like he will win through because of fear of one and apathy for the other .
those english or other nationalites touting sarko would do well to be very attentive to what he says .
this is a man who admires bush us middle eastern policy , it is a man many fear could be the new french emperor .
europe is not his cup of tea. collie , nice as a young british person working in france i would say one of the biggest problems here is the lack of trust the older generation have in the young .
people here think it 's strange that a 21-year old should have completed university and be working full time as in britain , and the baby-boom generation just seems to be sitting on all the wealth and positions of responsibility without opening up to the young .
often all twenty-somethings can do is spend years at university or doing poorly paid " stages " -lrb- work placements -rrb- rather than being encouraged to start contributing to the economy .
henry rich , paris , france france is probably fine for all the middle-aged people living in it that benefited from lots of perks handed out when the economy was doing fine and employment was high during the 30 glorieuses .
to answer those that say france is doing fine , i will say that it is for those people !
but it certainly is not for young people who have to beg for jobs , get paid nothing , have no perks , have high real estate prices and live at home .
i am living in the us , and as a young person , i am doing very well for myself .
everyday young people leave france just like me -lrb- 300,000 just in london alone -rrb- .
france seriously needs to think to liberalize its economy , so that more jobs can be created . until then , the brain drain and the lack of investments will continue .
after all , who wants to put their money in a place where the government takes most of it .
peter , washington dc despite all the claims about " égalité , fraternité et liberté " , france is still a monarchy , but with an all-powerful president as head of state instead of a powerless king or queen -lrb- as in britain and the netherlands -rrb- .
the country is ruled accordingly and hence nothing changes .
everything in the name of " la gloire " and nothing in the name of progress .
pity .
albert , amsterdam sarkozy would like to apply for liberalism but can not even pronounce the word .
the ps : officially the hymn is still " the international " and capitalism is not an accepted system -lrb- i predict ps will split up -rrb- .
labor party is assimilated with far right .
most of young people want to become " fonctionnaire " very few chance i come back to this funny country expect of course for holidays or retirement .
didier lebon , french expat - bruxelles french people are capable of the best and the worst beleive me !
with us , you have to expect the unexpected .
that is , one week only before the first round , i have still hope / faith that the majority of the people will hear the two speeches of sarkozy and royal and realise , in all honesty , that the first one has very dangerous ideas and the second is our only hope .
but even on the best case sceanario of segolene , being elected , she better keeps her promises , otherwise some very hard time is awaiting france , let me tell you - i shoud know , i am french myself .
the task is not going to be easy .
vanina st martin , edinburgh , scotland i think those that are denigrating this relative stability in british and american politics are missing the whole point of this article .
what is being argued -lrb- and quite correctly , i may add -rrb- is in fact that british and american politics is less colourful than french politics because of this airtime regulation - but that their political systems are better off in terms of stability and effectiveness because of this .
the gentleman who brought up italian politics brings a great point .
if it 's ' colour ' you 're after , italy is even ' better ' than france .
but just as the french system finally pales relative to the anglo-saxon ones in terms of providing results to its people , does this mean that you would trade your french system for an even less effective but more colourful one in italy -lrb- or india -rrb- ?
if so , i 'm sure there are a lot of italians and indians who would jump at that offer .
h. juneja , london , uk france may be experiencing difficulty economically and with immigration , but as a nation it should be admired for doing two things : following its own path , and being open to a real political spectrum .
one thing notably lacking amongst these commments is a sense of shared history between francophones and anglophones - canada is predicted to sky rocket to over 50 million citizens by 2040 , easily rivalling france and the uk in population ... we have the great benefit of both nations ' political and social heritage and it has done us very well .
british stoicism and french joi-de-vivre make for a vigorous and lively culture , and it should not be forgotten that whether the tories win the next election in the uk or sarkozy does win in france , the essence of their cultures wo n't change and the politicians ultimately will have to be true to the average citizen 's concept of their nation .
the us aside , doomsday scenarios just are n't realistic in the modern europe .
nathan jenkins , london , canada the only advice i can give the french people is ... do n't try to emulate britain .
if i had the means , i would have moved to france 20 years ago .
alex maricic , fife , scotland what the french want is someone who is not afraid to take on the criminals who , in the last 30 years , have turned safe and pleasant french " banlieues " into territories occupied by work-shy , integrists , anti-french delinquents issued from uncontrolled immigration .
jean-luc royer , england what amazes me is that the candidates are allowed to get away with so much .
the french tv journalists are so subservient .
what is needed is for each candidate to be given a good paxman-style grilling and then a live debate amonst themselves with a strong chairman .
john ette , le pradet , france being an american studying and working in france , i find the presidential election very interesting .
i am not sure who will win but , either way politics and democracy is alive and kicking in france and i hope it will always stay that way .
i would love it if in the usa we could have more than just two choices and two parties for our presidential elections coming up next year .
my french friends are very open about their views on the canidates and we love discussing our different perspectives of each canidate and speculating on how they would change france .
i find that the journalist of this article has n't given serious thought or consideration to the way of life and history of the french people and their political system .
having lived here for almost 2 years i was a bit offended by the tone of his article and i am not even french .
i wish the best for france and hope that no matter who wins they will do the best they can for their country and its citizens .
erin , lille , france as all the real power now rests in brussels and strasbourg maybe it ? s time for eu citizens to stop paying attention , as so many have already done , to local national elections and concentrate on how they are being represented within european institutions .
where it seems democracy plays second fiddle to bureaucracy i propose that national election candidates receive zero free air time as a first step towards shifting our attention .
a change that would be simultaneously cost effective , popular and egalitarian. mike sell , founex , switzerland i am a french citizen , living in malaysia and expect to vote in the april presidential elections .
i love my country and believe most french people are very lucky to have been born french even though , like everywhere else things could be much improved .
i am also one of the apparently unprecedented large number of undecided voters .
to put it more more simply , i find it hard to decide which of the candidates is the least unpalatable .
mitterrand , de gaulle , pompidou , giscard d 'estaing had stature , a rationally thought out political programme and a coherent vision of what france should be , whether you agreed with them or not .
this lot -lrb- royal , sarkozy , bayrou , le pen et al -rrb- are a bunch of undistinguished politicians scrambling for power .
pauvre france !
i 'll still vote because i believe it is a duty -lrb- hard won over the centuries -rrb- but without any conviction .
christine sathiah , penang , malaysia i have to say i enjoy reading rich english people living in limousin / aquitaine / languedoc-roussillon complaining about the french welfare system in happy oblivion of the rest of france , which would be destroyed in the way so many northern , scottish and welsh towns were by unrestricted thatcherism in the 1980s .
certainly , france needs economic reform if it is to go forward from where it is now , but the sort of ruthless cutthroat politics that sarkozy is advocating is frightening for people in the north of france , where the collapse of industry is still felt very strongly , and where a " tough " immigration policy would create tensions that do n't need to be exacerbated .
mark brown , lens , france i think france 's " equal time " standard , while perhaps cumbersome from a tv producer 's standpoint , is far superior to the system in the us where presidential candidates are given large endowments of public money to produce 30 second tv commercials .
the result is an enormously inefficent use of public and private resources to fund essentially smear campaigns where issue-oriented discussion is practically non-existent .
however , this would probably upset the us media lobby , so do n't expect change any time soon .
mike taylor , ann arbor , michigan usa have lived in both countries and in france presently .
sorry to disappoint everyone but there is no ideal political system wheather from the states , great britain or france and i agree with the negative points concerning the us + gb .
however the particularity of france is that the french people have been living with the myth of the " 30 glorieuses " -lrb- the best 30 economic years after ww2 -rrb- and kept to believe that it could continue for another 30 . and there is now a huge gap between the state paid employees -lrb- in the energy , and transport big dept -rrb- who enjoy work security and numerous privileges and the rest : self-employed , low payed workers from small firms , shopkeepers . who do not enjoy eany goodies and have to pay their electricity and gas and telephone bills full rate -lrb- unlike employees of edf -lrb- for electricty -rrb- or france telecom ... -rrb- i would like to know if employees from the different electricity co. in gb or us pay their electricity at reduced rate ?
sometimes you feel ! in france you are in a republic with some old fashion aristocratic / monarchist remaining that everyone moans about but not one politician dares talking about let alone question its democratic values ...
to finish france will always be a great country of contradictions where poeple love laws which loks perfect on paper but impossible to apply in real . i just hope that this time french people will refuse to be kept in the dark or above the clouds of the real economic situation -lrb- one of the highest european debt , a shrinking pension system . -rrb- and that we have to accept and adapt to this new globalisation of everything -lrb- from economy to terrorism -rrb- and think hard and suggest a real alternative ...
elisabeth , france + england i 've lived all over europe and for the last five years in paris and much as i love the city , country , culture , way of life etc .
i have to honestly say that i 've never been worse off financially .
i would probably qualify for housing benefit and several other subsidies but i 'm restricted from earning overtime .
it is a crazy situation .
if i was american i 'd vote democrat and have always considered myself centre-left but in france sarkozy is seen as extreme and if that 's the case , well i 'm extreme too. john healy , paris , france the issue of air time in the media is undermined by the way the media portait a candidate in news pieces .
for example , n sarkozy will win debates after debates but the media in france will mention his name every time there are riots for whatever reasons .
also , royal was shown as the messiah until she messed it up herself .
suddenly bayrou turns up and the media almost openly present him as the ' if you do n't want sarkozy in , vote for this no-mark ' .
basically the media -lrb- most of which has leftist ideals -rrb- do n't want sarkozy in and will do whatever they can to sink him .
shameful but so typical of the french elite -lrb- media and politics -rrb- which has put the country in this situation in the first place .
nick , london le pen 's score last time was not the fault of the minor candidates !
the first turn was won by the " leave me alone i 'm on holiday " party ; in fact the level of abstentionwas higher than the score of any candidate !
judy wood , lyon , france france desperately needs economic reform and the successful integration of immigrants into french society .
sarkozy may be able to deliver on the former but will fail miserably on the latter .
his record as interior minister is shocking in this respect and his potential election may only highten the tensions between les banlieues and the police .
royal would keep france economically uncompetitive for the duration of her presidential term and her foreign policy gaffes so far do not inspire confidence .
sarkozy will easily win the first round with royal trailing in second , but sarkozy is a polarising figure and i would not be surprised to see segolene becoming president .
ben lonsdale , manchester i am no prophet , but i forecast there will be no one from the left in the runoff .
sarkozy and le pen will eventually be the final contenders .
why ?
because french do not confess they are voting for le pen in opinion polls .
because the old far right leader has not been campaigning himself , letting his daughter marine le pen on the front line .
and she succeeded in giving a softer image of her father .
because he has criticised recent measures against smokers and speed checks and such type of demagogic speech is very popular with french .
because nothing has really changed since 21st of april 2002 but there has been the riots at the end of 2005 and the ones in gare du nord end of march 2007 and this is fuelling the protesting votes in favour of le pen .
there will be a new shock on the 22nd of april 2007 when le pen is placed in the final race .
i am no prophet , but sarkozy will be the next french president .
and what about royal in all this ?
pardon me ...
who did you say ?
antoine de champs , tours , france olivier besancenot sounds like a man who knows what he is talking about ... rightly condemning the appalling neo-liberal capitalism that has festered under both the right and the so-called left in france for far too long .
it is the unmitigated disater of the capitalist system that has created the massive unemployment and alienation , discrimination , and injustice throughout france on a vast scale.how refreshing then to hear someone putting forward a real alternative to the much hated neo-liberal capitalist nightmare of more disatrous privatisation plans for big business , which both sarkozy and royal defend .
how refreshing then to hear someone condemn the violence and discrimination of the french police .
how refreshing to hear someone defend public services and public sector workers , the right to a stable and decent job and present ideas about creating a genuine socialist alternative to capitalism .
another world is possible and another france is necessary .
segolene royal seems to be presenting the same old failed blairite right wing ideas.think again !
p.black , uk i think a new generation of politicians is now there for france , but i 'm not sure , the coming president will be accepted by the whole population .
i 'm a wee bit anxious for france 's future .
f.roux , bourges , france , you are wrong to underestimate the importance of francois bayrou and only to focus on the main both political parities : the right and the left nicolas , paris , france i 've lived in france for many years , and run a business with my husband .
yes - france has a wonderful way of life , a health system second to none , but economically , france is on its knees .
the loony left - more like an extreme version of michael foot 's socialist vision - is desperate to protect the social benefits which have been acquired over 30 years and which cripple the economy .
socialist politicians declare proudly that they do not own shares , a nasty right-wing habit of investing in industry .
madame royal claims to speak for the lowly-paid while benefiting from her salaries and perks .
in the meantime , my husband and i pay away 60 % of our earnings to support a lumbering state with its 6 million civil servants .
good luck to sarko , he 's the best of a mediocre bunch , the only one who might just bring a little egalité to france .
madeleine dickson , limoges , france an item that should be more prominent on the election agenda on both sides of politics is what should be done about the future of the world 's largest nickel deposit , new caledonia .
the country is at boiling point from a mining perspective and some leadership from france is much neeeded , after all it is her duty to do so .
sebastien carpin , brisbane , australia i agree that equal airtime for all of the candidates is a strength of the french system , but referring to the disparaging of the american electoral system as coca-cola v pepsi : in 2002 , did n't it eventually come down to le pen or chirac ?
far-right vs right ... how 's that for choice ?
khalil , boston , ma , usa i am a french citizen and have lived in the usa since the age of 8 .
i often hear many negative comments about france and europe .
i believe that these comments are born of jealousy .
while france may have its problems as everyone does i find the french approach and thought process refreshing and full of life .
i believe in the french process and have every confidence that france will prosper and the french will continue to preserve their language , culture and unique way of life in an increasing dull anglo-american world of politically correct " grey zone " .
how nice to know that there is still a country that has not sold out .
in the us , where everything including values and principles is for sale , i find it to be stale and the people in part uninterested and unmotivated beyond reaching for the next burger or bag of junk food to put a few more kilos on their already large frame , to put it nicely .
france has and will continue to be a society of free thinkers who are not afraid to voice their thoughts .
vive la france ! ! !
arthur brown , lb usa the french left needs to unite and fight for a radical redistribution of wealth and the urgent transformation of the deeply corrupt capitalist system to a socially just , participative and profoundly democratic , co-operative green socialist society based on the sustainable common ownership of the means of production .
this is an alternative as global capitalism runs amok , wreaking havoc and global climate chaos in its wake .
capitalism is doomed !
another france is possible and highly necessary .
patrick black , uk i am a sixth-form student and as i am talking about le pen in my oral exam the french elections are naturally very interesting to me .
i do n't think le pen will win -lrb- and , after extensive research the vast number of anti-semitic comments he has made over the years , i sincerely hope he wo n't win as well -rrb- but i am not convinced by either sarkozy or royal .
sarkozy seems very underhand , a man who you would imagine to be right-handed but to keep his wallet in his left-hand pocket ; royal should not be let anywhere near a microphone when it comes to foreign policy .
i do n't know much about bayrou , but i would not be appalled if he won - he appears to be the best of a bad bunch .
chris stanley , stroud , england much like american political races , advertising a politician is a political party 's biggest concern .
the bnp and ump have marketed their candidates to match the sentiment and feeling of their constituents , ms. royal feels scripted , however has an uncanny ability to improvise her responses to well thought-out questions from the press .
sarkozy swears to carry out his party 's goals but incorporates his own ideas .
however he is sheepishly stubborn towards alternative methods of carrying out policies .
i think many voters will vote based on their feelings towards each candidate and not on what policies would be best for the country .
finn raftery , seattle , united states in principle , it 's democratic to provide the same air time for all politicians who manage to get 500 mayor 's signatures in order to run for presidency .
unfortunately , the result is the exact opposite .
those who only want to rant , and have no political platform because they know that they will never be elected , feel free to lobotomize political discourse in france .
the result has been 25 years of meaningless hypocrisy .
hardly anything said has any relation to reality and as a result , very little if anything is done to address the real issues .
worse , the extremism of so many statements , along with the infamous " acquis sociaux " , on which no one will give an inch , lull people into hating work , which is , of course , " a form of oppression " of the " monstrous capitalist exploiters " .
ho hum .
and worse still , if and when sarkozy wins , the undemocratic left will not accept the result of the democratic process .
any reform will be met by attempts to totally block france by massive protest movements .
pity .
douglas mccarthy , paris , france picking up from what richard tomlinson wrote , as a british citizen living in france why will i lose my right to vote in the uk national elections when i complete my fifteenth year abroad ?
that is truly losing one 's vote , in our so-called eu of equals .
john ward , metz , france the problem in france is that french society in recent years has been turned upside down and they do not know what to do about it .
france has seen a rapid rise in immigration , unemployment and violence .
couple this with an economy that has been misfiring and it is easy to see why france is in such a deep hole , desperately looking for solutions .
it may hurt french pride , but modelling itself on great britain and taking the best of what the british have done , whilst keeping the best of french could really sort out modern france .
take immigration - why can the french not embrace multiculturalism as the british have ?
what about the economy - the british do n't seem that worried about globalisation , so why are we ? ..
the british have barely any marxists , simply because there is no place for them .
in france they offer a solution to a problem , britain has no problem -lrb- relatively -rrb- and therefore no heavy solutions need offering .
france needs to think seriously , politicians need to step back , be brave and say things that actually the french may not want to hear .
unfortunately , owing to this election , that is not going to happen , and france is not going to get any better .
frederic lacroix , paris , francais eric paul - you seem to fundamentally misunderstand american political campaigns and related us legislation .
section 315 of the us communications act details the equal time rule regulating us political campaigns .
it and subsequent amendments are very well crafted and might inform you more completely .
i do think that france 's strict equal air time rule is to be admired and is something modern democracies should strive for ; as some already do , though perhaps not in such an austere manner .
n. campbell , new orleans , usa personally i feel sorry for the french .
there is no-one worthy of the presidency today .
the choice is awful , but what must be understood is that the first round is the real choice and public opinion , the second is a knock-out to get rid of the worst candidate .
maybe they should really start thinking about voting for and not against .
be warned they are heading for thatcherism if they vote sarkozy , and we british all know what that did !
we are still paying .
i live , but sadly do n't vote , in france and have done for 15 years , this is my 3rd election .
v.miller , nancy , france the role of president urgently needs reforming -lrb- as does the whole constitution -rrb- , as no one is very sure about which role -lrb- s -rrb- he has , especially if confronted with an opposition parliament .
these elections have been the most exciting in decades , yet i do believe that none of the candidates will take the necessary stance to reform the institutions .
i also fear that due to the huge division of france into pro- and anti-sarkozy , we might very possibly end up with a cohabitation for the next five years .
the most striking aspect of this campaign is the increasing role of the media , especially television .
the majority of the french electorate will not seek information about the candidates but will expect it to come to them , mainly through television and radio -lrb- still a very popular medium , especially the morning and afternoon news -rrb- .
in such a system , the most able orators and communicators have a clear advantage .
unfortunately , these happen to be mm sarkozy and le pen .
quentin liger , london , uk well , the french system may have the advantage that we look at the candidates ' ideas and not only at how much cash they raise for their campaign .
living in the us , i came to realize that no matter what you believe in , money is the only driving force toward a warm seat at the white house .
emmanuel gilles , bronx , usa from the popularity of sarkozy , i 'd say any leanings toward marxism here are fleeing in the face of growing economic and globalization problems .
he 's a scary guy , sarko , the way he reaches for the far-right votes and disarms his critics by saying , " is it wrong to talk about national identity ?
is that a bad word ? "
because of course they ca n't say that without alienating a lot of french people !
many of my french friends here agree that the election is pitiful .
there is no one offering any real solutions to the problems threatening this country .
but it would be nice to hear more about bayrou .
he 's the most sensible by far , and the only one really trying to address the issues of immigration and discrimination .
maria alexander , aix-en-provence , france i 've had enough of this france-bashing : it is still one of the best countries to live , and i would n't even think of moving to the rainy , crowded country ruled by the nhs-dicta .
here , life is good and relaxed , the best education and health system , i pay only a little bit more than what i used to pay in the us as taxes .
the political life has not been anaesthetized like it has been in anglo-saxon countries - and we all know where that leads us : bush , born-again christians , evolution-revisionists and co .
funny that some of the french-bashing is coming from expats in france .
if it is so bad , what are you guys doing here ? : -rrb- france has a lot of problems , sure , but it is still " better " than the rest - nothing is ever perfect ..
baris tarim , caen , france one must recognise the plethora of choices available to french voters .
charles de gaulle said there are as many ideas in france as there are cheeses .
this is perfectly represented in this election with for example le pen 's far right and laguiller 's far left .
i think these extremist ideals reveal a great deal about the sense of upheaval in french society and shows how fragmented a society it is .
the unemployment , lack of economic growth , immigration are all thorny issues which are as divisive as they are polemic and the longer these particular problems last , the more it adds to le pen 's following .
as for le pen , he will always get that 10 % -15 % he consistently gets in elections because of how determined his supporters are .
his recent success though is down to a series of socio-economic problems which a series of governments , both right-wing and left-wing , have failed to solve .
cormac mac gabhann , dublin , ireland having lived in france for some time , it strikes me that its system of high job protection and generous social benefits serves only to ensure that the underprivileged few are condemned live with few prospects , a life spent literally on the margins : on the council estates bordering the big cities , dependant on the state .
no surprise that the signs of social fracture and growing dissatisfaction are plain to see .
so much for equality , freedom and brotherhood !
i do n't like sarkozy much as a person , but he seems to be the only candidate willing to undertake the drastic liberalisation that france so desperately needs .
dominic higgins , london , england eu citizens are entitled to vote in eu elections , local council and industrial tribunal elections , so richard tomlinson 's complaint is not fully accurate .
there is always the option of acquiring french nationality for the other elections .
i have done so and this is one of the reasons why .
david buick , rennes , france to mr tomlinson : as an eu citizen and permanent resident in an eu country other than your own , you are allowed to vote -lrb- and stand -rrb- in local elections : that includes city council , county council and " region " council elections .
then , just as i was not allowed to vote in the general election when i lived in the uk , you are not allowed to vote in the presidential election in france .
julien randon-furling , paris , france in my extended conversations with french citizens from all walks of life , it surprises me that most are not too far apart on issues like immigration and globalization .
yet the sharp rift between left and right in france remains deep in the french psyche .
it reaches down to a visceral level that defies logic and plays into the political strategies of career politicians .
is it possible for france to keep democracy but ditch its self-seeking party system ?
donald williams , springfield , massachusetts , usa i think it 's great that you have so many choices in france and that there is a law enforcing equal time to all .
your system makes me jealous as an american .
we are forced to choose between only two candidates who are in fact almost identical anyway .
all other parties or independents are refused any time by the media .
mark ellis , york , usa your article lacks the respect that we deserve .
you dismiss us without really looking at who we are and what we do .
the french communist party , of which i am a member , has 130,000 members and 13,000 persons that hold public offices .
your own liberal party has far fewer members .
who are you to dismiss the views of the citizens in any of these parties ?
i should remind you that many dismissed the views of democrats in the early 18th century , yet europe was transformed .
you seem to believe marxists have no place in politics today .
i , on the other hand , find your clinging to a monarchy outdated and a drain on your state 's finances .
i suppose you have the right to maintain a royal family .
i would prefer to maintain our low rate of child poverty and fight for a socialist state .
russell yates , meaux , france i am following my first election as a french resident , though not voter , and agree that the short presentations by each contender each day are very snappy and engaging .
saying something different each time holds the interest too .
the galloping music that opens each space is also attention-grabbing .
trouble is , they all sound so sincere and seem so nice !
what is important , i think , is that yes they are reading prepared material , not reacting to questions , but at least they get to finish what they have to say without being constantly interrupted .
-lrb- so many presenters take so long introducing their guest that the guest with a fascinating point to make often barely says hello before the time slot is over . -rrb-
especially in the morning , i think a straight , uninterrupted performance is more attractive than voices shouting all at once and seeing all the candidates does help sort who is who and what they stand for .
how often have you gone to vote without any idea of the face behind the name on the ballot paper ?
angela sheard , romans-sur-isère , france .
i have n't seen any evidence that a single candidate is facing up to the french budget deficit .
the whole country is living on the never-never , and that ca n't go on for ever .
andrew h , london uk the tone of the article implies that it is french democracy that is bizarre for at least attempting to ensure that all parties have an opportunity to make their platforms known .
an alternative view would be that allowing more ' popular ' parties more airtime -lrb- as in england -rrb- vastly reduces the chance of smaller parties acquiring the votes that would entitle them to greater coverage next time round .
the game is rigged from the start , and yet this is considered the norm from which the french deviate .
danny millum , london it is a very good thing that all candidates are given the same time on tv .
it means that democracy and debate are still alive and that economics and finance , and tv companies , can not impose their rule completely .
france therefore avoids to quite a large extent horrors such as the pepsi / coke us election system .
the issue is not so much about keeping marxism alive , however relevant that philosophy remains , but to avoid as much as possible that " la chose politique " becomes only a matter of experts and professional politicians , an intoxicating show in which the ordinary citizen would be only a spectator ...
thinking can only be a dynamic process when all possiblities are considered , even those which at the moment seem unreasonable .
that is why i wish that france remains as much as possible the laboratory of ideas it has been since at least the 18th century .
finance only likes ideas which like finance , which are compatible with it and i want to think freely .
as for the british system , i do n't think the british have a relation to politics which could be compared to the one the french have .
the british seem very consensual and traditional and i do n't want a two-party system for france .
eric paul , nice , france france is nothing like as poor as the uk was under wilson and callaghan .
yet talking about singing the marseillaise has some of the same desperation to find a bit of national pride as union jack underpants had in the carnaby street of the sixties .
it is odd that the country that put liberty into its national motto should have such a fear of liberalism - as if it and its multicultural cousin will come and eat them and their way of life .
but until the french realise that the rest of the world does n't owe them a living and they ca n't protect everything french by throwing protectionist money at it from higher and higher taxes , they will continue to suffer from high unemployment and the high taxes that most try to avoid paying .
there is nothing incompatible between a healthy yet well-regulated market economy and the french way of life .
but it does n't take twelve people to plant the season 's flowers on a roundabout !
ben lenthall , cahors , france another excellent analysis by mark ...
pity only that he left out francois bayrou , who tries to introduce a new political style in france .
for me it seems obvious that france has a more lively democratic culture than the uk .
compare this very open election with the passing on of power from blair to brown in the uk .
the absence of a real democratic debate in the uk is quite a shame for a country that likes to paint itself as the stalwart of democratic rule .
ronald gruenebaum , brussels , belgium unfortunately france is not the western european country where you can spot the highest level of support for the jurassic marxist ideology .
when it comes to sound representation in the two chambers of parliament this misfortune is still an italian privilege .
french marxist

the diary is published every thursday .
to always see the latest edition , please click here and bookmark this page .
the man the opinion polls say will be the next president of france has been out and about in the loire valley .
nicolas sarkozy has shaken hands with people restoring a chateau , chatted with youngsters learning hairdressing and made his triumphant way out of a hall in tours packed close with supporters .
he has passionately defended his controversial record .
i love election campaigns and watching politicians in action .
but most people get their politics not in the flesh but from people like me , tv reporters .
and in france for the next couple of weeks they 'll be getting a rather odd picture .
let 's put it this way .
would it make any difference to the result of the next british general election if gordon brown and david cameron were given exactly the same air time as nick griffin of the british national party -lrb- bnp -rrb- or the candidates of the socialist workers party ?
that 's what has to happen in france .
the presidential election has two rounds , and the first vote serves to narrow a large field to a simple two-horse race for the second round .
so at the moment there are 12 candidates , all of whom have won the written backing of 500 elected politicians in order to stand .
segolene royal is battling to consolidate left-wing support here 's the rub .
by law french radio and tv have to give all the candidates the same amount of air time .
all broadcasters know the horrors of stop-watch balance .
many is the time i 've got the message " the editor says can you get the snp in ? "
" well tell him ' yes ' but i 'll need another minute . "
" he 'll give you 45 seconds . "
it may be vital for democracy , but it does n't make for elegant television .
but british law and the bbc 's own guidelines are as nothing compared to the rigour of french law .
to include a short 20-second clip of each candidate a report would be four minutes long without the reporter saying a word of introduction .
so each and every report would have to be at least five minutes long .
the upshot is that of course it does n't happen .
there are special election programmes , but the news deals in opinion polls and generalities .
left-wing rebels but this has one unexpected bonus .
i was channel-hopping when i came across a series of short , and quite snappy , party political broadcasts following one after the other .
you might think this sounds dull viewing , but it is a lot more interesting , and gives you a much better perspective , than something tagged on before or after the news .
the best watch was oliver besancenot , the trotskyite postman .
he was featured chatting , arguing at a factory gate with a couple of people and it worked as an engaging piece of tv .
madame royal was deliberately presidential .
but what came across to me was the scale of the opposition she faces , and i do n't mean mr sarkozy .
le pen stunned france by reaching the runoff in 2002 it used to be a slogan of republicans in france : " no enemies to the left ! "
this is not something segolene is likely to say .
in broadcast after broadcast , the same message was repeated : the threat of globalisation , the trampled rights of workers , the ravages of capitalism and economic liberalism .
this of course is not just the result of a strict broadcasting law .
the left is more fractured and marxism more alive in france than anywhere else in europe .
in britain , there are of course marxist groups , but most people seem to believe that capitalism is the only currently possible economic system and arguments are about redistribution and restrictions within it .
it is such an accepted belief that it feels rather odd writing it down .
but in france that is not so .
this has a very real effect on this election .
the practical effect of a vote for the communist party , the revolutionary communist league , the alternative globalisation party , workers struggle or the workers party is to take a vote away from ms royal .
i am not trying to undermine the glorious unpredictability of democracy .
of course workers struggle could leap from the 6 % it got last time to victory .
but do n't hold your breath ..
what many on the left fear is a repeat of 2002 , when the smaller parties leeched support from lionel jospin to allow far-right leader jean-marie le pen through to the second round .
of course , mr sarkozy faces a similar threat from smaller parities of the right , but his real problem is with the other two realistic contenders - le pen and francois bayrou .
campaign contrasts in the packed hall in tours , sarkozy 's passionate discourse on immigration and integration gets them stamping their feet .
i 'm sitting on the steps of a temporary stand next to a woman in her mid-twenties .
as sarkozy came to one climactic point of his argument the twenty-something woman next to me exclaimed " voila ! " - as if he was providing the clinching point that had eluded her in past arguments with friends .
throughout his speech she had been muttering " c 'est vrai , c 'est vrai " -lrb- true , true ! -rrb- .
a few seats away a smart woman , her grey hair cut elegantly short , smartly punched the air and waved a poster , almost in imitation of political activists she had seen on tv .
i did n't get the feeling it was something she did very often .
i have been to three segolene royal rallies and there is a palpable difference .
the socialist party supporters are happy to back someone who could win , who shares at least some of their values .
here it is the man himself they are backing .
outside i talk to a woman who says she lived in london for a long while .
she wants sarkozy as her president , but wants to justify her choice .
" in america i would not be a republican , " she tells me , continuing : " he and tony blair are -lrb- she pressed her palms together -rrb- are they not ? "
certainly in the hall i did n't hear a single idea that would be shockingly out of place in a labour manifesto , i did n't hear anything that could not have come from the lips of john reid or david blunkett .
on second thoughts , i 'm not sure i can imagine them singing the marseillaise .
my new friend says she remembers " when your country was poor , " adding that french socialists are like the labour party of those days .
but the labour party in those days did n't have french tv guidelines giving marxist factions valuable air time .
please use the post form below to comment on any of the issues raised in the diary .
in my part of la france profonde , my neighbours will vote for anyone who promises to get the stifling beaurocracy off their backs and let them earn a living .
unfortunately , they do n't see anyone among the candidates able or willing to do so , so their vote will be cast for one of the usual suspects - a career politician wary of upsetting any of the ' social partners ' - and only appearances will change in france after the presidential election. doris ward , argenton chateau france having lived in france for the last 2 years i really enjoy the different appraoch the french have to politics .
people are very open with their opinions and really enjoy the fight. it is a great change from the ' soundbite ' contect over the channel .
however no-one seems to really want to rock the boat and unfortunately in our global world this boat is heading for reefs .
james hodson , montgenevre , france i wish the bbc was more aware that international opinion can have an effect on national choice of politics .
a quick analysis of all the political candidates agenda -reveals that sarkozy is only interested in becoming president and nothing more -lrb- social change takes years unless it comes from a police state -rrb- and royal is the only real opposition to sarkozy .
favourite candidates are bové -lrb- sustainability -rrb- and voynet -lrb- green -rrb- although french friends holding votes agree they will vote royal to ensure the safety of their fellow citizens -lrb- citizen in the sense people who live here -rrb- .
penelope , paris those who compare jean-marie le pen 's movement to the bnp and brand him " far-right " or an " extremist " prove that they have no understanding of what is happening in france today .
le pen will get more than 20 % of the votes and will be in the second round .
do n't forget that he has consistently improved his scores in the presidential elections and ended up with 17 % last time .
also his electorate is the most loyal of all with over 80 % faithfuls .
add that mégret and the populist party have joined forces with him , that 's another good 2 % .
i vote josé bové so i believe my comments are unbiased .
gaston favresse , london as a french citizen living in sweden , i shall next sunday vote for the only leader possible.jean marie le pen .
france and the rest of europe need a wake up call .
the left and the right are the same .
the time hascomefor a massive rebellion against muslim immigration , and the dictators in bruxelles .
i rather votefor a party that says clearly what it thinks than the hypocritical lefties or rightists. c.simon , sweden i 'm a french citizen born in mauritius .
well it 's incredible to see how polls can direct people views in two directions - mrs royal and mr sarkosy .
what about the others ?
what is the the margin of error of these polls 5 % - 10 % or 0 % as they wish us to beleive ? ? ?
if so probably again we 'll see another 2002 when no poll institute gave the right predictions .
published polls which do not give their margin of error are rubish when they give a winner by a 2 % margin .
bhageerutty kishore , bourg en bresse , france we droped equal airtime rules in the states back in the 90 's and to be honest third parties have done at least as well or better since then .
nick michelewicz , keene , new hampshire , usa the socialists are the biggest threat to this country as they have an actual chance of being elected in the second round .
how ségolène can justify her ridiculous program is beyond me , case in point : increasing minimum wage to 1.500 ? a month ... how ? with good will and a rose !
as the median -lrb- not average ! -rrb- salary hovers between 1250 and 1400 i wonder how on earth she will be able to find 200 extra euros a month for the majority of french workers , it does n't make sense , she peddles populist ideals and her campaign is focused on the criticising of the right .
she has no authority , no economic sense and is the epitome of the gauche caviar .
why does it have to be so bad to earn money and make a good living , somehow it is inextricably linked to the french instilled catholic morals , that despite the laïcité of the state , continues to permeate society .
in france the less you talk about money and the poorer and more charitable you portray yourself the better you are .
henrik nordling , paris , france to those of you that likes our " same time for everyone policy " never heard or seen the people begging for or votes .
they are away from reality , because they do n't have a chance to win .
they always say the same damn speech , because they do n't have any other idea ... ideas from one century ago , ideas that were proven to be big mistakes ...
they 're not even funny .
when i was a kid , mother told me maggie was evil .
today , i think we really would need someone like her , someone that would not stop when two or three demonstrator would show up ... just to move on one day .
nick , paris , france i have lived here 4 years .
i have a multi ethnic group of friends .
they are basically afraid of sarkozy .
this is man who stands on tiptoes when he is photographed .
who wants to stop immigration , who calls poor people scum .
he is openly hunting votes from the national front .
he has immense energy when he talks , and power of conviction , and perhaps is too excitable , making some comment he might already be going crazy .
by contrast the problem is royale is so serene she is turning into a non-entity , she does n't seem to want it badly enough and she is not leading at all but telling the french a load of policies but nothing about how it will happen .
this is her big error , if she ranted about the state of the country and showed people what she willing to do to fix it she would walk this election .
she smiles and talks in droning voice almost like a ' stepford mum ' .
bayrou looks like he will win through because of fear of one and apathy for the other .
those english or other nationalites touting sarko would do well to be very attentive to what he says .
this is a man who admires bush us middle eastern policy , it is a man many fear could be the new french emperor .
europe is not his cup of tea. collie , nice as a young british person working in france i would say one of the biggest problems here is the lack of trust the older generation have in the young .
people here think it 's strange that a 21-year old should have completed university and be working full time as in britain , and the baby-boom generation just seems to be sitting on all the wealth and positions of responsibility without opening up to the young .
often all twenty-somethings can do is spend years at university or doing poorly paid " stages " -lrb- work placements -rrb- rather than being encouraged to start contributing to the economy .
henry rich , paris , france france is probably fine for all the middle-aged people living in it that benefited from lots of perks handed out when the economy was doing fine and employment was high during the 30 glorieuses .
to answer those that say france is doing fine , i will say that it is for those people !
but it certainly is not for young people who have to beg for jobs , get paid nothing , have no perks , have high real estate prices and live at home .
i am living in the us , and as a young person , i am doing very well for myself .
everyday young people leave france just like me -lrb- 300,000 just in london alone -rrb- .
france seriously needs to think to liberalize its economy , so that more jobs can be created . until then , the brain drain and the lack of investments will continue .
after all , who wants to put their money in a place where the government takes most of it .
peter , washington dc despite all the claims about " égalité , fraternité et liberté " , france is still a monarchy , but with an all-powerful president as head of state instead of a powerless king or queen -lrb- as in britain and the netherlands -rrb- .
the country is ruled accordingly and hence nothing changes .
everything in the name of " la gloire " and nothing in the name of progress .
pity .
albert , amsterdam sarkozy would like to apply for liberalism but can not even pronounce the word .
the ps : officially the hymn is still " the international " and capitalism is not an accepted system -lrb- i predict ps will split up -rrb- .
labor party is assimilated with far right .
most of young people want to become " fonctionnaire " very few chance i come back to this funny country expect of course for holidays or retirement .
didier lebon , french expat - bruxelles french people are capable of the best and the worst beleive me !
with us , you have to expect the unexpected .
that is , one week only before the first round , i have still hope / faith that the majority of the people will hear the two speeches of sarkozy and royal and realise , in all honesty , that the first one has very dangerous ideas and the second is our only hope .
but even on the best case sceanario of segolene , being elected , she better keeps her promises , otherwise some very hard time is awaiting france , let me tell you - i shoud know , i am french myself .
the task is not going to be easy .
vanina st martin , edinburgh , scotland i think those that are denigrating this relative stability in british and american politics are missing the whole point of this article .
what is being argued -lrb- and quite correctly , i may add -rrb- is in fact that british and american politics is less colourful than french politics because of this airtime regulation - but that their political systems are better off in terms of stability and effectiveness because of this .
the gentleman who brought up italian politics brings a great point .
if it 's ' colour ' you 're after , italy is even ' better ' than france .
but just as the french system finally pales relative to the anglo-saxon ones in terms of providing results to its people , does this mean that you would trade your french system for an even less effective but more colourful one in italy -lrb- or india -rrb- ?
if so , i 'm sure there are a lot of italians and indians who would jump at that offer .
h. juneja , london , uk france may be experiencing difficulty economically and with immigration , but as a nation it should be admired for doing two things : following its own path , and being open to a real political spectrum .
one thing notably lacking amongst these commments is a sense of shared history between francophones and anglophones - canada is predicted to sky rocket to over 50 million citizens by 2040 , easily rivalling france and the uk in population ... we have the great benefit of both nations ' political and social heritage and it has done us very well .
british stoicism and french joi-de-vivre make for a vigorous and lively culture , and it should not be forgotten that whether the tories win the next election in the uk or sarkozy does win in france , the essence of their cultures wo n't change and the politicians ultimately will have to be true to the average citizen 's concept of their nation .
the us aside , doomsday scenarios just are n't realistic in the modern europe .
nathan jenkins , london , canada the only advice i can give the french people is ... do n't try to emulate britain .
if i had the means , i would have moved to france 20 years ago .
alex maricic , fife , scotland what the french want is someone who is not afraid to take on the criminals who , in the last 30 years , have turned safe and pleasant french " banlieues " into territories occupied by work-shy , integrists , anti-french delinquents issued from uncontrolled immigration .
jean-luc royer , england what amazes me is that the candidates are allowed to get away with so much .
the french tv journalists are so subservient .
what is needed is for each candidate to be given a good paxman-style grilling and then a live debate amonst themselves with a strong chairman .
john ette , le pradet , france being an american studying and working in france , i find the presidential election very interesting .
i am not sure who will win but , either way politics and democracy is alive and kicking in france and i hope it will always stay that way .
i would love it if in the usa we could have more than just two choices and two parties for our presidential elections coming up next year .
my french friends are very open about their views on the canidates and we love discussing our different perspectives of each canidate and speculating on how they would change france .
i find that the journalist of this article has n't given serious thought or consideration to the way of life and history of the french people and their political system .
having lived here for almost 2 years i was a bit offended by the tone of his article and i am not even french .
i wish the best for france and hope that no matter who wins they will do the best they can for their country and its citizens .
erin , lille , france as all the real power now rests in brussels and strasbourg maybe it ? s time for eu citizens to stop paying attention , as so many have already done , to local national elections and concentrate on how they are being represented within european institutions .
where it seems democracy plays second fiddle to bureaucracy i propose that national election candidates receive zero free air time as a first step towards shifting our attention .
a change that would be simultaneously cost effective , popular and egalitarian. mike sell , founex , switzerland i am a french citizen , living in malaysia and expect to vote in the april presidential elections .
i love my country and believe most french people are very lucky to have been born french even though , like everywhere else things could be much improved .
i am also one of the apparently unprecedented large number of undecided voters .
to put it more more simply , i find it hard to decide which of the candidates is the least unpalatable .
mitterrand , de gaulle , pompidou , giscard d 'estaing had stature , a rationally thought out political programme and a coherent vision of what france should be , whether you agreed with them or not .
this lot -lrb- royal , sarkozy , bayrou , le pen et al -rrb- are a bunch of undistinguished politicians scrambling for power .
pauvre france !
i 'll still vote because i believe it is a duty -lrb- hard won over the centuries -rrb- but without any conviction .
christine sathiah , penang , malaysia i have to say i enjoy reading rich english people living in limousin / aquitaine / languedoc-roussillon complaining about the french welfare system in happy oblivion of the rest of france , which would be destroyed in the way so many northern , scottish and welsh towns were by unrestricted thatcherism in the 1980s .
certainly , france needs economic reform if it is to go forward from where it is now , but the sort of ruthless cutthroat politics that sarkozy is advocating is frightening for people in the north of france , where the collapse of industry is still felt very strongly , and where a " tough " immigration policy would create tensions that do n't need to be exacerbated .
mark brown , lens , france i think france 's " equal time " standard , while perhaps cumbersome from a tv producer 's standpoint , is far superior to the system in the us where presidential candidates are given large endowments of public money to produce 30 second tv commercials .
the result is an enormously inefficent use of public and private resources to fund essentially smear campaigns where issue-oriented discussion is practically non-existent .
however , this would probably upset the us media lobby , so do n't expect change any time soon .
mike taylor , ann arbor , michigan usa have lived in both countries and in france presently .
sorry to disappoint everyone but there is no ideal political system wheather from the states , great britain or france and i agree with the negative points concerning the us + gb .
however the particularity of france is that the french people have been living with the myth of the " 30 glorieuses " -lrb- the best 30 economic years after ww2 -rrb- and kept to believe that it could continue for another 30 . and there is now a huge gap between the state paid employees -lrb- in the energy , and transport big dept -rrb- who enjoy work security and numerous privileges and the rest : self-employed , low payed workers from small firms , shopkeepers . who do not enjoy eany goodies and have to pay their electricity and gas and telephone bills full rate -lrb- unlike employees of edf -lrb- for electricty -rrb- or france telecom ... -rrb- i would like to know if employees from the different electricity co. in gb or us pay their electricity at reduced rate ?
sometimes you feel ! in france you are in a republic with some old fashion aristocratic / monarchist remaining that everyone moans about but not one politician dares talking about let alone question its democratic values ...
to finish france will always be a great country of contradictions where poeple love laws which loks perfect on paper but impossible to apply in real . i just hope that this time french people will refuse to be kept in the dark or above the clouds of the real economic situation -lrb- one of the highest european debt , a shrinking pension system . -rrb- and that we have to accept and adapt to this new globalisation of everything -lrb- from economy to terrorism -rrb- and think hard and suggest a real alternative ...
elisabeth , france + england i 've lived all over europe and for the last five years in paris and much as i love the city , country , culture , way of life etc .
i have to honestly say that i 've never been worse off financially .
i would probably qualify for housing benefit and several other subsidies but i 'm restricted from earning overtime .
it is a crazy situation .
if i was american i 'd vote democrat and have always considered myself centre-left but in france sarkozy is seen as extreme and if that 's the case , well i 'm extreme too. john healy , paris , france the issue of air time in the media is undermined by the way the media portait a candidate in news pieces .
for example , n sarkozy will win debates after debates but the media in france will mention his name every time there are riots for whatever reasons .
also , royal was shown as the messiah until she messed it up herself .
suddenly bayrou turns up and the media almost openly present him as the ' if you do n't want sarkozy in , vote for this no-mark ' .
basically the media -lrb- most of which has leftist ideals -rrb- do n't want sarkozy in and will do whatever they can to sink him .
shameful but so typical of the french elite -lrb- media and politics -rrb- which has put the country in this situation in the first place .
nick , london le pen 's score last time was not the fault of the minor candidates !
the first turn was won by the " leave me alone i 'm on holiday " party ; in fact the level of abstentionwas higher than the score of any candidate !
judy wood , lyon , france france desperately needs economic reform and the successful integration of immigrants into french society .
sarkozy may be able to deliver on the former but will fail miserably on the latter .
his record as interior minister is shocking in this respect and his potential election may only highten the tensions between les banlieues and the police .
royal would keep france economically uncompetitive for the duration of her presidential term and her foreign policy gaffes so far do not inspire confidence .
sarkozy will easily win the first round with royal trailing in second , but sarkozy is a polarising figure and i would not be surprised to see segolene becoming president .
ben lonsdale , manchester i am no prophet , but i forecast there will be no one from the left in the runoff .
sarkozy and le pen will eventually be the final contenders .
why ?
because french do not confess they are voting for le pen in opinion polls .
because the old far right leader has not been campaigning himself , letting his daughter marine le pen on the front line .
and she succeeded in giving a softer image of her father .
because he has criticised recent measures against smokers and speed checks and such type of demagogic speech is very popular with french .
because nothing has really changed since 21st of april 2002 but there has been the riots at the end of 2005 and the ones in gare du nord end of march 2007 and this is fuelling the protesting votes in favour of le pen .
there will be a new shock on the 22nd of april 2007 when le pen is placed in the final race .
i am no prophet , but sarkozy will be the next french president .
and what about royal in all this ?
pardon me ...
who did you say ?
antoine de champs , tours , france olivier besancenot sounds like a man who knows what he is talking about ... rightly condemning the appalling neo-liberal capitalism that has festered under both the right and the so-called left in france for far too long .
it is the unmitigated disater of the capitalist system that has created the massive unemployment and alienation , discrimination , and injustice throughout france on a vast scale.how refreshing then to hear someone putting forward a real alternative to the much hated neo-liberal capitalist nightmare of more disatrous privatisation plans for big business , which both sarkozy and royal defend .
how refreshing then to hear someone condemn the violence and discrimination of the french police .
how refreshing to hear someone defend public services and public sector workers , the right to a stable and decent job and present ideas about creating a genuine socialist alternative to capitalism .
another world is possible and another france is necessary .
segolene royal seems to be presenting the same old failed blairite right wing ideas.think again !
p.black , uk i think a new generation of politicians is now there for france , but i 'm not sure , the coming president will be accepted by the whole population .
i 'm a wee bit anxious for france 's future .
f.roux , bourges , france , you are wrong to underestimate the importance of francois bayrou and only to focus on the main both political parities : the right and the left nicolas , paris , france i 've lived in france for many years , and run a business with my husband .
yes - france has a wonderful way of life , a health system second to none , but economically , france is on its knees .
the loony left - more like an extreme version of michael foot 's socialist vision - is desperate to protect the social benefits which have been acquired over 30 years and which cripple the economy .
socialist politicians declare proudly that they do not own shares , a nasty right-wing habit of investing in industry .
madame royal claims to speak for the lowly-paid while benefiting from her salaries and perks .
in the meantime , my husband and i pay away 60 % of our earnings to support a lumbering state with its 6 million civil servants .
good luck to sarko , he 's the best of a mediocre bunch , the only one who might just bring a little egalité to france .
madeleine dickson , limoges , france an item that should be more prominent on the election agenda on both sides of politics is what should be done about the future of the world 's largest nickel deposit , new caledonia .
the country is at boiling point from a mining perspective and some leadership from france is much neeeded , after all it is her duty to do so .
sebastien carpin , brisbane , australia i agree that equal airtime for all of the candidates is a strength of the french system , but referring to the disparaging of the american electoral system as coca-cola v pepsi : in 2002 , did n't it eventually come down to le pen or chirac ?
far-right vs right ... how 's that for choice ?
khalil , boston , ma , usa i am a french citizen and have lived in the usa since the age of 8 .
i often hear many negative comments about france and europe .
i believe that these comments are born of jealousy .
while france may have its problems as everyone does i find the french approach and thought process refreshing and full of life .
i believe in the french process and have every confidence that france will prosper and the french will continue to preserve their language , culture and unique way of life in an increasing dull anglo-american world of politically correct " grey zone " .
how nice to know that there is still a country that has not sold out .
in the us , where everything including values and principles is for sale , i find it to be stale and the people in part uninterested and unmotivated beyond reaching for the next burger or bag of junk food to put a few more kilos on their already large frame , to put it nicely .
france has and will continue to be a society of free thinkers who are not afraid to voice their thoughts .
vive la france ! ! !
arthur brown , lb usa the french left needs to unite and fight for a radical redistribution of wealth and the urgent transformation of the deeply corrupt capitalist system to a socially just , participative and profoundly democratic , co-operative green socialist society based on the sustainable common ownership of the means of production .
this is an alternative as global capitalism runs amok , wreaking havoc and global climate chaos in its wake .
capitalism is doomed !
another france is possible and highly necessary .
patrick black , uk i am a sixth-form student and as i am talking about le pen in my oral exam the french elections are naturally very interesting to me .
i do n't think le pen will win -lrb- and , after extensive research the vast number of anti-semitic comments he has made over the years , i sincerely hope he wo n't win as well -rrb- but i am not convinced by either sarkozy or royal .
sarkozy seems very underhand , a man who you would imagine to be right-handed but to keep his wallet in his left-hand pocket ; royal should not be let anywhere near a microphone when it comes to foreign policy .
i do n't know much about bayrou , but i would not be appalled if he won - he appears to be the best of a bad bunch .
chris stanley , stroud , england much like american political races , advertising a politician is a political party 's biggest concern .
the bnp and ump have marketed their candidates to match the sentiment and feeling of their constituents , ms. royal feels scripted , however has an uncanny ability to improvise her responses to well thought-out questions from the press .
sarkozy swears to carry out his party 's goals but incorporates his own ideas .
however he is sheepishly stubborn towards alternative methods of carrying out policies .
i think many voters will vote based on their feelings towards each candidate and not on what policies would be best for the country .
finn raftery , seattle , united states in principle , it 's democratic to provide the same air time for all politicians who manage to get 500 mayor 's signatures in order to run for presidency .
unfortunately , the result is the exact opposite .
those who only want to rant , and have no political platform because they know that they will never be elected , feel free to lobotomize political discourse in france .
the result has been 25 years of meaningless hypocrisy .
hardly anything said has any relation to reality and as a result , very little if anything is done to address the real issues .
worse , the extremism of so many statements , along with the infamous " acquis sociaux " , on which no one will give an inch , lull people into hating work , which is , of course , " a form of oppression " of the " monstrous capitalist exploiters " .
ho hum .
and worse still , if and when sarkozy wins , the undemocratic left will not accept the result of the democratic process .
any reform will be met by attempts to totally block france by massive protest movements .
pity .
douglas mccarthy , paris , france picking up from what richard tomlinson wrote , as a british citizen living in france why will i lose my right to vote in the uk national elections when i complete my fifteenth year abroad ?
that is truly losing one 's vote , in our so-called eu of equals .
john ward , metz , france the problem in france is that french society in recent years has been turned upside down and they do not know what to do about it .
france has seen a rapid rise in immigration , unemployment and violence .
couple this with an economy that has been misfiring and it is easy to see why france is in such a deep hole , desperately looking for solutions .
it may hurt french pride , but modelling itself on great britain and taking the best of what the british have done , whilst keeping the best of french could really sort out modern france .
take immigration - why can the french not embrace multiculturalism as the british have ?
what about the economy - the british do n't seem that worried about globalisation , so why are we ? ..
the british have barely any marxists , simply because there is no place for them .
in france they offer a solution to a problem , britain has no problem -lrb- relatively -rrb- and therefore no heavy solutions need offering .
france needs to think seriously , politicians need to step back , be brave and say things that actually the french may not want to hear .
unfortunately , owing to this election , that is not going to happen , and france is not going to get any better .
frederic lacroix , paris , francais eric paul - you seem to fundamentally misunderstand american political campaigns and related us legislation .
section 315 of the us communications act details the equal time rule regulating us political campaigns .
it and subsequent amendments are very well crafted and might inform you more completely .
i do think that france 's strict equal air time rule is to be admired and is something modern democracies should strive for ; as some already do , though perhaps not in such an austere manner .
n. campbell , new orleans , usa personally i feel sorry for the french .
there is no-one worthy of the presidency today .
the choice is awful , but what must be understood is that the first round is the real choice and public opinion , the second is a knock-out to get rid of the worst candidate .
maybe they should really start thinking about voting for and not against .
be warned they are heading for thatcherism if they vote sarkozy , and we british all know what that did !
we are still paying .
i live , but sadly do n't vote , in france and have done for 15 years , this is my 3rd election .
v.miller , nancy , france the role of president urgently needs reforming -lrb- as does the whole constitution -rrb- , as no one is very sure about which role -lrb- s -rrb- he has , especially if confronted with an opposition parliament .
these elections have been the most exciting in decades , yet i do believe that none of the candidates will take the necessary stance to reform the institutions .
i also fear that due to the huge division of france into pro- and anti-sarkozy , we might very possibly end up with a cohabitation for the next five years .
the most striking aspect of this campaign is the increasing role of the media , especially television .
the majority of the french electorate will not seek information about the candidates but will expect it to come to them , mainly through television and radio -lrb- still a very popular medium , especially the morning and afternoon news -rrb- .
in such a system , the most able orators and communicators have a clear advantage .
unfortunately , these happen to be mm sarkozy and le pen .
quentin liger , london , uk well , the french system may have the advantage that we look at the candidates ' ideas and not only at how much cash they raise for their campaign .
living in the us , i came to realize that no matter what you believe in , money is the only driving force toward a warm seat at the white house .
emmanuel gilles , bronx , usa from the popularity of sarkozy , i 'd say any leanings toward marxism here are fleeing in the face of growing economic and globalization problems .
he 's a scary guy , sarko , the way he reaches for the far-right votes and disarms his critics by saying , " is it wrong to talk about national identity ?
is that a bad word ? "
because of course they ca n't say that without alienating a lot of french people !
many of my french friends here agree that the election is pitiful .
there is no one offering any real solutions to the problems threatening this country .
but it would be nice to hear more about bayrou .
he 's the most sensible by far , and the only one really trying to address the issues of immigration and discrimination .
maria alexander , aix-en-provence , france i 've had enough of this france-bashing : it is still one of the best countries to live , and i would n't even think of moving to the rainy , crowded country ruled by the nhs-dicta .
here , life is good and relaxed , the best education and health system , i pay only a little bit more than what i used to pay in the us as taxes .
the political life has not been anaesthetized like it has been in anglo-saxon countries - and we all know where that leads us : bush , born-again christians , evolution-revisionists and co .
funny that some of the french-bashing is coming from expats in france .
if it is so bad , what are you guys doing here ? : -rrb- france has a lot of problems , sure , but it is still " better " than the rest - nothing is ever perfect ..
baris tarim , caen , france one must recognise the plethora of choices available to french voters .
charles de gaulle said there are as many ideas in france as there are cheeses .
this is perfectly represented in this election with for example le pen 's far right and laguiller 's far left .
i think these extremist ideals reveal a great deal about the sense of upheaval in french society and shows how fragmented a society it is .
the unemployment , lack of economic growth , immigration are all thorny issues which are as divisive as they are polemic and the longer these particular problems last , the more it adds to le pen 's following .
as for le pen , he will always get that 10 % -15 % he consistently gets in elections because of how determined his supporters are .
his recent success though is down to a series of socio-economic problems which a series of governments , both right-wing and left-wing , have failed to solve .
cormac mac gabhann , dublin , ireland having lived in france for some time , it strikes me that its system of high job protection and generous social benefits serves only to ensure that the underprivileged few are condemned live with few prospects , a life spent literally on the margins : on the council estates bordering the big cities , dependant on the state .
no surprise that the signs of social fracture and growing dissatisfaction are plain to see .
so much for equality , freedom and brotherhood !
i do n't like sarkozy much as a person , but he seems to be the only candidate willing to undertake the drastic liberalisation that france so desperately needs .
dominic higgins , london , england eu citizens are entitled to vote in eu elections , local council and industrial tribunal elections , so richard tomlinson 's complaint is not fully accurate .
there is always the option of acquiring french nationality for the other elections .
i have done so and this is one of the reasons why .
david buick , rennes , france to mr tomlinson : as an eu citizen and permanent resident in an eu country other than your own , you are allowed to vote -lrb- and stand -rrb- in local elections : that includes city council , county council and " region " council elections .
then , just as i was not allowed to vote in the general election when i lived in the uk , you are not allowed to vote in the presidential election in france .
julien randon-furling , paris , france in my extended conversations with french citizens from all walks of life , it surprises me that most are not too far apart on issues like immigration and globalization .
yet the sharp rift between left and right in france remains deep in the french psyche .
it reaches down to a visceral level that defies logic and plays into the political strategies of career politicians .
is it possible for france to keep democracy but ditch its self-seeking party system ?
donald williams , springfield , massachusetts , usa i think it 's great that you have so many choices in france and that there is a law enforcing equal time to all .
your system makes me jealous as an american .
we are forced to choose between only two candidates who are in fact almost identical anyway .
all other parties or independents are refused any time by the media .
mark ellis , york , usa your article lacks the respect that we deserve .
you dismiss us without really looking at who we are and what we do .
the french communist party , of which i am a member , has 130,000 members and 13,000 persons that hold public offices .
your own liberal party has far fewer members .
who are you to dismiss the views of the citizens in any of these parties ?
i should remind you that many dismissed the views of democrats in the early 18th century , yet europe was transformed .
you seem to believe marxists have no place in politics today .
i , on the other hand , find your clinging to a monarchy outdated and a drain on your state 's finances .
i suppose you have the right to maintain a royal family .
i would prefer to maintain our low rate of child poverty and fight for a socialist state .
russell yates , meaux , france i am following my first election as a french resident , though not voter , and agree that the short presentations by each contender each day are very snappy and engaging .
saying something different each time holds the interest too .
the galloping music that opens each space is also attention-grabbing .
trouble is , they all sound so sincere and seem so nice !
what is important , i think , is that yes they are reading prepared material , not reacting to questions , but at least they get to finish what they have to say without being constantly interrupted .
-lrb- so many presenters take so long introducing their guest that the guest with a fascinating point to make often barely says hello before the time slot is over . -rrb-
especially in the morning , i think a straight , uninterrupted performance is more attractive than voices shouting all at once and seeing all the candidates does help sort who is who and what they stand for .
how often have you gone to vote without any idea of the face behind the name on the ballot paper ?
angela sheard , romans-sur-isère , france .
i have n't seen any evidence that a single candidate is facing up to the french budget deficit .
the whole country is living on the never-never , and that ca n't go on for ever .
andrew h , london uk the tone of the article implies that it is french democracy that is bizarre for at least attempting to ensure that all parties have an opportunity to make their platforms known .
an alternative view would be that allowing more ' popular ' parties more airtime -lrb- as in england -rrb- vastly reduces the chance of smaller parties acquiring the votes that would entitle them to greater coverage next time round .
the game is rigged from the start , and yet this is considered the norm from which the french deviate .
danny millum , london it is a very good thing that all candidates are given the same time on tv .
it means that democracy and debate are still alive and that economics and finance , and tv companies , can not impose their rule completely .
france therefore avoids to quite a large extent horrors such as the pepsi / coke us election system .
the issue is not so much about keeping marxism alive , however relevant that philosophy remains , but to avoid as much as possible that " la chose politique " becomes only a matter of experts and professional politicians , an intoxicating show in which the ordinary citizen would be only a spectator ...
thinking can only be a dynamic process when all possiblities are considered , even those which at the moment seem unreasonable .
that is why i wish that france remains as much as possible the laboratory of ideas it has been since at least the 18th century .
finance only likes ideas which like finance , which are compatible with it and i want to think freely .
as for the british system , i do n't think the british have a relation to politics which could be compared to the one the french have .
the british seem very consensual and traditional and i do n't want a two-party system for france .
eric paul , nice , france france is nothing like as poor as the uk was under wilson and callaghan .
yet talking about singing the marseillaise has some of the same desperation to find a bit of national pride as union jack underpants had in the carnaby street of the sixties .
it is odd that the country that put liberty into its national motto should have such a fear of liberalism - as if it and its multicultural cousin will come and eat them and their way of life .
but until the french realise that the rest of the world does n't owe them a living and they ca n't protect everything french by throwing protectionist money at it from higher and higher taxes , they will continue to suffer from high unemployment and the high taxes that most try to avoid paying .
there is nothing incompatible between a healthy yet well-regulated market economy and the french way of life .
but it does n't take twelve people to plant the season 's flowers on a roundabout !
ben lenthall , cahors , france another excellent analysis by mark ...
pity only that he left out francois bayrou , who tries to introduce a new political style in france .
for me it seems obvious that france has a more lively democratic culture than the uk .
compare this very open election with the passing on of power from blair to brown in the uk .
the absence of a real democratic debate in the uk is quite a shame for a country that likes to paint itself as the stalwart of democratic rule .
ronald gruenebaum , brussels , belgium unfortunately france is not the western european country where you can spot the highest level of support for the jurassic marxist ideology .
when it comes to sound representation in the two chambers of parliament this misfortune is still an italian privilege .
french marxists are a sideshow with no real power , fragmented maybe colourful.the real black spot in france is the far right - as jurassic and out of date as the marxists in italy but for france misfortune , still with some real power .
enrico ferrero , hellerup , denmark whether the french vote right or left , a man or woman , the french policy of neocolonialism and active support for unpopular puppets in africa shall continue relentlessly .
mofor tangmo edward , cameroon i think mr mardell has unknowingly or wittingly left out the factor that underlies french politics at present , fear ; unemployment , violent behaviour , poverty , institutions that no longer are able to respond to the concerns of the majority ...
paul hubball , france i am an eu citizen , am a permanent resident in france , pay my taxes here , but am not allowed to vote in the elections .
how can it be legal under eu law that we -lrb- and we are many -rrb- are excluded from the democratic process ?
richard tomlinson , mandelieu , france i am a french citizen , and , within the forseeable future , a permanent resident and taxpayer in the uk !
i cherish my right and duty to vote , and will be voting for the french president on sunday and have been frustrated at not being able to vote at important uk elections in the uk , especially when i see so many uk citizens not exercising their right to vote ! -lrb- it cost many people their lives or their freedom to ask for the right to vote , in some countries there still is no right to vote , yet , nowadays , both in the uk and in france , so many people ca n't be bothered ! ! ! -rrb-
but , i have lived here long enough now to apply for british citizenship -lrb- and am married to a british citizen -rrb- .
thankfully , now , i do not have to renounce my french nationality to do that !
-lrb- you used to be able to be only french , nothing else , or else renounce the french nationality -rrb- so , i will apply for british citizenship , it costs £ 268 , and takes up to 8 months to process , but at least i will be able to vote on uk issues and for the uk government !
richard t , perhaps you could investigate whether there is a similar possibility for you to gain these rights in france ?
helgaflower , cheltenham , uk to reply to richard tomlinson , i am a permanent resident in the uk , paying my taxes here , have been living here for 6 years now , and not allowed to vote here in the elections , because i am not a british citizen .
so england is not that much different in that case .
but i have always been a person who adored france , the culture , the country .
i have never lived there , but i am aware that burocracy makes it difficult sometimes , but with so many english people moving there , it ca n't be that bad , can it ?
they should stop complaining about it , or move back here if it 's so problematic over there .
em , manchester to richard tomlinson : under eu law an eu citizen legally resident in another member state can vote and stand in the the local and european elections , therefore you can do that in france -lrb- i 've done it in belgium -rrb- .
however , no eu member state allows non-citizens to vote in parliamentary or presidential elections , so nothing special about france there .
your anger should be directed at the british government because it is uk law which takes away your right to vote in the uk after 15 years outside of the country , something that many other european countries do not do .
it is undemocratic , but it 's got nothing to do with the eu .
rebecca , brussels to mr tomlinson , you can vote for local election in france like most of the european countries .
if you want to vote you can ask for the french citizenship thierry le romancer , paris france name your e-mail address town & country comments the bbc may edit your comments and not all emails will be published .

nicolas sarkozy has shaken hands with people restoring a chateau , chatted with youngsters learning hairdressing and made his triumphant way out of a hall in tours packed close with supporters .
he has passionately defended his controversial record .
i love election campaigns and watching politicians in action .
but most people get their politics not in the flesh but from people like me , tv reporters .
and in france for the next couple of weeks they 'll be getting a rather odd picture .
let 's put it this way .
would it make any difference to the result of the next british general election if gordon brown and david cameron were given exactly the same air time as nick griffin of the british national party -lrb- bnp -rrb- or the candidates of the socialist workers party ?
that 's what has to happen in france .
the presidential election has two rounds , and the first vote serves to narrow a large field to a simple two-horse race for the second round .
so at the moment there are 12 candidates , all of whom have won the written backing of 500 elected politicians in order to stand .
segolene royal is battling to consolidate left-wing support here 's the rub .
by law french radio and tv have to give all the candidates the same amount of air time .
all broadcasters know the horrors of stop-watch balance .
many is the time i 've got the message " the editor says can you get the snp in ? "
" well tell him ' yes ' but i 'll need another minute . "
" he 'll give you 45 seconds . "
it may be vital for democracy , but it does n't make for elegant television .
but british law and the bbc 's own guidelines are as nothing compared to the rigour of french law .
to include a short 20-second clip of each candidate a report would be four minutes long without the reporter saying a word of introduction .
so each and every report would have to be at least five minutes long .
the upshot is that of course it does n't happen .
there are special election programmes , but the news deals in opinion polls and generalities .
left-wing rebels but this has one unexpected bonus .
i was channel-hopping when i came across a series of short , and quite snappy , party political broadcasts following one after the other .
you might think this sounds dull viewing , but it is a lot more interesting , and gives you a much better perspective , than something tagged on before or after the news .
the best watch was oliver besancenot , the trotskyite postman .
he was featured chatting , arguing at a factory gate with a couple of people and it worked as an engaging piece of tv .
madame royal was deliberately presidential .
but what came across to me was the scale of the opposition she faces , and i do n't mean mr sarkozy .
le pen stunned france by reaching the runoff in 2002 it used to be a slogan of republicans in france : " no enemies to the left ! "
this is not something segolene is likely to say .
in broadcast after broadcast , the same message was repeated : the threat of globalisation , the trampled rights of workers , the ravages of capitalism and economic liberalism .
this of course is not just the result of a strict broadcasting law .
the left is more fractured and marxism more alive in france than anywhere else in europe .
in britain , there are of course marxist groups , but most people seem to believe that capitalism is the only currently possible economic system and arguments are about redistribution and restrictions within it .
it is such an accepted belief that it feels rather odd writing it down .
but in france that is not so .
this has a very real effect on this election .
the practical effect of a vote for the communist party , the revolutionary communist league , the alternative globalisation party , workers struggle or the workers party is to take a vote away from ms royal .
i am not trying to undermine the glorious unpredictability of democracy .
of course workers struggle could leap from the 6 % it got last time to victory .
but do n't hold your breath ..
what many on the left fear is a repeat of 2002 , when the smaller parties leeched support from lionel jospin to allow far-right leader jean-marie le pen through to the second round .
of course , mr sarkozy faces a similar threat from smaller parities of the right , but his real problem is with the other two realistic contenders - le pen and francois bayrou .
campaign contrasts in the packed hall in tours , sarkozy 's passionate discourse on immigration and integration gets them stamping their feet .
i 'm sitting on the steps of a temporary stand next to a woman in her mid-twenties .
as sarkozy came to one climactic point of his argument the twenty-something woman next to me exclaimed " voila ! " - as if he was providing the clinching point that had eluded her in past arguments with friends .
throughout his speech she had been muttering " c 'est vrai , c 'est vrai " -lrb- true , true ! -rrb- .
a few seats away a smart woman , her grey hair cut elegantly short , smartly punched the air and waved a poster , almost in imitation of political activists she had seen on tv .
i did n't get the feeling it was something she did very often .
i have been to three segolene royal rallies and there is a palpable difference .
the socialist party supporters are happy to back someone who could win , who shares at least some of their values .
here it is the man himself they are backing .
outside i talk to a woman who says she lived in london for a long while .
she wants sarkozy as her president , but wants to justify her choice .
" in america i would not be a republican , " she tells me , continuing : " he and tony blair are -lrb- she pressed her palms together -rrb- are they not ? "
certainly in the hall i did n't hear a single idea that would be shockingly out of place in a labour manifesto , i did n't hear anything that could not have come from the lips of john reid or david blunkett .
on second thoughts , i 'm not sure i can imagine them singing the marseillaise .
my new friend says she remembers " when your country was poor , " adding that french socialists are like the labour party of those days .
but the labour party in those days did n't have french tv guidelines giving marxist factions valuable air time .
please use the post form below to comment on any of the issues raised in the diary .
in my part of la france profonde , my neighbours will vote for anyone who promises to get the stifling beaurocracy off their backs and let them earn a living .
unfortunately , they do n't see anyone among the candidates able or willing to do so , so their vote will be cast for one of the usual suspects - a career politician wary of upsetting any of the ' social partners ' - and only appearances will change in france after the presidential election. doris ward , argenton chateau france having lived in france for the last 2 years i really enjoy the different appraoch the french have to politics .
people are very open with their opinions and really enjoy the fight. it is a great change from the ' soundbite ' contect over the channel .
however no-one seems to really want to rock the boat and unfortunately in our global world this boat is heading for reefs .
james hodson , montgenevre , france i wish the bbc was more aware that international opinion can have an effect on national choice of politics .
a quick analysis of all the political candidates agenda -reveals that sarkozy is only interested in becoming president and nothing more -lrb- social change takes years unless it comes from a police state -rrb- and royal is the only real opposition to sarkozy .
favourite candidates are bové -lrb- sustainability -rrb- and voynet -lrb- green -rrb- although french friends holding votes agree they will vote royal to ensure the safety of their fellow citizens -lrb- citizen in the sense people who live here -rrb- .
penelope , paris those who compare jean-marie le pen 's movement to the bnp and brand him " far-right " or an " extremist " prove that they have no understanding of what is happening in france today .
le pen will get more than 20 % of the votes and will be in the second round .
do n't forget that he has consistently improved his scores in the presidential elections and ended up with 17 % last time .
also his electorate is the most loyal of all with over 80 % faithfuls .
add that mégret and the populist party have joined forces with him , that 's another good 2 % .
i vote josé bové so i believe my comments are unbiased .
gaston favresse , london as a french citizen living in sweden , i shall next sunday vote for the only leader possible.jean marie le pen .
france and the rest of europe need a wake up call .
the left and the right are the same .
the time hascomefor a massive rebellion against muslim immigration , and the dictators in bruxelles .
i rather votefor a party that says clearly what it thinks than the hypocritical lefties or rightists. c.simon , sweden i 'm a french citizen born in mauritius .
well it 's incredible to see how polls can direct people views in two directions - mrs royal and mr sarkosy .
what about the others ?
what is the the margin of error of these polls 5 % - 10 % or 0 % as they wish us to beleive ? ? ?
if so probably again we 'll see another 2002 when no poll institute gave the right predictions .
published polls which do not give their margin of error are rubish when they give a winner by a 2 % margin .
bhageerutty kishore , bourg en bresse , france we droped equal airtime rules in the states back in the 90 's and to be honest third parties have done at least as well or better since then .
nick michelewicz , keene , new hampshire , usa the socialists are the biggest threat to this country as they have an actual chance of being elected in the second round .
how ségolène can justify her ridiculous program is beyond me , case in point : increasing minimum wage to 1.500 ? a month ... how ? with good will and a rose !
as the median -lrb- not average ! -rrb- salary hovers between 1250 and 1400 i wonder how on earth she will be able to find 200 extra euros a month for the majority of french workers , it does n't make sense , she peddles populist ideals and her campaign is focused on the criticising of the right .
she has no authority , no economic sense and is the epitome of the gauche caviar .
why does it have to be so bad to earn money and make a good living , somehow it is inextricably linked to the french instilled catholic morals , that despite the laïcité of the state , continues to permeate society .
in france the less you talk about money and the poorer and more charitable you portray yourself the better you are .
henrik nordling , paris , france to those of you that likes our " same time for everyone policy " never heard or seen the people begging for or votes .
they are away from reality , because they do n't have a chance to win .
they always say the same damn speech , because they do n't have any other idea ... ideas from one century ago , ideas that were proven to be big mistakes ...
they 're not even funny .
when i was a kid , mother told me maggie was evil .
today , i think we really would need someone like her , someone that would not stop when two or three demonstrator would show up ... just to move on one day .
nick , paris , france i have lived here 4 years .
i have a multi ethnic group of friends .
they are basically afraid of sarkozy .
this is man who stands on tiptoes when he is photographed .
who wants to stop immigration , who calls poor people scum .
he is openly hunting votes from the national front .
he has immense energy when he talks , and power of conviction , and perhaps is too excitable , making some comment he might already be going crazy .
by contrast the problem is royale is so serene she is turning into a non-entity , she does n't seem to want it badly enough and she is not leading at all but telling the french a load of policies but nothing about how it will happen .
this is her big error , if she ranted about the state of the country and showed people what she willing to do to fix it she would walk this election .
she smiles and talks in droning voice almost like a ' stepford mum ' .
bayrou looks like he will win through because of fear of one and apathy for the other .
those english or other nationalites touting sarko would do well to be very attentive to what he says .
this is a man who admires bush us middle eastern policy , it is a man many fear could be the new french emperor .
europe is not his cup of tea. collie , nice as a young british person working in france i would say one of the biggest problems here is the lack of trust the older generation have in the young .
people here think it 's strange that a 21-year old should have completed university and be working full time as in britain , and the baby-boom generation just seems to be sitting on all the wealth and positions of responsibility without opening up to the young .
often all twenty-somethings can do is spend years at university or doing poorly paid " stages " -lrb- work placements -rrb- rather than being encouraged to start contributing to the economy .
henry rich , paris , france france is probably fine for all the middle-aged people living in it that benefited from lots of perks handed out when the economy was doing fine and employment was high during the 30 glorieuses .
to answer those that say france is doing fine , i will say that it is for those people !
but it certainly is not for young people who have to beg for jobs , get paid nothing , have no perks , have high real estate prices and live at home .
i am living in the us , and as a young person , i am doing very well for myself .
everyday young people leave france just like me -lrb- 300,000 just in london alone -rrb- .
france seriously needs to think to liberalize its economy , so that more jobs can be created . until then , the brain drain and the lack of investments will continue .
after all , who wants to put their money in a place where the government takes most of it .
peter , washington dc despite all the claims about " égalité , fraternité et liberté " , france is still a monarchy , but with an all-powerful president as head of state instead of a powerless king or queen -lrb- as in britain and the netherlands -rrb- .
the country is ruled accordingly and hence nothing changes .
everything in the name of " la gloire " and nothing in the name of progress .
pity .
albert , amsterdam sarkozy would like to apply for liberalism but can not even pronounce the word .
the ps : officially the hymn is still " the international " and capitalism is not an accepted system -lrb- i predict ps will split up -rrb- .
labor party is assimilated with far right .
most of young people want to become " fonctionnaire " very few chance i come back to this funny country expect of course for holidays or retirement .
didier lebon , french expat - bruxelles french people are capable of the best and the worst beleive me !
with us , you have to expect the unexpected .
that is , one week only before the first round , i have still hope / faith that the majority of the people will hear the two speeches of sarkozy and royal and realise , in all honesty , that the first one has very dangerous ideas and the second is our only hope .
but even on the best case sceanario of segolene , being elected , she better keeps her promises , otherwise some very hard time is awaiting france , let me tell you - i shoud know , i am french myself .
the task is not going to be easy .
vanina st martin , edinburgh , scotland i think those that are denigrating this relative stability in british and american politics are missing the whole point of this article .
what is being argued -lrb- and quite correctly , i may add -rrb- is in fact that british and american politics is less colourful than french politics because of this airtime regulation - but that their political systems are better off in terms of stability and effectiveness because of this .
the gentleman who brought up italian politics brings a great point .
if it 's ' colour ' you 're after , italy is even ' better ' than france .
but just as the french system finally pales relative to the anglo-saxon ones in terms of providing results to its people , does this mean that you would trade your french system for an even less effective but more colourful one in italy -lrb- or india -rrb- ?
if so , i 'm sure there are a lot of italians and indians who would jump at that offer .
h. juneja , london , uk france may be experiencing difficulty economically and with immigration , but as a nation it should be admired for doing two things : following its own path , and being open to a real political spectrum .
one thing notably lacking amongst these commments is a sense of shared history between francophones and anglophones - canada is predicted to sky rocket to over 50 million citizens by 2040 , easily rivalling france and the uk in population ... we have the great benefit of both nations ' political and social heritage and it has done us very well .
british stoicism and french joi-de-vivre make for a vigorous and lively culture , and it should not be forgotten that whether the tories win the next election in the uk or sarkozy does win in france , the essence of their cultures wo n't change and the politicians ultimately will have to be true to the average citizen 's concept of their nation .
the us aside , doomsday scenarios just are n't realistic in the modern europe .
nathan jenkins , london , canada the only advice i can give the french people is ... do n't try to emulate britain .
if i had the means , i would have moved to france 20 years ago .
alex maricic , fife , scotland what the french want is someone who is not afraid to take on the criminals who , in the last 30 years , have turned safe and pleasant french " banlieues " into territories occupied by work-shy , integrists , anti-french delinquents issued from uncontrolled immigration .
jean-luc royer , england what amazes me is that the candidates are allowed to get away with so much .
the french tv journalists are so subservient .
what is needed is for each candidate to be given a good paxman-style grilling and then a live debate amonst themselves with a strong chairman .
john ette , le pradet , france being an american studying and working in france , i find the presidential election very interesting .
i am not sure who will win but , either way politics and democracy is alive and kicking in france and i hope it will always stay that way .
i would love it if in the usa we could have more than just two choices and two parties for our presidential elections coming up next year .
my french friends are very open about their views on the canidates and we love discussing our different perspectives of each canidate and speculating on how they would change france .
i find that the journalist of this article has n't given serious thought or consideration to the way of life and history of the french people and their political system .
having lived here for almost 2 years i was a bit offended by the tone of his article and i am not even french .
i wish the best for france and hope that no matter who wins they will do the best they can for their country and its citizens .
erin , lille , france as all the real power now rests in brussels and strasbourg maybe it ? s time for eu citizens to stop paying attention , as so many have already done , to local national elections and concentrate on how they are being represented within european institutions .
where it seems democracy plays second fiddle to bureaucracy i propose that national election candidates receive zero free air time as a first step towards shifting our attention .
a change that would be simultaneously cost effective , popular and egalitarian. mike sell , founex , switzerland i am a french citizen , living in malaysia and expect to vote in the april presidential elections .
i love my country and believe most french people are very lucky to have been born french even though , like everywhere else things could be much improved .
i am also one of the apparently unprecedented large number of undecided voters .
to put it more more simply , i find it hard to decide which of the candidates is the least unpalatable .
mitterrand , de gaulle , pompidou , giscard d 'estaing had stature , a rationally thought out political programme and a coherent vision of what france should be , whether you agreed with them or not .
this lot -lrb- royal , sarkozy , bayrou , le pen et al -rrb- are a bunch of undistinguished politicians scrambling for power .
pauvre france !
i 'll still vote because i believe it is a duty -lrb- hard won over the centuries -rrb- but without any conviction .
christine sathiah , penang , malaysia i have to say i enjoy reading rich english people living in limousin / aquitaine / languedoc-roussillon complaining about the french welfare system in happy oblivion of the rest of france , which would be destroyed in the way so many northern , scottish and welsh towns were by unrestricted thatcherism in the 1980s .
certainly , france needs economic reform if it is to go forward from where it is now , but the sort of ruthless cutthroat politics that sarkozy is advocating is frightening for people in the north of france , where the collapse of industry is still felt very strongly , and where a " tough " immigration policy would create tensions that do n't need to be exacerbated .
mark brown , lens , france i think france 's " equal time " standard , while perhaps cumbersome from a tv producer 's standpoint , is far superior to the system in the us where presidential candidates are given large endowments of public money to produce 30 second tv commercials .
the result is an enormously inefficent use of public and private resources to fund essentially smear campaigns where issue-oriented discussion is practically non-existent .
however , this would probably upset the us media lobby , so do n't expect change any time soon .
mike taylor , ann arbor , michigan usa have lived in both countries and in france presently .
sorry to disappoint everyone but there is no ideal political system wheather from the states , great britain or france and i agree with the negative points concerning the us + gb .
however the particularity of france is that the french people have been living with the myth of the " 30 glorieuses " -lrb- the best 30 economic years after ww2 -rrb- and kept to believe that it could continue for another 30 . and there is now a huge gap between the state paid employees -lrb- in the energy , and transport big dept -rrb- who enjoy work security and numerous privileges and the rest : self-employed , low payed workers from small firms , shopkeepers . who do not enjoy eany goodies and have to pay their electricity and gas and telephone bills full rate -lrb- unlike employees of edf -lrb- for electricty -rrb- or france telecom ... -rrb- i would like to know if employees from the different electricity co. in gb or us pay their electricity at reduced rate ?
sometimes you feel ! in france you are in a republic with some old fashion aristocratic / monarchist remaining that everyone moans about but not one politician dares talking about let alone question its democratic values ...
to finish france will always be a great country of contradictions where poeple love laws which loks perfect on paper but impossible to apply in real . i just hope that this time french people will refuse to be kept in the dark or above the clouds of the real economic situation -lrb- one of the highest european debt , a shrinking pension system . -rrb- and that we have to accept and adapt to this new globalisation of everything -lrb- from economy to terrorism -rrb- and think hard and suggest a real alternative ...
elisabeth , france + england i 've lived all over europe and for the last five years in paris and much as i love the city , country , culture , way of life etc .
i have to honestly say that i 've never been worse off financially .
i would probably qualify for housing benefit and several other subsidies but i 'm restricted from earning overtime .
it is a crazy situation .
if i was american i 'd vote democrat and have always considered myself centre-left but in france sarkozy is seen as extreme and if that 's the case , well i 'm extreme too. john healy , paris , france the issue of air time in the media is undermined by the way the media portait a candidate in news pieces .
for example , n sarkozy will win debates after debates but the media in france will mention his name every time there are riots for whatever reasons .
also , royal was shown as the messiah until she messed it up herself .
suddenly bayrou turns up and the media almost openly present him as the ' if you do n't want sarkozy in , vote for this no-mark ' .
basically the media -lrb- most of which has leftist ideals -rrb- do n't want sarkozy in and will do whatever they can to sink him .
shameful but so typical of the french elite -lrb- media and politics -rrb- which has put the country in this situation in the first place .
nick , london le pen 's score last time was not the fault of the minor candidates !
the first turn was won by the " leave me alone i 'm on holiday " party ; in fact the level of abstentionwas higher than the score of any candidate !
judy wood , lyon , france france desperately needs economic reform and the successful integration of immigrants into french society .
sarkozy may be able to deliver on the former but will fail miserably on the latter .
his record as interior minister is shocking in this respect and his potential election may only highten the tensions between les banlieues and the police .
royal would keep france economically uncompetitive for the duration of her presidential term and her foreign policy gaffes so far do not inspire confidence .
sarkozy will easily win the first round with royal trailing in second , but sarkozy is a polarising figure and i would not be surprised to see segolene becoming president .
ben lonsdale , manchester i am no prophet , but i forecast there will be no one from the left in the runoff .
sarkozy and le pen will eventually be the final contenders .
why ?
because french do not confess they are voting for le pen in opinion polls .
because the old far right leader has not been campaigning himself , letting his daughter marine le pen on the front line .
and she succeeded in giving a softer image of her father .
because he has criticised recent measures against smokers and speed checks and such type of demagogic speech is very popular with french .
because nothing has really changed since 21st of april 2002 but there has been the riots at the end of 2005 and the ones in gare du nord end of march 2007 and this is fuelling the protesting votes in favour of le pen .
there will be a new shock on the 22nd of april 2007 when le pen is placed in the final race .
i am no prophet , but sarkozy will be the next french president .
and what about royal in all this ?
pardon me ...
who did you say ?
antoine de champs , tours , france olivier besancenot sounds like a man who knows what he is talking about ... rightly condemning the appalling neo-liberal capitalism that has festered under both the right and the so-called left in france for far too long .
it is the unmitigated disater of the capitalist system that has created the massive unemployment and alienation , discrimination , and injustice throughout france on a vast scale.how refreshing then to hear someone putting forward a real alternative to the much hated neo-liberal capitalist nightmare of more disatrous privatisation plans for big business , which both sarkozy and royal defend .
how refreshing then to hear someone condemn the violence and discrimination of the french police .
how refreshing to hear someone defend public services and public sector workers , the right to a stable and decent job and present ideas about creating a genuine socialist alternative to capitalism .
another world is possible and another france is necessary .
segolene royal seems to be presenting the same old failed blairite right wing ideas.think again !
p.black , uk i think a new generation of politicians is now there for france , but i 'm not sure , the coming president will be accepted by the whole population .
i 'm a wee bit anxious for france 's future .
f.roux , bourges , france , you are wrong to underestimate the importance of francois bayrou and only to focus on the main both political parities : the right and the left nicolas , paris , france i 've lived in france for many years , and run a business with my husband .
yes - france has a wonderful way of life , a health system second to none , but economically , france is on its knees .
the loony left - more like an extreme version of michael foot 's socialist vision - is desperate to protect the social benefits which have been acquired over 30 years and which cripple the economy .
socialist politicians declare proudly that they do not own shares , a nasty right-wing habit of investing in industry .
madame royal claims to speak for the lowly-paid while benefiting from her salaries and perks .
in the meantime , my husband and i pay away 60 % of our earnings to support a lumbering state with its 6 million civil servants .
good luck to sarko , he 's the best of a mediocre bunch , the only one who might just bring a little egalité to france .
madeleine dickson , limoges , france an item that should be more prominent on the election agenda on both sides of politics is what should be done about the future of the world 's largest nickel deposit , new caledonia .
the country is at boiling point from a mining perspective and some leadership from france is much neeeded , after all it is her duty to do so .
sebastien carpin , brisbane , australia i agree that equal airtime for all of the candidates is a strength of the french system , but referring to the disparaging of the american electoral system as coca-cola v pepsi : in 2002 , did n't it eventually come down to le pen or chirac ?
far-right vs right ... how 's that for choice ?
khalil , boston , ma , usa i am a french citizen and have lived in the usa since the age of 8 .
i often hear many negative comments about france and europe .
i believe that these comments are born of jealousy .
while france may have its problems as everyone does i find the french approach and thought process refreshing and full of life .
i believe in the french process and have every confidence that france will prosper and the french will continue to preserve their language , culture and unique way of life in an increasing dull anglo-american world of politically correct " grey zone " .
how nice to know that there is still a country that has not sold out .
in the us , where everything including values and principles is for sale , i find it to be stale and the people in part uninterested and unmotivated beyond reaching for the next burger or bag of junk food to put a few more kilos on their already large frame , to put it nicely .
france has and will continue to be a society of free thinkers who are not afraid to voice their thoughts .
vive la france ! ! !
arthur brown , lb usa the french left needs to unite and fight for a radical redistribution of wealth and the urgent transformation of the deeply corrupt capitalist system to a socially just , participative and profoundly democratic , co-operative green socialist society based on the sustainable common ownership of the means of production .
this is an alternative as global capitalism runs amok , wreaking havoc and global climate chaos in its wake .
capitalism is doomed !
another france is possible and highly necessary .
patrick black , uk i am a sixth-form student and as i am talking about le pen in my oral exam the french elections are naturally very interesting to me .
i do n't think le pen will win -lrb- and , after extensive research the vast number of anti-semitic comments he has made over the years , i sincerely hope he wo n't win as well -rrb- but i am not convinced by either sarkozy or royal .
sarkozy seems very underhand , a man who you would imagine to be right-handed but to keep his wallet in his left-hand pocket ; royal should not be let anywhere near a microphone when it comes to foreign policy .
i do n't know much about bayrou , but i would not be appalled if he won - he appears to be the best of a bad bunch .
chris stanley , stroud , england much like american political races , advertising a politician is a political party 's biggest concern .
the bnp and ump have marketed their candidates to match the sentiment and feeling of their constituents , ms. royal feels scripted , however has an uncanny ability to improvise her responses to well thought-out questions from the press .
sarkozy swears to carry out his party 's goals but incorporates his own ideas .
however he is sheepishly stubborn towards alternative methods of carrying out policies .
i think many voters will vote based on their feelings towards each candidate and not on what policies would be best for the country .
finn raftery , seattle , united states in principle , it 's democratic to provide the same air time for all politicians who manage to get 500 mayor 's signatures in order to run for presidency .
unfortunately , the result is the exact opposite .
those who only want to rant , and have no political platform because they know that they will never be elected , feel free to lobotomize political discourse in france .
the result has been 25 years of meaningless hypocrisy .
hardly anything said has any relation to reality and as a result , very little if anything is done to address the real issues .
worse , the extremism of so many statements , along with the infamous " acquis sociaux " , on which no one will give an inch , lull people into hating work , which is , of course , " a form of oppression " of the " monstrous capitalist exploiters " .
ho hum .
and worse still , if and when sarkozy wins , the undemocratic left will not accept the result of the democratic process .
any reform will be met by attempts to totally block france by massive protest movements .
pity .
douglas mccarthy , paris , france picking up from what richard tomlinson wrote , as a british citizen living in france why will i lose my right to vote in the uk national elections when i complete my fifteenth year abroad ?
that is truly losing one 's vote , in our so-called eu of equals .
john ward , metz , france the problem in france is that french society in recent years has been turned upside down and they do not know what to do about it .
france has seen a rapid rise in immigration , unemployment and violence .
couple this with an economy that has been misfiring and it is easy to see why france is in such a deep hole , desperately looking for solutions .
it may hurt french pride , but modelling itself on great britain and taking the best of what the british have done , whilst keeping the best of french could really sort out modern france .
take immigration - why can the french not embrace multiculturalism as the british have ?
what about the economy - the british do n't seem that worried about globalisation , so why are we ? ..
the british have barely any marxists , simply because there is no place for them .
in france they offer a solution to a problem , britain has no problem -lrb- relatively -rrb- and therefore no heavy solutions need offering .
france needs to think seriously , politicians need to step back , be brave and say things that actually the french may not want to hear .
unfortunately , owing to this election , that is not going to happen , and france is not going to get any better .
frederic lacroix , paris , francais eric paul - you seem to fundamentally misunderstand american political campaigns and related us legislation .
section 315 of the us communications act details the equal time rule regulating us political campaigns .
it and subsequent amendments are very well crafted and might inform you more completely .
i do think that france 's strict equal air time rule is to be admired and is something modern democracies should strive for ; as some already do , though perhaps not in such an austere manner .
n. campbell , new orleans , usa personally i feel sorry for the french .
there is no-one worthy of the presidency today .
the choice is awful , but what must be understood is that the first round is the real choice and public opinion , the second is a knock-out to get rid of the worst candidate .
maybe they should really start thinking about voting for and not against .
be warned they are heading for thatcherism if they vote sarkozy , and we british all know what that did !
we are still paying .
i live , but sadly do n't vote , in france and have done for 15 years , this is my 3rd election .
v.miller , nancy , france the role of president urgently needs reforming -lrb- as does the whole constitution -rrb- , as no one is very sure about which role -lrb- s -rrb- he has , especially if confronted with an opposition parliament .
these elections have been the most exciting in decades , yet i do believe that none of the candidates will take the necessary stance to reform the institutions .
i also fear that due to the huge division of france into pro- and anti-sarkozy , we might very possibly end up with a cohabitation for the next five years .
the most striking aspect of this campaign is the increasing role of the media , especially television .
the majority of the french electorate will not seek information about the candidates but will expect it to come to them , mainly through television and radio -lrb- still a very popular medium , especially the morning and afternoon news -rrb- .
in such a system , the most able orators and communicators have a clear advantage .
unfortunately , these happen to be mm sarkozy and le pen .
quentin liger , london , uk well , the french system may have the advantage that we look at the candidates ' ideas and not only at how much cash they raise for their campaign .
living in the us , i came to realize that no matter what you believe in , money is the only driving force toward a warm seat at the white house .
emmanuel gilles , bronx , usa from the popularity of sarkozy , i 'd say any leanings toward marxism here are fleeing in the face of growing economic and globalization problems .
he 's a scary guy , sarko , the way he reaches for the far-right votes and disarms his critics by saying , " is it wrong to talk about national identity ?
is that a bad word ? "
because of course they ca n't say that without alienating a lot of french people !
many of my french friends here agree that the election is pitiful .
there is no one offering any real solutions to the problems threatening this country .
but it would be nice to hear more about bayrou .
he 's the most sensible by far , and the only one really trying to address the issues of immigration and discrimination .
maria alexander , aix-en-provence , france i 've had enough of this france-bashing : it is still one of the best countries to live , and i would n't even think of moving to the rainy , crowded country ruled by the nhs-dicta .
here , life is good and relaxed , the best education and health system , i pay only a little bit more than what i used to pay in the us as taxes .
the political life has not been anaesthetized like it has been in anglo-saxon countries - and we all know where that leads us : bush , born-again christians , evolution-revisionists and co .
funny that some of the french-bashing is coming from expats in france .
if it is so bad , what are you guys doing here ? : -rrb- france has a lot of problems , sure , but it is still " better " than the rest - nothing is ever perfect ..
baris tarim , caen , france one must recognise the plethora of choices available to french voters .
charles de gaulle said there are as many ideas in france as there are cheeses .
this is perfectly represented in this election with for example le pen 's far right and laguiller 's far left .
i think these extremist ideals reveal a great deal about the sense of upheaval in french society and shows how fragmented a society it is .
the unemployment , lack of economic growth , immigration are all thorny issues which are as divisive as they are polemic and the longer these particular problems last , the more it adds to le pen 's following .
as for le pen , he will always get that 10 % -15 % he consistently gets in elections because of how determined his supporters are .
his recent success though is down to a series of socio-economic problems which a series of governments , both right-wing and left-wing , have failed to solve .
cormac mac gabhann , dublin , ireland having lived in france for some time , it strikes me that its system of high job protection and generous social benefits serves only to ensure that the underprivileged few are condemned live with few prospects , a life spent literally on the margins : on the council estates bordering the big cities , dependant on the state .
no surprise that the signs of social fracture and growing dissatisfaction are plain to see .
so much for equality , freedom and brotherhood !
i do n't like sarkozy much as a person , but he seems to be the only candidate willing to undertake the drastic liberalisation that france so desperately needs .
dominic higgins , london , england eu citizens are entitled to vote in eu elections , local council and industrial tribunal elections , so richard tomlinson 's complaint is not fully accurate .
there is always the option of acquiring french nationality for the other elections .
i have done so and this is one of the reasons why .
david buick , rennes , france to mr tomlinson : as an eu citizen and permanent resident in an eu country other than your own , you are allowed to vote -lrb- and stand -rrb- in local elections : that includes city council , county council and " region " council elections .
then , just as i was not allowed to vote in the general election when i lived in the uk , you are not allowed to vote in the presidential election in france .
julien randon-furling , paris , france in my extended conversations with french citizens from all walks of life , it surprises me that most are not too far apart on issues like immigration and globalization .
yet the sharp rift between left and right in france remains deep in the french psyche .
it reaches down to a visceral level that defies logic and plays into the political strategies of career politicians .
is it possible for france to keep democracy but ditch its self-seeking party system ?
donald williams , springfield , massachusetts , usa i think it 's great that you have so many choices in france and that there is a law enforcing equal time to all .
your system makes me jealous as an american .
we are forced to choose between only two candidates who are in fact almost identical anyway .
all other parties or independents are refused any time by the media .
mark ellis , york , usa your article lacks the respect that we deserve .
you dismiss us without really looking at who we are and what we do .
the french communist party , of which i am a member , has 130,000 members and 13,000 persons that hold public offices .
your own liberal party has far fewer members .
who are you to dismiss the views of the citizens in any of these parties ?
i should remind you that many dismissed the views of democrats in the early 18th century , yet europe was transformed .
you seem to believe marxists have no place in politics today .
i , on the other hand , find your clinging to a monarchy outdated and a drain on your state 's finances .
i suppose you have the right to maintain a royal family .
i would prefer to maintain our low rate of child poverty and fight for a socialist state .
russell yates , meaux , france i am following my first election as a french resident , though not voter , and agree that the short presentations by each contender each day are very snappy and engaging .
saying something different each time holds the interest too .
the galloping music that opens each space is also attention-grabbing .
trouble is , they all sound so sincere and seem so nice !
what is important , i think , is that yes they are reading prepared material , not reacting to questions , but at least they get to finish what they have to say without being constantly interrupted .
-lrb- so many presenters take so long introducing their guest that the guest with a fascinating point to make often barely says hello before the time slot is over . -rrb-
especially in the morning , i think a straight , uninterrupted performance is more attractive than voices shouting all at once and seeing all the candidates does help sort who is who and what they stand for .
how often have you gone to vote without any idea of the face behind the name on the ballot paper ?
angela sheard , romans-sur-isère , france .
i have n't seen any evidence that a single candidate is facing up to the french budget deficit .
the whole country is living on the never-never , and that ca n't go on for ever .
andrew h , london uk the tone of the article implies that it is french democracy that is bizarre for at least attempting to ensure that all parties have an opportunity to make their platforms known .
an alternative view would be that allowing more ' popular ' parties more airtime -lrb- as in england -rrb- vastly reduces the chance of smaller parties acquiring the votes that would entitle them to greater coverage next time round .
the game is rigged from the start , and yet this is considered the norm from which the french deviate .
danny millum , london it is a very good thing that all candidates are given the same time on tv .
it means that democracy and debate are still alive and that economics and finance , and tv companies , can not impose their rule completely .
france therefore avoids to quite a large extent horrors such as the pepsi / coke us election system .
the issue is not so much about keeping marxism alive , however relevant that philosophy remains , but to avoid as much as possible that " la chose politique " becomes only a matter of experts and professional politicians , an intoxicating show in which the ordinary citizen would be only a spectator ...
thinking can only be a dynamic process when all possiblities are considered , even those which at the moment seem unreasonable .
that is why i wish that france remains as much as possible the laboratory of ideas it has been since at least the 18th century .
finance only likes ideas which like finance , which are compatible with it and i want to think freely .
as for the british system , i do n't think the british have a relation to politics which could be compared to the one the french have .
the british seem very consensual and traditional and i do n't want a two-party system for france .
eric paul , nice , france france is nothing like as poor as the uk was under wilson and callaghan .
yet talking about singing the marseillaise has some of the same desperation to find a bit of national pride as union jack underpants had in the carnaby street of the sixties .
it is odd that the country that put liberty into its national motto should have such a fear of liberalism - as if it and its multicultural cousin will come and eat them and their way of life .
but until the french realise that the rest of the world does n't owe them a living and they ca n't protect everything french by throwing protectionist money at it from higher and higher taxes , they will continue to suffer from high unemployment and the high taxes that most try to avoid paying .
there is nothing incompatible between a healthy yet well-regulated market economy and the french way of life .
but it does n't take twelve people to plant the season 's flowers on a roundabout !
ben lenthall , cahors , france another excellent analysis by mark ...
pity only that he left out francois bayrou , who tries to introduce a new political style in france .
for me it seems obvious that france has a more lively democratic culture than the uk .
compare this very open election with the passing on of power from blair to brown in the uk .
the absence of a real democratic debate in the uk is quite a shame for a country that likes to paint itself as the stalwart of democratic rule .
ronald gruenebaum , brussels , belgium unfortunately france is not the western european country where you can spot the highest level of support for the jurassic marxist ideology .
when it comes to sound representation in the two chambers of parliament this misfortune is still an italian privilege .
french marxists are a sideshow with no real power , fragmented maybe colourful.the real black spot in france is the far right - as jurassic and out of date as the marxists in italy but for france misfortune , still with some real power .
enrico ferrero , hellerup , denmark whether the french vote right or left , a man or woman , the french policy of neocolonialism and active support for unpopular puppets in africa shall continue relentlessly .
mofor tangmo edward , cameroon i think mr mardell has unknowingly or wittingly left out the factor that underlies french politics at present , fear ; unemployment , violent behaviour , poverty , institutions that no longer are able to respond to the concerns of the majority ...
paul hubball , france i am an eu citizen , am a permanent resident in france , pay my taxes here , but am not allowed to vote in the elections .
how can it be legal under eu law that we -lrb- and we are many -rrb- are excluded from the democratic process ?
richard tomlinson , mandelieu , france i am a french citizen , and , within the forseeable future , a permanent resident and taxpayer in the uk !
i cherish my right and duty to vote , and will be voting for the french president on sunday and have been frustrated at not being able to vote at important uk elections in the uk , especially when i see so many uk citizens not exercising their right to vote ! -lrb- it cost many people their lives or their freedom to ask for the right to vote , in some countries there still is no right to vote , yet , nowadays , both in the uk and in france , so many people ca n't be bothered ! ! ! -rrb-
but , i have lived here long enough now to apply for british citizenship -lrb- and am married to a british citizen -rrb- .
thankfully , now , i do not have to renounce my french nationality to do that !
-lrb- you used to be able to be only french , nothing else , or else renounce the french nationality -rrb- so , i will apply for british citizenship , it costs £ 268 , and takes up to 8 months to process , but at least i will be able to vote on uk issues and for the uk government !
richard t , perhaps you could investigate whether there is a similar possibility for you to gain these rights in france ?
helgaflower , cheltenham , uk to reply to richard tomlinson , i am a permanent resident in the uk , paying my taxes here , have been living here for 6 years now , and not allowed to vote here in the elections , because i am not a british citizen .
so england is not that much different in that case .
but i have always been a person who adored france , the culture , the country .
i have never lived there , but i am aware that burocracy makes it difficult sometimes , but with so many english people moving there , it ca n't be that bad , can it ?
they should stop complaining about it , or move back here if it 's so problematic over there .
em , manchester to richard tomlinson : under eu law an eu citizen legally resident in another member state can vote and stand in the the local and european elections , therefore you can do that in france -lrb- i 've done it in belgium -rrb- .
however , no eu member state allows non-citizens to vote in parliamentary or presidential elections , so nothing special about france there .
your anger should be directed at the british government because it is uk law which takes away your right to vote in the uk after 15 years outside of the country , something that many other european countries do not do .
it is undemocratic , but it 's got nothing to do with the eu .
rebecca , brussels to mr tomlinson , you can vote for local election in france like most of the european countries .
if you want to vote you can ask for the french citizenship thierry le romancer , paris france name your e-mail address town & country comments the bbc may edit your comments and not all emails will be published .

the diary is published every thursday .
to always see the latest edition , please click here and bookmark this page .
the man the opinion polls say will be the next president of france has been out and about in the loire valley .
nicolas sarkozy has shaken hands with people restoring a chateau , chatted with youngsters learning hairdressing and made his triumphant way out of a hall in tours packed close with supporters .
he has passionately defended his controversial record .
i love election campaigns and watching politicians in action .
but most people get their politics not in the flesh but from people like me , tv reporters .
and in france for the next couple of weeks they 'll be getting a rather odd picture .
let 's put it this way .
would it make any difference to the result of the next british general election if gordon brown and david cameron were given exactly the same air time as nick griffin of the british national party -lrb- bnp -rrb- or the candidates of the socialist workers party ?
that 's what has to happen in france .
the presidential election has two rounds , and the first vote serves to narrow a large field to a simple two-horse race for the second round .
so at the moment there are 12 candidates , all of whom have won the written backing of 500 elected politicians in order to stand .
here 's the rub .
by law french radio and tv have to give all the candidates the same amount of air time .
all broadcasters know the horrors of stop-watch balance .
many is the time i 've got the message " the editor says can you get the snp in ? "
" well tell him ' yes ' but i 'll need another minute . "
" he 'll give you 45 seconds . "
it may be vital for democracy , but it does n't make for elegant television .
but british law and the bbc 's own guidelines are as nothing compared to the rigour of french law .
to include a short 20-second clip of each candidate a report would be four minutes long without the reporter saying a word of introduction .
so each and every report would have to be at least five minutes long .
the upshot is that of course it does n't happen .
there are special election programmes , but the news deals in opinion polls and generalities .
left-wing rebels but this has one unexpected bonus .
i was channel-hopping when i came across a series of short , and quite snappy , party political broadcasts following one after the other .
you might think this sounds dull viewing , but it is a lot more interesting , and gives you a much better perspective , than something tagged on before or after the news .
the best watch was oliver besancenot , the trotskyite postman .
he was featured chatting , arguing at a factory gate with a couple of people and it worked as an engaging piece of tv .
madame royal was deliberately presidential .
but what came across to me was the scale of the opposition she faces , and i do n't mean mr sarkozy .
it used to be a slogan of republicans in france : " no enemies to the left ! "
this is not something segolene is likely to say .
in broadcast after broadcast , the same message was repeated : the threat of globalisation , the trampled rights of workers , the ravages of capitalism and economic liberalism .
this of course is not just the result of a strict broadcasting law .
the left is more fractured and marxism more alive in france than anywhere else in europe .
in britain , there are of course marxist groups , but most people seem to believe that capitalism is the only currently possible economic system and arguments are about redistribution and restrictions within it .
it is such an accepted belief that it feels rather odd writing it down .
but in france that is not so .
this has a very real effect on this election .
the practical effect of a vote for the communist party , the revolutionary communist league , the alternative globalisation party , workers struggle or the workers party is to take a vote away from ms royal .
i am not trying to undermine the glorious unpredictability of democracy .
of course workers struggle could leap from the 6 % it got last time to victory .
but do n't hold your breath ..
what many on the left fear is a repeat of 2002 , when the smaller parties leeched support from lionel jospin to allow far-right leader jean-marie le pen through to the second round .
of course , mr sarkozy faces a similar threat from smaller parities of the right , but his real problem is with the other two realistic contenders - le pen and francois bayrou .
campaign contrasts in the packed hall in tours , sarkozy 's passionate discourse on immigration and integration gets them stamping their feet .
i 'm sitting on the steps of a temporary stand next to a woman in her mid-twenties .
as sarkozy came to one climactic point of his argument the twenty-something woman next to me exclaimed " voila ! " - as if he was providing the clinching point that had eluded her in past arguments with friends .
throughout his speech she had been muttering " c 'est vrai , c 'est vrai " -lrb- true , true ! -rrb- .
a few seats away a smart woman , her grey hair cut elegantly short , smartly punched the air and waved a poster , almost in imitation of political activists she had seen on tv .
i did n't get the feeling it was something she did very often .
i have been to three segolene royal rallies and there is a palpable difference .
the socialist party supporters are happy to back someone who could win , who shares at least some of their values .
here it is the man himself they are backing .
outside i talk to a woman who says she lived in london for a long while .
she wants sarkozy as her president , but wants to justify her choice .
" in america i would not be a republican , " she tells me , continuing : " he and tony blair are -lrb- she pressed her palms together -rrb- are they not ? "
certainly in the hall i did n't hear a single idea that would be shockingly out of place in a labour manifesto , i did n't hear anything that could not have come from the lips of john reid or david blunkett .
on second thoughts , i 'm not sure i can imagine them singing the marseillaise .
my new friend says she remembers " when your country was poor , " adding that french socialists are like the labour party of those days .
but the labour party in those days did n't have french tv guidelines giving marxist factions valuable air time .
please use the post form below to comment on any of the issues raised in the diary .
in my part of la france profonde , my neighbours will vote for anyone who promises to get the stifling beaurocracy off their backs and let them earn a living .
unfortunately , they do n't see anyone among the candidates able or willing to do so , so their vote will be cast for one of the usual suspects - a career politician wary of upsetting any of the ' social partners ' - and only appearances will change in france after the presidential election. doris ward , argenton chateau france having lived in france for the last 2 years i really enjoy the different appraoch the french have to politics .
people are very open with their opinions and really enjoy the fight. it is a great change from the ' soundbite ' contect over the channel .
however no-one seems to really want to rock the boat and unfortunately in our global world this boat is heading for reefs .
james hodson , montgenevre , france i wish the bbc was more aware that international opinion can have an effect on national choice of politics .
a quick analysis of all the political candidates agenda -reveals that sarkozy is only interested in becoming president and nothing more -lrb- social change takes years unless it comes from a police state -rrb- and royal is the only real opposition to sarkozy .
favourite candidates are bové -lrb- sustainability -rrb- and voynet -lrb- green -rrb- although french friends holding votes agree they will vote royal to ensure the safety of their fellow citizens -lrb- citizen in the sense people who live here -rrb- .
penelope , paris those who compare jean-marie le pen 's movement to the bnp and brand him " far-right " or an " extremist " prove that they have no understanding of what is happening in france today .
le pen will get more than 20 % of the votes and will be in the second round .
do n't forget that he has consistently improved his scores in the presidential elections and ended up with 17 % last time .
also his electorate is the most loyal of all with over 80 % faithfuls .
add that mégret and the populist party have joined forces with him , that 's another good 2 % .
i vote josé bové so i believe my comments are unbiased .
gaston favresse , london as a french citizen living in sweden , i shall next sunday vote for the only leader possible.jean marie le pen .
france and the rest of europe need a wake up call .
the left and the right are the same .
the time hascomefor a massive rebellion against muslim immigration , and the dictators in bruxelles .
i rather votefor a party that says clearly what it thinks than the hypocritical lefties or rightists. c.simon , sweden i 'm a french citizen born in mauritius .
well it 's incredible to see how polls can direct people views in two directions - mrs royal and mr sarkosy .
what about the others ?
what is the the margin of error of these polls 5 % - 10 % or 0 % as they wish us to beleive ? ? ?
if so probably again we 'll see another 2002 when no poll institute gave the right predictions .
published polls which do not give their margin of error are rubish when they give a winner by a 2 % margin .
bhageerutty kishore , bourg en bresse , france we droped equal airtime rules in the states back in the 90 's and to be honest third parties have done at least as well or better since then .
nick michelewicz , keene , new hampshire , usa the socialists are the biggest threat to this country as they have an actual chance of being elected in the second round .
how ségolène can justify her ridiculous program is beyond me , case in point : increasing minimum wage to 1.500 ? a month ... how ? with good will and a rose !
as the median -lrb- not average ! -rrb- salary hovers between 1250 and 1400 i wonder how on earth she will be able to find 200 extra euros a month for the majority of french workers , it does n't make sense , she peddles populist ideals and her campaign is focused on the criticising of the right .
she has no authority , no economic sense and is the epitome of the gauche caviar .
why does it have to be so bad to earn money and make a good living , somehow it is inextricably linked to the french instilled catholic morals , that despite the laïcité of the state , continues to permeate society .
in france the less you talk about money and the poorer and more charitable you portray yourself the better you are .
henrik nordling , paris , france to those of you that likes our " same time for everyone policy " never heard or seen the people begging for or votes .
they are away from reality , because they do n't have a chance to win .
they always say the same damn speech , because they do n't have any other idea ... ideas from one century ago , ideas that were proven to be big mistakes ...
they 're not even funny .
when i was a kid , mother told me maggie was evil .
today , i think we really would need someone like her , someone that would not stop when two or three demonstrator would show up ... just to move on one day .
nick , paris , france i have lived here 4 years .
i have a multi ethnic group of friends .
they are basically afraid of sarkozy .
this is man who stands on tiptoes when he is photographed .
who wants to stop immigration , who calls poor people scum .
he is openly hunting votes from the national front .
he has immense energy when he talks , and power of conviction , and perhaps is too excitable , making some comment he might already be going crazy .
by contrast the problem is royale is so serene she is turning into a non-entity , she does n't seem to want it badly enough and she is not leading at all but telling the french a load of policies but nothing about how it will happen .
this is her big error , if she ranted about the state of the country and showed people what she willing to do to fix it she would walk this election .
she smiles and talks in droning voice almost like a ' stepford mum ' .
bayrou looks like he will win through because of fear of one and apathy for the other .
those english or other nationalites touting sarko would do well to be very attentive to what he says .
this is a man who admires bush us middle eastern policy , it is a man many fear could be the new french emperor .
europe is not his cup of tea. collie , nice as a young british person working in france i would say one of the biggest problems here is the lack of trust the older generation have in the young .
people here think it 's strange that a 21-year old should have completed university and be working full time as in britain , and the baby-boom generation just seems to be sitting on all the wealth and positions of responsibility without opening up to the young .
often all twenty-somethings can do is spend years at university or doing poorly paid " stages " -lrb- work placements -rrb- rather than being encouraged to start contributing to the economy .
henry rich , paris , france france is probably fine for all the middle-aged people living in it that benefited from lots of perks handed out when the economy was doing fine and employment was high during the 30 glorieuses .
to answer those that say france is doing fine , i will say that it is for those people !
but it certainly is not for young people who have to beg for jobs , get paid nothing , have no perks , have high real estate prices and live at home .
i am living in the us , and as a young person , i am doing very well for myself .
everyday young people leave france just like me -lrb- 300,000 just in london alone -rrb- .
france seriously needs to think to liberalize its economy , so that more jobs can be created . until then , the brain drain and the lack of investments will continue .
after all , who wants to put their money in a place where the government takes most of it .
peter , washington dc despite all the claims about " égalité , fraternité et liberté " , france is still a monarchy , but with an all-powerful president as head of state instead of a powerless king or queen -lrb- as in britain and the netherlands -rrb- .
the country is ruled accordingly and hence nothing changes .
everything in the name of " la gloire " and nothing in the name of progress .
pity .
albert , amsterdam sarkozy would like to apply for liberalism but can not even pronounce the word .
the ps : officially the hymn is still " the international " and capitalism is not an accepted system -lrb- i predict ps will split up -rrb- .
labor party is assimilated with far right .
most of young people want to become " fonctionnaire " very few chance i come back to this funny country expect of course for holidays or retirement .
didier lebon , french expat - bruxelles french people are capable of the best and the worst beleive me !
with us , you have to expect the unexpected .
that is , one week only before the first round , i have still hope / faith that the majority of the people will hear the two speeches of sarkozy and royal and realise , in all honesty , that the first one has very dangerous ideas and the second is our only hope .
but even on the best case sceanario of segolene , being elected , she better keeps her promises , otherwise some very hard time is awaiting france , let me tell you - i shoud know , i am french myself .
the task is not going to be easy .
vanina st martin , edinburgh , scotland i think those that are denigrating this relative stability in british and american politics are missing the whole point of this article .
what is being argued -lrb- and quite correctly , i may add -rrb- is in fact that british and american politics is less colourful than french politics because of this airtime regulation - but that their political systems are better off in terms of stability and effectiveness because of this .
the gentleman who brought up italian politics brings a great point .
if it 's ' colour ' you 're after , italy is even ' better ' than france .
but just as the french system finally pales relative to the anglo-saxon ones in terms of providing results to its people , does this mean that you would trade your french system for an even less effective but more colourful one in italy -lrb- or india -rrb- ?
if so , i 'm sure there are a lot of italians and indians who would jump at that offer .
h. juneja , london , uk france may be experiencing difficulty economically and with immigration , but as a nation it should be admired for doing two things : following its own path , and being open to a real political spectrum .
one thing notably lacking amongst these commments is a sense of shared history between francophones and anglophones - canada is predicted to sky rocket to over 50 million citizens by 2040 , easily rivalling france and the uk in population ... we have the great benefit of both nations ' political and social heritage and it has done us very well .
british stoicism and french joi-de-vivre make for a vigorous and lively culture , and it should not be forgotten that whether the tories win the next election in the uk or sarkozy does win in france , the essence of their cultures wo n't change and the politicians ultimately will have to be true to the average citizen 's concept of their nation .
the us aside , doomsday scenarios just are n't realistic in the modern europe .
nathan jenkins , london , canada the only advice i can give the french people is ... do n't try to emulate britain .
if i had the means , i would have moved to france 20 years ago .
alex maricic , fife , scotland what the french want is someone who is not afraid to take on the criminals who , in the last 30 years , have turned safe and pleasant french " banlieues " into territories occupied by work-shy , integrists , anti-french delinquents issued from uncontrolled immigration .
jean-luc royer , england what amazes me is that the candidates are allowed to get away with so much .
the french tv journalists are so subservient .
what is needed is for each candidate to be given a good paxman-style grilling and then a live debate amonst themselves with a strong chairman .
john ette , le pradet , france being an american studying and working in france , i find the presidential election very interesting .
i am not sure who will win but , either way politics and democracy is alive and kicking in france and i hope it will always stay that way .
i would love it if in the usa we could have more than just two choices and two parties for our presidential elections coming up next year .
my french friends are very open about their views on the canidates and we love discussing our different perspectives of each canidate and speculating on how they would change france .
i find that the journalist of this article has n't given serious thought or consideration to the way of life and history of the french people and their political system .
having lived here for almost 2 years i was a bit offended by the tone of his article and i am not even french .
i wish the best for france and hope that no matter who wins they will do the best they can for their country and its citizens .
erin , lille , france as all the real power now rests in brussels and strasbourg maybe it ? s time for eu citizens to stop paying attention , as so many have already done , to local national elections and concentrate on how they are being represented within european institutions .
where it seems democracy plays second fiddle to bureaucracy i propose that national election candidates receive zero free air time as a first step towards shifting our attention .
a change that would be simultaneously cost effective , popular and egalitarian. mike sell , founex , switzerland i am a french citizen , living in malaysia and expect to vote in the april presidential elections .
i love my country and believe most french people are very lucky to have been born french even though , like everywhere else things could be much improved .
i am also one of the apparently unprecedented large number of undecided voters .
to put it more more simply , i find it hard to decide which of the candidates is the least unpalatable .
mitterrand , de gaulle , pompidou , giscard d 'estaing had stature , a rationally thought out political programme and a coherent vision of what france should be , whether you agreed with them or not .
this lot -lrb- royal , sarkozy , bayrou , le pen et al -rrb- are a bunch of undistinguished politicians scrambling for power .
pauvre france !
i 'll still vote because i believe it is a duty -lrb- hard won over the centuries -rrb- but without any conviction .
christine sathiah , penang , malaysia i have to say i enjoy reading rich english people living in limousin / aquitaine / languedoc-roussillon complaining about the french welfare system in happy oblivion of the rest of france , which would be destroyed in the way so many northern , scottish and welsh towns were by unrestricted thatcherism in the 1980s .
certainly , france needs economic reform if it is to go forward from where it is now , but the sort of ruthless cutthroat politics that sarkozy is advocating is frightening for people in the north of france , where the collapse of industry is still felt very strongly , and where a " tough " immigration policy would create tensions that do n't need to be exacerbated .
mark brown , lens , france i think france 's " equal time " standard , while perhaps cumbersome from a tv producer 's standpoint , is far superior to the system in the us where presidential candidates are given large endowments of public money to produce 30 second tv commercials .
the result is an enormously inefficent use of public and private resources to fund essentially smear campaigns where issue-oriented discussion is practically non-existent .
however , this would probably upset the us media lobby , so do n't expect change any time soon .
mike taylor , ann arbor , michigan usa have lived in both countries and in france presently .
sorry to disappoint everyone but there is no ideal political system wheather from the states , great britain or france and i agree with the negative points concerning the us + gb .
however the particularity of france is that the french people have been living with the myth of the " 30 glorieuses " -lrb- the best 30 economic years after ww2 -rrb- and kept to believe that it could continue for another 30 . and there is now a huge gap between the state paid employees -lrb- in the energy , and transport big dept -rrb- who enjoy work security and numerous privileges and the rest : self-employed , low payed workers from small firms , shopkeepers . who do not enjoy eany goodies and have to pay their electricity and gas and telephone bills full rate -lrb- unlike employees of edf -lrb- for electricty -rrb- or france telecom ... -rrb- i would like to know if employees from the different electricity co. in gb or us pay their electricity at reduced rate ?
sometimes you feel ! in france you are in a republic with some old fashion aristocratic / monarchist remaining that everyone moans about but not one politician dares talking about let alone question its democratic values ...
to finish france will always be a great country of contradictions where poeple love laws which loks perfect on paper but impossible to apply in real . i just hope that this time french people will refuse to be kept in the dark or above the clouds of the real economic situation -lrb- one of the highest european debt , a shrinking pension system . -rrb- and that we have to accept and adapt to this new globalisation of everything -lrb- from economy to terrorism -rrb- and think hard and suggest a real alternative ...
elisabeth , france + england i 've lived all over europe and for the last five years in paris and much as i love the city , country , culture , way of life etc .
i have to honestly say that i 've never been worse off financially .
i would probably qualify for housing benefit and several other subsidies but i 'm restricted from earning overtime .
it is a crazy situation .
if i was american i 'd vote democrat and have always considered myself centre-left but in france sarkozy is seen as extreme and if that 's the case , well i 'm extreme too. john healy , paris , france the issue of air time in the media is undermined by the way the media portait a candidate in news pieces .
for example , n sarkozy will win debates after debates but the media in france will mention his name every time there are riots for whatever reasons .
also , royal was shown as the messiah until she messed it up herself .
suddenly bayrou turns up and the media almost openly present him as the ' if you do n't want sarkozy in , vote for this no-mark ' .
basically the media -lrb- most of which has leftist ideals -rrb- do n't want sarkozy in and will do whatever they can to sink him .
shameful but so typical of the french elite -lrb- media and politics -rrb- which has put the country in this situation in the first place .
nick , london le pen 's score last time was not the fault of the minor candidates !
the first turn was won by the " leave me alone i 'm on holiday " party ; in fact the level of abstentionwas higher than the score of any candidate !
judy wood , lyon , france france desperately needs economic reform and the successful integration of immigrants into french society .
sarkozy may be able to deliver on the former but will fail miserably on the latter .
his record as interior minister is shocking in this respect and his potential election may only highten the tensions between les banlieues and the police .
royal would keep france economically uncompetitive for the duration of her presidential term and her foreign policy gaffes so far do not inspire confidence .
sarkozy will easily win the first round with royal trailing in second , but sarkozy is a polarising figure and i would not be surprised to see segolene becoming president .
ben lonsdale , manchester i am no prophet , but i forecast there will be no one from the left in the runoff .
sarkozy and le pen will eventually be the final contenders .
why ?
because french do not confess they are voting for le pen in opinion polls .
because the old far right leader has not been campaigning himself , letting his daughter marine le pen on the front line .
and she succeeded in giving a softer image of her father .
because he has criticised recent measures against smokers and speed checks and such type of demagogic speech is very popular with french .
because nothing has really changed since 21st of april 2002 but there has been the riots at the end of 2005 and the ones in gare du nord end of march 2007 and this is fuelling the protesting votes in favour of le pen .
there will be a new shock on the 22nd of april 2007 when le pen is placed in the final race .
i am no prophet , but sarkozy will be the next french president .
and what about royal in all this ?
pardon me ...
who did you say ?
antoine de champs , tours , france olivier besancenot sounds like a man who knows what he is talking about ... rightly condemning the appalling neo-liberal capitalism that has festered under both the right and the so-called left in france for far too long .
it is the unmitigated disater of the capitalist system that has created the massive unemployment and alienation , discrimination , and injustice throughout france on a vast scale.how refreshing then to hear someone putting forward a real alternative to the much hated neo-liberal capitalist nightmare of more disatrous privatisation plans for big business , which both sarkozy and royal defend .
how refreshing then to hear someone condemn the violence and discrimination of the french police .
how refreshing to hear someone defend public services and public sector workers , the right to a stable and decent job and present ideas about creating a genuine socialist alternative to capitalism .
another world is possible and another france is necessary .
segolene royal seems to be presenting the same old failed blairite right wing ideas.think again !
p.black , uk i think a new generation of politicians is now there for france , but i 'm not sure , the coming president will be accepted by the whole population .
i 'm a wee bit anxious for france 's future .
f.roux , bourges , france , you are wrong to underestimate the importance of francois bayrou and only to focus on the main both political parities : the right and the left nicolas , paris , france i 've lived in france for many years , and run a business with my husband .
yes - france has a wonderful way of life , a health system second to none , but economically , france is on its knees .
the loony left - more like an extreme version of michael foot 's socialist vision - is desperate to protect the social benefits which have been acquired over 30 years and which cripple the economy .
socialist politicians declare proudly that they do not own shares , a nasty right-wing habit of investing in industry .
madame royal claims to speak for the lowly-paid while benefiting from her salaries and perks .
in the meantime , my husband and i pay away 60 % of our earnings to support a lumbering state with its 6 million civil servants .
good luck to sarko , he 's the best of a mediocre bunch , the only one who might just bring a little egalité to france .
madeleine dickson , limoges , france an item that should be more prominent on the election agenda on both sides of politics is what should be done about the future of the world 's largest nickel deposit , new caledonia .
the country is at boiling point from a mining perspective and some leadership from france is much neeeded , after all it is her duty to do so .
sebastien carpin , brisbane , australia i agree that equal airtime for all of the candidates is a strength of the french system , but referring to the disparaging of the american electoral system as coca-cola v pepsi : in 2002 , did n't it eventually come down to le pen or chirac ?
far-right vs right ... how 's that for choice ?
khalil , boston , ma , usa i am a french citizen and have lived in the usa since the age of 8 .
i often hear many negative comments about france and europe .
i believe that these comments are born of jealousy .
while france may have its problems as everyone does i find the french approach and thought process refreshing and full of life .
i believe in the french process and have every confidence that france will prosper and the french will continue to preserve their language , culture and unique way of life in an increasing dull anglo-american world of politically correct " grey zone " .
how nice to know that there is still a country that has not sold out .
in the us , where everything including values and principles is for sale , i find it to be stale and the people in part uninterested and unmotivated beyond reaching for the next burger or bag of junk food to put a few more kilos on their already large frame , to put it nicely .
france has and will continue to be a society of free thinkers who are not afraid to voice their thoughts .
vive la france ! ! !
arthur brown , lb usa the french left needs to unite and fight for a radical redistribution of wealth and the urgent transformation of the deeply corrupt capitalist system to a socially just , participative and profoundly democratic , co-operative green socialist society based on the sustainable common ownership of the means of production .
this is an alternative as global capitalism runs amok , wreaking havoc and global climate chaos in its wake .
capitalism is doomed !
another france is possible and highly necessary .
patrick black , uk i am a sixth-form student and as i am talking about le pen in my oral exam the french elections are naturally very interesting to me .
i do n't think le pen will win -lrb- and , after extensive research the vast number of anti-semitic comments he has made over the years , i sincerely hope he wo n't win as well -rrb- but i am not convinced by either sarkozy or royal .
sarkozy seems very underhand , a man who you would imagine to be right-handed but to keep his wallet in his left-hand pocket ; royal should not be let anywhere near a microphone when it comes to foreign policy .
i do n't know much about bayrou , but i would not be appalled if he won - he appears to be the best of a bad bunch .
chris stanley , stroud , england much like american political races , advertising a politician is a political party 's biggest concern .
the bnp and ump have marketed their candidates to match the sentiment and feeling of their constituents , ms. royal feels scripted , however has an uncanny ability to improvise her responses to well thought-out questions from the press .
sarkozy swears to carry out his party 's goals but incorporates his own ideas .
however he is sheepishly stubborn towards alternative methods of carrying out policies .
i think many voters will vote based on their feelings towards each candidate and not on what policies would be best for the country .
finn raftery , seattle , united states in principle , it 's democratic to provide the same air time for all politicians who manage to get 500 mayor 's signatures in order to run for presidency .
unfortunately , the result is the exact opposite .
those who only want to rant , and have no political platform because they know that they will never be elected , feel free to lobotomize political discourse in france .
the result has been 25 years of meaningless hypocrisy .
hardly anything said has any relation to reality and as a result , very little if anything is done to address the real issues .
worse , the extremism of so many statements , along with the infamous " acquis sociaux " , on which no one will give an inch , lull people into hating work , which is , of course , " a form of oppression " of the " monstrous capitalist exploiters " .
ho hum .
and worse still , if and when sarkozy wins , the undemocratic left will not accept the result of the democratic process .
any reform will be met by attempts to totally block france by massive protest movements .
pity .
douglas mccarthy , paris , france picking up from what richard tomlinson wrote , as a british citizen living in france why will i lose my right to vote in the uk national elections when i complete my fifteenth year abroad ?
that is truly losing one 's vote , in our so-called eu of equals .
john ward , metz , france the problem in france is that french society in recent years has been turned upside down and they do not know what to do about it .
france has seen a rapid rise in immigration , unemployment and violence .
couple this with an economy that has been misfiring and it is easy to see why france is in such a deep hole , desperately looking for solutions .
it may hurt french pride , but modelling itself on great britain and taking the best of what the british have done , whilst keeping the best of french could really sort out modern france .
take immigration - why can the french not embrace multiculturalism as the british have ?
what about the economy - the british do n't seem that worried about globalisation , so why are we ? ..
the british have barely any marxists , simply because there is no place for them .
in france they offer a solution to a problem , britain has no problem -lrb- relatively -rrb- and therefore no heavy solutions need offering .
france needs to think seriously , politicians need to step back , be brave and say things that actually the french may not want to hear .
unfortunately , owing to this election , that is not going to happen , and france is not going to get any better .
frederic lacroix , paris , francais eric paul - you seem to fundamentally misunderstand american political campaigns and related us legislation .
section 315 of the us communications act details the equal time rule regulating us political campaigns .
it and subsequent amendments are very well crafted and might inform you more completely .
i do think that france 's strict equal air time rule is to be admired and is something modern democracies should strive for ; as some already do , though perhaps not in such an austere manner .
n. campbell , new orleans , usa personally i feel sorry for the french .
there is no-one worthy of the presidency today .
the choice is awful , but what must be understood is that the first round is the real choice and public opinion , the second is a knock-out to get rid of the worst candidate .
maybe they should really start thinking about voting for and not against .
be warned they are heading for thatcherism if they vote sarkozy , and we british all know what that did !
we are still paying .
i live , but sadly do n't vote , in france and have done for 15 years , this is my 3rd election .
v.miller , nancy , france the role of president urgently needs reforming -lrb- as does the whole constitution -rrb- , as no one is very sure about which role -lrb- s -rrb- he has , especially if confronted with an opposition parliament .
these elections have been the most exciting in decades , yet i do believe that none of the candidates will take the necessary stance to reform the institutions .
i also fear that due to the huge division of france into pro- and anti-sarkozy , we might very possibly end up with a cohabitation for the next five years .
the most striking aspect of this campaign is the increasing role of the media , especially television .
the majority of the french electorate will not seek information about the candidates but will expect it to come to them , mainly through television and radio -lrb- still a very popular medium , especially the morning and afternoon news -rrb- .
in such a system , the most able orators and communicators have a clear advantage .
unfortunately , these happen to be mm sarkozy and le pen .
quentin liger , london , uk well , the french system may have the advantage that we look at the candidates ' ideas and not only at how much cash they raise for their campaign .
living in the us , i came to realize that no matter what you believe in , money is the only driving force toward a warm seat at the white house .
emmanuel gilles , bronx , usa from the popularity of sarkozy , i 'd say any leanings toward marxism here are fleeing in the face of growing economic and globalization problems .
he 's a scary guy , sarko , the way he reaches for the far-right votes and disarms his critics by saying , " is it wrong to talk about national identity ?
is that a bad word ? "
because of course they ca n't say that without alienating a lot of french people !
many of my french friends here agree that the election is pitiful .
there is no one offering any real solutions to the problems threatening this country .
but it would be nice to hear more about bayrou .
he 's the most sensible by far , and the only one really trying to address the issues of immigration and discrimination .
maria alexander , aix-en-provence , france i 've had enough of this france-bashing : it is still one of the best countries to live , and i would n't even think of moving to the rainy , crowded country ruled by the nhs-dicta .
here , life is good and relaxed , the best education and health system , i pay only a little bit more than what i used to pay in the us as taxes .
the political life has not been anaesthetized like it has been in anglo-saxon countries - and we all know where that leads us : bush , born-again christians , evolution-revisionists and co .
funny that some of the french-bashing is coming from expats in france .
if it is so bad , what are you guys doing here ? : -rrb- france has a lot of problems , sure , but it is still " better " than the rest - nothing is ever perfect ..
baris tarim , caen , france one must recognise the plethora of choices available to french voters .
charles de gaulle said there are as many ideas in france as there are cheeses .
this is perfectly represented in this election with for example le pen 's far right and laguiller 's far left .
i think these extremist ideals reveal a great deal about the sense of upheaval in french society and shows how fragmented a society it is .
the unemployment , lack of economic growth , immigration are all thorny issues which are as divisive as they are polemic and the longer these particular problems last , the more it adds to le pen 's following .
as for le pen , he will always get that 10 % -15 % he consistently gets in elections because of how determined his supporters are .
his recent success though is down to a series of socio-economic problems which a series of governments , both right-wing and left-wing , have failed to solve .
cormac mac gabhann , dublin , ireland having lived in france for some time , it strikes me that its system of high job protection and generous social benefits serves only to ensure that the underprivileged few are condemned live with few prospects , a life spent literally on the margins : on the council estates bordering the big cities , dependant on the state .
no surprise that the signs of social fracture and growing dissatisfaction are plain to see .
so much for equality , freedom and brotherhood !
i do n't like sarkozy much as a person , but he seems to be the only candidate willing to undertake the drastic liberalisation that france so desperately needs .
dominic higgins , london , england eu citizens are entitled to vote in eu elections , local council and industrial tribunal elections , so richard tomlinson 's complaint is not fully accurate .
there is always the option of acquiring french nationality for the other elections .
i have done so and this is one of the reasons why .
david buick , rennes , france to mr tomlinson : as an eu citizen and permanent resident in an eu country other than your own , you are allowed to vote -lrb- and stand -rrb- in local elections : that includes city council , county council and " region " council elections .
then , just as i was not allowed to vote in the general election when i lived in the uk , you are not allowed to vote in the presidential election in france .
julien randon-furling , paris , france in my extended conversations with french citizens from all walks of life , it surprises me that most are not too far apart on issues like immigration and globalization .
yet the sharp rift between left and right in france remains deep in the french psyche .
it reaches down to a visceral level that defies logic and plays into the political strategies of career politicians .
is it possible for france to keep democracy but ditch its self-seeking party system ?
donald williams , springfield , massachusetts , usa i think it 's great that you have so many choices in france and that there is a law enforcing equal time to all .
your system makes me jealous as an american .
we are forced to choose between only two candidates who are in fact almost identical anyway .
all other parties or independents are refused any time by the media .
mark ellis , york , usa your article lacks the respect that we deserve .
you dismiss us without really looking at who we are and what we do .
the french communist party , of which i am a member , has 130,000 members and 13,000 persons that hold public offices .
your own liberal party has far fewer members .
who are you to dismiss the views of the citizens in any of these parties ?
i should remind you that many dismissed the views of democrats in the early 18th century , yet europe was transformed .
you seem to believe marxists have no place in politics today .
i , on the other hand , find your clinging to a monarchy outdated and a drain on your state 's finances .
i suppose you have the right to maintain a royal family .
i would prefer to maintain our low rate of child poverty and fight for a socialist state .
russell yates , meaux , france i am following my first election as a french resident , though not voter , and agree that the short presentations by each contender each day are very snappy and engaging .
saying something different each time holds the interest too .
the galloping music that opens each space is also attention-grabbing .
trouble is , they all sound so sincere and seem so nice !
what is important , i think , is that yes they are reading prepared material , not reacting to questions , but at least they get to finish what they have to say without being constantly interrupted .
-lrb- so many presenters take so long introducing their guest that the guest with a fascinating point to make often barely says hello before the time slot is over . -rrb-
especially in the morning , i think a straight , uninterrupted performance is more attractive than voices shouting all at once and seeing all the candidates does help sort who is who and what they stand for .
how often have you gone to vote without any idea of the face behind the name on the ballot paper ?
angela sheard , romans-sur-isère , france .
i have n't seen any evidence that a single candidate is facing up to the french budget deficit .
the whole country is living on the never-never , and that ca n't go on for ever .
andrew h , london uk the tone of the article implies that it is french democracy that is bizarre for at least attempting to ensure that all parties have an opportunity to make their platforms known .
an alternative view would be that allowing more ' popular ' parties more airtime -lrb- as in england -rrb- vastly reduces the chance of smaller parties acquiring the votes that would entitle them to greater coverage next time round .
the game is rigged from the start , and yet this is considered the norm from which the french deviate .
danny millum , london it is a very good thing that all candidates are given the same time on tv .
it means that democracy and debate are still alive and that economics and finance , and tv companies , can not impose their rule completely .
france therefore avoids to quite a large extent horrors such as the pepsi / coke us election system .
the issue is not so much about keeping marxism alive , however relevant that philosophy remains , but to avoid as much as possible that " la chose politique " becomes only a matter of experts and professional politicians , an intoxicating show in which the ordinary citizen would be only a spectator ...
thinking can only be a dynamic process when all possiblities are considered , even those which at the moment seem unreasonable .
that is why i wish that france remains as much as possible the laboratory of ideas it has been since at least the 18th century .
finance only likes ideas which like finance , which are compatible with it and i want to think freely .
as for the british system , i do n't think the british have a relation to politics which could be compared to the one the french have .
the british seem very consensual and traditional and i do n't want a two-party system for france .
eric paul , nice , france france is nothing like as poor as the uk was under wilson and callaghan .
yet talking about singing the marseillaise has some of the same desperation to find a bit of national pride as union jack underpants had in the carnaby street of the sixties .
it is odd that the country that put liberty into its national motto should have such a fear of liberalism - as if it and its multicultural cousin will come and eat them and their way of life .
but until the french realise that the rest of the world does n't owe them a living and they ca n't protect everything french by throwing protectionist money at it from higher and higher taxes , they will continue to suffer from high unemployment and the high taxes that most try to avoid paying .
there is nothing incompatible between a healthy yet well-regulated market economy and the french way of life .
but it does n't take twelve people to plant the season 's flowers on a roundabout !
ben lenthall , cahors , france another excellent analysis by mark ...
pity only that he left out francois bayrou , who tries to introduce a new political style in france .
for me it seems obvious that france has a more lively democratic culture than the uk .
compare this very open election with the passing on of power from blair to brown in the uk .
the absence of a real democratic debate in the uk is quite a shame for a country that likes to paint itself as the stalwart of democratic rule .
ronald gruenebaum , brussels , belgium unfortunately france is not the western european country where you can spot the highest level of support for the jurassic marxist ideology .
when it comes to sound representation in the two chambers of parliament this misfortune is still an italian privilege .
french marxists are a sideshow with no real power , fragmented maybe colourful.the real black spot in france is the far right - as jurassic and out of date as the marxists in italy but for france misfortune , still with some real power .
enrico ferrero , hellerup , denmark whether the french vote right or left , a man or woman , the french policy of neocolonialism and active support for unpopular puppets in africa shall continue relentlessly .
mofor tangmo edward , cameroon i think mr mardell has unknowingly or wittingly left out the factor that underlies french politics at present , fear ; unemployment , violent behaviour , poverty , institutions that no longer are able to respond to the concerns of the majority ...
paul hubball , france i am an eu citizen , am a permanent resident in france , pay my taxes here , but am not allowed to vote in the elections .
how can it be legal under eu law that we -lrb- and we are many -rrb- are excluded from the democratic process ?
richard tomlinson , mandelieu , france i am a french citizen , and , within the forseeable future , a permanent resident and taxpayer in the uk !
i cherish my right and duty to vote , and will be voting for the french president on sunday and have been frustrated at not being able to vote at important uk elections in the uk , especially when i see so many uk citizens not exercising their right to vote ! -lrb- it cost many people their lives or their freedom to ask for the right to vote , in some countries there still is no right to vote , yet , nowadays , both in the uk and in france , so many people ca n't be bothered ! ! ! -rrb-
but , i have lived here long enough now to apply for british citizenship -lrb- and am married to a british citizen -rrb- .
thankfully , now , i do not have to renounce my french nationality to do that !
-lrb- you used to be able to be only french , nothing else , or else renounce the french nationality -rrb- so , i will apply for british citizenship , it costs £ 268 , and takes up to 8 months to process , but at least i will be able to vote on uk issues and for the uk government !
richard t , perhaps you could investigate whether there is a similar possibility for you to gain these rights in france ?
helgaflower , cheltenham , uk to reply to richard tomlinson , i am a permanent resident in the uk , paying my taxes here , have been living here for 6 years now , and not allowed to vote here in the elections , because i am not a british citizen .
so england is not that much different in that case .
but i have always been a person who adored france , the culture , the country .
i have never lived there , but i am aware that burocracy makes it difficult sometimes , but with so many english people moving there , it ca n't be that bad , can it ?
they should stop complaining about it , or move back here if it 's so problematic over there .
em , manchester to richard tomlinson : under eu law an eu citizen legally resident in another member state can vote and stand in the the local and european elections , therefore you can do that in france -lrb- i 've done it in belgium -rrb- .
however , no eu member state allows non-citizens to vote in parliamentary or presidential elections , so nothing special about france there .
your anger should be directed at the british government because it is uk law which takes away your right to vote in the uk after 15 years outside of the country , something that many other european countries do not do .
it is undemocratic , but it 's got nothing to do with the eu .
rebecca , brussels to mr tomlinson , you can vote for local election in france like most of the european countries .
if you want to vote you can ask for the french citizenship thierry le romancer , paris france name your e-mail address town & country comments the bbc may edit your comments and not all emails will be published .

the foreign ministry said cairo was offended by the report which was inaccurate and unfair .
the report said torture was pervasive in police stations and prisons .
it also said egypt has become an international centre for interrogation and torture on behalf of other states as part of the " war on terror " .
the foreign ministry statement said egypt had made " real and continuous achievements in the field of human rights " .
it pointed to the establishment of the national council of human rights , a state-appointed body chaired by former un secretary general boutros boutros ghali .
' war on terror ' amnesty 's report , released on wednesday , said 18,000 people were in egyptian jails without trial , some for more than a decade .
the report calls for other countries to abandon " no torture " deals with egypt .
under such deals governments , including the uk 's , deport suspects to cairo having been assured by egyptian authorities that the suspect will not suffer torture .
the report says that many violations occur within the context of domestic and international security operations .
in 2005 , egypt 's prime minister acknowledged that since 2001 the us had transferred some 60-70 detainees to egypt as part of the " war on terror " .
