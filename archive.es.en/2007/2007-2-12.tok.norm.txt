" the results of this referendum are clear , it proves that the portuguese people want to turn the page on the question of abortion , " socrates said . but turnout in portugal 's second referendum on its abortion law in less than a decade was 43.6 percent , below the 50 percent threshold needed to make the ballot legally binding . socrates pledged his socialist government will now use its parliamentary majority to legalize abortion . portugal abortion laws among most restrictive in eu abortion is currently allowed in portugal only in cases of rape , a malformed fetus or if the woman 's well-being is in danger . a woman can be jailed for up to three years for having an illegal abortion while those who perform them face up to eight years behind bars . within the 27-nation european union only ireland , malta and poland have abortion laws that are similar or even more restrictive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose socrates believes the yes vote will lead to a more tolerant portugal socrates , elected in a landslide in 2005 , said the new law would be modeled on legislation in place in other european nations and would require a reflection period before an abortion can be carried out . " it is my sincere conviction that with the result of this referendum portugal has taken another step in the creation of a society that is more open , tolerant and just , " he said . catholic church opposed to easing law opposition to change was led by the influential catholic church which argued the government should do more to help women to have children instead of easing abortion restrictions . one priest threatened catholics who voted to ease the law with excommunication from the church .
the bishop of the northern city of braganca likened abortion to the execution of former iraqi leader saddam hussein . more than 90 percent of portugal 's population of 10.6 million identify themselves as being roman catholic although , as in other catholic countries , regular church attendance is on the decline . in a referendum held in 1998 voters upheld the existing abortion law by a whisker but the result was declared void as nearly seven out of 10 voters stayed away . during the last referendum the socialists were split with then prime minister , antonio guterres , publicly opposed to the abortion law being changed . a " national shame " socrates by contrast has backed liberalization at rallies across the country and this time it was the main opposition centre-right social democrats that was divided on the issue .
the party did not adopt an official position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say backstreet abortions in portugal are risky since the last referendum , several trials of women charged with illegally terminating their pregnancies were held that generated widespread public sympathy for the women .
analysts said this helped boost support for reform . during the campaign socrates called backstreet abortions a " national shame " and cast the referendum as a test of portugal 's readiness for progress . pro-abortion groups estimate that some 10,000 women are hospitalized , and several die every year from complications arising from botched backstreet abortions . anti-abortion groups contest the figure . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government discusses reducing late abortions parliamentary leaders met with church representatives tuesday to talk about reforming legislation on late abortions , as conservatives push for more stringent controls on terminations and a re-think of who foots the bill .

" russia again claims a place in the first row , and with its nuclear arsenal , its size , and its oil and gas riches it has , by all means , weighty arguments , " wrote the munich daily süddeutsche zeitung in its monday edition .
" the usa offers another with its disastrous iraq adventure .
since that weakens western credibility , it creates the opportunity for putin to set himself up as the powerful voice of the growing number of countries and peoples who are stricken by doubt in the wisdom of western policies .
the russian president has laid his cards on the table .
europe and america now know where russia has positioned itself . " " in vladimir putin 's controlled ' democracy , ' power-political rowdiness is at least as pronounced as the need for cooperation , " commented the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily .
" in view of the general development of the past years , it 's assumedly even somewhat greater at the moment - as a signal from the kremlin that russia ' is back . '
one reason why putin acts as he did in munich and why russia ' is back ' in world politics has come to light : it is the petrol power that straightened out its self-confidence again .
in addition , comes the knowledge that america and its european allies want to have russia by their side in dealing with conflicts , and the correct appraisal that the bush administration currently finds itself in anything but a comfortable situation , " the paper continued . " how does one deal with putin 's munich blunder ? " asked the westdeutsche zeitung from düsseldorf .
" glossing over it , as some europeans try to do , would be just as wrong as responding with more verbal poison .
in view of worldwide problems , it 's important that russia remains level-headed and collaborates on finding solutions .
the next test will be the expiration of the un 's 60-day deadline for iran to discontinue its nuclear program , at the end of february .
now more than ever russia is unlikely to back a further un resolution . "
the times of london said monday that putin 's harsh comments were more than just another repeat of the bush administration 's mistakes .
" if the us administration didn ’ t have enough to worry about , given the current state of the world , it spent much of the weekend wondering whether moscow had declared another cold war … not since nikita khrushchev banged his shoe on the table at the united nations in 1960 has an international gathering heard such an icy blast from moscow ’ s leadership . " conservative french newspaper le figaro noted putin had increased the hostile tone between russia and the united states as part of his crusade against washington .
" this was vladimir putin 's variations on an old theme .
many participants at the security conference asked themselves the question of whether the second cold war was being announced in munich . " putin wants to make it clear that he wo n't allow outsiders to meddle in russia 's domestic affairs , said budapest newspaper nepszabadsag .
" should that be a cold war ?
or only an expression of the self-confident unity of an energy supplier equipped with enormous foreign exchange reserves ?
is ' soverign democracy ' not merely a pretty name for new authoritarianism ?
there is currently no confrontation .
there are discussions .
these wo n't allow the disruption of dialogue about foreign and arms policy , over the issue of eastern european democracies and the human rights .
at least not for the time being . " bulgarian newspaper dnewnik warned that europe 's energy dependence gives putin power .
" the current strategy of the kremlin is to strike while the iron is hot - namely so long as europe depends on russia to supply a fifth of its energy needs . " dw staff -lrb- ncy / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us defense chief to putin : " one cold war was enough " us defense secretary robert gates on sunday dismissed a stinging broadside against the united states by russian president vladimir putin , declaring : " one cold war was quite enough .

a majority of israeli and american jews now have positive views of germany , according to a new study . jewish opinions of germany have improved dramatically when compared to a major survey done in 1991 .
shortly after german reunification , jews in israel and the united states felt germans continued to hold anti-semitic beliefs and that the country was not on a stable democratic footing . those perceptions , however , have changed significantly during the past 15 years , according to the bertelsmann foundation study , which was released sunday . increase in favorable opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the holocaust remains a central issue to german-jewish relations a majority of israelis , 57 percent , now have a favorable opinion of germany , an increase of 48 percent since a similar poll was conducted in 1991 .
more than 70 percent of american jews see germany favorably , according to the bertelsmann study . according to the 1991 survey nearly 80 percent of israelis felt germany was endangered by extremist groups , a feeling now shared by 46 percent of those surveyed . during the same time , there 's been an increase in the number of germans who feel shame for the crimes committed against the jewish people and who are unwilling to ignore the past and " move on , " according to the report . although nearly half of jews in israel and the us still suspect a majority of germans hold anti-semitic beliefs , the survey found that these beliefs are on the wane in germany . " it is quite apparent that the centers of the two societies now have a much more positive attitude towards one another than they did in the early 90s , " werner weidenfeld , executive board member at the bertelsmann foundation , said in a statement .
" overall the ways germans and israelis perceive one another have become a lot less controversial and much more relaxed . " in israel , only 9 percent believe reconciliation with germany remains impossible , down from 69 percent in 1991 . political views differ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jews and germans have different outlooks towards war the survey , however , showed a difference of opinion between jews and germans when it comes to dealing with current events . three of four israelis polled were in favor of the deployment of german bundeswehr forces to the coast of lebanon .
in contrast , only 49 percent of germans support the deployment , where german boats patrol as part of international efforts to stop weapons from being smuggled to hezbollah guerrillas in lebanon . likewise , 80 percent of israelis and 72 percent of american jews surveyed support a military strike against iran if the country is found to have built an atomic bomb .
only 32 percent of germans consider that level of military action justified . " with their different historical memories , but also with their completely different political realities , germans and israelis have completely different political cultures , " said stephan vopel , project director at the bertelsmann foundation .
" this gives rise to strong disparities in formulating ways to deal with conflicts .

a majority of israeli and american jews now have positive views of germany , according to a new study . jewish opinions of germany have improved dramatically when compared to a major survey done in 1991 .
shortly after german reunification , jews in israel and the united states felt germans continued to hold anti-semitic beliefs and that the country was not on a stable democratic footing . those perceptions , however , have changed significantly during the past 15 years , according to the bertelsmann foundation study , which was released sunday . increase in favorable opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the holocaust remains a central issue to german-jewish relations a majority of israelis , 57 percent , now have a favorable opinion of germany , an increase of 48 percent since a similar poll was conducted in 1991 .
more than 70 percent of american jews see germany favorably , according to the bertelsmann study . according to the 1991 survey nearly 80 percent of israelis felt germany was endangered by extremist groups , a feeling now shared by 46 percent of those surveyed . during the same time , there 's been an increase in the number of germans who feel shame for the crimes committed against the jewish people and who are unwilling to ignore the past and " move on , " according to the report . although nearly half of jews in israel and the us still suspect a majority of germans hold anti-semitic beliefs , the survey found that these beliefs are on the wane in germany . " it is quite apparent that the centers of the two societies now have a much more positive attitude towards one another than they did in the early 90s , " werner weidenfeld , executive board member at the bertelsmann foundation , said in a statement .

in contrast , only 49 percent of germans support the deployment , where german boats patrol as part of international efforts to stop weapons from being smuggled to hezbollah guerrillas in lebanon . likewise , 80 percent of israelis and 72 percent of american jews surveyed support a military strike against iran if the country is found to have built an atomic bomb .
only 32 percent of germans consider that level of military action justified . " with their different historical memories , but also with their completely different political realities , germans and israelis have completely different political cultures , " said stephan vopel , project director at the bertelsmann foundation .
" this gives rise to strong disparities in formulating ways to deal with conflicts .

" russia again claims a place in the first row , and with its nuclear arsenal , its size , and its oil and gas riches it has , by all means , weighty arguments , " wrote the munich daily süddeutsche zeitung in its monday edition .
" the usa offers another with its disastrous iraq adventure .
since that weakens western credibility , it creates the opportunity for putin to set himself up as the powerful voice of the growing number of countries and peoples who are stricken by doubt in the wisdom of western policies .
the russian president has laid his cards on the table .
europe and america now know where russia has positioned itself . " " in vladimir putin 's controlled ' democracy , ' power-political rowdiness is at least as pronounced as the need for cooperation , " commented the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily .
" in view of the general development of the past years , it 's assumedly even somewhat greater at the moment - as a signal from the kremlin that russia ' is back . '
one reason why putin acts as he did in munich and why russia ' is back ' in world politics has come to light : it is the petrol power that straightened out its self-confidence again .
in addition , comes the knowledge that america and its european allies want to have russia by their side in dealing with conflicts , and the correct appraisal that the bush administration currently finds itself in anything but a comfortable situation , " the paper continued . " how does one deal with putin 's munich blunder ? " asked the westdeutsche zeitung from düsseldorf .
" glossing over it , as some europeans try to do , would be just as wrong as responding with more verbal poison .
in view of worldwide problems , it 's important that russia remains level-headed and collaborates on finding solutions .
the next test will be the expiration of the un 's 60-day deadline for iran to discontinue its nuclear program , at the end of february .
now more than ever russia is unlikely to back a further un resolution . "
the times of london said monday that putin 's harsh comments were more than just another repeat of the bush administration 's mistakes .
" if the us administration didn ’ t have enough to worry about , given the current state of the world , it spent much of the weekend wondering whether moscow had declared another cold war … not since nikita khrushchev banged his shoe on the table at the united nations in 1960 has an international gathering heard such an icy blast from moscow ’ s leadership . " conservative french newspaper le figaro noted putin had increased the hostile tone between russia and the united states as part of his crusade against washington .
" this was vladimir putin 's variations on an old theme .
many participants at the security conference asked themselves the question of whether the second cold war was being announced in munich . " putin wants to make it clear that he wo n't allow outsiders to meddle in russia 's domestic affairs , said budapest newspaper nepszabadsag .
" should that be a cold war ?
or only an expression of the self-confident unity of an energy supplier equipped with enormous foreign exchange reserves ?
is ' soverign democracy ' not merely a pretty name for new authoritarianism ?
there is currently no confrontation .
there are discussions .
these wo n't allow the disruption of dialogue about foreign and arms policy , over the issue of eastern european democracies and the human rights .
at least not for the time being . " bulgarian newspaper dnewnik warned that europe 's energy dependence gives putin power .

" russia again claims a place in the first row , and with its nuclear arsenal , its size , and its oil and gas riches it has , by all means , weighty arguments , " wrote the munich daily süddeutsche zeitung in its monday edition .
" the usa offers another with its disastrous iraq adventure .
since that weakens western credibility , it creates the opportunity for putin to set himself up as the powerful voice of the growing number of countries and peoples who are stricken by doubt in the wisdom of western policies .
the russian president has laid his cards on the table .
europe and america now know where russia has positioned itself . " " in vladimir putin 's controlled ' democracy , ' power-political rowdiness is at least as pronounced as the need for cooperation , " commented the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily .
" in view of the general development of the past years , it 's assumedly even somewhat greater at the moment - as a signal from the kremlin that russia ' is back . '
one reason why putin acts as he did in munich and why russia ' is back ' in world politics has come to light : it is the petrol power that straightened out its self-confidence again .
in addition , comes the knowledge that america and its european allies want to have russia by their side in dealing with conflicts , and the correct appraisal that the bush administration currently finds itself in anything but a comfortable situation , " the paper continued . " how does one deal with putin 's munich blunder ? " asked the westdeutsche zeitung from düsseldorf .
" glossing over it , as some europeans try to do , would be just as wrong as responding with more verbal poison .
in view of worldwide problems , it 's important that russia remains level-headed and collaborates on finding solutions .
the next test will be the expiration of the un 's 60-day deadline for iran to discontinue its nuclear program , at the end of february .
now more than ever russia is unlikely to back a further un resolution . "
the times of london said monday that putin 's harsh comments were more than just another repeat of the bush administration 's mistakes .
" if the us administration didn ’ t have enough to worry about , given the current state of the world , it spent much of the weekend wondering whether moscow had declared another cold war … not since nikita khrushchev banged his shoe on the table at the united nations in 1960 has an international gathering heard such an icy blast from moscow ’ s leadership . " conservative french newspaper le figaro noted putin had increased the hostile tone between russia and the united states as part of his crusade against washington .
" this was vladimir putin 's variations on an old theme .
many participants at the security conference asked themselves the question of whether the second cold war was being announced in munich . " putin wants to make it clear that he wo n't allow outsiders to meddle in russia 's domestic affairs , said budapest newspaper nepszabadsag .
" should that be a cold war ?
or only an expression of the self-confident unity of an energy supplier equipped with enormous foreign exchange reserves ?
is ' soverign democracy ' not merely a pretty name for new authoritarianism ?
there is currently no confrontation .
there are discussions .
these wo n't allow the disruption of dialogue about foreign and arms policy , over the issue of eastern european democracies and the human rights .
at least not for the time being . " bulgarian newspaper dnewnik warned that europe 's energy dependence gives putin power .
" the current strategy of the kremlin is to strike while the iron is hot - namely so long as europe depends on russia to supply a fifth of its energy needs . " dw staff -lrb- ncy / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us defense chief to putin : " one cold war was enough " us defense secretary robert gates on sunday dismissed a stinging broadside against the united states by russian president vladimir putin , declaring : " one cold war was quite enough .

more than 70 percent of american jews see germany favorably , according to the bertelsmann study . according to the 1991 survey nearly 80 percent of israelis felt germany was endangered by extremist groups , a feeling now shared by 46 percent of those surveyed . during the same time , there 's been an increase in the number of germans who feel shame for the crimes committed against the jewish people and who are unwilling to ignore the past and " move on , " according to the report . although nearly half of jews in israel and the us still suspect a majority of germans hold anti-semitic beliefs , the survey found that these beliefs are on the wane in germany .

" mohnhaupt will serve the remainder of her sentence on parole . the case has revived painful memories of the raf 's violent campaign of the 1970s . also known as the baader-meinhof gang after its founders andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , the red army faction murdered a string of high-profile german establishment figures from 1977 to 1982 as it attempted to bring down what it considered an oppressive capitalist state . the group is suspected of killing 34 people between 1972 and 1991 .
some 26 raf members died during that period and another 26 were sentenced to life in prison . mohnhaupt , now 57 , had risen to the ranks of the raf 's " second-generation " leadership in 1977 .
she has never explicitly apologized for the bloodshed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of schleyer , held hostage by the raf for over a month , became an iconic image of 1970s west germany in 1977 , mohnhaupt took part in the abductions and subsequent murders of west germany 's chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback , head of the west german employers ' federation hanns-martin schleyer and dresdner bank chief executive jürgen ponto .
brigitte mohnhaupt was captured in 1982 , convicted of involvement in nine murders and sentenced to five life sentences in 1985 . mohnhaupt has already made nine excursions from prison , with armed police watching her , to prepare her for a changed world that is connected up by the internet and only dimly remembers communism , which began crumbling in europe in 1989 . monday 's court decision does not come as a surprise , since prosecutors had previously supported mohnhaupt 's bid for parole at a closed hearing in stuttgart on january 22 . other raf members await clemency the former terrorist had petitioned for parole once already on feb 21 , 2006 , but was rejected because she had not yet served the minimum required sentence of 24 years , a provision that grew out of the " unusual gravity of the crime . "
that sentence expires on march 26 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar is still awaiting a decision on his plea for clemency mohnhaupt 's release comes at the same time as another petition for clemency filed by convicted red army faction leader christian klar .
because klar , 54 , still has two years to serve before qualifying for possible parole , his only chance for an early release is a special pardon from german president horst köhler , who is currently reviewing the case .
former president johannes rau already rejected a previous petition for clemency . klar , who like mohnhaupt came from a well-off family and went to university to study philosophy before becoming a terrorist , is reported to have been well behaved in jail .
a berlin theatre has promised him a two-year staff internship if he is released . klar has also never renounced his ideas , telling an interviewer in 2001 he still wanted germany to make a " fresh start " and would never abjure what the raf had done , " though i do not contemplate reviving the armed struggle . " both mohnhaupt and klar 's cases have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against some politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . besides klar , the only other members of the raf still in prison are eva haule and birgit hogefeld . most of the terrorist organization 's original leaders committed suicide in jail during the 1970s . the group abandoned violence in 1992 and formally disbanded in 1998 . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we need proof that the german state is capable of mercy " gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison .

" mohnhaupt will serve the remainder of her sentence on parole . the case has revived painful memories of the raf 's violent campaign of the 1970s . also known as the baader-meinhof gang after its founders andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , the red army faction murdered a string of high-profile german establishment figures from 1977 to 1982 as it attempted to bring down what it considered an oppressive capitalist state . the group is suspected of killing 34 people between 1972 and 1991 .
some 26 raf members died during that period and another 26 were sentenced to life in prison . mohnhaupt , now 57 , had risen to the ranks of the raf 's " second-generation " leadership in 1977 .
she has never explicitly apologized for the bloodshed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of schleyer , held hostage by the raf for over a month , became an iconic image of 1970s west germany in 1977 , mohnhaupt took part in the abductions and subsequent murders of west germany 's chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback , head of the west german employers ' federation hanns-martin schleyer and dresdner bank chief executive jürgen ponto .
brigitte mohnhaupt was captured in 1982 , convicted of involvement in nine murders and sentenced to five life sentences in 1985 . mohnhaupt has already made nine excursions from prison , with armed police watching her , to prepare her for a changed world that is connected up by the internet and only dimly remembers communism , which began crumbling in europe in 1989 . monday 's court decision does not come as a surprise , since prosecutors had previously supported mohnhaupt 's bid for parole at a closed hearing in stuttgart on january 22 . other raf members await clemency the former terrorist had petitioned for parole once already on feb 21 , 2006 , but was rejected because she had not yet served the minimum required sentence of 24 years , a provision that grew out of the " unusual gravity of the crime . "
that sentence expires on march 26 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar is still awaiting a decision on his plea for clemency mohnhaupt 's release comes at the same time as another petition for clemency filed by convicted red army faction leader christian klar .
because klar , 54 , still has two years to serve before qualifying for possible parole , his only chance for an early release is a special pardon from german president horst köhler , who is currently reviewing the case .
former president johannes rau already rejected a previous petition for clemency . klar , who like mohnhaupt came from a well-off family and went to university to study philosophy before becoming a terrorist , is reported to have been well behaved in jail .
a berlin theatre has promised him a two-year staff internship if he is released . klar has also never renounced his ideas , telling an interviewer in 2001 he still wanted germany to make a " fresh start " and would never abjure what the raf had done , " though i do not contemplate reviving the armed struggle . " both mohnhaupt and klar 's cases have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against some politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . besides klar , the only other members of the raf still in prison are eva haule and birgit hogefeld . most of the terrorist organization 's original leaders committed suicide in jail during the 1970s . the group abandoned violence in 1992 and formally disbanded in 1998 . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we need proof that the german state is capable of mercy " gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 12.02.2007 portugal to legalize abortion after referendum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-choice activists handed out campaign leaflets with the word " yes " in downtown lisbon portugal 's prime minister jose socrates vowed sunday to legalize abortion after voters backed the move in a referendum even though turnout was not high enough to make it binding . nearly 60 percent of those who cast ballots in the predominantly roman catholic country approved a government proposal to give all women the right to an abortion up to the 10th week of pregnancy , according to official final results . " the results of this referendum are clear , it proves that the portuguese people want to turn the page on the question of abortion , " socrates said . but turnout in portugal 's second referendum on its abortion law in less than a decade was 43.6 percent , below the 50 percent threshold needed to make the ballot legally binding . socrates pledged his socialist government will now use its parliamentary majority to legalize abortion . portugal abortion laws among most restrictive in eu abortion is currently allowed in portugal only in cases of rape , a malformed fetus or if the woman 's well-being is in danger . a woman can be jailed for up to three years for having an illegal abortion while those who perform them face up to eight years behind bars . within the 27-nation european union only ireland , malta and poland have abortion laws that are similar or even more restrictive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose socrates believes the yes vote will lead to a more tolerant portugal socrates , elected in a landslide in 2005 , said the new law would be modeled on legislation in place in other european nations and would require a reflection period before an abortion can be carried out . " it is my sincere conviction that with the result of this referendum portugal has taken another step in the creation of a society that is more open , tolerant and just , " he said . catholic church opposed to easing law opposition to change was led by the influential catholic church which argued the government should do more to help women to have children instead of easing abortion restrictions . one priest threatened catholics who voted to ease the law with excommunication from the church .

it 's unclear whether the kidnappers want ransom money or political concessions .
the victims ' family in germany have allegedly been contacted by the kidnappers . a german woman and her son who had lived in iraq for years went missing approximately a week ago . german authorities were alerted to the abduction after kidnappers contacted the missing man 's sister , who lives in berlin .
she in turn contacted german authorities , the berliner zeitung reported tuesday .
the abductors have yet to make demands .
it is unclear whether they want money , political concessions or both , according to the newspaper , which cited unnamed security sources . berlin daily tagesspiegel said one victim is a german national in her 60s who lives in baghdad and is married to an iraqi doctor . the second victim is her adult son who is believed to work at the iraqi foreign ministry , according to the paper . the identities of the victims have not been released .
the tagesspiegel also reported that kidnappers had contacted family of the victims who live in berlin and other parts of germany .
the kidnappers has not made demands , but threatened to kill the son , the tagesspiegel reported . the german foreign ministry wo n't say whether contact has been made with the kidnappers .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier confirmed monday that two german nationals have been missing in iraq for almost a week . " we can not rule out that it was a kidnapping by force , " he told reporters at an eu meeting . motivation for kidnapping unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier would not give reporters any details on the alleged kidnapping berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper reported that the family was considered wealthy by iraqi standards and was probably victim to a targeted kidnapping . germany 's ntv news channel said the crisis team set up by the german government was apparently working with mediators , but the foreign ministry declined to confirm that this was the case . " we hope that everything works out well and we are doing everything in our power to ensure that the two germans are returned safely to their families , " steinmeier said . according to the german foreign ministry there are still about a hundred german nationals in iraq , people working for german and international companies or diplomatic services .
germany has issued a security warning on travel to iraq due to the unstable security environment there as iraqi authorities are grappling with kidnappings and killings of foreigners . kidnappings of germans not the first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was kidnapped and later released in iraq only about a year ago , two german technicians , rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke , were released by their kidnappers after a three-month hostage ordeal .
and in november 2005 susanne osthoff , a german archeologist working for an aid organization , was released after the german government allegedly paid a ransom to the tune of several million euros . the german government has staunchly denied this saying that it doesn ’ t make deals with terrorists .
the complete media ban in the current case , however , suggests that officials may already be working behind the scenes to try and establish a contact with the kidnappers . the most urgent question is whether hostages are held by kidnappers seeking a ransom or by islamic fundamentalists with a political motive .
these terrorists aim to drive western out of the iraq and do n't shy away from killing their victims to put their message across . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , others paid millions for iraq hostages , report says in spite of denials by top officials , germany , france and italy reportedly paid $ 45 million for hostages taken in iraq , a london newspaper reported .

" mohnhaupt will serve the remainder of her sentence on parole . the case has revived painful memories of the raf 's violent campaign of the 1970s . also known as the baader-meinhof gang after its founders andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , the red army faction murdered a string of high-profile german establishment figures from 1977 to 1982 as it attempted to bring down what it considered an oppressive capitalist state . the group is suspected of killing 34 people between 1972 and 1991 .
some 26 raf members died during that period and another 26 were sentenced to life in prison . mohnhaupt , now 57 , had risen to the ranks of the raf 's " second-generation " leadership in 1977 .
she has never explicitly apologized for the bloodshed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of schleyer , held hostage by the raf for over a month , became an iconic image of 1970s west germany in 1977 , mohnhaupt took part in the abductions and subsequent murders of west germany 's chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback , head of the west german employers ' federation hanns-martin schleyer and dresdner bank chief executive jürgen ponto .
brigitte mohnhaupt was captured in 1982 , convicted of involvement in nine murders and sentenced to five life sentences in 1985 . mohnhaupt has already made nine excursions from prison , with armed police watching her , to prepare her for a changed world that is connected up by the internet and only dimly remembers communism , which began crumbling in europe in 1989 . monday 's court decision does not come as a surprise , since prosecutors had previously supported mohnhaupt 's bid for parole at a closed hearing in stuttgart on january 22 . other raf members await clemency the former terrorist had petitioned for parole once already on feb 21 , 2006 , but was rejected because she had not yet served the minimum required sentence of 24 years , a provision that grew out of the " unusual gravity of the crime . "
that sentence expires on march 26 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar is still awaiting a decision on his plea for clemency mohnhaupt 's release comes at the same time as another petition for clemency filed by convicted red army faction leader christian klar .
because klar , 54 , still has two years to serve before qualifying for possible parole , his only chance for an early release is a special pardon from german president horst köhler , who is currently reviewing the case .
former president johannes rau already rejected a previous petition for clemency . klar , who like mohnhaupt came from a well-off family and went to university to study philosophy before becoming a terrorist , is reported to have been well behaved in jail .
a berlin theatre has promised him a two-year staff internship if he is released . klar has also never renounced his ideas , telling an interviewer in 2001 he still wanted germany to make a " fresh start " and would never abjure what the raf had done , " though i do not contemplate reviving the armed struggle . " both mohnhaupt and klar 's cases have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against some politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . besides klar , the only other members of the raf still in prison are eva haule and birgit hogefeld . most of the terrorist organization 's original leaders committed suicide in jail during the 1970s . the group abandoned violence in 1992 and formally disbanded in 1998 . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we need proof that the german state is capable of mercy " gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison .

while it does not mention independence many see the plan as leading to the breakaway province 's eventual separation from serbia , something that belgrade opposes . the foreign ministers , whom the un envoy will meet during one of their regular meetings in brussels , face a difficult task in reaching agreement over how to handle belgrade politically .
the kosovo / serbia issue is of particular interest to them as the eu is preparing to take control of united nations mission in kosovo , which has administered the province for the last eight years in collaboration with nato and 17,000 kfor troops . also , both serbia and kosovo are seen by many as possible future eu members .
fears of separatism ahtisaari 's settlement plan worries some countries which fear political fallout into their own separatism problems if kosovo and its mainly albanian population are allowed to go it alone , european sources said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari has a tough task the most nervous nations are cyprus , romania and spain , according to one source . another concern is the possible effect on the secessionist tendencies in the republika srpska , the serb half of bosnia . " i think the judgment is ... that these concerns are outweighed by the advantages that come from settling the last big constitutional issue in the balkans , " the european source said .
" if you put this issue to bed you can say to the whole region : ' that 's it , time to get on with moving towards the european union . " ' serbia 's first step towards that goal , talks on a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , are stalled over its failure to cooperate fully with the un war crimes tribunal - shorthand for its failure to track down former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , who is indicted for genocide . the hope is that a new serb coalition government , currently cobbled together following a general election last month , will provide the fresh start needed to get back to the negotiating table .
eu divided however there are sharp differences within the eu over whether to encourage serbia by reopening the saa talks or to insist first that they cooperate with the hague-based court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kfor troops have been at work in kosovo for eight years austria , italy and spain want to see talks with the serbs reopen , but not be concluded , before full cooperation with the court is achieved .
others , including belgium and the netherlands , feel compliance must be a prerequisite for restarting talks . though formally still part of serbia , kosovo has been run by a un mission since 1999 , after nato 's aerial bombardment drove out forces loyal to then serbian leader slobodan milosevic over a crackdown on ethnic albanians . ahtisaari will hold talks with serbs and kosovars from feb .
21 before presenting his final propositions to the un security council , probably in late march .
deaths after protest to un plan two people injured in violent clashes with police during a pro-independence protest in kosovo died of their wounds sunday , a police spokesman there said .
they two were among 25 people hospitalized after a protest in pristina on saturday against the un plan for the future of kosovo . the demonstration turned violent with anti-riot police firing tear gas and rubber bullets at several thousand ethnic albanians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests got out of hand in pristina " it is regrettable that two lives were lost as a result of a wanton breach of security at government buildings , " un police commissioner stephen curtis said in a statement .
eu police for afghanistan also on their brussels agenda , the eu foreign ministers will welcome the agreement thrashed out between the fatah and hamas groups on forming a palestinian government of national unity . the eu 27 are also set to give the green light on monday for a european mission to afghanistan aimed at training the local police force , according to diplomatic sources .
some 160 european police officers , aided by 50-70 experts , will help " to establish an afghan police force which respects human rights and operates on that basis on the central , regional and provincial levels , " according to the draft conclusion to be adopted by the eu foreign ministers . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un briefly delays kosovo talks to accommodate serbs a final round of un-backed negotiations on the future status of kosovo - the serbian province whose ethnic albanian majority is craving independence - will be postponed by one week and start on feb .

" they could not prove a link between zammar and the september attacks so they sentenced him for belonging to the muslim brotherhood when he was not wanted by syria for belonging to the group in the first place , " qurabi said . zammar 's lawyer mohanad al-husni told reuters his client had always maintained his innocence .
" this religious man had the misfortune of frequenting the same mosques in hamburg as al qaeda members .
he kept telling the judge he had no organizational links with any muslim group , " husni said . zammar was handed over to syrian custody in december 2001 , just two weeks after his arrest in morocco .
his trial opened last october . he was briefly detained in germany in october 2001 as he was suspected of having had contacts with mohammed atta , who headed a hamburg cell of islamic extremists before leading the september 11 hijacks and suicide attacks .
he was later released due to insufficient evidence . german news magazine der spiegel reported that six members of the german intelligence services interrogated zammar at length in syria 's far filastin prison in november 2002 . alleged torture after cia rendition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror suspects have been flown to third nations by the cia zammar is suspected of being one of a growing number of detainees flown by the cia from their point of capture to a third state , such as syria , under washington 's policy of " rendition " where interrogation and torture are undertaken .
" he has been subjected to beating and torture i can not even describe , " husni said .
zammar was visited once by red cross officials . the suspected collaboration of the german and american intelligence services in the zammar affair forms part of the brief of a parliamentary inquiry currently under way in germany .
" the germans had him , " husni said .
" they would not have let him go if he had anything to do with the attacks . " der spiegel reported that the cia and the us federal bureau of investigation had asked germany 's bka criminal police several times in late 2001 for information on the hamburg-based zammar , his identity , his previous history , and his environment . at the end of november 2001 , the bka replied that it was closely monitoring his presence in morocco and he planned to take a flight with dutch airline klm heading back to germany on december 8 . on the orders of the cia , the suspect was arrested at casablanca airport .

the complete media ban in the current case , however , suggests that officials may already be working behind the scenes to try and establish a contact with the kidnappers . the most urgent question is whether hostages are held by kidnappers seeking a ransom or by islamic fundamentalists with a political motive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 12.02.2007 iran faces eu punishment for nuclear obstinacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has refused to give up its nuclear ambitions even while hoping for a new window of opportunity to start negotiations with tehran , eu ministers agreed monday to imposing sanctions against iran for continuing its uranium enrichment program . european union foreign ministers meeting monday in brussels put iran on notice that it will be punished for refusing to suspend its uranium enrichment program . the ministers endorsed a united nations security council resolution passed in december .
the sanctions prohibit countries from exporting nuclear and weapons technology to iran as well as impose visa bans and freeze assets of some iranian officials . " we want to maintain an door open for negotiation , but iran knows what we want them to do , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said . germany , france and england , backed by solana , offered iran political and economic incentives to suspend uranium enrichment .
despite the decision to impose sanctions , the eu says that offer still stands . enriched uranium can be used to make atomic weapons .
iran claims it is developing nuclear technology only to meet its energy needs .
europe and the united states , however , fear tehran wants to develop a nuclear arsenal under cover of a civilian nuclear program . open to negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign ministers decided to approve un sanctions at a meeting in brussels german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said a sunday speech made by ari larijani , iran 's top nuclear negotiator , could signal that iran wants to return to and continue negotiations . " now what we have to do is look at the proposal that iran is presenting and see if this paves the way back to the negotiating table , " steinmeier said . steinmeier said he and solana both thought there was an opportunity to reopen talks . " we both have the impression that in iran there is a new ambition to return to the negotiating table , " steinmeier told reporters monday , referring to meetings he and solana conducted with larijani .
" in the course of the next few days , we will have to sound out whether they -lrb- iran -rrb- can pursue that line . " we need to see what the signals are from iran , whether they are serious , " steinmeier added . " possibilities are not immense " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe still wants to negotiate with iran larijani said iran wants a negotiated settlement and does n't want to aggravate the tense political situation in the region . solana , however , was cautious , saying " the possibilities are not immense " and that he had yet to hear any new proposals from iran . on friday , the international atomic energy agency cut its aid package to iran by nearly 50 percent .
the cuts were meant to send a strong message to iran to shut down its uranium enrichment activities . " sanctions are one part of the double track approach we are taking in europe , " said spanish state secretary for european affairs alberto navarro .
" we know it is just the first step and these sanctions should be gradual . " iran risks more extensive economic sanctions if it fails to comply with a un security council deadline later this month to stop enrichment . eu ready to give serbia a new chance the ministers also said they were willing to give eu-hopeful serbia " a new chance " for talks on closer ties , but stressed that a resumption of stalled negotiations would depend on belgrade 's determination to arrest fugitives suspected of war crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ministers condemned violence that occurred in kosovo over the weekend steinmeier told reporters that a new serbian government must " live up to its responsibilities and cooperate with icty , " the united nations international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . " a new reform and europe-oriented government can make a new start , get back on the road to europe and regain lost time , " said eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn .
" this new government deserves a new chance . " belgrade must investigate war crimes however , rehn said the eu would resume suspended talks with serbia only if the new government took " concrete action " and showed " clear commitment " in the search for fugitive bosnian serb general ratko mladic and other key war crimes suspects . " full cooperation with icty remains the necessary condition for the pace and conclusions of stabilization talks , " rehn said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martti ahtisaari presented his proposal for kosovo and serbia on feb .
2 the 27-member bloc froze negotiations on closer economic and political ties - the first step towards eu membership - with serbia in may 2006 , demanding belgrade show " full cooperation " with the hague-based tribunal . eu foreign ministers also said that they were fully supporting a united nations plan that sets serbia 's breakaway region kosovo on the road to independence . the plans by un envoy for kosovo , martti ahtisaari , " provide comprehensive arrangements designed to promote in kosovo a multi-ethnic and democratic society based on the rule of law , " they said . belgrade and pristina must " participate actively and constructively " in upcoming talks on the plan , eu ministers said , adding that the bloc was ready " to play a significant role in the implementation of the status settlement . " rehn said he also expected russia to support the un plan , arguing that a long-term solution for kosovo must be backed by all members of the international community .

however , host germany chose to highlight the positives . german chancellor angela merkel welcomed some of the most important political and military figures in the world to the annual international security conference in munich over the weekend .
as with previous year 's , the 2007 conference threw up its fair share of controversy . in recent year 's , the munich conference has provided the setting for a nervous appearance by donald rumsfeld in 2005 , when the former us secretary of defense faced possible war crime charges , and merkel 's assertion last year that the threat posed by iran was comparable to the rise of the nazis in the early 1930 's . grabbing the majority of the limelight this year was russian president vladimir putin who told the high-ranking audience in no uncertain terms that the united states bore the responsibility for many of the world 's worst security issues . as hosts of the conference , it came down to the germans to diffuse the situation .

however , host germany chose to highlight the positives . german chancellor angela merkel welcomed some of the most important political and military figures in the world to the annual international security conference in munich over the weekend .
as with previous year 's , the 2007 conference threw up its fair share of controversy . in recent year 's , the munich conference has provided the setting for a nervous appearance by donald rumsfeld in 2005 , when the former us secretary of defense faced possible war crime charges , and merkel 's assertion last year that the threat posed by iran was comparable to the rise of the nazis in the early 1930 's . grabbing the majority of the limelight this year was russian president vladimir putin who told the high-ranking audience in no uncertain terms that the united states bore the responsibility for many of the world 's worst security issues . as hosts of the conference , it came down to the germans to diffuse the situation .
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said putin had been speaking in his own characteristic style at a venue that had " a suitable and longstanding context " for plain talking and added that putin 's comments " did not represent a reversion to the cold war . " berlin to keep dialogue open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you 're a bad lad , vlad . "
but berlin will keep talking putin also accused the us of provoking a new nuclear arms race by developing ballistic missile defenses in eastern europe as well as undermining international institutions and making the middle east more unstable . speaking in berlin on monday , the day after the conference closed , wilhelm added that berlin did not agree with putin 's criticism of nato 's eastward expansion , but would keep up the dialogue with the kremlin and continue to cooperate with russia on international issues . the other major incident to cause ripples was the decision of iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani to attend the conference after unexpectedly canceling his plans to attend and then , even more unexpectedly , reversing the reversal . face-to-face meeting before un deadline his attendance gave the german hosts and their european union counterparts in the current nuclear negotiation process the opportunity to address the crisis over iran 's ambitions face to face . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani talked tough but then gave hint of concession the german foreign ministry had arranged talks with larijani in munich with an eye on the feb .
21st un security council deadline for iran to stop enriching uranium for nuclear fuel or risk further international sanctions . before larijani spoke to the conference , merkel made it clear that the pressure remained on iran to make the first move . " if iran does not comply with international demands , it risks falling deeper into isolation , " merkel said .
" we are all determined to prevent the threat of an iran with a military nuclear program .
there are no ifs and buts here and no tricks . " larijani told the munich meeting that tehran had the right to peaceful nuclear technology and that his country 's uranium-enrichment activities were exclusively of a research and development nature . he said " irrational preconditions " such as western demands that iran must suspend uranium enrichment before coming to the negotiating table were an obstacle to solving the nuclear dispute . steinmeier : possible iran breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier saw a light at the end of the munich tunnel however , after meeting with eu foreign policy chief javier solana and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday for the first time since talks broke down last september , larijani said that " there is political will on both sides to have a negotiated settlement .

" we want to maintain an door open for negotiation , but iran knows what we want them to do , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said . germany , france and england , backed by solana , offered iran political and economic incentives to suspend uranium enrichment .
despite the decision to impose sanctions , the eu says that offer still stands . enriched uranium can be used to make atomic weapons .

the cuts were meant to send a strong message to iran to shut down its uranium enrichment activities . " sanctions are one part of the double track approach we are taking in europe , " said spanish state secretary for european affairs alberto navarro .

" russia again claims a place in the first row , and with its nuclear arsenal , its size , and its oil and gas riches it has , by all means , weighty arguments , " wrote the munich daily süddeutsche zeitung in its monday edition .
" the usa offers another with its disastrous iraq adventure .
since that weakens western credibility , it creates the opportunity for putin to set himself up as the powerful voice of the growing number of countries and peoples who are stricken by doubt in the wisdom of western policies .
the russian president has laid his cards on the table .
europe and america now know where russia has positioned itself . " " in vladimir putin 's controlled ' democracy , ' power-political rowdiness is at least as pronounced as the need for cooperation , " commented the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily .
" in view of the general development of the past years , it 's assumedly even somewhat greater at the moment - as a signal from the kremlin that russia ' is back . '
one reason why putin acts as he did in munich and why russia ' is back ' in world politics has come to light : it is the petrol power that straightened out its self-confidence again .
in addition , comes the knowledge that america and its european allies want to have russia by their side in dealing with conflicts , and the correct appraisal that the bush administration currently finds itself in anything but a comfortable situation , " the paper continued . " how does one deal with putin 's munich blunder ? " asked the westdeutsche zeitung from düsseldorf .
" glossing over it , as some europeans try to do , would be just as wrong as responding with more verbal poison .
in view of worldwide problems , it 's important that russia remains level-headed and collaborates on finding solutions .
the next test will be the expiration of the un 's 60-day deadline for iran to discontinue its nuclear program , at the end of february .
now more than ever russia is unlikely to back a further un resolution . "
the times of london said monday that putin 's harsh comments were more than just another repeat of the bush administration 's mistakes .
" if the us administration didn ’ t have enough to worry about , given the current state of the world , it spent much of the weekend wondering whether moscow had declared another cold war … not since nikita khrushchev banged his shoe on the table at the united nations in 1960 has an international gathering heard such an icy blast from moscow ’ s leadership . " conservative french newspaper le figaro noted putin had increased the hostile tone between russia and the united states as part of his crusade against washington .
" this was vladimir putin 's variations on an old theme .
many participants at the security conference asked themselves the question of whether the second cold war was being announced in munich . " putin wants to make it clear that he wo n't allow outsiders to meddle in russia 's domestic affairs , said budapest newspaper nepszabadsag .
" should that be a cold war ?
or only an expression of the self-confident unity of an energy supplier equipped with enormous foreign exchange reserves ?
is ' soverign democracy ' not merely a pretty name for new authoritarianism ?
there is currently no confrontation .
there are discussions .
these wo n't allow the disruption of dialogue about foreign and arms policy , over the issue of eastern european democracies and the human rights .
at least not for the time being . " bulgarian newspaper dnewnik warned that europe 's energy dependence gives putin power .
" the current strategy of the kremlin is to strike while the iron is hot - namely so long as europe depends on russia to supply a fifth of its energy needs .

" russia again claims a place in the first row , and with its nuclear arsenal , its size , and its oil and gas riches it has , by all means , weighty arguments , " wrote the munich daily süddeutsche zeitung in its monday edition .
" the usa offers another with its disastrous iraq adventure .
since that weakens western credibility , it creates the opportunity for putin to set himself up as the powerful voice of the growing number of countries and peoples who are stricken by doubt in the wisdom of western policies .
the russian president has laid his cards on the table .
europe and america now know where russia has positioned itself . " " in vladimir putin 's controlled ' democracy , ' power-political rowdiness is at least as pronounced as the need for cooperation , " commented the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily .
" in view of the general development of the past years , it 's assumedly even somewhat greater at the moment - as a signal from the kremlin that russia ' is back . '
one reason why putin acts as he did in munich and why russia ' is back ' in world politics has come to light : it is the petrol power that straightened out its self-confidence again .
in addition , comes the knowledge that america and its european allies want to have russia by their side in dealing with conflicts , and the correct appraisal that the bush administration currently finds itself in anything but a comfortable situation , " the paper continued . " how does one deal with putin 's munich blunder ? " asked the westdeutsche zeitung from düsseldorf .
" glossing over it , as some europeans try to do , would be just as wrong as responding with more verbal poison .
in view of worldwide problems , it 's important that russia remains level-headed and collaborates on finding solutions .
the next test will be the expiration of the un 's 60-day deadline for iran to discontinue its nuclear program , at the end of february .
now more than ever russia is unlikely to back a further un resolution . "
the times of london said monday that putin 's harsh comments were more than just another repeat of the bush administration 's mistakes .
" if the us administration didn ’ t have enough to worry about , given the current state of the world , it spent much of the weekend wondering whether moscow had declared another cold war … not since nikita khrushchev banged his shoe on the table at the united nations in 1960 has an international gathering heard such an icy blast from moscow ’ s leadership . " conservative french newspaper le figaro noted putin had increased the hostile tone between russia and the united states as part of his crusade against washington .

however , host germany chose to highlight the positives . german chancellor angela merkel welcomed some of the most important political and military figures in the world to the annual international security conference in munich over the weekend .

as with previous year 's , the 2007 conference threw up its fair share of controversy . in recent year 's , the munich conference has provided the setting for a nervous appearance by donald rumsfeld in 2005 , when the former us secretary of defense faced possible war crime charges , and merkel 's assertion last year that the threat posed by iran was comparable to the rise of the nazis in the early 1930 's . grabbing the majority of the limelight this year was russian president vladimir putin who told the high-ranking audience in no uncertain terms that the united states bore the responsibility for many of the world 's worst security issues . as hosts of the conference , it came down to the germans to diffuse the situation .

" we are all determined to prevent the threat of an iran with a military nuclear program .
there are no ifs and buts here and no tricks . " larijani told the munich meeting that tehran had the right to peaceful nuclear technology and that his country 's uranium-enrichment activities were exclusively of a research and development nature . he said " irrational preconditions " such as western demands that iran must suspend uranium enrichment before coming to the negotiating table were an obstacle to solving the nuclear dispute . steinmeier : possible iran breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier saw a light at the end of the munich tunnel however , after meeting with eu foreign policy chief javier solana and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday for the first time since talks broke down last september , larijani said that " there is political will on both sides to have a negotiated settlement .

shortly after german reunification , jews in israel and the united states felt germans continued to hold anti-semitic beliefs and that the country was not on a stable democratic footing . those perceptions , however , have changed significantly during the past 15 years , according to the bertelsmann foundation study , which was released sunday . increase in favorable opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the holocaust remains a central issue to german-jewish relations a majority of israelis , 57 percent , now have a favorable opinion of germany , an increase of 48 percent since a similar poll was conducted in 1991 .
more than 70 percent of american jews see germany favorably , according to the bertelsmann study . according to the 1991 survey nearly 80 percent of israelis felt germany was endangered by extremist groups , a feeling now shared by 46 percent of those surveyed . during the same time , there 's been an increase in the number of germans who feel shame for the crimes committed against the jewish people and who are unwilling to ignore the past and " move on , " according to the report . although nearly half of jews in israel and the us still suspect a majority of germans hold anti-semitic beliefs , the survey found that these beliefs are on the wane in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 12.02.2007 germany to free former leader of left-wing terror group großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte mohnhaupt will be released on parole after 24 years in prison a german court has ruled that a former member of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , brigitte mohnhaupt will walk free on parole on march 27 after serving 24 years for multiple murders . after consulting the prosecutors and a psychiatric expert for mohnhaupt 's case , a state court in stuttgart found " no indications … that she could commit future serious offenses . " mohnhaupt will serve the remainder of her sentence on parole . the case has revived painful memories of the raf 's violent campaign of the 1970s . also known as the baader-meinhof gang after its founders andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , the red army faction murdered a string of high-profile german establishment figures from 1977 to 1982 as it attempted to bring down what it considered an oppressive capitalist state . the group is suspected of killing 34 people between 1972 and 1991 .
some 26 raf members died during that period and another 26 were sentenced to life in prison . mohnhaupt , now 57 , had risen to the ranks of the raf 's " second-generation " leadership in 1977 .
she has never explicitly apologized for the bloodshed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of schleyer , held hostage by the raf for over a month , became an iconic image of 1970s west germany in 1977 , mohnhaupt took part in the abductions and subsequent murders of west germany 's chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback , head of the west german employers ' federation hanns-martin schleyer and dresdner bank chief executive jürgen ponto .
brigitte mohnhaupt was captured in 1982 , convicted of involvement in nine murders and sentenced to five life sentences in 1985 . mohnhaupt has already made nine excursions from prison , with armed police watching her , to prepare her for a changed world that is connected up by the internet and only dimly remembers communism , which began crumbling in europe in 1989 . monday 's court decision does not come as a surprise , since prosecutors had previously supported mohnhaupt 's bid for parole at a closed hearing in stuttgart on january 22 . other raf members await clemency the former terrorist had petitioned for parole once already on feb 21 , 2006 , but was rejected because she had not yet served the minimum required sentence of 24 years , a provision that grew out of the " unusual gravity of the crime . "
that sentence expires on march 26 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar is still awaiting a decision on his plea for clemency mohnhaupt 's release comes at the same time as another petition for clemency filed by convicted red army faction leader christian klar .
because klar , 54 , still has two years to serve before qualifying for possible parole , his only chance for an early release is a special pardon from german president horst köhler , who is currently reviewing the case .
former president johannes rau already rejected a previous petition for clemency . klar , who like mohnhaupt came from a well-off family and went to university to study philosophy before becoming a terrorist , is reported to have been well behaved in jail .
a berlin theatre has promised him a two-year staff internship if he is released . klar has also never renounced his ideas , telling an interviewer in 2001 he still wanted germany to make a " fresh start " and would never abjure what the raf had done , " though i do not contemplate reviving the armed struggle . " both mohnhaupt and klar 's cases have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against some politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . besides klar , the only other members of the raf still in prison are eva haule and birgit hogefeld . most of the terrorist organization 's original leaders committed suicide in jail during the 1970s . the group abandoned violence in 1992 and formally disbanded in 1998 . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we need proof that the german state is capable of mercy " gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison .

" mohnhaupt will serve the remainder of her sentence on parole . the case has revived painful memories of the raf 's violent campaign of the 1970s . also known as the baader-meinhof gang after its founders andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , the red army faction murdered a string of high-profile german establishment figures from 1977 to 1982 as it attempted to bring down what it considered an oppressive capitalist state . the group is suspected of killing 34 people between 1972 and 1991 .
some 26 raf members died during that period and another 26 were sentenced to life in prison . mohnhaupt , now 57 , had risen to the ranks of the raf 's " second-generation " leadership in 1977 .

brigitte mohnhaupt was captured in 1982 , convicted of involvement in nine murders and sentenced to five life sentences in 1985 . mohnhaupt has already made nine excursions from prison , with armed police watching her , to prepare her for a changed world that is connected up by the internet and only dimly remembers communism , which began crumbling in europe in 1989 . monday 's court decision does not come as a surprise , since prosecutors had previously supported mohnhaupt 's bid for parole at a closed hearing in stuttgart on january 22 . other raf members await clemency the former terrorist had petitioned for parole once already on feb 21 , 2006 , but was rejected because she had not yet served the minimum required sentence of 24 years , a provision that grew out of the " unusual gravity of the crime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 12.02.2007 eu foreign ministers to quiz un envoy on kosovo 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two people died after protests against the un plan in kosovo european foreign ministers will ask un envoy martti ahtisaari on monday how he intends to push forward his proposals for kosovo 's future as they seek their own formula to keep serbia engaged . the 27 eu member states are set to declare their strong support for ahtisaari 's plan for the breakaway serb province when they meet in brussels , despite misgivings in some quarters , according to diplomatic sources . the recently drafted plan offers kosovo self-governance , a constitution , anthem and flag .
while it does not mention independence many see the plan as leading to the breakaway province 's eventual separation from serbia , something that belgrade opposes . the foreign ministers , whom the un envoy will meet during one of their regular meetings in brussels , face a difficult task in reaching agreement over how to handle belgrade politically .
the kosovo / serbia issue is of particular interest to them as the eu is preparing to take control of united nations mission in kosovo , which has administered the province for the last eight years in collaboration with nato and 17,000 kfor troops . also , both serbia and kosovo are seen by many as possible future eu members .
fears of separatism ahtisaari 's settlement plan worries some countries which fear political fallout into their own separatism problems if kosovo and its mainly albanian population are allowed to go it alone , european sources said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari has a tough task the most nervous nations are cyprus , romania and spain , according to one source . another concern is the possible effect on the secessionist tendencies in the republika srpska , the serb half of bosnia . " i think the judgment is ... that these concerns are outweighed by the advantages that come from settling the last big constitutional issue in the balkans , " the european source said .
" if you put this issue to bed you can say to the whole region : ' that 's it , time to get on with moving towards the european union . " ' serbia 's first step towards that goal , talks on a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , are stalled over its failure to cooperate fully with the un war crimes tribunal - shorthand for its failure to track down former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , who is indicted for genocide . the hope is that a new serb coalition government , currently cobbled together following a general election last month , will provide the fresh start needed to get back to the negotiating table .
eu divided however there are sharp differences within the eu over whether to encourage serbia by reopening the saa talks or to insist first that they cooperate with the hague-based court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kfor troops have been at work in kosovo for eight years austria , italy and spain want to see talks with the serbs reopen , but not be concluded , before full cooperation with the court is achieved .
others , including belgium and the netherlands , feel compliance must be a prerequisite for restarting talks . though formally still part of serbia , kosovo has been run by a un mission since 1999 , after nato 's aerial bombardment drove out forces loyal to then serbian leader slobodan milosevic over a crackdown on ethnic albanians . ahtisaari will hold talks with serbs and kosovars from feb .
21 before presenting his final propositions to the un security council , probably in late march .
deaths after protest to un plan two people injured in violent clashes with police during a pro-independence protest in kosovo died of their wounds sunday , a police spokesman there said .
they two were among 25 people hospitalized after a protest in pristina on saturday against the un plan for the future of kosovo . the demonstration turned violent with anti-riot police firing tear gas and rubber bullets at several thousand ethnic albanians .

while it does not mention independence many see the plan as leading to the breakaway province 's eventual separation from serbia , something that belgrade opposes . the foreign ministers , whom the un envoy will meet during one of their regular meetings in brussels , face a difficult task in reaching agreement over how to handle belgrade politically .
the kosovo / serbia issue is of particular interest to them as the eu is preparing to take control of united nations mission in kosovo , which has administered the province for the last eight years in collaboration with nato and 17,000 kfor troops . also , both serbia and kosovo are seen by many as possible future eu members .

eu divided however there are sharp differences within the eu over whether to encourage serbia by reopening the saa talks or to insist first that they cooperate with the hague-based court .

" russia again claims a place in the first row , and with its nuclear arsenal , its size , and its oil and gas riches it has , by all means , weighty arguments , " wrote the munich daily süddeutsche zeitung in its monday edition .
" the usa offers another with its disastrous iraq adventure .
since that weakens western credibility , it creates the opportunity for putin to set himself up as the powerful voice of the growing number of countries and peoples who are stricken by doubt in the wisdom of western policies .
the russian president has laid his cards on the table .
europe and america now know where russia has positioned itself . " " in vladimir putin 's controlled ' democracy , ' power-political rowdiness is at least as pronounced as the need for cooperation , " commented the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily .
" in view of the general development of the past years , it 's assumedly even somewhat greater at the moment - as a signal from the kremlin that russia ' is back . '
one reason why putin acts as he did in munich and why russia ' is back ' in world politics has come to light : it is the petrol power that straightened out its self-confidence again .
in addition , comes the knowledge that america and its european allies want to have russia by their side in dealing with conflicts , and the correct appraisal that the bush administration currently finds itself in anything but a comfortable situation , " the paper continued . " how does one deal with putin 's munich blunder ? " asked the westdeutsche zeitung from düsseldorf .
" glossing over it , as some europeans try to do , would be just as wrong as responding with more verbal poison .
in view of worldwide problems , it 's important that russia remains level-headed and collaborates on finding solutions .
the next test will be the expiration of the un 's 60-day deadline for iran to discontinue its nuclear program , at the end of february .
now more than ever russia is unlikely to back a further un resolution . "
the times of london said monday that putin 's harsh comments were more than just another repeat of the bush administration 's mistakes .
" if the us administration didn ’ t have enough to worry about , given the current state of the world , it spent much of the weekend wondering whether moscow had declared another cold war … not since nikita khrushchev banged his shoe on the table at the united nations in 1960 has an international gathering heard such an icy blast from moscow ’ s leadership . " conservative french newspaper le figaro noted putin had increased the hostile tone between russia and the united states as part of his crusade against washington .
" this was vladimir putin 's variations on an old theme .
many participants at the security conference asked themselves the question of whether the second cold war was being announced in munich . " putin wants to make it clear that he wo n't allow outsiders to meddle in russia 's domestic affairs , said budapest newspaper nepszabadsag .
" should that be a cold war ?
or only an expression of the self-confident unity of an energy supplier equipped with enormous foreign exchange reserves ?
is ' soverign democracy ' not merely a pretty name for new authoritarianism ?
there is currently no confrontation .
there are discussions .
these wo n't allow the disruption of dialogue about foreign and arms policy , over the issue of eastern european democracies and the human rights .
at least not for the time being . " bulgarian newspaper dnewnik warned that europe 's energy dependence gives putin power .
" the current strategy of the kremlin is to strike while the iron is hot - namely so long as europe depends on russia to supply a fifth of its energy needs . " dw staff -lrb- ncy / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us defense chief to putin : " one cold war was enough " us defense secretary robert gates on sunday dismissed a stinging broadside against the united states by russian president vladimir putin , declaring : " one cold war was quite enough .

the sanctions prohibit countries from exporting nuclear and weapons technology to iran as well as impose visa bans and freeze assets of some iranian officials . " we want to maintain an door open for negotiation , but iran knows what we want them to do , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said . germany , france and england , backed by solana , offered iran political and economic incentives to suspend uranium enrichment .
despite the decision to impose sanctions , the eu says that offer still stands . enriched uranium can be used to make atomic weapons .
iran claims it is developing nuclear technology only to meet its energy needs .
europe and the united states , however , fear tehran wants to develop a nuclear arsenal under cover of a civilian nuclear program . open to negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign ministers decided to approve un sanctions at a meeting in brussels german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said a sunday speech made by ari larijani , iran 's top nuclear negotiator , could signal that iran wants to return to and continue negotiations . " now what we have to do is look at the proposal that iran is presenting and see if this paves the way back to the negotiating table , " steinmeier said . steinmeier said he and solana both thought there was an opportunity to reopen talks . " we both have the impression that in iran there is a new ambition to return to the negotiating table , " steinmeier told reporters monday , referring to meetings he and solana conducted with larijani .
" in the course of the next few days , we will have to sound out whether they -lrb- iran -rrb- can pursue that line . " we need to see what the signals are from iran , whether they are serious , " steinmeier added . " possibilities are not immense " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe still wants to negotiate with iran larijani said iran wants a negotiated settlement and does n't want to aggravate the tense political situation in the region . solana , however , was cautious , saying " the possibilities are not immense " and that he had yet to hear any new proposals from iran . on friday , the international atomic energy agency cut its aid package to iran by nearly 50 percent .
the cuts were meant to send a strong message to iran to shut down its uranium enrichment activities . " sanctions are one part of the double track approach we are taking in europe , " said spanish state secretary for european affairs alberto navarro .
" we know it is just the first step and these sanctions should be gradual . " iran risks more extensive economic sanctions if it fails to comply with a un security council deadline later this month to stop enrichment . eu ready to give serbia a new chance the ministers also said they were willing to give eu-hopeful serbia " a new chance " for talks on closer ties , but stressed that a resumption of stalled negotiations would depend on belgrade 's determination to arrest fugitives suspected of war crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ministers condemned violence that occurred in kosovo over the weekend steinmeier told reporters that a new serbian government must " live up to its responsibilities and cooperate with icty , " the united nations international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . " a new reform and europe-oriented government can make a new start , get back on the road to europe and regain lost time , " said eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn .
" this new government deserves a new chance . " belgrade must investigate war crimes however , rehn said the eu would resume suspended talks with serbia only if the new government took " concrete action " and showed " clear commitment " in the search for fugitive bosnian serb general ratko mladic and other key war crimes suspects . " full cooperation with icty remains the necessary condition for the pace and conclusions of stabilization talks , " rehn said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martti ahtisaari presented his proposal for kosovo and serbia on feb .
2 the 27-member bloc froze negotiations on closer economic and political ties - the first step towards eu membership - with serbia in may 2006 , demanding belgrade show " full cooperation " with the hague-based tribunal . eu foreign ministers also said that they were fully supporting a united nations plan that sets serbia 's breakaway region kosovo on the road to independence . the plans by un envoy for kosovo , martti ahtisaari , " provide comprehensive arrangements designed to promote in kosovo a multi-ethnic and democratic society based on the rule of law , " they said . belgrade and pristina must " participate actively and constructively " in upcoming talks on the plan , eu ministers said , adding that the bloc was ready " to play a significant role in the implementation of the status settlement . " rehn said he also expected russia to support the un plan , arguing that a long-term solution for kosovo must be backed by all members of the international community . " kosovo will be a real test for multilateralism , " rehn said . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany takes positives from another controversial conference a " threat " of a new cold war and a potential new stalemate over iran 's nuclear program could have brought this weekend 's munich security conference to a bitter end .

while it does not mention independence many see the plan as leading to the breakaway province 's eventual separation from serbia , something that belgrade opposes . the foreign ministers , whom the un envoy will meet during one of their regular meetings in brussels , face a difficult task in reaching agreement over how to handle belgrade politically .
the kosovo / serbia issue is of particular interest to them as the eu is preparing to take control of united nations mission in kosovo , which has administered the province for the last eight years in collaboration with nato and 17,000 kfor troops . also , both serbia and kosovo are seen by many as possible future eu members .
fears of separatism ahtisaari 's settlement plan worries some countries which fear political fallout into their own separatism problems if kosovo and its mainly albanian population are allowed to go it alone , european sources said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari has a tough task the most nervous nations are cyprus , romania and spain , according to one source . another concern is the possible effect on the secessionist tendencies in the republika srpska , the serb half of bosnia . " i think the judgment is ... that these concerns are outweighed by the advantages that come from settling the last big constitutional issue in the balkans , " the european source said .
" if you put this issue to bed you can say to the whole region : ' that 's it , time to get on with moving towards the european union . " ' serbia 's first step towards that goal , talks on a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , are stalled over its failure to cooperate fully with the un war crimes tribunal - shorthand for its failure to track down former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , who is indicted for genocide . the hope is that a new serb coalition government , currently cobbled together following a general election last month , will provide the fresh start needed to get back to the negotiating table .
eu divided however there are sharp differences within the eu over whether to encourage serbia by reopening the saa talks or to insist first that they cooperate with the hague-based court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kfor troops have been at work in kosovo for eight years austria , italy and spain want to see talks with the serbs reopen , but not be concluded , before full cooperation with the court is achieved .
others , including belgium and the netherlands , feel compliance must be a prerequisite for restarting talks . though formally still part of serbia , kosovo has been run by a un mission since 1999 , after nato 's aerial bombardment drove out forces loyal to then serbian leader slobodan milosevic over a crackdown on ethnic albanians . ahtisaari will hold talks with serbs and kosovars from feb .
21 before presenting his final propositions to the un security council , probably in late march .
deaths after protest to un plan two people injured in violent clashes with police during a pro-independence protest in kosovo died of their wounds sunday , a police spokesman there said .
they two were among 25 people hospitalized after a protest in pristina on saturday against the un plan for the future of kosovo . the demonstration turned violent with anti-riot police firing tear gas and rubber bullets at several thousand ethnic albanians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests got out of hand in pristina " it is regrettable that two lives were lost as a result of a wanton breach of security at government buildings , " un police commissioner stephen curtis said in a statement .
eu police for afghanistan also on their brussels agenda , the eu foreign ministers will welcome the agreement thrashed out between the fatah and hamas groups on forming a palestinian government of national unity . the eu 27 are also set to give the green light on monday for a european mission to afghanistan aimed at training the local police force , according to diplomatic sources .
some 160 european police officers , aided by 50-70 experts , will help " to establish an afghan police force which respects human rights and operates on that basis on the central , regional and provincial levels , " according to the draft conclusion to be adopted by the eu foreign ministers . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un briefly delays kosovo talks to accommodate serbs a final round of un-backed negotiations on the future status of kosovo - the serbian province whose ethnic albanian majority is craving independence - will be postponed by one week and start on feb .

" the results of this referendum are clear , it proves that the portuguese people want to turn the page on the question of abortion , " socrates said . but turnout in portugal 's second referendum on its abortion law in less than a decade was 43.6 percent , below the 50 percent threshold needed to make the ballot legally binding . socrates pledged his socialist government will now use its parliamentary majority to legalize abortion . portugal abortion laws among most restrictive in eu abortion is currently allowed in portugal only in cases of rape , a malformed fetus or if the woman 's well-being is in danger . a woman can be jailed for up to three years for having an illegal abortion while those who perform them face up to eight years behind bars . within the 27-nation european union only ireland , malta and poland have abortion laws that are similar or even more restrictive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose socrates believes the yes vote will lead to a more tolerant portugal socrates , elected in a landslide in 2005 , said the new law would be modeled on legislation in place in other european nations and would require a reflection period before an abortion can be carried out . " it is my sincere conviction that with the result of this referendum portugal has taken another step in the creation of a society that is more open , tolerant and just , " he said . catholic church opposed to easing law opposition to change was led by the influential catholic church which argued the government should do more to help women to have children instead of easing abortion restrictions . one priest threatened catholics who voted to ease the law with excommunication from the church .
the bishop of the northern city of braganca likened abortion to the execution of former iraqi leader saddam hussein . more than 90 percent of portugal 's population of 10.6 million identify themselves as being roman catholic although , as in other catholic countries , regular church attendance is on the decline . in a referendum held in 1998 voters upheld the existing abortion law by a whisker but the result was declared void as nearly seven out of 10 voters stayed away . during the last referendum the socialists were split with then prime minister , antonio guterres , publicly opposed to the abortion law being changed . a " national shame " socrates by contrast has backed liberalization at rallies across the country and this time it was the main opposition centre-right social democrats that was divided on the issue .
the party did not adopt an official position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say backstreet abortions in portugal are risky since the last referendum , several trials of women charged with illegally terminating their pregnancies were held that generated widespread public sympathy for the women .
analysts said this helped boost support for reform . during the campaign socrates called backstreet abortions a " national shame " and cast the referendum as a test of portugal 's readiness for progress . pro-abortion groups estimate that some 10,000 women are hospitalized , and several die every year from complications arising from botched backstreet abortions . anti-abortion groups contest the figure . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government discusses reducing late abortions parliamentary leaders met with church representatives tuesday to talk about reforming legislation on late abortions , as conservatives push for more stringent controls on terminations and a re-think of who foots the bill .

" the results of this referendum are clear , it proves that the portuguese people want to turn the page on the question of abortion , " socrates said . but turnout in portugal 's second referendum on its abortion law in less than a decade was 43.6 percent , below the 50 percent threshold needed to make the ballot legally binding . socrates pledged his socialist government will now use its parliamentary majority to legalize abortion . portugal abortion laws among most restrictive in eu abortion is currently allowed in portugal only in cases of rape , a malformed fetus or if the woman 's well-being is in danger . a woman can be jailed for up to three years for having an illegal abortion while those who perform them face up to eight years behind bars . within the 27-nation european union only ireland , malta and poland have abortion laws that are similar or even more restrictive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose socrates believes the yes vote will lead to a more tolerant portugal socrates , elected in a landslide in 2005 , said the new law would be modeled on legislation in place in other european nations and would require a reflection period before an abortion can be carried out . " it is my sincere conviction that with the result of this referendum portugal has taken another step in the creation of a society that is more open , tolerant and just , " he said . catholic church opposed to easing law opposition to change was led by the influential catholic church which argued the government should do more to help women to have children instead of easing abortion restrictions . one priest threatened catholics who voted to ease the law with excommunication from the church .
the bishop of the northern city of braganca likened abortion to the execution of former iraqi leader saddam hussein . more than 90 percent of portugal 's population of 10.6 million identify themselves as being roman catholic although , as in other catholic countries , regular church attendance is on the decline . in a referendum held in 1998 voters upheld the existing abortion law by a whisker but the result was declared void as nearly seven out of 10 voters stayed away . during the last referendum the socialists were split with then prime minister , antonio guterres , publicly opposed to the abortion law being changed . a " national shame " socrates by contrast has backed liberalization at rallies across the country and this time it was the main opposition centre-right social democrats that was divided on the issue .
the party did not adopt an official position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say backstreet abortions in portugal are risky since the last referendum , several trials of women charged with illegally terminating their pregnancies were held that generated widespread public sympathy for the women .
analysts said this helped boost support for reform . during the campaign socrates called backstreet abortions a " national shame " and cast the referendum as a test of portugal 's readiness for progress . pro-abortion groups estimate that some 10,000 women are hospitalized , and several die every year from complications arising from botched backstreet abortions . anti-abortion groups contest the figure . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government discusses reducing late abortions parliamentary leaders met with church representatives tuesday to talk about reforming legislation on late abortions , as conservatives push for more stringent controls on terminations and a re-think of who foots the bill .

" mohnhaupt will serve the remainder of her sentence on parole . the case has revived painful memories of the raf 's violent campaign of the 1970s . also known as the baader-meinhof gang after its founders andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , the red army faction murdered a string of high-profile german establishment figures from 1977 to 1982 as it attempted to bring down what it considered an oppressive capitalist state . the group is suspected of killing 34 people between 1972 and 1991 .
some 26 raf members died during that period and another 26 were sentenced to life in prison . mohnhaupt , now 57 , had risen to the ranks of the raf 's " second-generation " leadership in 1977 .
she has never explicitly apologized for the bloodshed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of schleyer , held hostage by the raf for over a month , became an iconic image of 1970s west germany in 1977 , mohnhaupt took part in the abductions and subsequent murders of west germany 's chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback , head of the west german employers ' federation hanns-martin schleyer and dresdner bank chief executive jürgen ponto .
brigitte mohnhaupt was captured in 1982 , convicted of involvement in nine murders and sentenced to five life sentences in 1985 . mohnhaupt has already made nine excursions from prison , with armed police watching her , to prepare her for a changed world that is connected up by the internet and only dimly remembers communism , which began crumbling in europe in 1989 . monday 's court decision does not come as a surprise , since prosecutors had previously supported mohnhaupt 's bid for parole at a closed hearing in stuttgart on january 22 . other raf members await clemency the former terrorist had petitioned for parole once already on feb 21 , 2006 , but was rejected because she had not yet served the minimum required sentence of 24 years , a provision that grew out of the " unusual gravity of the crime . "
that sentence expires on march 26 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar is still awaiting a decision on his plea for clemency mohnhaupt 's release comes at the same time as another petition for clemency filed by convicted red army faction leader christian klar .
because klar , 54 , still has two years to serve before qualifying for possible parole , his only chance for an early release is a special pardon from german president horst köhler , who is currently reviewing the case .
former president johannes rau already rejected a previous petition for clemency . klar , who like mohnhaupt came from a well-off family and went to university to study philosophy before becoming a terrorist , is reported to have been well behaved in jail .
a berlin theatre has promised him a two-year staff internship if he is released . klar has also never renounced his ideas , telling an interviewer in 2001 he still wanted germany to make a " fresh start " and would never abjure what the raf had done , " though i do not contemplate reviving the armed struggle . " both mohnhaupt and klar 's cases have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against some politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . besides klar , the only other members of the raf still in prison are eva haule and birgit hogefeld . most of the terrorist organization 's original leaders committed suicide in jail during the 1970s . the group abandoned violence in 1992 and formally disbanded in 1998 . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we need proof that the german state is capable of mercy " gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison .

a berlin theatre has promised him a two-year staff internship if he is released . klar has also never renounced his ideas , telling an interviewer in 2001 he still wanted germany to make a " fresh start " and would never abjure what the raf had done , " though i do not contemplate reviving the armed struggle . " both mohnhaupt and klar 's cases have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against some politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . besides klar , the only other members of the raf still in prison are eva haule and birgit hogefeld . most of the terrorist organization 's original leaders committed suicide in jail during the 1970s . the group abandoned violence in 1992 and formally disbanded in 1998 . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we need proof that the german state is capable of mercy " gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison .

" russia again claims a place in the first row , and with its nuclear arsenal , its size , and its oil and gas riches it has , by all means , weighty arguments , " wrote the munich daily süddeutsche zeitung in its monday edition .
" the usa offers another with its disastrous iraq adventure .
since that weakens western credibility , it creates the opportunity for putin to set himself up as the powerful voice of the growing number of countries and peoples who are stricken by doubt in the wisdom of western policies .
the russian president has laid his cards on the table .
europe and america now know where russia has positioned itself . " " in vladimir putin 's controlled ' democracy , ' power-political rowdiness is at least as pronounced as the need for cooperation , " commented the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily .
" in view of the general development of the past years , it 's assumedly even somewhat greater at the moment - as a signal from the kremlin that russia ' is back . '
one reason why putin acts as he did in munich and why russia ' is back ' in world politics has come to light : it is the petrol power that straightened out its self-confidence again .
in addition , comes the knowledge that america and its european allies want to have russia by their side in dealing with conflicts , and the correct appraisal that the bush administration currently finds itself in anything but a comfortable situation , " the paper continued . " how does one deal with putin 's munich blunder ? " asked the westdeutsche zeitung from düsseldorf .
" glossing over it , as some europeans try to do , would be just as wrong as responding with more verbal poison .
in view of worldwide problems , it 's important that russia remains level-headed and collaborates on finding solutions .
the next test will be the expiration of the un 's 60-day deadline for iran to discontinue its nuclear program , at the end of february .
now more than ever russia is unlikely to back a further un resolution . "
the times of london said monday that putin 's harsh comments were more than just another repeat of the bush administration 's mistakes .
" if the us administration didn ’ t have enough to worry about , given the current state of the world , it spent much of the weekend wondering whether moscow had declared another cold war … not since nikita khrushchev banged his shoe on the table at the united nations in 1960 has an international gathering heard such an icy blast from moscow ’ s leadership . " conservative french newspaper le figaro noted putin had increased the hostile tone between russia and the united states as part of his crusade against washington .
" this was vladimir putin 's variations on an old theme .
many participants at the security conference asked themselves the question of whether the second cold war was being announced in munich . " putin wants to make it clear that he wo n't allow outsiders to meddle in russia 's domestic affairs , said budapest newspaper nepszabadsag .
" should that be a cold war ?
or only an expression of the self-confident unity of an energy supplier equipped with enormous foreign exchange reserves ?
is ' soverign democracy ' not merely a pretty name for new authoritarianism ?
there is currently no confrontation .
there are discussions .
these wo n't allow the disruption of dialogue about foreign and arms policy , over the issue of eastern european democracies and the human rights .
at least not for the time being . " bulgarian newspaper dnewnik warned that europe 's energy dependence gives putin power .
" the current strategy of the kremlin is to strike while the iron is hot - namely so long as europe depends on russia to supply a fifth of its energy needs . " dw staff -lrb- ncy / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us defense chief to putin : " one cold war was enough " us defense secretary robert gates on sunday dismissed a stinging broadside against the united states by russian president vladimir putin , declaring : " one cold war was quite enough .

" mohnhaupt will serve the remainder of her sentence on parole . the case has revived painful memories of the raf 's violent campaign of the 1970s . also known as the baader-meinhof gang after its founders andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , the red army faction murdered a string of high-profile german establishment figures from 1977 to 1982 as it attempted to bring down what it considered an oppressive capitalist state . the group is suspected of killing 34 people between 1972 and 1991 .
some 26 raf members died during that period and another 26 were sentenced to life in prison . mohnhaupt , now 57 , had risen to the ranks of the raf 's " second-generation " leadership in 1977 .

" mohnhaupt will serve the remainder of her sentence on parole . the case has revived painful memories of the raf 's violent campaign of the 1970s . also known as the baader-meinhof gang after its founders andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , the red army faction murdered a string of high-profile german establishment figures from 1977 to 1982 as it attempted to bring down what it considered an oppressive capitalist state . the group is suspected of killing 34 people between 1972 and 1991 .
some 26 raf members died during that period and another 26 were sentenced to life in prison . mohnhaupt , now 57 , had risen to the ranks of the raf 's " second-generation " leadership in 1977 .

brigitte mohnhaupt was captured in 1982 , convicted of involvement in nine murders and sentenced to five life sentences in 1985 . mohnhaupt has already made nine excursions from prison , with armed police watching her , to prepare her for a changed world that is connected up by the internet and only dimly remembers communism , which began crumbling in europe in 1989 . monday 's court decision does not come as a surprise , since prosecutors had previously supported mohnhaupt 's bid for parole at a closed hearing in stuttgart on january 22 . other raf members await clemency the former terrorist had petitioned for parole once already on feb 21 , 2006 , but was rejected because she had not yet served the minimum required sentence of 24 years , a provision that grew out of the " unusual gravity of the crime .

because klar , 54 , still has two years to serve before qualifying for possible parole , his only chance for an early release is a special pardon from german president horst köhler , who is currently reviewing the case .
former president johannes rau already rejected a previous petition for clemency . klar , who like mohnhaupt came from a well-off family and went to university to study philosophy before becoming a terrorist , is reported to have been well behaved in jail .
a berlin theatre has promised him a two-year staff internship if he is released . klar has also never renounced his ideas , telling an interviewer in 2001 he still wanted germany to make a " fresh start " and would never abjure what the raf had done , " though i do not contemplate reviving the armed struggle . " both mohnhaupt and klar 's cases have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against some politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . besides klar , the only other members of the raf still in prison are eva haule and birgit hogefeld . most of the terrorist organization 's original leaders committed suicide in jail during the 1970s . the group abandoned violence in 1992 and formally disbanded in 1998 . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we need proof that the german state is capable of mercy " gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison .

while it does not mention independence many see the plan as leading to the breakaway province 's eventual separation from serbia , something that belgrade opposes . the foreign ministers , whom the un envoy will meet during one of their regular meetings in brussels , face a difficult task in reaching agreement over how to handle belgrade politically .
the kosovo / serbia issue is of particular interest to them as the eu is preparing to take control of united nations mission in kosovo , which has administered the province for the last eight years in collaboration with nato and 17,000 kfor troops . also , both serbia and kosovo are seen by many as possible future eu members .
fears of separatism ahtisaari 's settlement plan worries some countries which fear political fallout into their own separatism problems if kosovo and its mainly albanian population are allowed to go it alone , european sources said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari has a tough task the most nervous nations are cyprus , romania and spain , according to one source . another concern is the possible effect on the secessionist tendencies in the republika srpska , the serb half of bosnia . " i think the judgment is ... that these concerns are outweighed by the advantages that come from settling the last big constitutional issue in the balkans , " the european source said .
" if you put this issue to bed you can say to the whole region : ' that 's it , time to get on with moving towards the european union . " ' serbia 's first step towards that goal , talks on a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , are stalled over its failure to cooperate fully with the un war crimes tribunal - shorthand for its failure to track down former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , who is indicted for genocide . the hope is that a new serb coalition government , currently cobbled together following a general election last month , will provide the fresh start needed to get back to the negotiating table .
eu divided however there are sharp differences within the eu over whether to encourage serbia by reopening the saa talks or to insist first that they cooperate with the hague-based court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kfor troops have been at work in kosovo for eight years austria , italy and spain want to see talks with the serbs reopen , but not be concluded , before full cooperation with the court is achieved .
others , including belgium and the netherlands , feel compliance must be a prerequisite for restarting talks . though formally still part of serbia , kosovo has been run by a un mission since 1999 , after nato 's aerial bombardment drove out forces loyal to then serbian leader slobodan milosevic over a crackdown on ethnic albanians . ahtisaari will hold talks with serbs and kosovars from feb .
21 before presenting his final propositions to the un security council , probably in late march .
deaths after protest to un plan two people injured in violent clashes with police during a pro-independence protest in kosovo died of their wounds sunday , a police spokesman there said .
they two were among 25 people hospitalized after a protest in pristina on saturday against the un plan for the future of kosovo . the demonstration turned violent with anti-riot police firing tear gas and rubber bullets at several thousand ethnic albanians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests got out of hand in pristina " it is regrettable that two lives were lost as a result of a wanton breach of security at government buildings , " un police commissioner stephen curtis said in a statement .
eu police for afghanistan also on their brussels agenda , the eu foreign ministers will welcome the agreement thrashed out between the fatah and hamas groups on forming a palestinian government of national unity . the eu 27 are also set to give the green light on monday for a european mission to afghanistan aimed at training the local police force , according to diplomatic sources .
some 160 european police officers , aided by 50-70 experts , will help " to establish an afghan police force which respects human rights and operates on that basis on the central , regional and provincial levels , " according to the draft conclusion to be adopted by the eu foreign ministers . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un briefly delays kosovo talks to accommodate serbs a final round of un-backed negotiations on the future status of kosovo - the serbian province whose ethnic albanian majority is craving independence - will be postponed by one week and start on feb .

however , host germany chose to highlight the positives . german chancellor angela merkel welcomed some of the most important political and military figures in the world to the annual international security conference in munich over the weekend .
as with previous year 's , the 2007 conference threw up its fair share of controversy . in recent year 's , the munich conference has provided the setting for a nervous appearance by donald rumsfeld in 2005 , when the former us secretary of defense faced possible war crime charges , and merkel 's assertion last year that the threat posed by iran was comparable to the rise of the nazis in the early 1930 's . grabbing the majority of the limelight this year was russian president vladimir putin who told the high-ranking audience in no uncertain terms that the united states bore the responsibility for many of the world 's worst security issues . as hosts of the conference , it came down to the germans to diffuse the situation .
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said putin had been speaking in his own characteristic style at a venue that had " a suitable and longstanding context " for plain talking and added that putin 's comments " did not represent a reversion to the cold war .

" larijani told the munich meeting that tehran had the right to peaceful nuclear technology and that his country 's uranium-enrichment activities were exclusively of a research and development nature . he said " irrational preconditions " such as western demands that iran must suspend uranium enrichment before coming to the negotiating table were an obstacle to solving the nuclear dispute . steinmeier : possible iran breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier saw a light at the end of the munich tunnel however , after meeting with eu foreign policy chief javier solana and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday for the first time since talks broke down last september , larijani said that " there is political will on both sides to have a negotiated settlement .

as with previous year 's , the 2007 conference threw up its fair share of controversy . in recent year 's , the munich conference has provided the setting for a nervous appearance by donald rumsfeld in 2005 , when the former us secretary of defense faced possible war crime charges , and merkel 's assertion last year that the threat posed by iran was comparable to the rise of the nazis in the early 1930 's . grabbing the majority of the limelight this year was russian president vladimir putin who told the high-ranking audience in no uncertain terms that the united states bore the responsibility for many of the world 's worst security issues . as hosts of the conference , it came down to the germans to diffuse the situation .

before you pack your bag , check out what other dw-world.de readers had to say about their german travel experience . my husband , two daughters and i hired a car in frankfurt in july 2006 and headed for rothenburg ob der tauber .
it was an awesome experience - and a magical town .
we stayed at guesthouse eberlein .
erich and the team were the perfect hosts .

impressions of germany from pictures and books had been rooted in my mind since my childhood .
in my mind , germany is not just a modern country , but also a country with a long history and legends , including hansel und gretel , walpurgistnacht , etc .
i 've been in canada and the us .
they 're just modern countries .
i barely found the aroma of their roots .
but in germany , despite its modernity , you still can sense her past history marked with castles here and there .
when arriving at the st. thomas church in leipzig i sighed with joy .
i touched the tomb of my favorite composer johann sebastian bach .

on my last trip , i was able to visit my favorite city on the moselle river , bernkastel-kues , during the wine harvest festival in august .
the wine and food samples in all the different tents were fantastic .
if i 'm shopping for wine and i see that it 's from the moselle river area , i know it will taste excellent .
prost ! - john l. i 'm from the us and i just visited germany this last summer , and the reason is because the food is so delicious .

it 's unclear whether the kidnappers want ransom money or political concessions .
the victims ' family in germany have allegedly been contacted by the kidnappers . a german woman and her son who had lived in iraq for years went missing approximately a week ago . german authorities were alerted to the abduction after kidnappers contacted the missing man 's sister , who lives in berlin .
she in turn contacted german authorities , the berliner zeitung reported tuesday .
the abductors have yet to make demands .
it is unclear whether they want money , political concessions or both , according to the newspaper , which cited unnamed security sources . berlin daily tagesspiegel said one victim is a german national in her 60s who lives in baghdad and is married to an iraqi doctor . the second victim is her adult son who is believed to work at the iraqi foreign ministry , according to the paper . the identities of the victims have not been released .
the tagesspiegel also reported that kidnappers had contacted family of the victims who live in berlin and other parts of germany .
the kidnappers has not made demands , but threatened to kill the son , the tagesspiegel reported . the german foreign ministry wo n't say whether contact has been made with the kidnappers .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier confirmed monday that two german nationals have been missing in iraq for almost a week . " we can not rule out that it was a kidnapping by force , " he told reporters at an eu meeting . motivation for kidnapping unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier would not give reporters any details on the alleged kidnapping berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper reported that the family was considered wealthy by iraqi standards and was probably victim to a targeted kidnapping . germany 's ntv news channel said the crisis team set up by the german government was apparently working with mediators , but the foreign ministry declined to confirm that this was the case . " we hope that everything works out well and we are doing everything in our power to ensure that the two germans are returned safely to their families , " steinmeier said . according to the german foreign ministry there are still about a hundred german nationals in iraq , people working for german and international companies or diplomatic services .
germany has issued a security warning on travel to iraq due to the unstable security environment there as iraqi authorities are grappling with kidnappings and killings of foreigners . kidnappings of germans not the first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was kidnapped and later released in iraq only about a year ago , two german technicians , rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke , were released by their kidnappers after a three-month hostage ordeal .
and in november 2005 susanne osthoff , a german archeologist working for an aid organization , was released after the german government allegedly paid a ransom to the tune of several million euros . the german government has staunchly denied this saying that it doesn ’ t make deals with terrorists .
the complete media ban in the current case , however , suggests that officials may already be working behind the scenes to try and establish a contact with the kidnappers . the most urgent question is whether hostages are held by kidnappers seeking a ransom or by islamic fundamentalists with a political motive .
these terrorists aim to drive western out of the iraq and do n't shy away from killing their victims to put their message across . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , others paid millions for iraq hostages , report says in spite of denials by top officials , germany , france and italy reportedly paid $ 45 million for hostages taken in iraq , a london newspaper reported .
-lrb- 22.05.2006 -rrb- public frustration mounts in case of german hostages the continued captivity of german engineers taken hostage in iraq over two months ago is leading to a sense among some germans that the government is not doing enough to secure their release .

however , host germany chose to highlight the positives . german chancellor angela merkel welcomed some of the most important political and military figures in the world to the annual international security conference in munich over the weekend .
as with previous year 's , the 2007 conference threw up its fair share of controversy . in recent year 's , the munich conference has provided the setting for a nervous appearance by donald rumsfeld in 2005 , when the former us secretary of defense faced possible war crime charges , and merkel 's assertion last year that the threat posed by iran was comparable to the rise of the nazis in the early 1930 's . grabbing the majority of the limelight this year was russian president vladimir putin who told the high-ranking audience in no uncertain terms that the united states bore the responsibility for many of the world 's worst security issues . as hosts of the conference , it came down to the germans to diffuse the situation .

" we are all determined to prevent the threat of an iran with a military nuclear program .
there are no ifs and buts here and no tricks . " larijani told the munich meeting that tehran had the right to peaceful nuclear technology and that his country 's uranium-enrichment activities were exclusively of a research and development nature . he said " irrational preconditions " such as western demands that iran must suspend uranium enrichment before coming to the negotiating table were an obstacle to solving the nuclear dispute . steinmeier : possible iran breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier saw a light at the end of the munich tunnel however , after meeting with eu foreign policy chief javier solana and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday for the first time since talks broke down last september , larijani said that " there is political will on both sides to have a negotiated settlement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 12.02.2007 germany takes positives from another controversial conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slogan reads " peace through dialogue " but iran 's ali larajani remained tight lipped a " threat " of a new cold war and a potential new stalemate over iran 's nuclear program could have brought this weekend 's munich security conference to a bitter end .
however , host germany chose to highlight the positives . german chancellor angela merkel welcomed some of the most important political and military figures in the world to the annual international security conference in munich over the weekend .
as with previous year 's , the 2007 conference threw up its fair share of controversy . in recent year 's , the munich conference has provided the setting for a nervous appearance by donald rumsfeld in 2005 , when the former us secretary of defense faced possible war crime charges , and merkel 's assertion last year that the threat posed by iran was comparable to the rise of the nazis in the early 1930 's . grabbing the majority of the limelight this year was russian president vladimir putin who told the high-ranking audience in no uncertain terms that the united states bore the responsibility for many of the world 's worst security issues . as hosts of the conference , it came down to the germans to diffuse the situation .
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said putin had been speaking in his own characteristic style at a venue that had " a suitable and longstanding context " for plain talking and added that putin 's comments " did not represent a reversion to the cold war . " berlin to keep dialogue open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you 're a bad lad , vlad . "
but berlin will keep talking putin also accused the us of provoking a new nuclear arms race by developing ballistic missile defenses in eastern europe as well as undermining international institutions and making the middle east more unstable . speaking in berlin on monday , the day after the conference closed , wilhelm added that berlin did not agree with putin 's criticism of nato 's eastward expansion , but would keep up the dialogue with the kremlin and continue to cooperate with russia on international issues . the other major incident to cause ripples was the decision of iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani to attend the conference after unexpectedly canceling his plans to attend and then , even more unexpectedly , reversing the reversal . face-to-face meeting before un deadline his attendance gave the german hosts and their european union counterparts in the current nuclear negotiation process the opportunity to address the crisis over iran 's ambitions face to face . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani talked tough but then gave hint of concession the german foreign ministry had arranged talks with larijani in munich with an eye on the feb .
21st un security council deadline for iran to stop enriching uranium for nuclear fuel or risk further international sanctions . before larijani spoke to the conference , merkel made it clear that the pressure remained on iran to make the first move . " if iran does not comply with international demands , it risks falling deeper into isolation , " merkel said .
" we are all determined to prevent the threat of an iran with a military nuclear program .
there are no ifs and buts here and no tricks . " larijani told the munich meeting that tehran had the right to peaceful nuclear technology and that his country 's uranium-enrichment activities were exclusively of a research and development nature . he said " irrational preconditions " such as western demands that iran must suspend uranium enrichment before coming to the negotiating table were an obstacle to solving the nuclear dispute . steinmeier : possible iran breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier saw a light at the end of the munich tunnel however , after meeting with eu foreign policy chief javier solana and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday for the first time since talks broke down last september , larijani said that " there is political will on both sides to have a negotiated settlement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 12.02.2007 germany to free former leader of left-wing terror group großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte mohnhaupt will be released on parole after 24 years in prison a german court has ruled that a former member of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , brigitte mohnhaupt will walk free on parole on march 27 after serving 24 years for multiple murders . after consulting the prosecutors and a psychiatric expert for mohnhaupt 's case , a state court in stuttgart found " no indications … that she could commit future serious offenses . " mohnhaupt will serve the remainder of her sentence on parole . the case has revived painful memories of the raf 's violent campaign of the 1970s . also known as the baader-meinhof gang after its founders andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , the red army faction murdered a string of high-profile german establishment figures from 1977 to 1982 as it attempted to bring down what it considered an oppressive capitalist state . the group is suspected of killing 34 people between 1972 and 1991 .
some 26 raf members died during that period and another 26 were sentenced to life in prison . mohnhaupt , now 57 , had risen to the ranks of the raf 's " second-generation " leadership in 1977 .
she has never explicitly apologized for the bloodshed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of schleyer , held hostage by the raf for over a month , became an iconic image of 1970s west germany in 1977 , mohnhaupt took part in the abductions and subsequent murders of west germany 's chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback , head of the west german employers ' federation hanns-martin schleyer and dresdner bank chief executive jürgen ponto .
brigitte mohnhaupt was captured in 1982 , convicted of involvement in nine murders and sentenced to five life sentences in 1985 . mohnhaupt has already made nine excursions from prison , with armed police watching her , to prepare her for a changed world that is connected up by the internet and only dimly remembers communism , which began crumbling in europe in 1989 . monday 's court decision does not come as a surprise , since prosecutors had previously supported mohnhaupt 's bid for parole at a closed hearing in stuttgart on january 22 . other raf members await clemency the former terrorist had petitioned for parole once already on feb 21 , 2006 , but was rejected because she had not yet served the minimum required sentence of 24 years , a provision that grew out of the " unusual gravity of the crime . "
that sentence expires on march 26 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar is still awaiting a decision on his plea for clemency mohnhaupt 's release comes at the same time as another petition for clemency filed by convicted red army faction leader christian klar .
because klar , 54 , still has two years to serve before qualifying for possible parole , his only chance for an early release is a special pardon from german president horst köhler , who is currently reviewing the case .
former president johannes rau already rejected a previous petition for clemency . klar , who like mohnhaupt came from a well-off family and went to university to study philosophy before becoming a terrorist , is reported to have been well behaved in jail .
a berlin theatre has promised him a two-year staff internship if he is released . klar has also never renounced his ideas , telling an interviewer in 2001 he still wanted germany to make a " fresh start " and would never abjure what the raf had done , " though i do not contemplate reviving the armed struggle . " both mohnhaupt and klar 's cases have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against some politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . besides klar , the only other members of the raf still in prison are eva haule and birgit hogefeld . most of the terrorist organization 's original leaders committed suicide in jail during the 1970s . the group abandoned violence in 1992 and formally disbanded in 1998 . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we need proof that the german state is capable of mercy " gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison .

the sanctions prohibit countries from exporting nuclear and weapons technology to iran as well as impose visa bans and freeze assets of some iranian officials . " we want to maintain an door open for negotiation , but iran knows what we want them to do , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said . germany , france and england , backed by solana , offered iran political and economic incentives to suspend uranium enrichment .
despite the decision to impose sanctions , the eu says that offer still stands . enriched uranium can be used to make atomic weapons .
iran claims it is developing nuclear technology only to meet its energy needs .
europe and the united states , however , fear tehran wants to develop a nuclear arsenal under cover of a civilian nuclear program . open to negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign ministers decided to approve un sanctions at a meeting in brussels german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said a sunday speech made by ari larijani , iran 's top nuclear negotiator , could signal that iran wants to return to and continue negotiations . " now what we have to do is look at the proposal that iran is presenting and see if this paves the way back to the negotiating table , " steinmeier said . steinmeier said he and solana both thought there was an opportunity to reopen talks . " we both have the impression that in iran there is a new ambition to return to the negotiating table , " steinmeier told reporters monday , referring to meetings he and solana conducted with larijani .
" in the course of the next few days , we will have to sound out whether they -lrb- iran -rrb- can pursue that line . " we need to see what the signals are from iran , whether they are serious , " steinmeier added . " possibilities are not immense " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe still wants to negotiate with iran larijani said iran wants a negotiated settlement and does n't want to aggravate the tense political situation in the region . solana , however , was cautious , saying " the possibilities are not immense " and that he had yet to hear any new proposals from iran . on friday , the international atomic energy agency cut its aid package to iran by nearly 50 percent .
the cuts were meant to send a strong message to iran to shut down its uranium enrichment activities . " sanctions are one part of the double track approach we are taking in europe , " said spanish state secretary for european affairs alberto navarro .
" we know it is just the first step and these sanctions should be gradual . " iran risks more extensive economic sanctions if it fails to comply with a un security council deadline later this month to stop enrichment . eu ready to give serbia a new chance the ministers also said they were willing to give eu-hopeful serbia " a new chance " for talks on closer ties , but stressed that a resumption of stalled negotiations would depend on belgrade 's determination to arrest fugitives suspected of war crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ministers condemned violence that occurred in kosovo over the weekend steinmeier told reporters that a new serbian government must " live up to its responsibilities and cooperate with icty , " the united nations international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . " a new reform and europe-oriented government can make a new start , get back on the road to europe and regain lost time , " said eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn .
" this new government deserves a new chance . " belgrade must investigate war crimes however , rehn said the eu would resume suspended talks with serbia only if the new government took " concrete action " and showed " clear commitment " in the search for fugitive bosnian serb general ratko mladic and other key war crimes suspects . " full cooperation with icty remains the necessary condition for the pace and conclusions of stabilization talks , " rehn said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martti ahtisaari presented his proposal for kosovo and serbia on feb .
2 the 27-member bloc froze negotiations on closer economic and political ties - the first step towards eu membership - with serbia in may 2006 , demanding belgrade show " full cooperation " with the hague-based tribunal . eu foreign ministers also said that they were fully supporting a united nations plan that sets serbia 's breakaway region kosovo on the road to independence . the plans by un envoy for kosovo , martti ahtisaari , " provide comprehensive arrangements designed to promote in kosovo a multi-ethnic and democratic society based on the rule of law , " they said . belgrade and pristina must " participate actively and constructively " in upcoming talks on the plan , eu ministers said , adding that the bloc was ready " to play a significant role in the implementation of the status settlement . " rehn said he also expected russia to support the un plan , arguing that a long-term solution for kosovo must be backed by all members of the international community .

" they could not prove a link between zammar and the september attacks so they sentenced him for belonging to the muslim brotherhood when he was not wanted by syria for belonging to the group in the first place , " qurabi said . zammar 's lawyer mohanad al-husni told reuters his client had always maintained his innocence .
" this religious man had the misfortune of frequenting the same mosques in hamburg as al qaeda members .
he kept telling the judge he had no organizational links with any muslim group , " husni said . zammar was handed over to syrian custody in december 2001 , just two weeks after his arrest in morocco .
his trial opened last october . he was briefly detained in germany in october 2001 as he was suspected of having had contacts with mohammed atta , who headed a hamburg cell of islamic extremists before leading the september 11 hijacks and suicide attacks .
he was later released due to insufficient evidence . german news magazine der spiegel reported that six members of the german intelligence services interrogated zammar at length in syria 's far filastin prison in november 2002 . alleged torture after cia rendition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror suspects have been flown to third nations by the cia zammar is suspected of being one of a growing number of detainees flown by the cia from their point of capture to a third state , such as syria , under washington 's policy of " rendition " where interrogation and torture are undertaken .
" he has been subjected to beating and torture i can not even describe , " husni said .
zammar was visited once by red cross officials . the suspected collaboration of the german and american intelligence services in the zammar affair forms part of the brief of a parliamentary inquiry currently under way in germany .
" the germans had him , " husni said .
" they would not have let him go if he had anything to do with the attacks . " der spiegel reported that the cia and the us federal bureau of investigation had asked germany 's bka criminal police several times in late 2001 for information on the hamburg-based zammar , his identity , his previous history , and his environment . at the end of november 2001 , the bka replied that it was closely monitoring his presence in morocco and he planned to take a flight with dutch airline klm heading back to germany on december 8 . on the orders of the cia , the suspect was arrested at casablanca airport .

its makers said they hope it will help silence holocaust deniers , including iran 's president . a few months before his death in 2005 , simon wiesenthal remembered something he had promised his wife , cyla . " three to four years , " he had told her - that 's how long he would hunt nazi criminals from vienna before the family could move to israel . the wiesenthals never left the austrian capital as simon ended up devoting his entire life to bringing the holocaust 's perpetrators to justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : collecting stamps , including those with pictures of hitler , gave wiesenthal some distraction from his work " if you want to cure malaria , you have to live with the mosquitoes , " he said to friends who asked him why he would n't leave despite the hostility , death threats and even a bomb attack on his home .
" a soldier belongs on the battlefield . " the documentary " i have never forgotten you : the life and legacy of simon wiesenthal , " which premiered at the berlin international film festival , tries to shed light on why wiesenthal did n't keep the promise to his wife . " how could i simply restart my life where it had been interrupted and build houses ? "
wiesenthal , an architect by trade , asked after emerging from the nazi 's mauthausen death camp barely alive and weighing only 45 kilograms -lrb- 99 pounds -rrb- . labor of love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicole kidman , seen at the 2003 berlinale , narrated the film using interviews with the man himself as well as conversations with family members and friends , the film 's director , richard trank , recounts wiesenthal 's life from his birth in a small polish village through the horrors of the nazi era to his role as the world 's most prominent prosecutor of war criminals . produced by moriah films , which is associated with the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles , the documentary shows its subject in the best light possible and those behind it made no secret of their admiration for wiesenthal . " it was something from the heart , " trank , who has worked on several film productions for the center , said after the screening in berlin . painting a full picture despite this , the film also contains scenes about moments of controversy in wiesenthal 's life . " i wanted a full picture , " trank said .
" we did n't want to skip over some of the more controversial parts of his life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesenthal visited an austrian jewish cemetery vandalized by neo-nazis in 1992 those include allegations that wiesenthal may have taken too much credit for hunting down holocaust organizer adolf eichmann , who was hanged in israel in 1962 . there is also discussion about accusations that wiesenthal - based on false information - acted irresponsibly by saying that nazi doctor josef mengele , who killed thousands for medical experiments at concentration camps , was still alive while he had already died years earlier .
the documentary includes wiesenthal 's war crimes accusations against the leader of austria 's fpö party , friedrich peter , which led peter 's political ally , austrian chancellor bruno kreisky , to accuse wiesenthal of employing mafia methods . contagious obsession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kingsley said wiesenthal 's gesture of wiping his face with one hand summed up all the pain he had suffered but these episodes in the movie pale in comparison with the praise by wiesenthal 's admirers , including sir ben kingsley , who played wiesenthal in the1989 film " murderers among us : the simon wiesenthal story . " " it was an obsession he had and when you were around him you became addicted , " said kingsley , who also attended the screening .
" he was like a dad to me .
he is still part of my cellular tissue .
he taught me a great deal . " education tool trank said the movie had already found a distributor in germany and would be released in the us in late spring before going on to television and dvd . " most importantly , it will be used in schools , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish delegates with ahmadinejad at the conference last year wiesenthal center officials meanwhile said they were planning to translate the movie into farsi and find a way to broadcast it in iran , where the country 's president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , recently hosted a conference questioning that the holocaust actually took place .

the sanctions prohibit countries from exporting nuclear and weapons technology to iran as well as impose visa bans and freeze assets of some iranian officials . " we want to maintain an door open for negotiation , but iran knows what we want them to do , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said . germany , france and england , backed by solana , offered iran political and economic incentives to suspend uranium enrichment .
despite the decision to impose sanctions , the eu says that offer still stands . enriched uranium can be used to make atomic weapons .
iran claims it is developing nuclear technology only to meet its energy needs .
europe and the united states , however , fear tehran wants to develop a nuclear arsenal under cover of a civilian nuclear program . open to negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign ministers decided to approve un sanctions at a meeting in brussels german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said a sunday speech made by ari larijani , iran 's top nuclear negotiator , could signal that iran wants to return to and continue negotiations . " now what we have to do is look at the proposal that iran is presenting and see if this paves the way back to the negotiating table , " steinmeier said . steinmeier said he and solana both thought there was an opportunity to reopen talks . " we both have the impression that in iran there is a new ambition to return to the negotiating table , " steinmeier told reporters monday , referring to meetings he and solana conducted with larijani .
" in the course of the next few days , we will have to sound out whether they -lrb- iran -rrb- can pursue that line . " we need to see what the signals are from iran , whether they are serious , " steinmeier added . " possibilities are not immense " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe still wants to negotiate with iran larijani said iran wants a negotiated settlement and does n't want to aggravate the tense political situation in the region . solana , however , was cautious , saying " the possibilities are not immense " and that he had yet to hear any new proposals from iran . on friday , the international atomic energy agency cut its aid package to iran by nearly 50 percent .
the cuts were meant to send a strong message to iran to shut down its uranium enrichment activities . " sanctions are one part of the double track approach we are taking in europe , " said spanish state secretary for european affairs alberto navarro .
" we know it is just the first step and these sanctions should be gradual . " iran risks more extensive economic sanctions if it fails to comply with a un security council deadline later this month to stop enrichment . eu ready to give serbia a new chance the ministers also said they were willing to give eu-hopeful serbia " a new chance " for talks on closer ties , but stressed that a resumption of stalled negotiations would depend on belgrade 's determination to arrest fugitives suspected of war crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ministers condemned violence that occurred in kosovo over the weekend steinmeier told reporters that a new serbian government must " live up to its responsibilities and cooperate with icty , " the united nations international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . " a new reform and europe-oriented government can make a new start , get back on the road to europe and regain lost time , " said eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn .
" this new government deserves a new chance . " belgrade must investigate war crimes however , rehn said the eu would resume suspended talks with serbia only if the new government took " concrete action " and showed " clear commitment " in the search for fugitive bosnian serb general ratko mladic and other key war crimes suspects . " full cooperation with icty remains the necessary condition for the pace and conclusions of stabilization talks , " rehn said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martti ahtisaari presented his proposal for kosovo and serbia on feb .
2 the 27-member bloc froze negotiations on closer economic and political ties - the first step towards eu membership - with serbia in may 2006 , demanding belgrade show " full cooperation " with the hague-based tribunal . eu foreign ministers also said that they were fully supporting a united nations plan that sets serbia 's breakaway region kosovo on the road to independence . the plans by un envoy for kosovo , martti ahtisaari , " provide comprehensive arrangements designed to promote in kosovo a multi-ethnic and democratic society based on the rule of law , " they said . belgrade and pristina must " participate actively and constructively " in upcoming talks on the plan , eu ministers said , adding that the bloc was ready " to play a significant role in the implementation of the status settlement . " rehn said he also expected russia to support the un plan , arguing that a long-term solution for kosovo must be backed by all members of the international community .

" russia again claims a place in the first row , and with its nuclear arsenal , its size , and its oil and gas riches it has , by all means , weighty arguments , " wrote the munich daily süddeutsche zeitung in its monday edition .
" the usa offers another with its disastrous iraq adventure .
since that weakens western credibility , it creates the opportunity for putin to set himself up as the powerful voice of the growing number of countries and peoples who are stricken by doubt in the wisdom of western policies .
the russian president has laid his cards on the table .
europe and america now know where russia has positioned itself . " " in vladimir putin 's controlled ' democracy , ' power-political rowdiness is at least as pronounced as the need for cooperation , " commented the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily .
" in view of the general development of the past years , it 's assumedly even somewhat greater at the moment - as a signal from the kremlin that russia ' is back . '
one reason why putin acts as he did in munich and why russia ' is back ' in world politics has come to light : it is the petrol power that straightened out its self-confidence again .
in addition , comes the knowledge that america and its european allies want to have russia by their side in dealing with conflicts , and the correct appraisal that the bush administration currently finds itself in anything but a comfortable situation , " the paper continued . " how does one deal with putin 's munich blunder ? " asked the westdeutsche zeitung from düsseldorf .
" glossing over it , as some europeans try to do , would be just as wrong as responding with more verbal poison .
in view of worldwide problems , it 's important that russia remains level-headed and collaborates on finding solutions .
the next test will be the expiration of the un 's 60-day deadline for iran to discontinue its nuclear program , at the end of february .

" mohnhaupt will serve the remainder of her sentence on parole . the case has revived painful memories of the raf 's violent campaign of the 1970s . also known as the baader-meinhof gang after its founders andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , the red army faction murdered a string of high-profile german establishment figures from 1977 to 1982 as it attempted to bring down what it considered an oppressive capitalist state . the group is suspected of killing 34 people between 1972 and 1991 .
some 26 raf members died during that period and another 26 were sentenced to life in prison . mohnhaupt , now 57 , had risen to the ranks of the raf 's " second-generation " leadership in 1977 .
she has never explicitly apologized for the bloodshed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of schleyer , held hostage by the raf for over a month , became an iconic image of 1970s west germany in 1977 , mohnhaupt took part in the abductions and subsequent murders of west germany 's chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback , head of the west german employers ' federation hanns-martin schleyer and dresdner bank chief executive jürgen ponto .
brigitte mohnhaupt was captured in 1982 , convicted of involvement in nine murders and sentenced to five life sentences in 1985 . mohnhaupt has already made nine excursions from prison , with armed police watching her , to prepare her for a changed world that is connected up by the internet and only dimly remembers communism , which began crumbling in europe in 1989 . monday 's court decision does not come as a surprise , since prosecutors had previously supported mohnhaupt 's bid for parole at a closed hearing in stuttgart on january 22 . other raf members await clemency the former terrorist had petitioned for parole once already on feb 21 , 2006 , but was rejected because she had not yet served the minimum required sentence of 24 years , a provision that grew out of the " unusual gravity of the crime .

because klar , 54 , still has two years to serve before qualifying for possible parole , his only chance for an early release is a special pardon from german president horst köhler , who is currently reviewing the case .
former president johannes rau already rejected a previous petition for clemency . klar , who like mohnhaupt came from a well-off family and went to university to study philosophy before becoming a terrorist , is reported to have been well behaved in jail .

" both mohnhaupt and klar 's cases have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against some politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . besides klar , the only other members of the raf still in prison are eva haule and birgit hogefeld . most of the terrorist organization 's original leaders committed suicide in jail during the 1970s . the group abandoned violence in 1992 and formally disbanded in 1998 . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we need proof that the german state is capable of mercy " gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison .

the sanctions prohibit countries from exporting nuclear and weapons technology to iran as well as impose visa bans and freeze assets of some iranian officials . " we want to maintain an door open for negotiation , but iran knows what we want them to do , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said . germany , france and england , backed by solana , offered iran political and economic incentives to suspend uranium enrichment .
despite the decision to impose sanctions , the eu says that offer still stands . enriched uranium can be used to make atomic weapons .
iran claims it is developing nuclear technology only to meet its energy needs .
europe and the united states , however , fear tehran wants to develop a nuclear arsenal under cover of a civilian nuclear program . open to negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign ministers decided to approve un sanctions at a meeting in brussels german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said a sunday speech made by ari larijani , iran 's top nuclear negotiator , could signal that iran wants to return to and continue negotiations . " now what we have to do is look at the proposal that iran is presenting and see if this paves the way back to the negotiating table , " steinmeier said . steinmeier said he and solana both thought there was an opportunity to reopen talks . " we both have the impression that in iran there is a new ambition to return to the negotiating table , " steinmeier told reporters monday , referring to meetings he and solana conducted with larijani .
" in the course of the next few days , we will have to sound out whether they -lrb- iran -rrb- can pursue that line . " we need to see what the signals are from iran , whether they are serious , " steinmeier added . " possibilities are not immense " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe still wants to negotiate with iran larijani said iran wants a negotiated settlement and does n't want to aggravate the tense political situation in the region . solana , however , was cautious , saying " the possibilities are not immense " and that he had yet to hear any new proposals from iran . on friday , the international atomic energy agency cut its aid package to iran by nearly 50 percent .
the cuts were meant to send a strong message to iran to shut down its uranium enrichment activities . " sanctions are one part of the double track approach we are taking in europe , " said spanish state secretary for european affairs alberto navarro .
" we know it is just the first step and these sanctions should be gradual . " iran risks more extensive economic sanctions if it fails to comply with a un security council deadline later this month to stop enrichment . eu ready to give serbia a new chance the ministers also said they were willing to give eu-hopeful serbia " a new chance " for talks on closer ties , but stressed that a resumption of stalled negotiations would depend on belgrade 's determination to arrest fugitives suspected of war crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ministers condemned violence that occurred in kosovo over the weekend steinmeier told reporters that a new serbian government must " live up to its responsibilities and cooperate with icty , " the united nations international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . " a new reform and europe-oriented government can make a new start , get back on the road to europe and regain lost time , " said eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn .
" this new government deserves a new chance . " belgrade must investigate war crimes however , rehn said the eu would resume suspended talks with serbia only if the new government took " concrete action " and showed " clear commitment " in the search for fugitive bosnian serb general ratko mladic and other key war crimes suspects . " full cooperation with icty remains the necessary condition for the pace and conclusions of stabilization talks , " rehn said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martti ahtisaari presented his proposal for kosovo and serbia on feb .
2 the 27-member bloc froze negotiations on closer economic and political ties - the first step towards eu membership - with serbia in may 2006 , demanding belgrade show " full cooperation " with the hague-based tribunal . eu foreign ministers also said that they were fully supporting a united nations plan that sets serbia 's breakaway region kosovo on the road to independence . the plans by un envoy for kosovo , martti ahtisaari , " provide comprehensive arrangements designed to promote in kosovo a multi-ethnic and democratic society based on the rule of law , " they said . belgrade and pristina must " participate actively and constructively " in upcoming talks on the plan , eu ministers said , adding that the bloc was ready " to play a significant role in the implementation of the status settlement . " rehn said he also expected russia to support the un plan , arguing that a long-term solution for kosovo must be backed by all members of the international community . " kosovo will be a real test for multilateralism , " rehn said . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany takes positives from another controversial conference a " threat " of a new cold war and a potential new stalemate over iran 's nuclear program could have brought this weekend 's munich security conference to a bitter end .

a majority of israeli and american jews now have positive views of germany , according to a new study . jewish opinions of germany have improved dramatically when compared to a major survey done in 1991 .
shortly after german reunification , jews in israel and the united states felt germans continued to hold anti-semitic beliefs and that the country was not on a stable democratic footing . those perceptions , however , have changed significantly during the past 15 years , according to the bertelsmann foundation study , which was released sunday . increase in favorable opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the holocaust remains a central issue to german-jewish relations a majority of israelis , 57 percent , now have a favorable opinion of germany , an increase of 48 percent since a similar poll was conducted in 1991 .
more than 70 percent of american jews see germany favorably , according to the bertelsmann study . according to the 1991 survey nearly 80 percent of israelis felt germany was endangered by extremist groups , a feeling now shared by 46 percent of those surveyed . during the same time , there 's been an increase in the number of germans who feel shame for the crimes committed against the jewish people and who are unwilling to ignore the past and " move on , " according to the report . although nearly half of jews in israel and the us still suspect a majority of germans hold anti-semitic beliefs , the survey found that these beliefs are on the wane in germany . " it is quite apparent that the centers of the two societies now have a much more positive attitude towards one another than they did in the early 90s , " werner weidenfeld , executive board member at the bertelsmann foundation , said in a statement .
" overall the ways germans and israelis perceive one another have become a lot less controversial and much more relaxed . " in israel , only 9 percent believe reconciliation with germany remains impossible , down from 69 percent in 1991 . political views differ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jews and germans have different outlooks towards war the survey , however , showed a difference of opinion between jews and germans when it comes to dealing with current events . three of four israelis polled were in favor of the deployment of german bundeswehr forces to the coast of lebanon .
in contrast , only 49 percent of germans support the deployment , where german boats patrol as part of international efforts to stop weapons from being smuggled to hezbollah guerrillas in lebanon . likewise , 80 percent of israelis and 72 percent of american jews surveyed support a military strike against iran if the country is found to have built an atomic bomb .
only 32 percent of germans consider that level of military action justified . " with their different historical memories , but also with their completely different political realities , germans and israelis have completely different political cultures , " said stephan vopel , project director at the bertelsmann foundation .
" this gives rise to strong disparities in formulating ways to deal with conflicts .

" mohnhaupt will serve the remainder of her sentence on parole . the case has revived painful memories of the raf 's violent campaign of the 1970s . also known as the baader-meinhof gang after its founders andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , the red army faction murdered a string of high-profile german establishment figures from 1977 to 1982 as it attempted to bring down what it considered an oppressive capitalist state . the group is suspected of killing 34 people between 1972 and 1991 .
some 26 raf members died during that period and another 26 were sentenced to life in prison . mohnhaupt , now 57 , had risen to the ranks of the raf 's " second-generation " leadership in 1977 .
she has never explicitly apologized for the bloodshed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of schleyer , held hostage by the raf for over a month , became an iconic image of 1970s west germany in 1977 , mohnhaupt took part in the abductions and subsequent murders of west germany 's chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback , head of the west german employers ' federation hanns-martin schleyer and dresdner bank chief executive jürgen ponto .
brigitte mohnhaupt was captured in 1982 , convicted of involvement in nine murders and sentenced to five life sentences in 1985 . mohnhaupt has already made nine excursions from prison , with armed police watching her , to prepare her for a changed world that is connected up by the internet and only dimly remembers communism , which began crumbling in europe in 1989 . monday 's court decision does not come as a surprise , since prosecutors had previously supported mohnhaupt 's bid for parole at a closed hearing in stuttgart on january 22 . other raf members await clemency the former terrorist had petitioned for parole once already on feb 21 , 2006 , but was rejected because she had not yet served the minimum required sentence of 24 years , a provision that grew out of the " unusual gravity of the crime . "
that sentence expires on march 26 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar is still awaiting a decision on his plea for clemency mohnhaupt 's release comes at the same time as another petition for clemency filed by convicted red army faction leader christian klar .
because klar , 54 , still has two years to serve before qualifying for possible parole , his only chance for an early release is a special pardon from german president horst köhler , who is currently reviewing the case .
former president johannes rau already rejected a previous petition for clemency . klar , who like mohnhaupt came from a well-off family and went to university to study philosophy before becoming a terrorist , is reported to have been well behaved in jail .
a berlin theatre has promised him a two-year staff internship if he is released . klar has also never renounced his ideas , telling an interviewer in 2001 he still wanted germany to make a " fresh start " and would never abjure what the raf had done , " though i do not contemplate reviving the armed struggle . " both mohnhaupt and klar 's cases have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against some politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . besides klar , the only other members of the raf still in prison are eva haule and birgit hogefeld . most of the terrorist organization 's original leaders committed suicide in jail during the 1970s . the group abandoned violence in 1992 and formally disbanded in 1998 . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we need proof that the german state is capable of mercy " gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison .

" the results of this referendum are clear , it proves that the portuguese people want to turn the page on the question of abortion , " socrates said . but turnout in portugal 's second referendum on its abortion law in less than a decade was 43.6 percent , below the 50 percent threshold needed to make the ballot legally binding . socrates pledged his socialist government will now use its parliamentary majority to legalize abortion . portugal abortion laws among most restrictive in eu abortion is currently allowed in portugal only in cases of rape , a malformed fetus or if the woman 's well-being is in danger . a woman can be jailed for up to three years for having an illegal abortion while those who perform them face up to eight years behind bars . within the 27-nation european union only ireland , malta and poland have abortion laws that are similar or even more restrictive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose socrates believes the yes vote will lead to a more tolerant portugal socrates , elected in a landslide in 2005 , said the new law would be modeled on legislation in place in other european nations and would require a reflection period before an abortion can be carried out . " it is my sincere conviction that with the result of this referendum portugal has taken another step in the creation of a society that is more open , tolerant and just , " he said . catholic church opposed to easing law opposition to change was led by the influential catholic church which argued the government should do more to help women to have children instead of easing abortion restrictions . one priest threatened catholics who voted to ease the law with excommunication from the church .
the bishop of the northern city of braganca likened abortion to the execution of former iraqi leader saddam hussein . more than 90 percent of portugal 's population of 10.6 million identify themselves as being roman catholic although , as in other catholic countries , regular church attendance is on the decline . in a referendum held in 1998 voters upheld the existing abortion law by a whisker but the result was declared void as nearly seven out of 10 voters stayed away . during the last referendum the socialists were split with then prime minister , antonio guterres , publicly opposed to the abortion law being changed . a " national shame " socrates by contrast has backed liberalization at rallies across the country and this time it was the main opposition centre-right social democrats that was divided on the issue .
the party did not adopt an official position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say backstreet abortions in portugal are risky since the last referendum , several trials of women charged with illegally terminating their pregnancies were held that generated widespread public sympathy for the women .
analysts said this helped boost support for reform . during the campaign socrates called backstreet abortions a " national shame " and cast the referendum as a test of portugal 's readiness for progress . pro-abortion groups estimate that some 10,000 women are hospitalized , and several die every year from complications arising from botched backstreet abortions . anti-abortion groups contest the figure . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government discusses reducing late abortions parliamentary leaders met with church representatives tuesday to talk about reforming legislation on late abortions , as conservatives push for more stringent controls on terminations and a re-think of who foots the bill .

" russia again claims a place in the first row , and with its nuclear arsenal , its size , and its oil and gas riches it has , by all means , weighty arguments , " wrote the munich daily süddeutsche zeitung in its monday edition .
" the usa offers another with its disastrous iraq adventure .
since that weakens western credibility , it creates the opportunity for putin to set himself up as the powerful voice of the growing number of countries and peoples who are stricken by doubt in the wisdom of western policies .
the russian president has laid his cards on the table .
europe and america now know where russia has positioned itself . " " in vladimir putin 's controlled ' democracy , ' power-political rowdiness is at least as pronounced as the need for cooperation , " commented the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily .
" in view of the general development of the past years , it 's assumedly even somewhat greater at the moment - as a signal from the kremlin that russia ' is back . '
one reason why putin acts as he did in munich and why russia ' is back ' in world politics has come to light : it is the petrol power that straightened out its self-confidence again .
in addition , comes the knowledge that america and its european allies want to have russia by their side in dealing with conflicts , and the correct appraisal that the bush administration currently finds itself in anything but a comfortable situation , " the paper continued . " how does one deal with putin 's munich blunder ? " asked the westdeutsche zeitung from düsseldorf .
" glossing over it , as some europeans try to do , would be just as wrong as responding with more verbal poison .
in view of worldwide problems , it 's important that russia remains level-headed and collaborates on finding solutions .
the next test will be the expiration of the un 's 60-day deadline for iran to discontinue its nuclear program , at the end of february .
now more than ever russia is unlikely to back a further un resolution . "
the times of london said monday that putin 's harsh comments were more than just another repeat of the bush administration 's mistakes .
" if the us administration didn ’ t have enough to worry about , given the current state of the world , it spent much of the weekend wondering whether moscow had declared another cold war … not since nikita khrushchev banged his shoe on the table at the united nations in 1960 has an international gathering heard such an icy blast from moscow ’ s leadership . " conservative french newspaper le figaro noted putin had increased the hostile tone between russia and the united states as part of his crusade against washington .
" this was vladimir putin 's variations on an old theme .
many participants at the security conference asked themselves the question of whether the second cold war was being announced in munich . " putin wants to make it clear that he wo n't allow outsiders to meddle in russia 's domestic affairs , said budapest newspaper nepszabadsag .
" should that be a cold war ?
or only an expression of the self-confident unity of an energy supplier equipped with enormous foreign exchange reserves ?
is ' soverign democracy ' not merely a pretty name for new authoritarianism ?
there is currently no confrontation .
there are discussions .

" they could not prove a link between zammar and the september attacks so they sentenced him for belonging to the muslim brotherhood when he was not wanted by syria for belonging to the group in the first place , " qurabi said . zammar 's lawyer mohanad al-husni told reuters his client had always maintained his innocence .
" this religious man had the misfortune of frequenting the same mosques in hamburg as al qaeda members .
he kept telling the judge he had no organizational links with any muslim group , " husni said . zammar was handed over to syrian custody in december 2001 , just two weeks after his arrest in morocco .
his trial opened last october . he was briefly detained in germany in october 2001 as he was suspected of having had contacts with mohammed atta , who headed a hamburg cell of islamic extremists before leading the september 11 hijacks and suicide attacks .
he was later released due to insufficient evidence . german news magazine der spiegel reported that six members of the german intelligence services interrogated zammar at length in syria 's far filastin prison in november 2002 . alleged torture after cia rendition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror suspects have been flown to third nations by the cia zammar is suspected of being one of a growing number of detainees flown by the cia from their point of capture to a third state , such as syria , under washington 's policy of " rendition " where interrogation and torture are undertaken .
" he has been subjected to beating and torture i can not even describe , " husni said .
zammar was visited once by red cross officials . the suspected collaboration of the german and american intelligence services in the zammar affair forms part of the brief of a parliamentary inquiry currently under way in germany .
" the germans had him , " husni said .
" they would not have let him go if he had anything to do with the attacks . " der spiegel reported that the cia and the us federal bureau of investigation had asked germany 's bka criminal police several times in late 2001 for information on the hamburg-based zammar , his identity , his previous history , and his environment . at the end of november 2001 , the bka replied that it was closely monitoring his presence in morocco and he planned to take a flight with dutch airline klm heading back to germany on december 8 . on the orders of the cia , the suspect was arrested at casablanca airport .

a majority of israeli and american jews now have positive views of germany , according to a new study . jewish opinions of germany have improved dramatically when compared to a major survey done in 1991 .
shortly after german reunification , jews in israel and the united states felt germans continued to hold anti-semitic beliefs and that the country was not on a stable democratic footing . those perceptions , however , have changed significantly during the past 15 years , according to the bertelsmann foundation study , which was released sunday . increase in favorable opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the holocaust remains a central issue to german-jewish relations a majority of israelis , 57 percent , now have a favorable opinion of germany , an increase of 48 percent since a similar poll was conducted in 1991 .
more than 70 percent of american jews see germany favorably , according to the bertelsmann study . according to the 1991 survey nearly 80 percent of israelis felt germany was endangered by extremist groups , a feeling now shared by 46 percent of those surveyed . during the same time , there 's been an increase in the number of germans who feel shame for the crimes committed against the jewish people and who are unwilling to ignore the past and " move on , " according to the report . although nearly half of jews in israel and the us still suspect a majority of germans hold anti-semitic beliefs , the survey found that these beliefs are on the wane in germany . " it is quite apparent that the centers of the two societies now have a much more positive attitude towards one another than they did in the early 90s , " werner weidenfeld , executive board member at the bertelsmann foundation , said in a statement .
" overall the ways germans and israelis perceive one another have become a lot less controversial and much more relaxed . " in israel , only 9 percent believe reconciliation with germany remains impossible , down from 69 percent in 1991 . political views differ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jews and germans have different outlooks towards war the survey , however , showed a difference of opinion between jews and germans when it comes to dealing with current events . three of four israelis polled were in favor of the deployment of german bundeswehr forces to the coast of lebanon .
in contrast , only 49 percent of germans support the deployment , where german boats patrol as part of international efforts to stop weapons from being smuggled to hezbollah guerrillas in lebanon . likewise , 80 percent of israelis and 72 percent of american jews surveyed support a military strike against iran if the country is found to have built an atomic bomb .
only 32 percent of germans consider that level of military action justified . " with their different historical memories , but also with their completely different political realities , germans and israelis have completely different political cultures , " said stephan vopel , project director at the bertelsmann foundation .
" this gives rise to strong disparities in formulating ways to deal with conflicts .
israelis tend to subscribe to the maxim ' never again victims , ' the germans ' dictum after world war ii has been ' never again war .

its makers said they hope it will help silence holocaust deniers , including iran 's president . a few months before his death in 2005 , simon wiesenthal remembered something he had promised his wife , cyla . " three to four years , " he had told her - that 's how long he would hunt nazi criminals from vienna before the family could move to israel . the wiesenthals never left the austrian capital as simon ended up devoting his entire life to bringing the holocaust 's perpetrators to justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : collecting stamps , including those with pictures of hitler , gave wiesenthal some distraction from his work " if you want to cure malaria , you have to live with the mosquitoes , " he said to friends who asked him why he would n't leave despite the hostility , death threats and even a bomb attack on his home .
" a soldier belongs on the battlefield . " the documentary " i have never forgotten you : the life and legacy of simon wiesenthal , " which premiered at the berlin international film festival , tries to shed light on why wiesenthal did n't keep the promise to his wife . " how could i simply restart my life where it had been interrupted and build houses ? "
wiesenthal , an architect by trade , asked after emerging from the nazi 's mauthausen death camp barely alive and weighing only 45 kilograms -lrb- 99 pounds -rrb- . labor of love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicole kidman , seen at the 2003 berlinale , narrated the film using interviews with the man himself as well as conversations with family members and friends , the film 's director , richard trank , recounts wiesenthal 's life from his birth in a small polish village through the horrors of the nazi era to his role as the world 's most prominent prosecutor of war criminals . produced by moriah films , which is associated with the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles , the documentary shows its subject in the best light possible and those behind it made no secret of their admiration for wiesenthal . " it was something from the heart , " trank , who has worked on several film productions for the center , said after the screening in berlin . painting a full picture despite this , the film also contains scenes about moments of controversy in wiesenthal 's life . " i wanted a full picture , " trank said .
" we did n't want to skip over some of the more controversial parts of his life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesenthal visited an austrian jewish cemetery vandalized by neo-nazis in 1992 those include allegations that wiesenthal may have taken too much credit for hunting down holocaust organizer adolf eichmann , who was hanged in israel in 1962 . there is also discussion about accusations that wiesenthal - based on false information - acted irresponsibly by saying that nazi doctor josef mengele , who killed thousands for medical experiments at concentration camps , was still alive while he had already died years earlier .
the documentary includes wiesenthal 's war crimes accusations against the leader of austria 's fpö party , friedrich peter , which led peter 's political ally , austrian chancellor bruno kreisky , to accuse wiesenthal of employing mafia methods . contagious obsession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kingsley said wiesenthal 's gesture of wiping his face with one hand summed up all the pain he had suffered but these episodes in the movie pale in comparison with the praise by wiesenthal 's admirers , including sir ben kingsley , who played wiesenthal in the1989 film " murderers among us : the simon wiesenthal story . " " it was an obsession he had and when you were around him you became addicted , " said kingsley , who also attended the screening .
" he was like a dad to me .
he is still part of my cellular tissue .
he taught me a great deal . " education tool trank said the movie had already found a distributor in germany and would be released in the us in late spring before going on to television and dvd . " most importantly , it will be used in schools , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish delegates with ahmadinejad at the conference last year wiesenthal center officials meanwhile said they were planning to translate the movie into farsi and find a way to broadcast it in iran , where the country 's president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , recently hosted a conference questioning that the holocaust actually took place .

" the results of this referendum are clear , it proves that the portuguese people want to turn the page on the question of abortion , " socrates said . but turnout in portugal 's second referendum on its abortion law in less than a decade was 43.6 percent , below the 50 percent threshold needed to make the ballot legally binding . socrates pledged his socialist government will now use its parliamentary majority to legalize abortion . portugal abortion laws among most restrictive in eu abortion is currently allowed in portugal only in cases of rape , a malformed fetus or if the woman 's well-being is in danger . a woman can be jailed for up to three years for having an illegal abortion while those who perform them face up to eight years behind bars . within the 27-nation european union only ireland , malta and poland have abortion laws that are similar or even more restrictive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose socrates believes the yes vote will lead to a more tolerant portugal socrates , elected in a landslide in 2005 , said the new law would be modeled on legislation in place in other european nations and would require a reflection period before an abortion can be carried out . " it is my sincere conviction that with the result of this referendum portugal has taken another step in the creation of a society that is more open , tolerant and just , " he said . catholic church opposed to easing law opposition to change was led by the influential catholic church which argued the government should do more to help women to have children instead of easing abortion restrictions . one priest threatened catholics who voted to ease the law with excommunication from the church .
the bishop of the northern city of braganca likened abortion to the execution of former iraqi leader saddam hussein . more than 90 percent of portugal 's population of 10.6 million identify themselves as being roman catholic although , as in other catholic countries , regular church attendance is on the decline . in a referendum held in 1998 voters upheld the existing abortion law by a whisker but the result was declared void as nearly seven out of 10 voters stayed away . during the last referendum the socialists were split with then prime minister , antonio guterres , publicly opposed to the abortion law being changed . a " national shame " socrates by contrast has backed liberalization at rallies across the country and this time it was the main opposition centre-right social democrats that was divided on the issue .
the party did not adopt an official position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say backstreet abortions in portugal are risky since the last referendum , several trials of women charged with illegally terminating their pregnancies were held that generated widespread public sympathy for the women .
analysts said this helped boost support for reform . during the campaign socrates called backstreet abortions a " national shame " and cast the referendum as a test of portugal 's readiness for progress . pro-abortion groups estimate that some 10,000 women are hospitalized , and several die every year from complications arising from botched backstreet abortions . anti-abortion groups contest the figure . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government discusses reducing late abortions parliamentary leaders met with church representatives tuesday to talk about reforming legislation on late abortions , as conservatives push for more stringent controls on terminations and a re-think of who foots the bill .

before you pack your bag , check out what other dw-world.de readers had to say about their german travel experience . my husband , two daughters and i hired a car in frankfurt in july 2006 and headed for rothenburg ob der tauber .
it was an awesome experience - and a magical town .
we stayed at guesthouse eberlein .
erich and the team were the perfect hosts .
the town was absolutely fantastic : history , preservation , care , beauty and hospitality all wrapped in one small place .
our deepest admiration to the people of this great country .
we are certainly coming back . - samira h.r.oliveira , curitiba , brazil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : composer j.s. bach worked for many years in leipzig 's st. thomas church i visited germany a few years ago for a two-month study course .
impressions of germany from pictures and books had been rooted in my mind since my childhood .
in my mind , germany is not just a modern country , but also a country with a long history and legends , including hansel und gretel , walpurgistnacht , etc .
i 've been in canada and the us .
they 're just modern countries .
i barely found the aroma of their roots .
but in germany , despite its modernity , you still can sense her past history marked with castles here and there .
when arriving at the st. thomas church in leipzig i sighed with joy .
i touched the tomb of my favorite composer johann sebastian bach .
traveling in germany fulfills my idea of a great country . - johannes sebastian bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is no place for dieters , wrote one reader i am absolutely crazy for all things german !
i 've been fortunate to visit four times now .
when i 'm there , i want to stay longer and when i 'm not there , i ca n't wait to return .
on my last trip , i was able to visit my favorite city on the moselle river , bernkastel-kues , during the wine harvest festival in august .
the wine and food samples in all the different tents were fantastic .

" russia again claims a place in the first row , and with its nuclear arsenal , its size , and its oil and gas riches it has , by all means , weighty arguments , " wrote the munich daily süddeutsche zeitung in its monday edition .
" the usa offers another with its disastrous iraq adventure .
since that weakens western credibility , it creates the opportunity for putin to set himself up as the powerful voice of the growing number of countries and peoples who are stricken by doubt in the wisdom of western policies .
the russian president has laid his cards on the table .
europe and america now know where russia has positioned itself . " " in vladimir putin 's controlled ' democracy , ' power-political rowdiness is at least as pronounced as the need for cooperation , " commented the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily .
" in view of the general development of the past years , it 's assumedly even somewhat greater at the moment - as a signal from the kremlin that russia ' is back . '
one reason why putin acts as he did in munich and why russia ' is back ' in world politics has come to light : it is the petrol power that straightened out its self-confidence again .
in addition , comes the knowledge that america and its european allies want to have russia by their side in dealing with conflicts , and the correct appraisal that the bush administration currently finds itself in anything but a comfortable situation , " the paper continued . " how does one deal with putin 's munich blunder ? " asked the westdeutsche zeitung from düsseldorf .
" glossing over it , as some europeans try to do , would be just as wrong as responding with more verbal poison .
in view of worldwide problems , it 's important that russia remains level-headed and collaborates on finding solutions .
the next test will be the expiration of the un 's 60-day deadline for iran to discontinue its nuclear program , at the end of february .
now more than ever russia is unlikely to back a further un resolution . "
the times of london said monday that putin 's harsh comments were more than just another repeat of the bush administration 's mistakes .
" if the us administration didn ’ t have enough to worry about , given the current state of the world , it spent much of the weekend wondering whether moscow had declared another cold war … not since nikita khrushchev banged his shoe on the table at the united nations in 1960 has an international gathering heard such an icy blast from moscow ’ s leadership . " conservative french newspaper le figaro noted putin had increased the hostile tone between russia and the united states as part of his crusade against washington .
" this was vladimir putin 's variations on an old theme .
many participants at the security conference asked themselves the question of whether the second cold war was being announced in munich . " putin wants to make it clear that he wo n't allow outsiders to meddle in russia 's domestic affairs , said budapest newspaper nepszabadsag .
" should that be a cold war ?
or only an expression of the self-confident unity of an energy supplier equipped with enormous foreign exchange reserves ?
is ' soverign democracy ' not merely a pretty name for new authoritarianism ?
there is currently no confrontation .
there are discussions .
these wo n't allow the disruption of dialogue about foreign and arms policy , over the issue of eastern european democracies and the human rights .
at least not for the time being . " bulgarian newspaper dnewnik warned that europe 's energy dependence gives putin power .
" the current strategy of the kremlin is to strike while the iron is hot - namely so long as europe depends on russia to supply a fifth of its energy needs .

a majority of israeli and american jews now have positive views of germany , according to a new study . jewish opinions of germany have improved dramatically when compared to a major survey done in 1991 .
shortly after german reunification , jews in israel and the united states felt germans continued to hold anti-semitic beliefs and that the country was not on a stable democratic footing . those perceptions , however , have changed significantly during the past 15 years , according to the bertelsmann foundation study , which was released sunday . increase in favorable opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the holocaust remains a central issue to german-jewish relations a majority of israelis , 57 percent , now have a favorable opinion of germany , an increase of 48 percent since a similar poll was conducted in 1991 .
more than 70 percent of american jews see germany favorably , according to the bertelsmann study . according to the 1991 survey nearly 80 percent of israelis felt germany was endangered by extremist groups , a feeling now shared by 46 percent of those surveyed . during the same time , there 's been an increase in the number of germans who feel shame for the crimes committed against the jewish people and who are unwilling to ignore the past and " move on , " according to the report . although nearly half of jews in israel and the us still suspect a majority of germans hold anti-semitic beliefs , the survey found that these beliefs are on the wane in germany . " it is quite apparent that the centers of the two societies now have a much more positive attitude towards one another than they did in the early 90s , " werner weidenfeld , executive board member at the bertelsmann foundation , said in a statement .
" overall the ways germans and israelis perceive one another have become a lot less controversial and much more relaxed . " in israel , only 9 percent believe reconciliation with germany remains impossible , down from 69 percent in 1991 . political views differ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jews and germans have different outlooks towards war the survey , however , showed a difference of opinion between jews and germans when it comes to dealing with current events . three of four israelis polled were in favor of the deployment of german bundeswehr forces to the coast of lebanon .
in contrast , only 49 percent of germans support the deployment , where german boats patrol as part of international efforts to stop weapons from being smuggled to hezbollah guerrillas in lebanon . likewise , 80 percent of israelis and 72 percent of american jews surveyed support a military strike against iran if the country is found to have built an atomic bomb .
only 32 percent of germans consider that level of military action justified . " with their different historical memories , but also with their completely different political realities , germans and israelis have completely different political cultures , " said stephan vopel , project director at the bertelsmann foundation .
" this gives rise to strong disparities in formulating ways to deal with conflicts .
israelis tend to subscribe to the maxim ' never again victims , ' the germans ' dictum after world war ii has been ' never again war .

its makers said they hope it will help silence holocaust deniers , including iran 's president . a few months before his death in 2005 , simon wiesenthal remembered something he had promised his wife , cyla . " three to four years , " he had told her - that 's how long he would hunt nazi criminals from vienna before the family could move to israel . the wiesenthals never left the austrian capital as simon ended up devoting his entire life to bringing the holocaust 's perpetrators to justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : collecting stamps , including those with pictures of hitler , gave wiesenthal some distraction from his work " if you want to cure malaria , you have to live with the mosquitoes , " he said to friends who asked him why he would n't leave despite the hostility , death threats and even a bomb attack on his home .
" a soldier belongs on the battlefield . " the documentary " i have never forgotten you : the life and legacy of simon wiesenthal , " which premiered at the berlin international film festival , tries to shed light on why wiesenthal did n't keep the promise to his wife . " how could i simply restart my life where it had been interrupted and build houses ? "
wiesenthal , an architect by trade , asked after emerging from the nazi 's mauthausen death camp barely alive and weighing only 45 kilograms -lrb- 99 pounds -rrb- . labor of love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicole kidman , seen at the 2003 berlinale , narrated the film using interviews with the man himself as well as conversations with family members and friends , the film 's director , richard trank , recounts wiesenthal 's life from his birth in a small polish village through the horrors of the nazi era to his role as the world 's most prominent prosecutor of war criminals . produced by moriah films , which is associated with the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles , the documentary shows its subject in the best light possible and those behind it made no secret of their admiration for wiesenthal . " it was something from the heart , " trank , who has worked on several film productions for the center , said after the screening in berlin . painting a full picture despite this , the film also contains scenes about moments of controversy in wiesenthal 's life . " i wanted a full picture , " trank said .

" russia again claims a place in the first row , and with its nuclear arsenal , its size , and its oil and gas riches it has , by all means , weighty arguments , " wrote the munich daily süddeutsche zeitung in its monday edition .
" the usa offers another with its disastrous iraq adventure .
since that weakens western credibility , it creates the opportunity for putin to set himself up as the powerful voice of the growing number of countries and peoples who are stricken by doubt in the wisdom of western policies .
the russian president has laid his cards on the table .
europe and america now know where russia has positioned itself . " " in vladimir putin 's controlled ' democracy , ' power-political rowdiness is at least as pronounced as the need for cooperation , " commented the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily .
" in view of the general development of the past years , it 's assumedly even somewhat greater at the moment - as a signal from the kremlin that russia ' is back . '
one reason why putin acts as he did in munich and why russia ' is back ' in world politics has come to light : it is the petrol power that straightened out its self-confidence again .
in addition , comes the knowledge that america and its european allies want to have russia by their side in dealing with conflicts , and the correct appraisal that the bush administration currently finds itself in anything but a comfortable situation , " the paper continued . " how does one deal with putin 's munich blunder ? " asked the westdeutsche zeitung from düsseldorf .
" glossing over it , as some europeans try to do , would be just as wrong as responding with more verbal poison .
in view of worldwide problems , it 's important that russia remains level-headed and collaborates on finding solutions .
the next test will be the expiration of the un 's 60-day deadline for iran to discontinue its nuclear program , at the end of february .
now more than ever russia is unlikely to back a further un resolution . "
the times of london said monday that putin 's harsh comments were more than just another repeat of the bush administration 's mistakes .
" if the us administration didn ’ t have enough to worry about , given the current state of the world , it spent much of the weekend wondering whether moscow had declared another cold war … not since nikita khrushchev banged his shoe on the table at the united nations in 1960 has an international gathering heard such an icy blast from moscow ’ s leadership . " conservative french newspaper le figaro noted putin had increased the hostile tone between russia and the united states as part of his crusade against washington .
" this was vladimir putin 's variations on an old theme .
many participants at the security conference asked themselves the question of whether the second cold war was being announced in munich . " putin wants to make it clear that he wo n't allow outsiders to meddle in russia 's domestic affairs , said budapest newspaper nepszabadsag .
" should that be a cold war ?
or only an expression of the self-confident unity of an energy supplier equipped with enormous foreign exchange reserves ?
is ' soverign democracy ' not merely a pretty name for new authoritarianism ?
there is currently no confrontation .
there are discussions .
these wo n't allow the disruption of dialogue about foreign and arms policy , over the issue of eastern european democracies and the human rights .
at least not for the time being . " bulgarian newspaper dnewnik warned that europe 's energy dependence gives putin power .
" the current strategy of the kremlin is to strike while the iron is hot - namely so long as europe depends on russia to supply a fifth of its energy needs . " dw staff -lrb- ncy / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us defense chief to putin : " one cold war was enough " us defense secretary robert gates on sunday dismissed a stinging broadside against the united states by russian president vladimir putin , declaring : " one cold war was quite enough . " -lrb- 11.02.2007 -rrb- putin slams us for making world more dangerous russian president vladimir putin launched a full-frontal attack on the united states on saturday , saying it had made the world a more dangerous place and left successive conflicts unresolved .

a majority of israeli and american jews now have positive views of germany , according to a new study . jewish opinions of germany have improved dramatically when compared to a major survey done in 1991 .
shortly after german reunification , jews in israel and the united states felt germans continued to hold anti-semitic beliefs and that the country was not on a stable democratic footing . those perceptions , however , have changed significantly during the past 15 years , according to the bertelsmann foundation study , which was released sunday . increase in favorable opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the holocaust remains a central issue to german-jewish relations a majority of israelis , 57 percent , now have a favorable opinion of germany , an increase of 48 percent since a similar poll was conducted in 1991 .
more than 70 percent of american jews see germany favorably , according to the bertelsmann study . according to the 1991 survey nearly 80 percent of israelis felt germany was endangered by extremist groups , a feeling now shared by 46 percent of those surveyed . during the same time , there 's been an increase in the number of germans who feel shame for the crimes committed against the jewish people and who are unwilling to ignore the past and " move on , " according to the report . although nearly half of jews in israel and the us still suspect a majority of germans hold anti-semitic beliefs , the survey found that these beliefs are on the wane in germany . " it is quite apparent that the centers of the two societies now have a much more positive attitude towards one another than they did in the early 90s , " werner weidenfeld , executive board member at the bertelsmann foundation , said in a statement .
" overall the ways germans and israelis perceive one another have become a lot less controversial and much more relaxed . " in israel , only 9 percent believe reconciliation with germany remains impossible , down from 69 percent in 1991 . political views differ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jews and germans have different outlooks towards war the survey , however , showed a difference of opinion between jews and germans when it comes to dealing with current events . three of four israelis polled were in favor of the deployment of german bundeswehr forces to the coast of lebanon .
in contrast , only 49 percent of germans support the deployment , where german boats patrol as part of international efforts to stop weapons from being smuggled to hezbollah guerrillas in lebanon . likewise , 80 percent of israelis and 72 percent of american jews surveyed support a military strike against iran if the country is found to have built an atomic bomb .
only 32 percent of germans consider that level of military action justified . " with their different historical memories , but also with their completely different political realities , germans and israelis have completely different political cultures , " said stephan vopel , project director at the bertelsmann foundation .
" this gives rise to strong disparities in formulating ways to deal with conflicts .

while it does not mention independence many see the plan as leading to the breakaway province 's eventual separation from serbia , something that belgrade opposes . the foreign ministers , whom the un envoy will meet during one of their regular meetings in brussels , face a difficult task in reaching agreement over how to handle belgrade politically .
the kosovo / serbia issue is of particular interest to them as the eu is preparing to take control of united nations mission in kosovo , which has administered the province for the last eight years in collaboration with nato and 17,000 kfor troops . also , both serbia and kosovo are seen by many as possible future eu members .
fears of separatism ahtisaari 's settlement plan worries some countries which fear political fallout into their own separatism problems if kosovo and its mainly albanian population are allowed to go it alone , european sources said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari has a tough task the most nervous nations are cyprus , romania and spain , according to one source . another concern is the possible effect on the secessionist tendencies in the republika srpska , the serb half of bosnia . " i think the judgment is ... that these concerns are outweighed by the advantages that come from settling the last big constitutional issue in the balkans , " the european source said .
" if you put this issue to bed you can say to the whole region : ' that 's it , time to get on with moving towards the european union . " ' serbia 's first step towards that goal , talks on a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , are stalled over its failure to cooperate fully with the un war crimes tribunal - shorthand for its failure to track down former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , who is indicted for genocide . the hope is that a new serb coalition government , currently cobbled together following a general election last month , will provide the fresh start needed to get back to the negotiating table .
eu divided however there are sharp differences within the eu over whether to encourage serbia by reopening the saa talks or to insist first that they cooperate with the hague-based court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kfor troops have been at work in kosovo for eight years austria , italy and spain want to see talks with the serbs reopen , but not be concluded , before full cooperation with the court is achieved .
others , including belgium and the netherlands , feel compliance must be a prerequisite for restarting talks . though formally still part of serbia , kosovo has been run by a un mission since 1999 , after nato 's aerial bombardment drove out forces loyal to then serbian leader slobodan milosevic over a crackdown on ethnic albanians . ahtisaari will hold talks with serbs and kosovars from feb .
21 before presenting his final propositions to the un security council , probably in late march .
deaths after protest to un plan two people injured in violent clashes with police during a pro-independence protest in kosovo died of their wounds sunday , a police spokesman there said .
they two were among 25 people hospitalized after a protest in pristina on saturday against the un plan for the future of kosovo . the demonstration turned violent with anti-riot police firing tear gas and rubber bullets at several thousand ethnic albanians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests got out of hand in pristina " it is regrettable that two lives were lost as a result of a wanton breach of security at government buildings , " un police commissioner stephen curtis said in a statement .
eu police for afghanistan also on their brussels agenda , the eu foreign ministers will welcome the agreement thrashed out between the fatah and hamas groups on forming a palestinian government of national unity . the eu 27 are also set to give the green light on monday for a european mission to afghanistan aimed at training the local police force , according to diplomatic sources .
some 160 european police officers , aided by 50-70 experts , will help " to establish an afghan police force which respects human rights and operates on that basis on the central , regional and provincial levels , " according to the draft conclusion to be adopted by the eu foreign ministers . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un briefly delays kosovo talks to accommodate serbs a final round of un-backed negotiations on the future status of kosovo - the serbian province whose ethnic albanian majority is craving independence - will be postponed by one week and start on feb .

" they could not prove a link between zammar and the september attacks so they sentenced him for belonging to the muslim brotherhood when he was not wanted by syria for belonging to the group in the first place , " qurabi said . zammar 's lawyer mohanad al-husni told reuters his client had always maintained his innocence .
" this religious man had the misfortune of frequenting the same mosques in hamburg as al qaeda members .
he kept telling the judge he had no organizational links with any muslim group , " husni said . zammar was handed over to syrian custody in december 2001 , just two weeks after his arrest in morocco .
his trial opened last october . he was briefly detained in germany in october 2001 as he was suspected of having had contacts with mohammed atta , who headed a hamburg cell of islamic extremists before leading the september 11 hijacks and suicide attacks .
he was later released due to insufficient evidence . german news magazine der spiegel reported that six members of the german intelligence services interrogated zammar at length in syria 's far filastin prison in november 2002 . alleged torture after cia rendition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror suspects have been flown to third nations by the cia zammar is suspected of being one of a growing number of detainees flown by the cia from their point of capture to a third state , such as syria , under washington 's policy of " rendition " where interrogation and torture are undertaken .
" he has been subjected to beating and torture i can not even describe , " husni said .
zammar was visited once by red cross officials . the suspected collaboration of the german and american intelligence services in the zammar affair forms part of the brief of a parliamentary inquiry currently under way in germany .
" the germans had him , " husni said .
" they would not have let him go if he had anything to do with the attacks . " der spiegel reported that the cia and the us federal bureau of investigation had asked germany 's bka criminal police several times in late 2001 for information on the hamburg-based zammar , his identity , his previous history , and his environment . at the end of november 2001 , the bka replied that it was closely monitoring his presence in morocco and he planned to take a flight with dutch airline klm heading back to germany on december 8 . on the orders of the cia , the suspect was arrested at casablanca airport .

the sanctions prohibit countries from exporting nuclear and weapons technology to iran as well as impose visa bans and freeze assets of some iranian officials . " we want to maintain an door open for negotiation , but iran knows what we want them to do , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said . germany , france and england , backed by solana , offered iran political and economic incentives to suspend uranium enrichment .
despite the decision to impose sanctions , the eu says that offer still stands . enriched uranium can be used to make atomic weapons .
iran claims it is developing nuclear technology only to meet its energy needs .
europe and the united states , however , fear tehran wants to develop a nuclear arsenal under cover of a civilian nuclear program . open to negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign ministers decided to approve un sanctions at a meeting in brussels german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said a sunday speech made by ari larijani , iran 's top nuclear negotiator , could signal that iran wants to return to and continue negotiations .

" we both have the impression that in iran there is a new ambition to return to the negotiating table , " steinmeier told reporters monday , referring to meetings he and solana conducted with larijani .
" in the course of the next few days , we will have to sound out whether they -lrb- iran -rrb- can pursue that line . " we need to see what the signals are from iran , whether they are serious , " steinmeier added . " possibilities are not immense " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe still wants to negotiate with iran larijani said iran wants a negotiated settlement and does n't want to aggravate the tense political situation in the region . solana , however , was cautious , saying " the possibilities are not immense " and that he had yet to hear any new proposals from iran . on friday , the international atomic energy agency cut its aid package to iran by nearly 50 percent .
the cuts were meant to send a strong message to iran to shut down its uranium enrichment activities . " sanctions are one part of the double track approach we are taking in europe , " said spanish state secretary for european affairs alberto navarro .
" we know it is just the first step and these sanctions should be gradual . " iran risks more extensive economic sanctions if it fails to comply with a un security council deadline later this month to stop enrichment . eu ready to give serbia a new chance the ministers also said they were willing to give eu-hopeful serbia " a new chance " for talks on closer ties , but stressed that a resumption of stalled negotiations would depend on belgrade 's determination to arrest fugitives suspected of war crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ministers condemned violence that occurred in kosovo over the weekend steinmeier told reporters that a new serbian government must " live up to its responsibilities and cooperate with icty , " the united nations international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia .

however , host germany chose to highlight the positives . german chancellor angela merkel welcomed some of the most important political and military figures in the world to the annual international security conference in munich over the weekend .
as with previous year 's , the 2007 conference threw up its fair share of controversy . in recent year 's , the munich conference has provided the setting for a nervous appearance by donald rumsfeld in 2005 , when the former us secretary of defense faced possible war crime charges , and merkel 's assertion last year that the threat posed by iran was comparable to the rise of the nazis in the early 1930 's . grabbing the majority of the limelight this year was russian president vladimir putin who told the high-ranking audience in no uncertain terms that the united states bore the responsibility for many of the world 's worst security issues . as hosts of the conference , it came down to the germans to diffuse the situation .
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said putin had been speaking in his own characteristic style at a venue that had " a suitable and longstanding context " for plain talking and added that putin 's comments " did not represent a reversion to the cold war . " berlin to keep dialogue open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you 're a bad lad , vlad . "
but berlin will keep talking putin also accused the us of provoking a new nuclear arms race by developing ballistic missile defenses in eastern europe as well as undermining international institutions and making the middle east more unstable . speaking in berlin on monday , the day after the conference closed , wilhelm added that berlin did not agree with putin 's criticism of nato 's eastward expansion , but would keep up the dialogue with the kremlin and continue to cooperate with russia on international issues . the other major incident to cause ripples was the decision of iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani to attend the conference after unexpectedly canceling his plans to attend and then , even more unexpectedly , reversing the reversal . face-to-face meeting before un deadline his attendance gave the german hosts and their european union counterparts in the current nuclear negotiation process the opportunity to address the crisis over iran 's ambitions face to face . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani talked tough but then gave hint of concession the german foreign ministry had arranged talks with larijani in munich with an eye on the feb .
21st un security council deadline for iran to stop enriching uranium for nuclear fuel or risk further international sanctions . before larijani spoke to the conference , merkel made it clear that the pressure remained on iran to make the first move . " if iran does not comply with international demands , it risks falling deeper into isolation , " merkel said .
" we are all determined to prevent the threat of an iran with a military nuclear program .
there are no ifs and buts here and no tricks . " larijani told the munich meeting that tehran had the right to peaceful nuclear technology and that his country 's uranium-enrichment activities were exclusively of a research and development nature . he said " irrational preconditions " such as western demands that iran must suspend uranium enrichment before coming to the negotiating table were an obstacle to solving the nuclear dispute . steinmeier : possible iran breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier saw a light at the end of the munich tunnel however , after meeting with eu foreign policy chief javier solana and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday for the first time since talks broke down last september , larijani said that " there is political will on both sides to have a negotiated settlement . " steinmeier said sunday that larijani had indicated that tehran could be ready to talk . " -lrb- larijani -rrb- signaled iran has an interest in returning and continuing with the negotiating process , " he told reporters .

while it does not mention independence many see the plan as leading to the breakaway province 's eventual separation from serbia , something that belgrade opposes . the foreign ministers , whom the un envoy will meet during one of their regular meetings in brussels , face a difficult task in reaching agreement over how to handle belgrade politically .
the kosovo / serbia issue is of particular interest to them as the eu is preparing to take control of united nations mission in kosovo , which has administered the province for the last eight years in collaboration with nato and 17,000 kfor troops . also , both serbia and kosovo are seen by many as possible future eu members .
fears of separatism ahtisaari 's settlement plan worries some countries which fear political fallout into their own separatism problems if kosovo and its mainly albanian population are allowed to go it alone , european sources said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari has a tough task the most nervous nations are cyprus , romania and spain , according to one source . another concern is the possible effect on the secessionist tendencies in the republika srpska , the serb half of bosnia . " i think the judgment is ... that these concerns are outweighed by the advantages that come from settling the last big constitutional issue in the balkans , " the european source said .
" if you put this issue to bed you can say to the whole region : ' that 's it , time to get on with moving towards the european union . " ' serbia 's first step towards that goal , talks on a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , are stalled over its failure to cooperate fully with the un war crimes tribunal - shorthand for its failure to track down former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , who is indicted for genocide . the hope is that a new serb coalition government , currently cobbled together following a general election last month , will provide the fresh start needed to get back to the negotiating table .
eu divided however there are sharp differences within the eu over whether to encourage serbia by reopening the saa talks or to insist first that they cooperate with the hague-based court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kfor troops have been at work in kosovo for eight years austria , italy and spain want to see talks with the serbs reopen , but not be concluded , before full cooperation with the court is achieved .
others , including belgium and the netherlands , feel compliance must be a prerequisite for restarting talks . though formally still part of serbia , kosovo has been run by a un mission since 1999 , after nato 's aerial bombardment drove out forces loyal to then serbian leader slobodan milosevic over a crackdown on ethnic albanians . ahtisaari will hold talks with serbs and kosovars from feb .
21 before presenting his final propositions to the un security council , probably in late march .
deaths after protest to un plan two people injured in violent clashes with police during a pro-independence protest in kosovo died of their wounds sunday , a police spokesman there said .
they two were among 25 people hospitalized after a protest in pristina on saturday against the un plan for the future of kosovo . the demonstration turned violent with anti-riot police firing tear gas and rubber bullets at several thousand ethnic albanians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests got out of hand in pristina " it is regrettable that two lives were lost as a result of a wanton breach of security at government buildings , " un police commissioner stephen curtis said in a statement .
eu police for afghanistan also on their brussels agenda , the eu foreign ministers will welcome the agreement thrashed out between the fatah and hamas groups on forming a palestinian government of national unity . the eu 27 are also set to give the green light on monday for a european mission to afghanistan aimed at training the local police force , according to diplomatic sources .
some 160 european police officers , aided by 50-70 experts , will help " to establish an afghan police force which respects human rights and operates on that basis on the central , regional and provincial levels , " according to the draft conclusion to be adopted by the eu foreign ministers . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un briefly delays kosovo talks to accommodate serbs a final round of un-backed negotiations on the future status of kosovo - the serbian province whose ethnic albanian majority is craving independence - will be postponed by one week and start on feb .

while it does not mention independence many see the plan as leading to the breakaway province 's eventual separation from serbia , something that belgrade opposes . the foreign ministers , whom the un envoy will meet during one of their regular meetings in brussels , face a difficult task in reaching agreement over how to handle belgrade politically .
the kosovo / serbia issue is of particular interest to them as the eu is preparing to take control of united nations mission in kosovo , which has administered the province for the last eight years in collaboration with nato and 17,000 kfor troops . also , both serbia and kosovo are seen by many as possible future eu members .
fears of separatism ahtisaari 's settlement plan worries some countries which fear political fallout into their own separatism problems if kosovo and its mainly albanian population are allowed to go it alone , european sources said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari has a tough task the most nervous nations are cyprus , romania and spain , according to one source . another concern is the possible effect on the secessionist tendencies in the republika srpska , the serb half of bosnia . " i think the judgment is ... that these concerns are outweighed by the advantages that come from settling the last big constitutional issue in the balkans , " the european source said .
" if you put this issue to bed you can say to the whole region : ' that 's it , time to get on with moving towards the european union . " ' serbia 's first step towards that goal , talks on a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , are stalled over its failure to cooperate fully with the un war crimes tribunal - shorthand for its failure to track down former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , who is indicted for genocide . the hope is that a new serb coalition government , currently cobbled together following a general election last month , will provide the fresh start needed to get back to the negotiating table .
eu divided however there are sharp differences within the eu over whether to encourage serbia by reopening the saa talks or to insist first that they cooperate with the hague-based court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kfor troops have been at work in kosovo for eight years austria , italy and spain want to see talks with the serbs reopen , but not be concluded , before full cooperation with the court is achieved .
others , including belgium and the netherlands , feel compliance must be a prerequisite for restarting talks . though formally still part of serbia , kosovo has been run by a un mission since 1999 , after nato 's aerial bombardment drove out forces loyal to then serbian leader slobodan milosevic over a crackdown on ethnic albanians . ahtisaari will hold talks with serbs and kosovars from feb .
21 before presenting his final propositions to the un security council , probably in late march .
deaths after protest to un plan two people injured in violent clashes with police during a pro-independence protest in kosovo died of their wounds sunday , a police spokesman there said .
they two were among 25 people hospitalized after a protest in pristina on saturday against the un plan for the future of kosovo . the demonstration turned violent with anti-riot police firing tear gas and rubber bullets at several thousand ethnic albanians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests got out of hand in pristina " it is regrettable that two lives were lost as a result of a wanton breach of security at government buildings , " un police commissioner stephen curtis said in a statement .
eu police for afghanistan also on their brussels agenda , the eu foreign ministers will welcome the agreement thrashed out between the fatah and hamas groups on forming a palestinian government of national unity . the eu 27 are also set to give the green light on monday for a european mission to afghanistan aimed at training the local police force , according to diplomatic sources .
some 160 european police officers , aided by 50-70 experts , will help " to establish an afghan police force which respects human rights and operates on that basis on the central , regional and provincial levels , " according to the draft conclusion to be adopted by the eu foreign ministers . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un briefly delays kosovo talks to accommodate serbs a final round of un-backed negotiations on the future status of kosovo - the serbian province whose ethnic albanian majority is craving independence - will be postponed by one week and start on feb .

the sanctions prohibit countries from exporting nuclear and weapons technology to iran as well as impose visa bans and freeze assets of some iranian officials . " we want to maintain an door open for negotiation , but iran knows what we want them to do , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said . germany , france and england , backed by solana , offered iran political and economic incentives to suspend uranium enrichment .
despite the decision to impose sanctions , the eu says that offer still stands . enriched uranium can be used to make atomic weapons .
iran claims it is developing nuclear technology only to meet its energy needs .
europe and the united states , however , fear tehran wants to develop a nuclear arsenal under cover of a civilian nuclear program . open to negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign ministers decided to approve un sanctions at a meeting in brussels german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said a sunday speech made by ari larijani , iran 's top nuclear negotiator , could signal that iran wants to return to and continue negotiations . " now what we have to do is look at the proposal that iran is presenting and see if this paves the way back to the negotiating table , " steinmeier said . steinmeier said he and solana both thought there was an opportunity to reopen talks . " we both have the impression that in iran there is a new ambition to return to the negotiating table , " steinmeier told reporters monday , referring to meetings he and solana conducted with larijani .
" in the course of the next few days , we will have to sound out whether they -lrb- iran -rrb- can pursue that line . " we need to see what the signals are from iran , whether they are serious , " steinmeier added . " possibilities are not immense " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe still wants to negotiate with iran larijani said iran wants a negotiated settlement and does n't want to aggravate the tense political situation in the region . solana , however , was cautious , saying " the possibilities are not immense " and that he had yet to hear any new proposals from iran . on friday , the international atomic energy agency cut its aid package to iran by nearly 50 percent .
the cuts were meant to send a strong message to iran to shut down its uranium enrichment activities . " sanctions are one part of the double track approach we are taking in europe , " said spanish state secretary for european affairs alberto navarro .
" we know it is just the first step and these sanctions should be gradual . " iran risks more extensive economic sanctions if it fails to comply with a un security council deadline later this month to stop enrichment . eu ready to give serbia a new chance the ministers also said they were willing to give eu-hopeful serbia " a new chance " for talks on closer ties , but stressed that a resumption of stalled negotiations would depend on belgrade 's determination to arrest fugitives suspected of war crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ministers condemned violence that occurred in kosovo over the weekend steinmeier told reporters that a new serbian government must " live up to its responsibilities and cooperate with icty , " the united nations international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . " a new reform and europe-oriented government can make a new start , get back on the road to europe and regain lost time , " said eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn .
" this new government deserves a new chance . " belgrade must investigate war crimes however , rehn said the eu would resume suspended talks with serbia only if the new government took " concrete action " and showed " clear commitment " in the search for fugitive bosnian serb general ratko mladic and other key war crimes suspects . " full cooperation with icty remains the necessary condition for the pace and conclusions of stabilization talks , " rehn said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martti ahtisaari presented his proposal for kosovo and serbia on feb .
2 the 27-member bloc froze negotiations on closer economic and political ties - the first step towards eu membership - with serbia in may 2006 , demanding belgrade show " full cooperation " with the hague-based tribunal . eu foreign ministers also said that they were fully supporting a united nations plan that sets serbia 's breakaway region kosovo on the road to independence . the plans by un envoy for kosovo , martti ahtisaari , " provide comprehensive arrangements designed to promote in kosovo a multi-ethnic and democratic society based on the rule of law , " they said . belgrade and pristina must " participate actively and constructively " in upcoming talks on the plan , eu ministers said , adding that the bloc was ready " to play a significant role in the implementation of the status settlement . " rehn said he also expected russia to support the un plan , arguing that a long-term solution for kosovo must be backed by all members of the international community . " kosovo will be a real test for multilateralism , " rehn said . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany takes positives from another controversial conference a " threat " of a new cold war and a potential new stalemate over iran 's nuclear program could have brought this weekend 's munich security conference to a bitter end .

and in november 2005 susanne osthoff , a german archeologist working for an aid organization , was released after the german government allegedly paid a ransom to the tune of several million euros . the german government has staunchly denied this saying that it doesn ’ t make deals with terrorists .
the complete media ban in the current case , however , suggests that officials may already be working behind the scenes to try and establish a contact with the kidnappers . the most urgent question is whether hostages are held by kidnappers seeking a ransom or by islamic fundamentalists with a political motive .

-lrb- 22.05.2006 -rrb- public frustration mounts in case of german hostages the continued captivity of german engineers taken hostage in iraq over two months ago is leading to a sense among some germans that the government is not doing enough to secure their release .

its makers said they hope it will help silence holocaust deniers , including iran 's president . a few months before his death in 2005 , simon wiesenthal remembered something he had promised his wife , cyla . " three to four years , " he had told her - that 's how long he would hunt nazi criminals from vienna before the family could move to israel . the wiesenthals never left the austrian capital as simon ended up devoting his entire life to bringing the holocaust 's perpetrators to justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : collecting stamps , including those with pictures of hitler , gave wiesenthal some distraction from his work " if you want to cure malaria , you have to live with the mosquitoes , " he said to friends who asked him why he would n't leave despite the hostility , death threats and even a bomb attack on his home .
" a soldier belongs on the battlefield . " the documentary " i have never forgotten you : the life and legacy of simon wiesenthal , " which premiered at the berlin international film festival , tries to shed light on why wiesenthal did n't keep the promise to his wife . " how could i simply restart my life where it had been interrupted and build houses ? "

" it was something from the heart , " trank , who has worked on several film productions for the center , said after the screening in berlin . painting a full picture despite this , the film also contains scenes about moments of controversy in wiesenthal 's life . " i wanted a full picture , " trank said .
" we did n't want to skip over some of the more controversial parts of his life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesenthal visited an austrian jewish cemetery vandalized by neo-nazis in 1992 those include allegations that wiesenthal may have taken too much credit for hunting down holocaust organizer adolf eichmann , who was hanged in israel in 1962 . there is also discussion about accusations that wiesenthal - based on false information - acted irresponsibly by saying that nazi doctor josef mengele , who killed thousands for medical experiments at concentration camps , was still alive while he had already died years earlier .
the documentary includes wiesenthal 's war crimes accusations against the leader of austria 's fpö party , friedrich peter , which led peter 's political ally , austrian chancellor bruno kreisky , to accuse wiesenthal of employing mafia methods . contagious obsession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kingsley said wiesenthal 's gesture of wiping his face with one hand summed up all the pain he had suffered but these episodes in the movie pale in comparison with the praise by wiesenthal 's admirers , including sir ben kingsley , who played wiesenthal in the1989 film " murderers among us : the simon wiesenthal story . " " it was an obsession he had and when you were around him you became addicted , " said kingsley , who also attended the screening .
" he was like a dad to me .
he is still part of my cellular tissue .

the sanctions prohibit countries from exporting nuclear and weapons technology to iran as well as impose visa bans and freeze assets of some iranian officials . " we want to maintain an door open for negotiation , but iran knows what we want them to do , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said . germany , france and england , backed by solana , offered iran political and economic incentives to suspend uranium enrichment .
despite the decision to impose sanctions , the eu says that offer still stands . enriched uranium can be used to make atomic weapons .
iran claims it is developing nuclear technology only to meet its energy needs .
europe and the united states , however , fear tehran wants to develop a nuclear arsenal under cover of a civilian nuclear program . open to negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign ministers decided to approve un sanctions at a meeting in brussels german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said a sunday speech made by ari larijani , iran 's top nuclear negotiator , could signal that iran wants to return to and continue negotiations . " now what we have to do is look at the proposal that iran is presenting and see if this paves the way back to the negotiating table , " steinmeier said . steinmeier said he and solana both thought there was an opportunity to reopen talks . " we both have the impression that in iran there is a new ambition to return to the negotiating table , " steinmeier told reporters monday , referring to meetings he and solana conducted with larijani .
" in the course of the next few days , we will have to sound out whether they -lrb- iran -rrb- can pursue that line . " we need to see what the signals are from iran , whether they are serious , " steinmeier added . " possibilities are not immense " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe still wants to negotiate with iran larijani said iran wants a negotiated settlement and does n't want to aggravate the tense political situation in the region . solana , however , was cautious , saying " the possibilities are not immense " and that he had yet to hear any new proposals from iran . on friday , the international atomic energy agency cut its aid package to iran by nearly 50 percent .
the cuts were meant to send a strong message to iran to shut down its uranium enrichment activities . " sanctions are one part of the double track approach we are taking in europe , " said spanish state secretary for european affairs alberto navarro .
" we know it is just the first step and these sanctions should be gradual . " iran risks more extensive economic sanctions if it fails to comply with a un security council deadline later this month to stop enrichment . eu ready to give serbia a new chance the ministers also said they were willing to give eu-hopeful serbia " a new chance " for talks on closer ties , but stressed that a resumption of stalled negotiations would depend on belgrade 's determination to arrest fugitives suspected of war crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ministers condemned violence that occurred in kosovo over the weekend steinmeier told reporters that a new serbian government must " live up to its responsibilities and cooperate with icty , " the united nations international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . " a new reform and europe-oriented government can make a new start , get back on the road to europe and regain lost time , " said eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn .
" this new government deserves a new chance . " belgrade must investigate war crimes however , rehn said the eu would resume suspended talks with serbia only if the new government took " concrete action " and showed " clear commitment " in the search for fugitive bosnian serb general ratko mladic and other key war crimes suspects . " full cooperation with icty remains the necessary condition for the pace and conclusions of stabilization talks , " rehn said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martti ahtisaari presented his proposal for kosovo and serbia on feb .
2 the 27-member bloc froze negotiations on closer economic and political ties - the first step towards eu membership - with serbia in may 2006 , demanding belgrade show " full cooperation " with the hague-based tribunal . eu foreign ministers also said that they were fully supporting a united nations plan that sets serbia 's breakaway region kosovo on the road to independence . the plans by un envoy for kosovo , martti ahtisaari , " provide comprehensive arrangements designed to promote in kosovo a multi-ethnic and democratic society based on the rule of law , " they said . belgrade and pristina must " participate actively and constructively " in upcoming talks on the plan , eu ministers said , adding that the bloc was ready " to play a significant role in the implementation of the status settlement . " rehn said he also expected russia to support the un plan , arguing that a long-term solution for kosovo must be backed by all members of the international community .

its makers said they hope it will help silence holocaust deniers , including iran 's president . a few months before his death in 2005 , simon wiesenthal remembered something he had promised his wife , cyla . " three to four years , " he had told her - that 's how long he would hunt nazi criminals from vienna before the family could move to israel . the wiesenthals never left the austrian capital as simon ended up devoting his entire life to bringing the holocaust 's perpetrators to justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : collecting stamps , including those with pictures of hitler , gave wiesenthal some distraction from his work " if you want to cure malaria , you have to live with the mosquitoes , " he said to friends who asked him why he would n't leave despite the hostility , death threats and even a bomb attack on his home .
" a soldier belongs on the battlefield . " the documentary " i have never forgotten you : the life and legacy of simon wiesenthal , " which premiered at the berlin international film festival , tries to shed light on why wiesenthal did n't keep the promise to his wife . " how could i simply restart my life where it had been interrupted and build houses ? "
wiesenthal , an architect by trade , asked after emerging from the nazi 's mauthausen death camp barely alive and weighing only 45 kilograms -lrb- 99 pounds -rrb- . labor of love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicole kidman , seen at the 2003 berlinale , narrated the film using interviews with the man himself as well as conversations with family members and friends , the film 's director , richard trank , recounts wiesenthal 's life from his birth in a small polish village through the horrors of the nazi era to his role as the world 's most prominent prosecutor of war criminals . produced by moriah films , which is associated with the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles , the documentary shows its subject in the best light possible and those behind it made no secret of their admiration for wiesenthal . " it was something from the heart , " trank , who has worked on several film productions for the center , said after the screening in berlin . painting a full picture despite this , the film also contains scenes about moments of controversy in wiesenthal 's life . " i wanted a full picture , " trank said .
" we did n't want to skip over some of the more controversial parts of his life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesenthal visited an austrian jewish cemetery vandalized by neo-nazis in 1992 those include allegations that wiesenthal may have taken too much credit for hunting down holocaust organizer adolf eichmann , who was hanged in israel in 1962 . there is also discussion about accusations that wiesenthal - based on false information - acted irresponsibly by saying that nazi doctor josef mengele , who killed thousands for medical experiments at concentration camps , was still alive while he had already died years earlier .
the documentary includes wiesenthal 's war crimes accusations against the leader of austria 's fpö party , friedrich peter , which led peter 's political ally , austrian chancellor bruno kreisky , to accuse wiesenthal of employing mafia methods . contagious obsession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kingsley said wiesenthal 's gesture of wiping his face with one hand summed up all the pain he had suffered but these episodes in the movie pale in comparison with the praise by wiesenthal 's admirers , including sir ben kingsley , who played wiesenthal in the1989 film " murderers among us : the simon wiesenthal story . " " it was an obsession he had and when you were around him you became addicted , " said kingsley , who also attended the screening .
" he was like a dad to me .
he is still part of my cellular tissue .
he taught me a great deal . " education tool trank said the movie had already found a distributor in germany and would be released in the us in late spring before going on to television and dvd . " most importantly , it will be used in schools , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish delegates with ahmadinejad at the conference last year wiesenthal center officials meanwhile said they were planning to translate the movie into farsi and find a way to broadcast it in iran , where the country 's president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , recently hosted a conference questioning that the holocaust actually took place .

" the results of this referendum are clear , it proves that the portuguese people want to turn the page on the question of abortion , " socrates said . but turnout in portugal 's second referendum on its abortion law in less than a decade was 43.6 percent , below the 50 percent threshold needed to make the ballot legally binding . socrates pledged his socialist government will now use its parliamentary majority to legalize abortion . portugal abortion laws among most restrictive in eu abortion is currently allowed in portugal only in cases of rape , a malformed fetus or if the woman 's well-being is in danger . a woman can be jailed for up to three years for having an illegal abortion while those who perform them face up to eight years behind bars . within the 27-nation european union only ireland , malta and poland have abortion laws that are similar or even more restrictive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose socrates believes the yes vote will lead to a more tolerant portugal socrates , elected in a landslide in 2005 , said the new law would be modeled on legislation in place in other european nations and would require a reflection period before an abortion can be carried out . " it is my sincere conviction that with the result of this referendum portugal has taken another step in the creation of a society that is more open , tolerant and just , " he said . catholic church opposed to easing law opposition to change was led by the influential catholic church which argued the government should do more to help women to have children instead of easing abortion restrictions . one priest threatened catholics who voted to ease the law with excommunication from the church .
the bishop of the northern city of braganca likened abortion to the execution of former iraqi leader saddam hussein . more than 90 percent of portugal 's population of 10.6 million identify themselves as being roman catholic although , as in other catholic countries , regular church attendance is on the decline . in a referendum held in 1998 voters upheld the existing abortion law by a whisker but the result was declared void as nearly seven out of 10 voters stayed away . during the last referendum the socialists were split with then prime minister , antonio guterres , publicly opposed to the abortion law being changed . a " national shame " socrates by contrast has backed liberalization at rallies across the country and this time it was the main opposition centre-right social democrats that was divided on the issue .
the party did not adopt an official position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say backstreet abortions in portugal are risky since the last referendum , several trials of women charged with illegally terminating their pregnancies were held that generated widespread public sympathy for the women .
analysts said this helped boost support for reform . during the campaign socrates called backstreet abortions a " national shame " and cast the referendum as a test of portugal 's readiness for progress . pro-abortion groups estimate that some 10,000 women are hospitalized , and several die every year from complications arising from botched backstreet abortions . anti-abortion groups contest the figure . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government discusses reducing late abortions parliamentary leaders met with church representatives tuesday to talk about reforming legislation on late abortions , as conservatives push for more stringent controls on terminations and a re-think of who foots the bill .

however , host germany chose to highlight the positives . german chancellor angela merkel welcomed some of the most important political and military figures in the world to the annual international security conference in munich over the weekend .
as with previous year 's , the 2007 conference threw up its fair share of controversy . in recent year 's , the munich conference has provided the setting for a nervous appearance by donald rumsfeld in 2005 , when the former us secretary of defense faced possible war crime charges , and merkel 's assertion last year that the threat posed by iran was comparable to the rise of the nazis in the early 1930 's . grabbing the majority of the limelight this year was russian president vladimir putin who told the high-ranking audience in no uncertain terms that the united states bore the responsibility for many of the world 's worst security issues . as hosts of the conference , it came down to the germans to diffuse the situation .

its makers said they hope it will help silence holocaust deniers , including iran 's president . a few months before his death in 2005 , simon wiesenthal remembered something he had promised his wife , cyla . " three to four years , " he had told her - that 's how long he would hunt nazi criminals from vienna before the family could move to israel . the wiesenthals never left the austrian capital as simon ended up devoting his entire life to bringing the holocaust 's perpetrators to justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : collecting stamps , including those with pictures of hitler , gave wiesenthal some distraction from his work " if you want to cure malaria , you have to live with the mosquitoes , " he said to friends who asked him why he would n't leave despite the hostility , death threats and even a bomb attack on his home .
" a soldier belongs on the battlefield . " the documentary " i have never forgotten you : the life and legacy of simon wiesenthal , " which premiered at the berlin international film festival , tries to shed light on why wiesenthal did n't keep the promise to his wife . " how could i simply restart my life where it had been interrupted and build houses ? "
wiesenthal , an architect by trade , asked after emerging from the nazi 's mauthausen death camp barely alive and weighing only 45 kilograms -lrb- 99 pounds -rrb- . labor of love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicole kidman , seen at the 2003 berlinale , narrated the film using interviews with the man himself as well as conversations with family members and friends , the film 's director , richard trank , recounts wiesenthal 's life from his birth in a small polish village through the horrors of the nazi era to his role as the world 's most prominent prosecutor of war criminals . produced by moriah films , which is associated with the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles , the documentary shows its subject in the best light possible and those behind it made no secret of their admiration for wiesenthal . " it was something from the heart , " trank , who has worked on several film productions for the center , said after the screening in berlin . painting a full picture despite this , the film also contains scenes about moments of controversy in wiesenthal 's life . " i wanted a full picture , " trank said .
" we did n't want to skip over some of the more controversial parts of his life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesenthal visited an austrian jewish cemetery vandalized by neo-nazis in 1992 those include allegations that wiesenthal may have taken too much credit for hunting down holocaust organizer adolf eichmann , who was hanged in israel in 1962 . there is also discussion about accusations that wiesenthal - based on false information - acted irresponsibly by saying that nazi doctor josef mengele , who killed thousands for medical experiments at concentration camps , was still alive while he had already died years earlier .
the documentary includes wiesenthal 's war crimes accusations against the leader of austria 's fpö party , friedrich peter , which led peter 's political ally , austrian chancellor bruno kreisky , to accuse wiesenthal of employing mafia methods . contagious obsession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kingsley said wiesenthal 's gesture of wiping his face with one hand summed up all the pain he had suffered but these episodes in the movie pale in comparison with the praise by wiesenthal 's admirers , including sir ben kingsley , who played wiesenthal in the1989 film " murderers among us : the simon wiesenthal story . " " it was an obsession he had and when you were around him you became addicted , " said kingsley , who also attended the screening .
" he was like a dad to me .
he is still part of my cellular tissue .
he taught me a great deal . " education tool trank said the movie had already found a distributor in germany and would be released in the us in late spring before going on to television and dvd . " most importantly , it will be used in schools , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish delegates with ahmadinejad at the conference last year wiesenthal center officials meanwhile said they were planning to translate the movie into farsi and find a way to broadcast it in iran , where the country 's president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , recently hosted a conference questioning that the holocaust actually took place .

a majority of israeli and american jews now have positive views of germany , according to a new study . jewish opinions of germany have improved dramatically when compared to a major survey done in 1991 .
shortly after german reunification , jews in israel and the united states felt germans continued to hold anti-semitic beliefs and that the country was not on a stable democratic footing . those perceptions , however , have changed significantly during the past 15 years , according to the bertelsmann foundation study , which was released sunday . increase in favorable opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the holocaust remains a central issue to german-jewish relations a majority of israelis , 57 percent , now have a favorable opinion of germany , an increase of 48 percent since a similar poll was conducted in 1991 .
more than 70 percent of american jews see germany favorably , according to the bertelsmann study . according to the 1991 survey nearly 80 percent of israelis felt germany was endangered by extremist groups , a feeling now shared by 46 percent of those surveyed . during the same time , there 's been an increase in the number of germans who feel shame for the crimes committed against the jewish people and who are unwilling to ignore the past and " move on , " according to the report . although nearly half of jews in israel and the us still suspect a majority of germans hold anti-semitic beliefs , the survey found that these beliefs are on the wane in germany . " it is quite apparent that the centers of the two societies now have a much more positive attitude towards one another than they did in the early 90s , " werner weidenfeld , executive board member at the bertelsmann foundation , said in a statement .
" overall the ways germans and israelis perceive one another have become a lot less controversial and much more relaxed . " in israel , only 9 percent believe reconciliation with germany remains impossible , down from 69 percent in 1991 . political views differ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jews and germans have different outlooks towards war the survey , however , showed a difference of opinion between jews and germans when it comes to dealing with current events . three of four israelis polled were in favor of the deployment of german bundeswehr forces to the coast of lebanon .
in contrast , only 49 percent of germans support the deployment , where german boats patrol as part of international efforts to stop weapons from being smuggled to hezbollah guerrillas in lebanon . likewise , 80 percent of israelis and 72 percent of american jews surveyed support a military strike against iran if the country is found to have built an atomic bomb .
only 32 percent of germans consider that level of military action justified . " with their different historical memories , but also with their completely different political realities , germans and israelis have completely different political cultures , " said stephan vopel , project director at the bertelsmann foundation .
" this gives rise to strong disparities in formulating ways to deal with conflicts .
israelis tend to subscribe to the maxim ' never again victims , ' the germans ' dictum after world war ii has been ' never again war .

" russia again claims a place in the first row , and with its nuclear arsenal , its size , and its oil and gas riches it has , by all means , weighty arguments , " wrote the munich daily süddeutsche zeitung in its monday edition .
" the usa offers another with its disastrous iraq adventure .
since that weakens western credibility , it creates the opportunity for putin to set himself up as the powerful voice of the growing number of countries and peoples who are stricken by doubt in the wisdom of western policies .
the russian president has laid his cards on the table .
europe and america now know where russia has positioned itself . " " in vladimir putin 's controlled ' democracy , ' power-political rowdiness is at least as pronounced as the need for cooperation , " commented the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily .
" in view of the general development of the past years , it 's assumedly even somewhat greater at the moment - as a signal from the kremlin that russia ' is back . '
one reason why putin acts as he did in munich and why russia ' is back ' in world politics has come to light : it is the petrol power that straightened out its self-confidence again .
in addition , comes the knowledge that america and its european allies want to have russia by their side in dealing with conflicts , and the correct appraisal that the bush administration currently finds itself in anything but a comfortable situation , " the paper continued . " how does one deal with putin 's munich blunder ? " asked the westdeutsche zeitung from düsseldorf .
" glossing over it , as some europeans try to do , would be just as wrong as responding with more verbal poison .
in view of worldwide problems , it 's important that russia remains level-headed and collaborates on finding solutions .
the next test will be the expiration of the un 's 60-day deadline for iran to discontinue its nuclear program , at the end of february .
now more than ever russia is unlikely to back a further un resolution . "
the times of london said monday that putin 's harsh comments were more than just another repeat of the bush administration 's mistakes .
" if the us administration didn ’ t have enough to worry about , given the current state of the world , it spent much of the weekend wondering whether moscow had declared another cold war … not since nikita khrushchev banged his shoe on the table at the united nations in 1960 has an international gathering heard such an icy blast from moscow ’ s leadership . " conservative french newspaper le figaro noted putin had increased the hostile tone between russia and the united states as part of his crusade against washington .
" this was vladimir putin 's variations on an old theme .
many participants at the security conference asked themselves the question of whether the second cold war was being announced in munich . " putin wants to make it clear that he wo n't allow outsiders to meddle in russia 's domestic affairs , said budapest newspaper nepszabadsag .
" should that be a cold war ?
or only an expression of the self-confident unity of an energy supplier equipped with enormous foreign exchange reserves ?
is ' soverign democracy ' not merely a pretty name for new authoritarianism ?
there is currently no confrontation .
there are discussions .
these wo n't allow the disruption of dialogue about foreign and arms policy , over the issue of eastern european democracies and the human rights .
at least not for the time being . " bulgarian newspaper dnewnik warned that europe 's energy dependence gives putin power .
" the current strategy of the kremlin is to strike while the iron is hot - namely so long as europe depends on russia to supply a fifth of its energy needs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 12.02.2007 european press review : a hint of the cold war in munich großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's verbal attack on the us ruffled feathers at the munich security conference europe 's editorialists commented on russian president putin 's speech at the munich security conference in which he accused the united states of making the world a more dangerous place . " russia again claims a place in the first row , and with its nuclear arsenal , its size , and its oil and gas riches it has , by all means , weighty arguments , " wrote the munich daily süddeutsche zeitung in its monday edition .
" the usa offers another with its disastrous iraq adventure .
since that weakens western credibility , it creates the opportunity for putin to set himself up as the powerful voice of the growing number of countries and peoples who are stricken by doubt in the wisdom of western policies .
the russian president has laid his cards on the table .
europe and america now know where russia has positioned itself . " " in vladimir putin 's controlled ' democracy , ' power-political rowdiness is at least as pronounced as the need for cooperation , " commented the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily .
" in view of the general development of the past years , it 's assumedly even somewhat greater at the moment - as a signal from the kremlin that russia ' is back . '
one reason why putin acts as he did in munich and why russia ' is back ' in world politics has come to light : it is the petrol power that straightened out its self-confidence again .
in addition , comes the knowledge that america and its european allies want to have russia by their side in dealing with conflicts , and the correct appraisal that the bush administration currently finds itself in anything but a comfortable situation , " the paper continued . " how does one deal with putin 's munich blunder ? " asked the westdeutsche zeitung from düsseldorf .
" glossing over it , as some europeans try to do , would be just as wrong as responding with more verbal poison .
in view of worldwide problems , it 's important that russia remains level-headed and collaborates on finding solutions .
the next test will be the expiration of the un 's 60-day deadline for iran to discontinue its nuclear program , at the end of february .
now more than ever russia is unlikely to back a further un resolution . "
the times of london said monday that putin 's harsh comments were more than just another repeat of the bush administration 's mistakes .
" if the us administration didn ’ t have enough to worry about , given the current state of the world , it spent much of the weekend wondering whether moscow had declared another cold war … not since nikita khrushchev banged his shoe on the table at the united nations in 1960 has an international gathering heard such an icy blast from moscow ’ s leadership . " conservative french newspaper le figaro noted putin had increased the hostile tone between russia and the united states as part of his crusade against washington .
" this was vladimir putin 's variations on an old theme .
many participants at the security conference asked themselves the question of whether the second cold war was being announced in munich . " putin wants to make it clear that he wo n't allow outsiders to meddle in russia 's domestic affairs , said budapest newspaper nepszabadsag .
" should that be a cold war ?
or only an expression of the self-confident unity of an energy supplier equipped with enormous foreign exchange reserves ?
is ' soverign democracy ' not merely a pretty name for new authoritarianism ?
there is currently no confrontation .
there are discussions .
these wo n't allow the disruption of dialogue about foreign and arms policy , over the issue of eastern european democracies and the human rights .
at least not for the time being . " bulgarian newspaper dnewnik warned that europe 's energy dependence gives putin power .
" the current strategy of the kremlin is to strike while the iron is hot - namely so long as europe depends on russia to supply a fifth of its energy needs . " dw staff -lrb- ncy / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us defense chief to putin : " one cold war was enough " us defense secretary robert gates on sunday dismissed a stinging broadside against the united states by russian president vladimir putin , declaring : " one cold war was quite enough .

while it does not mention independence many see the plan as leading to the breakaway province 's eventual separation from serbia , something that belgrade opposes . the foreign ministers , whom the un envoy will meet during one of their regular meetings in brussels , face a difficult task in reaching agreement over how to handle belgrade politically .
the kosovo / serbia issue is of particular interest to them as the eu is preparing to take control of united nations mission in kosovo , which has administered the province for the last eight years in collaboration with nato and 17,000 kfor troops . also , both serbia and kosovo are seen by many as possible future eu members .
fears of separatism ahtisaari 's settlement plan worries some countries which fear political fallout into their own separatism problems if kosovo and its mainly albanian population are allowed to go it alone , european sources said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari has a tough task the most nervous nations are cyprus , romania and spain , according to one source . another concern is the possible effect on the secessionist tendencies in the republika srpska , the serb half of bosnia . " i think the judgment is ... that these concerns are outweighed by the advantages that come from settling the last big constitutional issue in the balkans , " the european source said .
" if you put this issue to bed you can say to the whole region : ' that 's it , time to get on with moving towards the european union . " ' serbia 's first step towards that goal , talks on a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , are stalled over its failure to cooperate fully with the un war crimes tribunal - shorthand for its failure to track down former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , who is indicted for genocide . the hope is that a new serb coalition government , currently cobbled together following a general election last month , will provide the fresh start needed to get back to the negotiating table .
eu divided however there are sharp differences within the eu over whether to encourage serbia by reopening the saa talks or to insist first that they cooperate with the hague-based court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kfor troops have been at work in kosovo for eight years austria , italy and spain want to see talks with the serbs reopen , but not be concluded , before full cooperation with the court is achieved .
others , including belgium and the netherlands , feel compliance must be a prerequisite for restarting talks . though formally still part of serbia , kosovo has been run by a un mission since 1999 , after nato 's aerial bombardment drove out forces loyal to then serbian leader slobodan milosevic over a crackdown on ethnic albanians . ahtisaari will hold talks with serbs and kosovars from feb .
21 before presenting his final propositions to the un security council , probably in late march .
deaths after protest to un plan two people injured in violent clashes with police during a pro-independence protest in kosovo died of their wounds sunday , a police spokesman there said .
they two were among 25 people hospitalized after a protest in pristina on saturday against the un plan for the future of kosovo . the demonstration turned violent with anti-riot police firing tear gas and rubber bullets at several thousand ethnic albanians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests got out of hand in pristina " it is regrettable that two lives were lost as a result of a wanton breach of security at government buildings , " un police commissioner stephen curtis said in a statement .
eu police for afghanistan also on their brussels agenda , the eu foreign ministers will welcome the agreement thrashed out between the fatah and hamas groups on forming a palestinian government of national unity . the eu 27 are also set to give the green light on monday for a european mission to afghanistan aimed at training the local police force , according to diplomatic sources .
some 160 european police officers , aided by 50-70 experts , will help " to establish an afghan police force which respects human rights and operates on that basis on the central , regional and provincial levels , " according to the draft conclusion to be adopted by the eu foreign ministers . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un briefly delays kosovo talks to accommodate serbs a final round of un-backed negotiations on the future status of kosovo - the serbian province whose ethnic albanian majority is craving independence - will be postponed by one week and start on feb .

however , host germany chose to highlight the positives . german chancellor angela merkel welcomed some of the most important political and military figures in the world to the annual international security conference in munich over the weekend .
as with previous year 's , the 2007 conference threw up its fair share of controversy . in recent year 's , the munich conference has provided the setting for a nervous appearance by donald rumsfeld in 2005 , when the former us secretary of defense faced possible war crime charges , and merkel 's assertion last year that the threat posed by iran was comparable to the rise of the nazis in the early 1930 's . grabbing the majority of the limelight this year was russian president vladimir putin who told the high-ranking audience in no uncertain terms that the united states bore the responsibility for many of the world 's worst security issues . as hosts of the conference , it came down to the germans to diffuse the situation .

it 's unclear whether the kidnappers want ransom money or political concessions .
the victims ' family in germany have allegedly been contacted by the kidnappers . a german woman and her son who had lived in iraq for years went missing approximately a week ago . german authorities were alerted to the abduction after kidnappers contacted the missing man 's sister , who lives in berlin .
she in turn contacted german authorities , the berliner zeitung reported tuesday .
the abductors have yet to make demands .
it is unclear whether they want money , political concessions or both , according to the newspaper , which cited unnamed security sources . berlin daily tagesspiegel said one victim is a german national in her 60s who lives in baghdad and is married to an iraqi doctor . the second victim is her adult son who is believed to work at the iraqi foreign ministry , according to the paper . the identities of the victims have not been released .
the tagesspiegel also reported that kidnappers had contacted family of the victims who live in berlin and other parts of germany .
the kidnappers has not made demands , but threatened to kill the son , the tagesspiegel reported . the german foreign ministry wo n't say whether contact has been made with the kidnappers .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier confirmed monday that two german nationals have been missing in iraq for almost a week . " we can not rule out that it was a kidnapping by force , " he told reporters at an eu meeting . motivation for kidnapping unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier would not give reporters any details on the alleged kidnapping berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper reported that the family was considered wealthy by iraqi standards and was probably victim to a targeted kidnapping . germany 's ntv news channel said the crisis team set up by the german government was apparently working with mediators , but the foreign ministry declined to confirm that this was the case . " we hope that everything works out well and we are doing everything in our power to ensure that the two germans are returned safely to their families , " steinmeier said . according to the german foreign ministry there are still about a hundred german nationals in iraq , people working for german and international companies or diplomatic services .
germany has issued a security warning on travel to iraq due to the unstable security environment there as iraqi authorities are grappling with kidnappings and killings of foreigners . kidnappings of germans not the first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was kidnapped and later released in iraq only about a year ago , two german technicians , rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke , were released by their kidnappers after a three-month hostage ordeal .
and in november 2005 susanne osthoff , a german archeologist working for an aid organization , was released after the german government allegedly paid a ransom to the tune of several million euros . the german government has staunchly denied this saying that it doesn ’ t make deals with terrorists .
the complete media ban in the current case , however , suggests that officials may already be working behind the scenes to try and establish a contact with the kidnappers . the most urgent question is whether hostages are held by kidnappers seeking a ransom or by islamic fundamentalists with a political motive .

its makers said they hope it will help silence holocaust deniers , including iran 's president . a few months before his death in 2005 , simon wiesenthal remembered something he had promised his wife , cyla . " three to four years , " he had told her - that 's how long he would hunt nazi criminals from vienna before the family could move to israel . the wiesenthals never left the austrian capital as simon ended up devoting his entire life to bringing the holocaust 's perpetrators to justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : collecting stamps , including those with pictures of hitler , gave wiesenthal some distraction from his work " if you want to cure malaria , you have to live with the mosquitoes , " he said to friends who asked him why he would n't leave despite the hostility , death threats and even a bomb attack on his home .
" a soldier belongs on the battlefield . " the documentary " i have never forgotten you : the life and legacy of simon wiesenthal , " which premiered at the berlin international film festival , tries to shed light on why wiesenthal did n't keep the promise to his wife . " how could i simply restart my life where it had been interrupted and build houses ? "

" it was something from the heart , " trank , who has worked on several film productions for the center , said after the screening in berlin . painting a full picture despite this , the film also contains scenes about moments of controversy in wiesenthal 's life . " i wanted a full picture , " trank said .
" we did n't want to skip over some of the more controversial parts of his life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesenthal visited an austrian jewish cemetery vandalized by neo-nazis in 1992 those include allegations that wiesenthal may have taken too much credit for hunting down holocaust organizer adolf eichmann , who was hanged in israel in 1962 . there is also discussion about accusations that wiesenthal - based on false information - acted irresponsibly by saying that nazi doctor josef mengele , who killed thousands for medical experiments at concentration camps , was still alive while he had already died years earlier .
the documentary includes wiesenthal 's war crimes accusations against the leader of austria 's fpö party , friedrich peter , which led peter 's political ally , austrian chancellor bruno kreisky , to accuse wiesenthal of employing mafia methods . contagious obsession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kingsley said wiesenthal 's gesture of wiping his face with one hand summed up all the pain he had suffered but these episodes in the movie pale in comparison with the praise by wiesenthal 's admirers , including sir ben kingsley , who played wiesenthal in the1989 film " murderers among us : the simon wiesenthal story . " " it was an obsession he had and when you were around him you became addicted , " said kingsley , who also attended the screening .
" he was like a dad to me .
he is still part of my cellular tissue .
he taught me a great deal . " education tool trank said the movie had already found a distributor in germany and would be released in the us in late spring before going on to television and dvd .

the sanctions prohibit countries from exporting nuclear and weapons technology to iran as well as impose visa bans and freeze assets of some iranian officials . " we want to maintain an door open for negotiation , but iran knows what we want them to do , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said . germany , france and england , backed by solana , offered iran political and economic incentives to suspend uranium enrichment .
despite the decision to impose sanctions , the eu says that offer still stands . enriched uranium can be used to make atomic weapons .
iran claims it is developing nuclear technology only to meet its energy needs .
europe and the united states , however , fear tehran wants to develop a nuclear arsenal under cover of a civilian nuclear program . open to negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign ministers decided to approve un sanctions at a meeting in brussels german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said a sunday speech made by ari larijani , iran 's top nuclear negotiator , could signal that iran wants to return to and continue negotiations . " now what we have to do is look at the proposal that iran is presenting and see if this paves the way back to the negotiating table , " steinmeier said . steinmeier said he and solana both thought there was an opportunity to reopen talks . " we both have the impression that in iran there is a new ambition to return to the negotiating table , " steinmeier told reporters monday , referring to meetings he and solana conducted with larijani .
" in the course of the next few days , we will have to sound out whether they -lrb- iran -rrb- can pursue that line . " we need to see what the signals are from iran , whether they are serious , " steinmeier added . " possibilities are not immense " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe still wants to negotiate with iran larijani said iran wants a negotiated settlement and does n't want to aggravate the tense political situation in the region . solana , however , was cautious , saying " the possibilities are not immense " and that he had yet to hear any new proposals from iran . on friday , the international atomic energy agency cut its aid package to iran by nearly 50 percent .
the cuts were meant to send a strong message to iran to shut down its uranium enrichment activities . " sanctions are one part of the double track approach we are taking in europe , " said spanish state secretary for european affairs alberto navarro .
" we know it is just the first step and these sanctions should be gradual .

because klar , 54 , still has two years to serve before qualifying for possible parole , his only chance for an early release is a special pardon from german president horst köhler , who is currently reviewing the case .
former president johannes rau already rejected a previous petition for clemency . klar , who like mohnhaupt came from a well-off family and went to university to study philosophy before becoming a terrorist , is reported to have been well behaved in jail .

because klar , 54 , still has two years to serve before qualifying for possible parole , his only chance for an early release is a special pardon from german president horst köhler , who is currently reviewing the case .
former president johannes rau already rejected a previous petition for clemency . klar , who like mohnhaupt came from a well-off family and went to university to study philosophy before becoming a terrorist , is reported to have been well behaved in jail .
a berlin theatre has promised him a two-year staff internship if he is released . klar has also never renounced his ideas , telling an interviewer in 2001 he still wanted germany to make a " fresh start " and would never abjure what the raf had done , " though i do not contemplate reviving the armed struggle . " both mohnhaupt and klar 's cases have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against some politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . besides klar , the only other members of the raf still in prison are eva haule and birgit hogefeld . most of the terrorist organization 's original leaders committed suicide in jail during the 1970s . the group abandoned violence in 1992 and formally disbanded in 1998 . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we need proof that the german state is capable of mercy " gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison .

" russia again claims a place in the first row , and with its nuclear arsenal , its size , and its oil and gas riches it has , by all means , weighty arguments , " wrote the munich daily süddeutsche zeitung in its monday edition .
" the usa offers another with its disastrous iraq adventure .
since that weakens western credibility , it creates the opportunity for putin to set himself up as the powerful voice of the growing number of countries and peoples who are stricken by doubt in the wisdom of western policies .
the russian president has laid his cards on the table .
europe and america now know where russia has positioned itself . " " in vladimir putin 's controlled ' democracy , ' power-political rowdiness is at least as pronounced as the need for cooperation , " commented the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily .
" in view of the general development of the past years , it 's assumedly even somewhat greater at the moment - as a signal from the kremlin that russia ' is back . '
one reason why putin acts as he did in munich and why russia ' is back ' in world politics has come to light : it is the petrol power that straightened out its self-confidence again .
in addition , comes the knowledge that america and its european allies want to have russia by their side in dealing with conflicts , and the correct appraisal that the bush administration currently finds itself in anything but a comfortable situation , " the paper continued . " how does one deal with putin 's munich blunder ? " asked the westdeutsche zeitung from düsseldorf .
" glossing over it , as some europeans try to do , would be just as wrong as responding with more verbal poison .
in view of worldwide problems , it 's important that russia remains level-headed and collaborates on finding solutions .
the next test will be the expiration of the un 's 60-day deadline for iran to discontinue its nuclear program , at the end of february .
now more than ever russia is unlikely to back a further un resolution . "
the times of london said monday that putin 's harsh comments were more than just another repeat of the bush administration 's mistakes .
" if the us administration didn ’ t have enough to worry about , given the current state of the world , it spent much of the weekend wondering whether moscow had declared another cold war … not since nikita khrushchev banged his shoe on the table at the united nations in 1960 has an international gathering heard such an icy blast from moscow ’ s leadership . " conservative french newspaper le figaro noted putin had increased the hostile tone between russia and the united states as part of his crusade against washington .
" this was vladimir putin 's variations on an old theme .
many participants at the security conference asked themselves the question of whether the second cold war was being announced in munich . " putin wants to make it clear that he wo n't allow outsiders to meddle in russia 's domestic affairs , said budapest newspaper nepszabadsag .
" should that be a cold war ?
or only an expression of the self-confident unity of an energy supplier equipped with enormous foreign exchange reserves ?
is ' soverign democracy ' not merely a pretty name for new authoritarianism ?
there is currently no confrontation .
there are discussions .
these wo n't allow the disruption of dialogue about foreign and arms policy , over the issue of eastern european democracies and the human rights .
at least not for the time being . " bulgarian newspaper dnewnik warned that europe 's energy dependence gives putin power .
" the current strategy of the kremlin is to strike while the iron is hot - namely so long as europe depends on russia to supply a fifth of its energy needs . " dw staff -lrb- ncy / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us defense chief to putin : " one cold war was enough " us defense secretary robert gates on sunday dismissed a stinging broadside against the united states by russian president vladimir putin , declaring : " one cold war was quite enough .

" mohnhaupt will serve the remainder of her sentence on parole . the case has revived painful memories of the raf 's violent campaign of the 1970s . also known as the baader-meinhof gang after its founders andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , the red army faction murdered a string of high-profile german establishment figures from 1977 to 1982 as it attempted to bring down what it considered an oppressive capitalist state . the group is suspected of killing 34 people between 1972 and 1991 .
some 26 raf members died during that period and another 26 were sentenced to life in prison . mohnhaupt , now 57 , had risen to the ranks of the raf 's " second-generation " leadership in 1977 .

a majority of israeli and american jews now have positive views of germany , according to a new study . jewish opinions of germany have improved dramatically when compared to a major survey done in 1991 .
shortly after german reunification , jews in israel and the united states felt germans continued to hold anti-semitic beliefs and that the country was not on a stable democratic footing . those perceptions , however , have changed significantly during the past 15 years , according to the bertelsmann foundation study , which was released sunday . increase in favorable opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the holocaust remains a central issue to german-jewish relations a majority of israelis , 57 percent , now have a favorable opinion of germany , an increase of 48 percent since a similar poll was conducted in 1991 .
more than 70 percent of american jews see germany favorably , according to the bertelsmann study . according to the 1991 survey nearly 80 percent of israelis felt germany was endangered by extremist groups , a feeling now shared by 46 percent of those surveyed . during the same time , there 's been an increase in the number of germans who feel shame for the crimes committed against the jewish people and who are unwilling to ignore the past and " move on , " according to the report . although nearly half of jews in israel and the us still suspect a majority of germans hold anti-semitic beliefs , the survey found that these beliefs are on the wane in germany . " it is quite apparent that the centers of the two societies now have a much more positive attitude towards one another than they did in the early 90s , " werner weidenfeld , executive board member at the bertelsmann foundation , said in a statement .
" overall the ways germans and israelis perceive one another have become a lot less controversial and much more relaxed . " in israel , only 9 percent believe reconciliation with germany remains impossible , down from 69 percent in 1991 . political views differ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jews and germans have different outlooks towards war the survey , however , showed a difference of opinion between jews and germans when it comes to dealing with current events . three of four israelis polled were in favor of the deployment of german bundeswehr forces to the coast of lebanon .
in contrast , only 49 percent of germans support the deployment , where german boats patrol as part of international efforts to stop weapons from being smuggled to hezbollah guerrillas in lebanon . likewise , 80 percent of israelis and 72 percent of american jews surveyed support a military strike against iran if the country is found to have built an atomic bomb .
only 32 percent of germans consider that level of military action justified . " with their different historical memories , but also with their completely different political realities , germans and israelis have completely different political cultures , " said stephan vopel , project director at the bertelsmann foundation .
" this gives rise to strong disparities in formulating ways to deal with conflicts .
israelis tend to subscribe to the maxim ' never again victims , ' the germans ' dictum after world war ii has been ' never again war .

while it does not mention independence many see the plan as leading to the breakaway province 's eventual separation from serbia , something that belgrade opposes . the foreign ministers , whom the un envoy will meet during one of their regular meetings in brussels , face a difficult task in reaching agreement over how to handle belgrade politically .
the kosovo / serbia issue is of particular interest to them as the eu is preparing to take control of united nations mission in kosovo , which has administered the province for the last eight years in collaboration with nato and 17,000 kfor troops . also , both serbia and kosovo are seen by many as possible future eu members .
fears of separatism ahtisaari 's settlement plan worries some countries which fear political fallout into their own separatism problems if kosovo and its mainly albanian population are allowed to go it alone , european sources said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari has a tough task the most nervous nations are cyprus , romania and spain , according to one source . another concern is the possible effect on the secessionist tendencies in the republika srpska , the serb half of bosnia . " i think the judgment is ... that these concerns are outweighed by the advantages that come from settling the last big constitutional issue in the balkans , " the european source said .
" if you put this issue to bed you can say to the whole region : ' that 's it , time to get on with moving towards the european union . " ' serbia 's first step towards that goal , talks on a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , are stalled over its failure to cooperate fully with the un war crimes tribunal - shorthand for its failure to track down former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , who is indicted for genocide . the hope is that a new serb coalition government , currently cobbled together following a general election last month , will provide the fresh start needed to get back to the negotiating table .
eu divided however there are sharp differences within the eu over whether to encourage serbia by reopening the saa talks or to insist first that they cooperate with the hague-based court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kfor troops have been at work in kosovo for eight years austria , italy and spain want to see talks with the serbs reopen , but not be concluded , before full cooperation with the court is achieved .
others , including belgium and the netherlands , feel compliance must be a prerequisite for restarting talks . though formally still part of serbia , kosovo has been run by a un mission since 1999 , after nato 's aerial bombardment drove out forces loyal to then serbian leader slobodan milosevic over a crackdown on ethnic albanians . ahtisaari will hold talks with serbs and kosovars from feb .
21 before presenting his final propositions to the un security council , probably in late march .
deaths after protest to un plan two people injured in violent clashes with police during a pro-independence protest in kosovo died of their wounds sunday , a police spokesman there said .
they two were among 25 people hospitalized after a protest in pristina on saturday against the un plan for the future of kosovo . the demonstration turned violent with anti-riot police firing tear gas and rubber bullets at several thousand ethnic albanians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests got out of hand in pristina " it is regrettable that two lives were lost as a result of a wanton breach of security at government buildings , " un police commissioner stephen curtis said in a statement .
eu police for afghanistan also on their brussels agenda , the eu foreign ministers will welcome the agreement thrashed out between the fatah and hamas groups on forming a palestinian government of national unity . the eu 27 are also set to give the green light on monday for a european mission to afghanistan aimed at training the local police force , according to diplomatic sources .
some 160 european police officers , aided by 50-70 experts , will help " to establish an afghan police force which respects human rights and operates on that basis on the central , regional and provincial levels , " according to the draft conclusion to be adopted by the eu foreign ministers . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un briefly delays kosovo talks to accommodate serbs a final round of un-backed negotiations on the future status of kosovo - the serbian province whose ethnic albanian majority is craving independence - will be postponed by one week and start on feb .

its makers said they hope it will help silence holocaust deniers , including iran 's president . a few months before his death in 2005 , simon wiesenthal remembered something he had promised his wife , cyla . " three to four years , " he had told her - that 's how long he would hunt nazi criminals from vienna before the family could move to israel . the wiesenthals never left the austrian capital as simon ended up devoting his entire life to bringing the holocaust 's perpetrators to justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : collecting stamps , including those with pictures of hitler , gave wiesenthal some distraction from his work " if you want to cure malaria , you have to live with the mosquitoes , " he said to friends who asked him why he would n't leave despite the hostility , death threats and even a bomb attack on his home .
" a soldier belongs on the battlefield . " the documentary " i have never forgotten you : the life and legacy of simon wiesenthal , " which premiered at the berlin international film festival , tries to shed light on why wiesenthal did n't keep the promise to his wife . " how could i simply restart my life where it had been interrupted and build houses ? "
wiesenthal , an architect by trade , asked after emerging from the nazi 's mauthausen death camp barely alive and weighing only 45 kilograms -lrb- 99 pounds -rrb- . labor of love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicole kidman , seen at the 2003 berlinale , narrated the film using interviews with the man himself as well as conversations with family members and friends , the film 's director , richard trank , recounts wiesenthal 's life from his birth in a small polish village through the horrors of the nazi era to his role as the world 's most prominent prosecutor of war criminals . produced by moriah films , which is associated with the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles , the documentary shows its subject in the best light possible and those behind it made no secret of their admiration for wiesenthal . " it was something from the heart , " trank , who has worked on several film productions for the center , said after the screening in berlin . painting a full picture despite this , the film also contains scenes about moments of controversy in wiesenthal 's life . " i wanted a full picture , " trank said .
" we did n't want to skip over some of the more controversial parts of his life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesenthal visited an austrian jewish cemetery vandalized by neo-nazis in 1992 those include allegations that wiesenthal may have taken too much credit for hunting down holocaust organizer adolf eichmann , who was hanged in israel in 1962 . there is also discussion about accusations that wiesenthal - based on false information - acted irresponsibly by saying that nazi doctor josef mengele , who killed thousands for medical experiments at concentration camps , was still alive while he had already died years earlier .
the documentary includes wiesenthal 's war crimes accusations against the leader of austria 's fpö party , friedrich peter , which led peter 's political ally , austrian chancellor bruno kreisky , to accuse wiesenthal of employing mafia methods . contagious obsession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kingsley said wiesenthal 's gesture of wiping his face with one hand summed up all the pain he had suffered but these episodes in the movie pale in comparison with the praise by wiesenthal 's admirers , including sir ben kingsley , who played wiesenthal in the1989 film " murderers among us : the simon wiesenthal story . " " it was an obsession he had and when you were around him you became addicted , " said kingsley , who also attended the screening .
" he was like a dad to me .
he is still part of my cellular tissue .
he taught me a great deal . " education tool trank said the movie had already found a distributor in germany and would be released in the us in late spring before going on to television and dvd . " most importantly , it will be used in schools , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish delegates with ahmadinejad at the conference last year wiesenthal center officials meanwhile said they were planning to translate the movie into farsi and find a way to broadcast it in iran , where the country 's president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , recently hosted a conference questioning that the holocaust actually took place .

while it does not mention independence many see the plan as leading to the breakaway province 's eventual separation from serbia , something that belgrade opposes . the foreign ministers , whom the un envoy will meet during one of their regular meetings in brussels , face a difficult task in reaching agreement over how to handle belgrade politically .
the kosovo / serbia issue is of particular interest to them as the eu is preparing to take control of united nations mission in kosovo , which has administered the province for the last eight years in collaboration with nato and 17,000 kfor troops . also , both serbia and kosovo are seen by many as possible future eu members .
fears of separatism ahtisaari 's settlement plan worries some countries which fear political fallout into their own separatism problems if kosovo and its mainly albanian population are allowed to go it alone , european sources said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari has a tough task the most nervous nations are cyprus , romania and spain , according to one source . another concern is the possible effect on the secessionist tendencies in the republika srpska , the serb half of bosnia . " i think the judgment is ... that these concerns are outweighed by the advantages that come from settling the last big constitutional issue in the balkans , " the european source said .
" if you put this issue to bed you can say to the whole region : ' that 's it , time to get on with moving towards the european union . " ' serbia 's first step towards that goal , talks on a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , are stalled over its failure to cooperate fully with the un war crimes tribunal - shorthand for its failure to track down former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , who is indicted for genocide . the hope is that a new serb coalition government , currently cobbled together following a general election last month , will provide the fresh start needed to get back to the negotiating table .
eu divided however there are sharp differences within the eu over whether to encourage serbia by reopening the saa talks or to insist first that they cooperate with the hague-based court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kfor troops have been at work in kosovo for eight years austria , italy and spain want to see talks with the serbs reopen , but not be concluded , before full cooperation with the court is achieved .
others , including belgium and the netherlands , feel compliance must be a prerequisite for restarting talks . though formally still part of serbia , kosovo has been run by a un mission since 1999 , after nato 's aerial bombardment drove out forces loyal to then serbian leader slobodan milosevic over a crackdown on ethnic albanians . ahtisaari will hold talks with serbs and kosovars from feb .
21 before presenting his final propositions to the un security council , probably in late march .
deaths after protest to un plan two people injured in violent clashes with police during a pro-independence protest in kosovo died of their wounds sunday , a police spokesman there said .
they two were among 25 people hospitalized after a protest in pristina on saturday against the un plan for the future of kosovo . the demonstration turned violent with anti-riot police firing tear gas and rubber bullets at several thousand ethnic albanians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests got out of hand in pristina " it is regrettable that two lives were lost as a result of a wanton breach of security at government buildings , " un police commissioner stephen curtis said in a statement .
eu police for afghanistan also on their brussels agenda , the eu foreign ministers will welcome the agreement thrashed out between the fatah and hamas groups on forming a palestinian government of national unity . the eu 27 are also set to give the green light on monday for a european mission to afghanistan aimed at training the local police force , according to diplomatic sources .
some 160 european police officers , aided by 50-70 experts , will help " to establish an afghan police force which respects human rights and operates on that basis on the central , regional and provincial levels , " according to the draft conclusion to be adopted by the eu foreign ministers . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un briefly delays kosovo talks to accommodate serbs a final round of un-backed negotiations on the future status of kosovo - the serbian province whose ethnic albanian majority is craving independence - will be postponed by one week and start on feb .

before you pack your bag , check out what other dw-world.de readers had to say about their german travel experience . my husband , two daughters and i hired a car in frankfurt in july 2006 and headed for rothenburg ob der tauber .
it was an awesome experience - and a magical town .
we stayed at guesthouse eberlein .
erich and the team were the perfect hosts .
the town was absolutely fantastic : history , preservation , care , beauty and hospitality all wrapped in one small place .
our deepest admiration to the people of this great country .
we are certainly coming back . - samira h.r.oliveira , curitiba , brazil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : composer j.s. bach worked for many years in leipzig 's st. thomas church i visited germany a few years ago for a two-month study course .
impressions of germany from pictures and books had been rooted in my mind since my childhood .
in my mind , germany is not just a modern country , but also a country with a long history and legends , including hansel und gretel , walpurgistnacht , etc .
i 've been in canada and the us .
they 're just modern countries .
i barely found the aroma of their roots .
but in germany , despite its modernity , you still can sense her past history marked with castles here and there .
when arriving at the st. thomas church in leipzig i sighed with joy .
i touched the tomb of my favorite composer johann sebastian bach .
traveling in germany fulfills my idea of a great country . - johannes sebastian bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is no place for dieters , wrote one reader i am absolutely crazy for all things german !
i 've been fortunate to visit four times now .
when i 'm there , i want to stay longer and when i 'm not there , i ca n't wait to return .
on my last trip , i was able to visit my favorite city on the moselle river , bernkastel-kues , during the wine harvest festival in august .
the wine and food samples in all the different tents were fantastic .
if i 'm shopping for wine and i see that it 's from the moselle river area , i know it will taste excellent .
prost ! - john l. i 'm from the us and i just visited germany this last summer , and the reason is because the food is so delicious .
the döner kebabs , bratwurst and beer would make it hard for anyone to diet . - justin compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german travel agency helps people unearth roots in poland germany and poland have had a tumultuous relationship for many years .

" they could not prove a link between zammar and the september attacks so they sentenced him for belonging to the muslim brotherhood when he was not wanted by syria for belonging to the group in the first place , " qurabi said . zammar 's lawyer mohanad al-husni told reuters his client had always maintained his innocence .
" this religious man had the misfortune of frequenting the same mosques in hamburg as al qaeda members .
he kept telling the judge he had no organizational links with any muslim group , " husni said . zammar was handed over to syrian custody in december 2001 , just two weeks after his arrest in morocco .
his trial opened last october . he was briefly detained in germany in october 2001 as he was suspected of having had contacts with mohammed atta , who headed a hamburg cell of islamic extremists before leading the september 11 hijacks and suicide attacks .
he was later released due to insufficient evidence . german news magazine der spiegel reported that six members of the german intelligence services interrogated zammar at length in syria 's far filastin prison in november 2002 . alleged torture after cia rendition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror suspects have been flown to third nations by the cia zammar is suspected of being one of a growing number of detainees flown by the cia from their point of capture to a third state , such as syria , under washington 's policy of " rendition " where interrogation and torture are undertaken .
" he has been subjected to beating and torture i can not even describe , " husni said .
zammar was visited once by red cross officials . the suspected collaboration of the german and american intelligence services in the zammar affair forms part of the brief of a parliamentary inquiry currently under way in germany .
" the germans had him , " husni said .
" they would not have let him go if he had anything to do with the attacks . " der spiegel reported that the cia and the us federal bureau of investigation had asked germany 's bka criminal police several times in late 2001 for information on the hamburg-based zammar , his identity , his previous history , and his environment . at the end of november 2001 , the bka replied that it was closely monitoring his presence in morocco and he planned to take a flight with dutch airline klm heading back to germany on december 8 . on the orders of the cia , the suspect was arrested at casablanca airport .

" russia again claims a place in the first row , and with its nuclear arsenal , its size , and its oil and gas riches it has , by all means , weighty arguments , " wrote the munich daily süddeutsche zeitung in its monday edition .
" the usa offers another with its disastrous iraq adventure .
since that weakens western credibility , it creates the opportunity for putin to set himself up as the powerful voice of the growing number of countries and peoples who are stricken by doubt in the wisdom of western policies .
the russian president has laid his cards on the table .
europe and america now know where russia has positioned itself . " " in vladimir putin 's controlled ' democracy , ' power-political rowdiness is at least as pronounced as the need for cooperation , " commented the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily .
" in view of the general development of the past years , it 's assumedly even somewhat greater at the moment - as a signal from the kremlin that russia ' is back . '
one reason why putin acts as he did in munich and why russia ' is back ' in world politics has come to light : it is the petrol power that straightened out its self-confidence again .
in addition , comes the knowledge that america and its european allies want to have russia by their side in dealing with conflicts , and the correct appraisal that the bush administration currently finds itself in anything but a comfortable situation , " the paper continued . " how does one deal with putin 's munich blunder ? " asked the westdeutsche zeitung from düsseldorf .
" glossing over it , as some europeans try to do , would be just as wrong as responding with more verbal poison .
in view of worldwide problems , it 's important that russia remains level-headed and collaborates on finding solutions .
the next test will be the expiration of the un 's 60-day deadline for iran to discontinue its nuclear program , at the end of february .
now more than ever russia is unlikely to back a further un resolution . "
the times of london said monday that putin 's harsh comments were more than just another repeat of the bush administration 's mistakes .
" if the us administration didn ’ t have enough to worry about , given the current state of the world , it spent much of the weekend wondering whether moscow had declared another cold war … not since nikita khrushchev banged his shoe on the table at the united nations in 1960 has an international gathering heard such an icy blast from moscow ’ s leadership . " conservative french newspaper le figaro noted putin had increased the hostile tone between russia and the united states as part of his crusade against washington .
" this was vladimir putin 's variations on an old theme .
many participants at the security conference asked themselves the question of whether the second cold war was being announced in munich . " putin wants to make it clear that he wo n't allow outsiders to meddle in russia 's domestic affairs , said budapest newspaper nepszabadsag .
" should that be a cold war ?
or only an expression of the self-confident unity of an energy supplier equipped with enormous foreign exchange reserves ?
is ' soverign democracy ' not merely a pretty name for new authoritarianism ?
there is currently no confrontation .
there are discussions .
these wo n't allow the disruption of dialogue about foreign and arms policy , over the issue of eastern european democracies and the human rights .
at least not for the time being . " bulgarian newspaper dnewnik warned that europe 's energy dependence gives putin power .

while it does not mention independence many see the plan as leading to the breakaway province 's eventual separation from serbia , something that belgrade opposes . the foreign ministers , whom the un envoy will meet during one of their regular meetings in brussels , face a difficult task in reaching agreement over how to handle belgrade politically .
the kosovo / serbia issue is of particular interest to them as the eu is preparing to take control of united nations mission in kosovo , which has administered the province for the last eight years in collaboration with nato and 17,000 kfor troops . also , both serbia and kosovo are seen by many as possible future eu members .
fears of separatism ahtisaari 's settlement plan worries some countries which fear political fallout into their own separatism problems if kosovo and its mainly albanian population are allowed to go it alone , european sources said .

while it does not mention independence many see the plan as leading to the breakaway province 's eventual separation from serbia , something that belgrade opposes . the foreign ministers , whom the un envoy will meet during one of their regular meetings in brussels , face a difficult task in reaching agreement over how to handle belgrade politically .
the kosovo / serbia issue is of particular interest to them as the eu is preparing to take control of united nations mission in kosovo , which has administered the province for the last eight years in collaboration with nato and 17,000 kfor troops . also , both serbia and kosovo are seen by many as possible future eu members .
fears of separatism ahtisaari 's settlement plan worries some countries which fear political fallout into their own separatism problems if kosovo and its mainly albanian population are allowed to go it alone , european sources said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari has a tough task the most nervous nations are cyprus , romania and spain , according to one source . another concern is the possible effect on the secessionist tendencies in the republika srpska , the serb half of bosnia . " i think the judgment is ... that these concerns are outweighed by the advantages that come from settling the last big constitutional issue in the balkans , " the european source said .
" if you put this issue to bed you can say to the whole region : ' that 's it , time to get on with moving towards the european union . " ' serbia 's first step towards that goal , talks on a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , are stalled over its failure to cooperate fully with the un war crimes tribunal - shorthand for its failure to track down former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , who is indicted for genocide . the hope is that a new serb coalition government , currently cobbled together following a general election last month , will provide the fresh start needed to get back to the negotiating table .
eu divided however there are sharp differences within the eu over whether to encourage serbia by reopening the saa talks or to insist first that they cooperate with the hague-based court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kfor troops have been at work in kosovo for eight years austria , italy and spain want to see talks with the serbs reopen , but not be concluded , before full cooperation with the court is achieved .
others , including belgium and the netherlands , feel compliance must be a prerequisite for restarting talks . though formally still part of serbia , kosovo has been run by a un mission since 1999 , after nato 's aerial bombardment drove out forces loyal to then serbian leader slobodan milosevic over a crackdown on ethnic albanians . ahtisaari will hold talks with serbs and kosovars from feb .
21 before presenting his final propositions to the un security council , probably in late march .
deaths after protest to un plan two people injured in violent clashes with police during a pro-independence protest in kosovo died of their wounds sunday , a police spokesman there said .
they two were among 25 people hospitalized after a protest in pristina on saturday against the un plan for the future of kosovo . the demonstration turned violent with anti-riot police firing tear gas and rubber bullets at several thousand ethnic albanians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests got out of hand in pristina " it is regrettable that two lives were lost as a result of a wanton breach of security at government buildings , " un police commissioner stephen curtis said in a statement .
eu police for afghanistan also on their brussels agenda , the eu foreign ministers will welcome the agreement thrashed out between the fatah and hamas groups on forming a palestinian government of national unity . the eu 27 are also set to give the green light on monday for a european mission to afghanistan aimed at training the local police force , according to diplomatic sources .
some 160 european police officers , aided by 50-70 experts , will help " to establish an afghan police force which respects human rights and operates on that basis on the central , regional and provincial levels , " according to the draft conclusion to be adopted by the eu foreign ministers . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un briefly delays kosovo talks to accommodate serbs a final round of un-backed negotiations on the future status of kosovo - the serbian province whose ethnic albanian majority is craving independence - will be postponed by one week and start on feb .

" mohnhaupt will serve the remainder of her sentence on parole . the case has revived painful memories of the raf 's violent campaign of the 1970s . also known as the baader-meinhof gang after its founders andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , the red army faction murdered a string of high-profile german establishment figures from 1977 to 1982 as it attempted to bring down what it considered an oppressive capitalist state . the group is suspected of killing 34 people between 1972 and 1991 .
some 26 raf members died during that period and another 26 were sentenced to life in prison . mohnhaupt , now 57 , had risen to the ranks of the raf 's " second-generation " leadership in 1977 .
she has never explicitly apologized for the bloodshed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of schleyer , held hostage by the raf for over a month , became an iconic image of 1970s west germany in 1977 , mohnhaupt took part in the abductions and subsequent murders of west germany 's chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback , head of the west german employers ' federation hanns-martin schleyer and dresdner bank chief executive jürgen ponto .
brigitte mohnhaupt was captured in 1982 , convicted of involvement in nine murders and sentenced to five life sentences in 1985 . mohnhaupt has already made nine excursions from prison , with armed police watching her , to prepare her for a changed world that is connected up by the internet and only dimly remembers communism , which began crumbling in europe in 1989 . monday 's court decision does not come as a surprise , since prosecutors had previously supported mohnhaupt 's bid for parole at a closed hearing in stuttgart on january 22 . other raf members await clemency the former terrorist had petitioned for parole once already on feb 21 , 2006 , but was rejected because she had not yet served the minimum required sentence of 24 years , a provision that grew out of the " unusual gravity of the crime .

because klar , 54 , still has two years to serve before qualifying for possible parole , his only chance for an early release is a special pardon from german president horst köhler , who is currently reviewing the case .
former president johannes rau already rejected a previous petition for clemency . klar , who like mohnhaupt came from a well-off family and went to university to study philosophy before becoming a terrorist , is reported to have been well behaved in jail .
a berlin theatre has promised him a two-year staff internship if he is released . klar has also never renounced his ideas , telling an interviewer in 2001 he still wanted germany to make a " fresh start " and would never abjure what the raf had done , " though i do not contemplate reviving the armed struggle . " both mohnhaupt and klar 's cases have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against some politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . besides klar , the only other members of the raf still in prison are eva haule and birgit hogefeld . most of the terrorist organization 's original leaders committed suicide in jail during the 1970s . the group abandoned violence in 1992 and formally disbanded in 1998 . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we need proof that the german state is capable of mercy " gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison .

she has never explicitly apologized for the bloodshed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of schleyer , held hostage by the raf for over a month , became an iconic image of 1970s west germany in 1977 , mohnhaupt took part in the abductions and subsequent murders of west germany 's chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback , head of the west german employers ' federation hanns-martin schleyer and dresdner bank chief executive jürgen ponto .
brigitte mohnhaupt was captured in 1982 , convicted of involvement in nine murders and sentenced to five life sentences in 1985 . mohnhaupt has already made nine excursions from prison , with armed police watching her , to prepare her for a changed world that is connected up by the internet and only dimly remembers communism , which began crumbling in europe in 1989 . monday 's court decision does not come as a surprise , since prosecutors had previously supported mohnhaupt 's bid for parole at a closed hearing in stuttgart on january 22 . other raf members await clemency the former terrorist had petitioned for parole once already on feb 21 , 2006 , but was rejected because she had not yet served the minimum required sentence of 24 years , a provision that grew out of the " unusual gravity of the crime . "
that sentence expires on march 26 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar is still awaiting a decision on his plea for clemency mohnhaupt 's release comes at the same time as another petition for clemency filed by convicted red army faction leader christian klar .
because klar , 54 , still has two years to serve before qualifying for possible parole , his only chance for an early release is a special pardon from german president horst köhler , who is currently reviewing the case .
former president johannes rau already rejected a previous petition for clemency . klar , who like mohnhaupt came from a well-off family and went to university to study philosophy before becoming a terrorist , is reported to have been well behaved in jail .
a berlin theatre has promised him a two-year staff internship if he is released . klar has also never renounced his ideas , telling an interviewer in 2001 he still wanted germany to make a " fresh start " and would never abjure what the raf had done , " though i do not contemplate reviving the armed struggle . " both mohnhaupt and klar 's cases have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against some politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . besides klar , the only other members of the raf still in prison are eva haule and birgit hogefeld . most of the terrorist organization 's original leaders committed suicide in jail during the 1970s . the group abandoned violence in 1992 and formally disbanded in 1998 . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we need proof that the german state is capable of mercy " gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison .

" the results of this referendum are clear , it proves that the portuguese people want to turn the page on the question of abortion , " socrates said . but turnout in portugal 's second referendum on its abortion law in less than a decade was 43.6 percent , below the 50 percent threshold needed to make the ballot legally binding . socrates pledged his socialist government will now use its parliamentary majority to legalize abortion . portugal abortion laws among most restrictive in eu abortion is currently allowed in portugal only in cases of rape , a malformed fetus or if the woman 's well-being is in danger . a woman can be jailed for up to three years for having an illegal abortion while those who perform them face up to eight years behind bars . within the 27-nation european union only ireland , malta and poland have abortion laws that are similar or even more restrictive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose socrates believes the yes vote will lead to a more tolerant portugal socrates , elected in a landslide in 2005 , said the new law would be modeled on legislation in place in other european nations and would require a reflection period before an abortion can be carried out . " it is my sincere conviction that with the result of this referendum portugal has taken another step in the creation of a society that is more open , tolerant and just , " he said . catholic church opposed to easing law opposition to change was led by the influential catholic church which argued the government should do more to help women to have children instead of easing abortion restrictions . one priest threatened catholics who voted to ease the law with excommunication from the church .
the bishop of the northern city of braganca likened abortion to the execution of former iraqi leader saddam hussein . more than 90 percent of portugal 's population of 10.6 million identify themselves as being roman catholic although , as in other catholic countries , regular church attendance is on the decline . in a referendum held in 1998 voters upheld the existing abortion law by a whisker but the result was declared void as nearly seven out of 10 voters stayed away . during the last referendum the socialists were split with then prime minister , antonio guterres , publicly opposed to the abortion law being changed . a " national shame " socrates by contrast has backed liberalization at rallies across the country and this time it was the main opposition centre-right social democrats that was divided on the issue .
the party did not adopt an official position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say backstreet abortions in portugal are risky since the last referendum , several trials of women charged with illegally terminating their pregnancies were held that generated widespread public sympathy for the women .
analysts said this helped boost support for reform . during the campaign socrates called backstreet abortions a " national shame " and cast the referendum as a test of portugal 's readiness for progress . pro-abortion groups estimate that some 10,000 women are hospitalized , and several die every year from complications arising from botched backstreet abortions . anti-abortion groups contest the figure . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government discusses reducing late abortions parliamentary leaders met with church representatives tuesday to talk about reforming legislation on late abortions , as conservatives push for more stringent controls on terminations and a re-think of who foots the bill .

the sanctions prohibit countries from exporting nuclear and weapons technology to iran as well as impose visa bans and freeze assets of some iranian officials . " we want to maintain an door open for negotiation , but iran knows what we want them to do , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said . germany , france and england , backed by solana , offered iran political and economic incentives to suspend uranium enrichment .
despite the decision to impose sanctions , the eu says that offer still stands . enriched uranium can be used to make atomic weapons .
iran claims it is developing nuclear technology only to meet its energy needs .
europe and the united states , however , fear tehran wants to develop a nuclear arsenal under cover of a civilian nuclear program . open to negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign ministers decided to approve un sanctions at a meeting in brussels german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said a sunday speech made by ari larijani , iran 's top nuclear negotiator , could signal that iran wants to return to and continue negotiations . " now what we have to do is look at the proposal that iran is presenting and see if this paves the way back to the negotiating table , " steinmeier said . steinmeier said he and solana both thought there was an opportunity to reopen talks . " we both have the impression that in iran there is a new ambition to return to the negotiating table , " steinmeier told reporters monday , referring to meetings he and solana conducted with larijani .
" in the course of the next few days , we will have to sound out whether they -lrb- iran -rrb- can pursue that line . " we need to see what the signals are from iran , whether they are serious , " steinmeier added . " possibilities are not immense " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe still wants to negotiate with iran larijani said iran wants a negotiated settlement and does n't want to aggravate the tense political situation in the region . solana , however , was cautious , saying " the possibilities are not immense " and that he had yet to hear any new proposals from iran . on friday , the international atomic energy agency cut its aid package to iran by nearly 50 percent .
the cuts were meant to send a strong message to iran to shut down its uranium enrichment activities . " sanctions are one part of the double track approach we are taking in europe , " said spanish state secretary for european affairs alberto navarro .
" we know it is just the first step and these sanctions should be gradual . " iran risks more extensive economic sanctions if it fails to comply with a un security council deadline later this month to stop enrichment . eu ready to give serbia a new chance the ministers also said they were willing to give eu-hopeful serbia " a new chance " for talks on closer ties , but stressed that a resumption of stalled negotiations would depend on belgrade 's determination to arrest fugitives suspected of war crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ministers condemned violence that occurred in kosovo over the weekend steinmeier told reporters that a new serbian government must " live up to its responsibilities and cooperate with icty , " the united nations international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia . " a new reform and europe-oriented government can make a new start , get back on the road to europe and regain lost time , " said eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn .
" this new government deserves a new chance . " belgrade must investigate war crimes however , rehn said the eu would resume suspended talks with serbia only if the new government took " concrete action " and showed " clear commitment " in the search for fugitive bosnian serb general ratko mladic and other key war crimes suspects . " full cooperation with icty remains the necessary condition for the pace and conclusions of stabilization talks , " rehn said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martti ahtisaari presented his proposal for kosovo and serbia on feb .
2 the 27-member bloc froze negotiations on closer economic and political ties - the first step towards eu membership - with serbia in may 2006 , demanding belgrade show " full cooperation " with the hague-based tribunal . eu foreign ministers also said that they were fully supporting a united nations plan that sets serbia 's breakaway region kosovo on the road to independence . the plans by un envoy for kosovo , martti ahtisaari , " provide comprehensive arrangements designed to promote in kosovo a multi-ethnic and democratic society based on the rule of law , " they said . belgrade and pristina must " participate actively and constructively " in upcoming talks on the plan , eu ministers said , adding that the bloc was ready " to play a significant role in the implementation of the status settlement . " rehn said he also expected russia to support the un plan , arguing that a long-term solution for kosovo must be backed by all members of the international community . " kosovo will be a real test for multilateralism , " rehn said . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany takes positives from another controversial conference a " threat " of a new cold war and a potential new stalemate over iran 's nuclear program could have brought this weekend 's munich security conference to a bitter end .

its makers said they hope it will help silence holocaust deniers , including iran 's president . a few months before his death in 2005 , simon wiesenthal remembered something he had promised his wife , cyla . " three to four years , " he had told her - that 's how long he would hunt nazi criminals from vienna before the family could move to israel . the wiesenthals never left the austrian capital as simon ended up devoting his entire life to bringing the holocaust 's perpetrators to justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : collecting stamps , including those with pictures of hitler , gave wiesenthal some distraction from his work " if you want to cure malaria , you have to live with the mosquitoes , " he said to friends who asked him why he would n't leave despite the hostility , death threats and even a bomb attack on his home .
" a soldier belongs on the battlefield . " the documentary " i have never forgotten you : the life and legacy of simon wiesenthal , " which premiered at the berlin international film festival , tries to shed light on why wiesenthal did n't keep the promise to his wife . " how could i simply restart my life where it had been interrupted and build houses ? "
wiesenthal , an architect by trade , asked after emerging from the nazi 's mauthausen death camp barely alive and weighing only 45 kilograms -lrb- 99 pounds -rrb- . labor of love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicole kidman , seen at the 2003 berlinale , narrated the film using interviews with the man himself as well as conversations with family members and friends , the film 's director , richard trank , recounts wiesenthal 's life from his birth in a small polish village through the horrors of the nazi era to his role as the world 's most prominent prosecutor of war criminals . produced by moriah films , which is associated with the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles , the documentary shows its subject in the best light possible and those behind it made no secret of their admiration for wiesenthal . " it was something from the heart , " trank , who has worked on several film productions for the center , said after the screening in berlin . painting a full picture despite this , the film also contains scenes about moments of controversy in wiesenthal 's life . " i wanted a full picture , " trank said .
" we did n't want to skip over some of the more controversial parts of his life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesenthal visited an austrian jewish cemetery vandalized by neo-nazis in 1992 those include allegations that wiesenthal may have taken too much credit for hunting down holocaust organizer adolf eichmann , who was hanged in israel in 1962 . there is also discussion about accusations that wiesenthal - based on false information - acted irresponsibly by saying that nazi doctor josef mengele , who killed thousands for medical experiments at concentration camps , was still alive while he had already died years earlier .
the documentary includes wiesenthal 's war crimes accusations against the leader of austria 's fpö party , friedrich peter , which led peter 's political ally , austrian chancellor bruno kreisky , to accuse wiesenthal of employing mafia methods . contagious obsession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kingsley said wiesenthal 's gesture of wiping his face with one hand summed up all the pain he had suffered but these episodes in the movie pale in comparison with the praise by wiesenthal 's admirers , including sir ben kingsley , who played wiesenthal in the1989 film " murderers among us : the simon wiesenthal story . " " it was an obsession he had and when you were around him you became addicted , " said kingsley , who also attended the screening .
" he was like a dad to me .
he is still part of my cellular tissue .
he taught me a great deal . " education tool trank said the movie had already found a distributor in germany and would be released in the us in late spring before going on to television and dvd . " most importantly , it will be used in schools , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish delegates with ahmadinejad at the conference last year wiesenthal center officials meanwhile said they were planning to translate the movie into farsi and find a way to broadcast it in iran , where the country 's president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , recently hosted a conference questioning that the holocaust actually took place .

while it does not mention independence many see the plan as leading to the breakaway province 's eventual separation from serbia , something that belgrade opposes . the foreign ministers , whom the un envoy will meet during one of their regular meetings in brussels , face a difficult task in reaching agreement over how to handle belgrade politically .
the kosovo / serbia issue is of particular interest to them as the eu is preparing to take control of united nations mission in kosovo , which has administered the province for the last eight years in collaboration with nato and 17,000 kfor troops . also , both serbia and kosovo are seen by many as possible future eu members .
fears of separatism ahtisaari 's settlement plan worries some countries which fear political fallout into their own separatism problems if kosovo and its mainly albanian population are allowed to go it alone , european sources said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari has a tough task the most nervous nations are cyprus , romania and spain , according to one source . another concern is the possible effect on the secessionist tendencies in the republika srpska , the serb half of bosnia . " i think the judgment is ... that these concerns are outweighed by the advantages that come from settling the last big constitutional issue in the balkans , " the european source said .
" if you put this issue to bed you can say to the whole region : ' that 's it , time to get on with moving towards the european union . " ' serbia 's first step towards that goal , talks on a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , are stalled over its failure to cooperate fully with the un war crimes tribunal - shorthand for its failure to track down former bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , who is indicted for genocide . the hope is that a new serb coalition government , currently cobbled together following a general election last month , will provide the fresh start needed to get back to the negotiating table .
eu divided however there are sharp differences within the eu over whether to encourage serbia by reopening the saa talks or to insist first that they cooperate with the hague-based court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kfor troops have been at work in kosovo for eight years austria , italy and spain want to see talks with the serbs reopen , but not be concluded , before full cooperation with the court is achieved .
others , including belgium and the netherlands , feel compliance must be a prerequisite for restarting talks . though formally still part of serbia , kosovo has been run by a un mission since 1999 , after nato 's aerial bombardment drove out forces loyal to then serbian leader slobodan milosevic over a crackdown on ethnic albanians . ahtisaari will hold talks with serbs and kosovars from feb .
21 before presenting his final propositions to the un security council , probably in late march .
deaths after protest to un plan two people injured in violent clashes with police during a pro-independence protest in kosovo died of their wounds sunday , a police spokesman there said .
they two were among 25 people hospitalized after a protest in pristina on saturday against the un plan for the future of kosovo . the demonstration turned violent with anti-riot police firing tear gas and rubber bullets at several thousand ethnic albanians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests got out of hand in pristina " it is regrettable that two lives were lost as a result of a wanton breach of security at government buildings , " un police commissioner stephen curtis said in a statement .
eu police for afghanistan also on their brussels agenda , the eu foreign ministers will welcome the agreement thrashed out between the fatah and hamas groups on forming a palestinian government of national unity . the eu 27 are also set to give the green light on monday for a european mission to afghanistan aimed at training the local police force , according to diplomatic sources .
some 160 european police officers , aided by 50-70 experts , will help " to establish an afghan police force which respects human rights and operates on that basis on the central , regional and provincial levels , " according to the draft conclusion to be adopted by the eu foreign ministers . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un briefly delays kosovo talks to accommodate serbs a final round of un-backed negotiations on the future status of kosovo - the serbian province whose ethnic albanian majority is craving independence - will be postponed by one week and start on feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 12.02.2007 germany takes positives from another controversial conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slogan reads " peace through dialogue " but iran 's ali larajani remained tight lipped a " threat " of a new cold war and a potential new stalemate over iran 's nuclear program could have brought this weekend 's munich security conference to a bitter end .
however , host germany chose to highlight the positives . german chancellor angela merkel welcomed some of the most important political and military figures in the world to the annual international security conference in munich over the weekend .
as with previous year 's , the 2007 conference threw up its fair share of controversy . in recent year 's , the munich conference has provided the setting for a nervous appearance by donald rumsfeld in 2005 , when the former us secretary of defense faced possible war crime charges , and merkel 's assertion last year that the threat posed by iran was comparable to the rise of the nazis in the early 1930 's . grabbing the majority of the limelight this year was russian president vladimir putin who told the high-ranking audience in no uncertain terms that the united states bore the responsibility for many of the world 's worst security issues . as hosts of the conference , it came down to the germans to diffuse the situation .
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said putin had been speaking in his own characteristic style at a venue that had " a suitable and longstanding context " for plain talking and added that putin 's comments " did not represent a reversion to the cold war . " berlin to keep dialogue open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you 're a bad lad , vlad . "
but berlin will keep talking putin also accused the us of provoking a new nuclear arms race by developing ballistic missile defenses in eastern europe as well as undermining international institutions and making the middle east more unstable . speaking in berlin on monday , the day after the conference closed , wilhelm added that berlin did not agree with putin 's criticism of nato 's eastward expansion , but would keep up the dialogue with the kremlin and continue to cooperate with russia on international issues . the other major incident to cause ripples was the decision of iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani to attend the conference after unexpectedly canceling his plans to attend and then , even more unexpectedly , reversing the reversal . face-to-face meeting before un deadline his attendance gave the german hosts and their european union counterparts in the current nuclear negotiation process the opportunity to address the crisis over iran 's ambitions face to face . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani talked tough but then gave hint of concession the german foreign ministry had arranged talks with larijani in munich with an eye on the feb .
21st un security council deadline for iran to stop enriching uranium for nuclear fuel or risk further international sanctions . before larijani spoke to the conference , merkel made it clear that the pressure remained on iran to make the first move . " if iran does not comply with international demands , it risks falling deeper into isolation , " merkel said .
" we are all determined to prevent the threat of an iran with a military nuclear program .
there are no ifs and buts here and no tricks . " larijani told the munich meeting that tehran had the right to peaceful nuclear technology and that his country 's uranium-enrichment activities were exclusively of a research and development nature . he said " irrational preconditions " such as western demands that iran must suspend uranium enrichment before coming to the negotiating table were an obstacle to solving the nuclear dispute . steinmeier : possible iran breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier saw a light at the end of the munich tunnel however , after meeting with eu foreign policy chief javier solana and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday for the first time since talks broke down last september , larijani said that " there is political will on both sides to have a negotiated settlement . " steinmeier said sunday that larijani had indicated that tehran could be ready to talk . " -lrb- larijani -rrb- signaled iran has an interest in returning and continuing with the negotiating process , " he told reporters .
" now what we have to do is look at the proposal that iran is presenting and see if this paves the way back to the negotiating table .

however , host germany chose to highlight the positives . german chancellor angela merkel welcomed some of the most important political and military figures in the world to the annual international security conference in munich over the weekend .
as with previous year 's , the 2007 conference threw up its fair share of controversy . in recent year 's , the munich conference has provided the setting for a nervous appearance by donald rumsfeld in 2005 , when the former us secretary of defense faced possible war crime charges , and merkel 's assertion last year that the threat posed by iran was comparable to the rise of the nazis in the early 1930 's . grabbing the majority of the limelight this year was russian president vladimir putin who told the high-ranking audience in no uncertain terms that the united states bore the responsibility for many of the world 's worst security issues . as hosts of the conference , it came down to the germans to diffuse the situation .
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said putin had been speaking in his own characteristic style at a venue that had " a suitable and longstanding context " for plain talking and added that putin 's comments " did not represent a reversion to the cold war . " berlin to keep dialogue open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you 're a bad lad , vlad . "
but berlin will keep talking putin also accused the us of provoking a new nuclear arms race by developing ballistic missile defenses in eastern europe as well as undermining international institutions and making the middle east more unstable . speaking in berlin on monday , the day after the conference closed , wilhelm added that berlin did not agree with putin 's criticism of nato 's eastward expansion , but would keep up the dialogue with the kremlin and continue to cooperate with russia on international issues . the other major incident to cause ripples was the decision of iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani to attend the conference after unexpectedly canceling his plans to attend and then , even more unexpectedly , reversing the reversal . face-to-face meeting before un deadline his attendance gave the german hosts and their european union counterparts in the current nuclear negotiation process the opportunity to address the crisis over iran 's ambitions face to face . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani talked tough but then gave hint of concession the german foreign ministry had arranged talks with larijani in munich with an eye on the feb .
21st un security council deadline for iran to stop enriching uranium for nuclear fuel or risk further international sanctions . before larijani spoke to the conference , merkel made it clear that the pressure remained on iran to make the first move . " if iran does not comply with international demands , it risks falling deeper into isolation , " merkel said .
" we are all determined to prevent the threat of an iran with a military nuclear program .
there are no ifs and buts here and no tricks . " larijani told the munich meeting that tehran had the right to peaceful nuclear technology and that his country 's uranium-enrichment activities were exclusively of a research and development nature . he said " irrational preconditions " such as western demands that iran must suspend uranium enrichment before coming to the negotiating table were an obstacle to solving the nuclear dispute . steinmeier : possible iran breakthrough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier saw a light at the end of the munich tunnel however , after meeting with eu foreign policy chief javier solana and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on sunday for the first time since talks broke down last september , larijani said that " there is political will on both sides to have a negotiated settlement . " steinmeier said sunday that larijani had indicated that tehran could be ready to talk . " -lrb- larijani -rrb- signaled iran has an interest in returning and continuing with the negotiating process , " he told reporters .

" the results of this referendum are clear , it proves that the portuguese people want to turn the page on the question of abortion , " socrates said . but turnout in portugal 's second referendum on its abortion law in less than a decade was 43.6 percent , below the 50 percent threshold needed to make the ballot legally binding . socrates pledged his socialist government will now use its parliamentary majority to legalize abortion . portugal abortion laws among most restrictive in eu abortion is currently allowed in portugal only in cases of rape , a malformed fetus or if the woman 's well-being is in danger . a woman can be jailed for up to three years for having an illegal abortion while those who perform them face up to eight years behind bars . within the 27-nation european union only ireland , malta and poland have abortion laws that are similar or even more restrictive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose socrates believes the yes vote will lead to a more tolerant portugal socrates , elected in a landslide in 2005 , said the new law would be modeled on legislation in place in other european nations and would require a reflection period before an abortion can be carried out .

the bishop of the northern city of braganca likened abortion to the execution of former iraqi leader saddam hussein . more than 90 percent of portugal 's population of 10.6 million identify themselves as being roman catholic although , as in other catholic countries , regular church attendance is on the decline . in a referendum held in 1998 voters upheld the existing abortion law by a whisker but the result was declared void as nearly seven out of 10 voters stayed away . during the last referendum the socialists were split with then prime minister , antonio guterres , publicly opposed to the abortion law being changed . a " national shame " socrates by contrast has backed liberalization at rallies across the country and this time it was the main opposition centre-right social democrats that was divided on the issue .
the party did not adopt an official position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say backstreet abortions in portugal are risky since the last referendum , several trials of women charged with illegally terminating their pregnancies were held that generated widespread public sympathy for the women .
analysts said this helped boost support for reform . during the campaign socrates called backstreet abortions a " national shame " and cast the referendum as a test of portugal 's readiness for progress . pro-abortion groups estimate that some 10,000 women are hospitalized , and several die every year from complications arising from botched backstreet abortions . anti-abortion groups contest the figure . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government discusses reducing late abortions parliamentary leaders met with church representatives tuesday to talk about reforming legislation on late abortions , as conservatives push for more stringent controls on terminations and a re-think of who foots the bill .

it 's unclear whether the kidnappers want ransom money or political concessions .
the victims ' family in germany have allegedly been contacted by the kidnappers . a german woman and her son who had lived in iraq for years went missing approximately a week ago . german authorities were alerted to the abduction after kidnappers contacted the missing man 's sister , who lives in berlin .
she in turn contacted german authorities , the berliner zeitung reported tuesday .
the abductors have yet to make demands .
it is unclear whether they want money , political concessions or both , according to the newspaper , which cited unnamed security sources . berlin daily tagesspiegel said one victim is a german national in her 60s who lives in baghdad and is married to an iraqi doctor . the second victim is her adult son who is believed to work at the iraqi foreign ministry , according to the paper . the identities of the victims have not been released .
the tagesspiegel also reported that kidnappers had contacted family of the victims who live in berlin and other parts of germany .
the kidnappers has not made demands , but threatened to kill the son , the tagesspiegel reported . the german foreign ministry wo n't say whether contact has been made with the kidnappers .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier confirmed monday that two german nationals have been missing in iraq for almost a week . " we can not rule out that it was a kidnapping by force , " he told reporters at an eu meeting . motivation for kidnapping unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier would not give reporters any details on the alleged kidnapping berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper reported that the family was considered wealthy by iraqi standards and was probably victim to a targeted kidnapping . germany 's ntv news channel said the crisis team set up by the german government was apparently working with mediators , but the foreign ministry declined to confirm that this was the case . " we hope that everything works out well and we are doing everything in our power to ensure that the two germans are returned safely to their families , " steinmeier said . according to the german foreign ministry there are still about a hundred german nationals in iraq , people working for german and international companies or diplomatic services .

and in november 2005 susanne osthoff , a german archeologist working for an aid organization , was released after the german government allegedly paid a ransom to the tune of several million euros . the german government has staunchly denied this saying that it doesn ’ t make deals with terrorists .
the complete media ban in the current case , however , suggests that officials may already be working behind the scenes to try and establish a contact with the kidnappers . the most urgent question is whether hostages are held by kidnappers seeking a ransom or by islamic fundamentalists with a political motive .

since the bafta awards shifted to just two weeks ahead of the academy awards in 2001 , they have developed a decidely international flavour .
the latest bond star was beseiged by fans on the red carpet but sunday was a noticeably british affair , from the winning films the queen and the last king of scotland , to the february chill and the ample display of goosebumps among the guests .
and perhaps it was the customary british reserve that accounted for the decidedly low-key atmosphere , which saw the queen director stephen frears shambling on stage in his ' lucky ' red trainers and kate winslet forced once again to dispel tabloid tales about her weight .
the rain held off , but it would appear last year 's damp celebrations deterred many of hollywood 's finest from making the trip across the atlantic .
alan arkin and jennifer hudson , who both won awards in the best supporting acting categories , were just two of the absent stars .
bond girl eva green won the bafta rising star award nor was there any sign of meryl streep , martin scorsese or leonardo dicaprio - though perhaps it was just as well since the departed failed to earn a single award .
a trio of women threatened to impale themselves on the barriers in their determination to get a photo with jake gyllenhaal , returning to present the best actress award after his triumph at last year 's awards .
and the 10-year-old abigail breslin was clearly thrilled by her first trip to london .
but dame judi dench and sir ian mckellen all but ignored the press , and penelope cruz was frogmarched up the red carpet in the firm grip of pedro almodovar .
greengrass is shooting action sequel the bourne ultimatum in the absence of george clooney , it was left to 007 , the modest mr craig , to deliver the red carpet dazzle as the crowds bayed for ' daniel ' .
while craig failed to take the best actor title , it was undoubtedly a triumphant night for british film .
richard griffiths , nominated for best actor in the history boys , called the domination of uk films " wonderful " .
" five years ago they were saying the british film industry was dead .
this kind of success can only promote more possibilities for more projects . "
" cinema is alive and vibrant , and particularly so in this country , " said united 93 's director paul greengrass , clearly surprised and delighted by his bafta honour for best director .
he even took the unusual step of singling out the current chancellor : " gordon brown should take credit for some of the success tonight . "
i 'll drink some tequila in the morning , that will calm my nerves babel director alejandro inarritu on preparing for the oscars " we 've always had great films and great talent , but we needed the framework - and they 've -lsb- the government -rsb- have got that right . "
if it was a good night for the brits , there was also much to celebrate in mexico .
pan 's labyrinth , directed by mexico 's guillermo del toro , took three awards including best foreign film .
" most of my movies have connected very strongly with a british audience and this is of particular pride for me , " said del toro , best known for blade ii and hellboy , who expressed his " great joy " at winning the bafta .
but he played down talk of victory at the oscars , where the film is nominated in six categories : " as a fat man , i have learned one thing , go to the party and do n't expect anything ! "
there was also double bafta success for alfonso cuaron 's children of men , and even with just one award - for film music - babel director alejandro inarritu was a happy man .
mirren compared the obsession with oscar odds to being in a dog race " after so much hard work , it 's great to be recognised and acknowledged , " he said , speaking of the recent success of hispanic film-makers .
" no matter that it 's late or not , it 's beautiful , " said the 43-year-old mexican , who is nominated for best picture at the academy awards later this month .
the night finished with triumph for oscar favourites forest whitaker and dame helen mirren , who fittingly had the final word .
" we make a good king and queen , " said mirren , adding naughtily that after greeting whitaker at so many award ceremonies the couple knew each other " very intimately " .
" it was an amazing year for female performances , " said the 61-year-old star .
" i was very proud to see actresses being allowed to be themselves , be the age they are and give incredible performances . "
" you do n't become a great actress without doing the work .
i had three superb roles and i worked my butt off for a year , and now i 'm getting the reaction . "

since the bafta awards shifted to just two weeks ahead of the academy awards in 2001 , they have developed a decidely international flavour .
the latest bond star was beseiged by fans on the red carpet but sunday was a noticeably british affair , from the winning films the queen and the last king of scotland , to the february chill and the ample display of goosebumps among the guests .
and perhaps it was the customary british reserve that accounted for the decidedly low-key atmosphere , which saw the queen director stephen frears shambling on stage in his ' lucky ' red trainers and kate winslet forced once again to dispel tabloid tales about her weight .

as a german court orders the release of one of the last members of the baader-meinhof gang remaining behind bars , clare murphy recalls the long terror campaign waged by the country 's most notorious urban guerrilla group .
schleyer was held for more than a month before being killed on 5 september , 1977 , a woman with a pushchair stepped out in front of a car on a street in cologne .
the driver , who was chauffeuring one of west germany 's most powerful industrialists , was forced to brake .
the woman pulled out two machine guns , and her accomplices , following behind , bundled hanns martin schleyer out of the car .
his bodyguards were killed at the scene and one month later , his body was found in the boot of a car .
schleyer is one name on a list of more than 30 people killed by the baader-meinhof gang - or red army faction as it later became known - during a campaign against members of the german elite and us military personnel which started in the late 1960s .
born from the radical student movement of that period , the raf comprised mainly middle-class youngsters who saw themselves as fighting a west german capitalist establishment which they apparently believed was little more than a reincarnation of the third reich .
at the height of its popularity , around a quarter of young west germans expressed some sympathy for the group .
many condemned their tactics but understood their disgust with the new order , particularly one where former nazis enjoyed prominent roles .
their critics meanwhile denounced them as murderous nihilists - desperate for a cause but with no real political goals .
library plot it was the 1967 killing by police of a young activist during a demonstration in berlin against a visit by the shah of iran that apparently persuaded andreas baader that the post-war authorities were little better than that which they had replaced .
baader began his campaign with the bombing of a frankfurt store vowing to mount a violent campaign , he started off in 1968 by detonating home-made bombs in two frankfurt department stores .
arrested and imprisoned , he escaped in 1970 during a library visit with the help of a left-wing campaigning journalist - ulrike meinhof - and the baader-meinhof gang was firmly established in the public mind .
horst mahler - a socialist lawyer who is now a key figure within the german neo-nazi movement - was by this stage also heavily involved with the fledgling organisation .
in 1970 , several members of the group headed off to jordan where they were taught how to use a kalashnikov at a camp run by the palestinian liberation organisation .
they spent the next two years robbing banks and bombing buildings back in germany .
baader was then captured with accomplices jan-carl raspe and holger meins in a frankfurt shootout on 1 june , 1972 .
baader 's girlfriend gudrun ensslin was arrested a week later , and meinhof was caught in mid-june .
bloody spell a second generation of militants then took up the fight , carrying out some of the bloodiest and most high-profile attacks in order to secure the release of their heroes , whose trial - the longest and most expensive in west german history - opened in 1975 .
that same year the german embassy in sweden was seized ; two of the hostages , both attachés , were shot dead during the 11-hour siege after chancellor helmut schmidt refused to give in to demands that all the suspects be released .
in the course of the trial , meinhof was found hanging from a rope made of towels in her cell - her death sparking a stream of conspiracy theories from her followers .
the trial concluded a year later , with the three remaining defendants sentenced to life imprisonment for murder and attempted murder .
a new series of assassinations had already begun .
1977 : campaign escalates 7 april : chief public prosecutor killed 30 july : head of dresdner bank killed 5 sep : hanns martin schleyer abducted 13 oct : plane hijacked 18 oct : baader , ensslin and raspe commit suicide on 7 april 1977 , chief public prosecutor siegfried buback was killed in karlsruhe by a motorcycle hit squad .
three months later , the chief executive of dresdner bank , juergen ponto , was killed at his home in frankfurt .
but it was the september abduction of schleyer , head of the german association of employers and a former member of the nazi party , which kicked off a series of events known as the german autumn .
hijack mission schleyer 's captors offered his release in exchange for baader , ensslin and nine others .
baader and ensslin committed suicide in 1977 but even as the negotiations were being carried out , arab sympathisers were finalising a plan to hijack a plane full of german tourists bound to frankfurt from majorca to increase the pressure on the authorities .
the aircraft , seized on 13 october , went first to italy , then cyprus , bahrain and dubai , before finally landing in mogadishu , where the captain was shot dead by the hijackers .
shortly afterwards , german elite commandos stormed the plane , killing three of the hijackers and freeing the hostages .
the success of the mission provided a ray of hope for a country where many felt under siege .
but it was the final blow for the group 's leaders in prison .
as news broke , baader , ensslin and raspe committed suicide - although there is still some controversy as to how they obtained the weapons they used .
the next day , schleyer 's kidnappers announced he had been killed .
communist help whether there was any great ideological design behind the killings of the 1970s is unclear .
by 1977 , it looked as though the release of the imprisoned had become an end in itself .
the revolution says : i was , i am , i will be again raf 's last statement some analysts believe the raf had hoped to push the state to breaking point , goading it into introducing a series of illiberal measures that would whip up anger within the left and spark some form of civil war .
indeed comparisons have been drawn with the crackdown on some civil liberties which followed the 9/11 attacks on the us and the steps taken in germany during that period , when new laws were quickly introduced to limit suspects ' rights and bolster police powers .
but while it initally enjoyed some sympathy from the left , the raf found itself increasingly isolated as the years went by , although it did find assistance from communist east germany , where a number of their members were given refuge .
attacks continued throughout the 1980s , but the group never achieved the kind of prominence it had enjoyed in the 1970s .
arms industry executive ernst zimmermann was killed in 1985 , the same year a bombing at a us airbase killed two people , and in 1986 , siemens executive karl-heinz beckurts was killed .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 weakened the group immensely .
after a long lull , on 20 april 1998 , the group announced its dissolution .
" the revolution says : i was , i am , i will be again , " it declared as it signed off .

as a german court orders the release of one of the last members of the baader-meinhof gang remaining behind bars , clare murphy recalls the long terror campaign waged by the country 's most notorious urban guerrilla group .
schleyer was held for more than a month before being killed on 5 september , 1977 , a woman with a pushchair stepped out in front of a car on a street in cologne .
the driver , who was chauffeuring one of west germany 's most powerful industrialists , was forced to brake .
the woman pulled out two machine guns , and her accomplices , following behind , bundled hanns martin schleyer out of the car .
his bodyguards were killed at the scene and one month later , his body was found in the boot of a car .
schleyer is one name on a list of more than 30 people killed by the baader-meinhof gang - or red army faction as it later became known - during a campaign against members of the german elite and us military personnel which started in the late 1960s .
born from the radical student movement of that period , the raf comprised mainly middle-class youngsters who saw themselves as fighting a west german capitalist establishment which they apparently believed was little more than a reincarnation of the third reich .
at the height of its popularity , around a quarter of young west germans expressed some sympathy for the group .
many condemned their tactics but understood their disgust with the new order , particularly one where former nazis enjoyed prominent roles .

as a german court orders the release of one of the last members of the baader-meinhof gang remaining behind bars , clare murphy recalls the long terror campaign waged by the country 's most notorious urban guerrilla group .
schleyer was held for more than a month before being killed on 5 september , 1977 , a woman with a pushchair stepped out in front of a car on a street in cologne .
the driver , who was chauffeuring one of west germany 's most powerful industrialists , was forced to brake .
the woman pulled out two machine guns , and her accomplices , following behind , bundled hanns martin schleyer out of the car .
his bodyguards were killed at the scene and one month later , his body was found in the boot of a car .
schleyer is one name on a list of more than 30 people killed by the baader-meinhof gang - or red army faction as it later became known - during a campaign against members of the german elite and us military personnel which started in the late 1960s .
born from the radical student movement of that period , the raf comprised mainly middle-class youngsters who saw themselves as fighting a west german capitalist establishment which they apparently believed was little more than a reincarnation of the third reich .
at the height of its popularity , around a quarter of young west germans expressed some sympathy for the group .
many condemned their tactics but understood their disgust with the new order , particularly one where former nazis enjoyed prominent roles .
their critics meanwhile denounced them as murderous nihilists - desperate for a cause but with no real political goals .
library plot it was the 1967 killing by police of a young activist during a demonstration in berlin against a visit by the shah of iran that apparently persuaded andreas baader that the post-war authorities were little better than that which they had replaced .
baader began his campaign with the bombing of a frankfurt store vowing to mount a violent campaign , he started off in 1968 by detonating home-made bombs in two frankfurt department stores .
arrested and imprisoned , he escaped in 1970 during a library visit with the help of a left-wing campaigning journalist - ulrike meinhof - and the baader-meinhof gang was firmly established in the public mind .
horst mahler - a socialist lawyer who is now a key figure within the german neo-nazi movement - was by this stage also heavily involved with the fledgling organisation .
in 1970 , several members of the group headed off to jordan where they were taught how to use a kalashnikov at a camp run by the palestinian liberation organisation .
they spent the next two years robbing banks and bombing buildings back in germany .
baader was then captured with accomplices jan-carl raspe and holger meins in a frankfurt shootout on 1 june , 1972 .
baader 's girlfriend gudrun ensslin was arrested a week later , and meinhof was caught in mid-june .
bloody spell a second generation of militants then took up the fight , carrying out some of the bloodiest and most high-profile attacks in order to secure the release of their heroes , whose trial - the longest and most expensive in west german history - opened in 1975 .
that same year the german embassy in sweden was seized ; two of the hostages , both attachés , were shot dead during the 11-hour siege after chancellor helmut schmidt refused to give in to demands that all the suspects be released .
in the course of the trial , meinhof was found hanging from a rope made of towels in her cell - her death sparking a stream of conspiracy theories from her followers .
the trial concluded a year later , with the three remaining defendants sentenced to life imprisonment for murder and attempted murder .
a new series of assassinations had already begun .
1977 : campaign escalates 7 april : chief public prosecutor killed 30 july : head of dresdner bank killed 5 sep : hanns martin schleyer abducted 13 oct : plane hijacked 18 oct : baader , ensslin and raspe commit suicide on 7 april 1977 , chief public prosecutor siegfried buback was killed in karlsruhe by a motorcycle hit squad .
three months later , the chief executive of dresdner bank , juergen ponto , was killed at his home in frankfurt .
but it was the september abduction of schleyer , head of the german association of employers and a former member of the nazi party , which kicked off a series of events known as the german autumn .
hijack mission schleyer 's captors offered his release in exchange for baader , ensslin and nine others .
baader and ensslin committed suicide in 1977 but even as the negotiations were being carried out , arab sympathisers were finalising a plan to hijack a plane full of german tourists bound to frankfurt from majorca to increase the pressure on the authorities .
the aircraft , seized on 13 october , went first to italy , then cyprus , bahrain and dubai , before finally landing in mogadishu , where the captain was shot dead by the hijackers .
shortly afterwards , german elite commandos stormed the plane , killing three of the hijackers and freeing the hostages .
the success of the mission provided a ray of hope for a country where many felt under siege .
but it was the final blow for the group 's leaders in prison .

foreign minister patteson oti told pacific islands forum members that they should discuss an exit strategy .
the regional assistance mission to solomon islands -lrb- ramsi -rrb- began work in 2003 , to help restore peace after years of ethnic unrest .
australia , new zealand and other pacific states have contributed troops .
escalating tensions " the forum should start a dialogue process with all stakeholders to carefully examine an exit strategy for ramsi , " mr oti told members of the pacific islands forum on monday , during a visit to review the deployment .
" i 'm not saying that ramsi should leave tomorrow or soon , no , far from it .
but at least we can work towards a time-frame so that solomon islanders will not become dependent on ramsi , " mr oti is quoted as saying by the australian associated press .
he also said the mission should maintain its regional character rather than being " australian-dictated " .
solomons prime minister manasseh sogavare has also previously argued for a " clear exit strategy " for ramsi - a move that has angered australia - which has provided the bulk of the personnel for the mission .
in a sign of escalating tensions between honiara and canberra , australian foreign minister alexander downer wrote a full-page letter published in a solomons newspaper on friday , saying mr sogavare was trying to destroy ramsi .
he called on solomon islanders to support the mission and reject their government 's plans to re-arm the local police force .
" before ramsi , solomon islands sovereignty had been seized at the point of a gun , by bands of thugs and criminals , " mr downer said .
the australian government regards the security force in the solomon islands as crucial to its region-wide strategy of stamping out corruption , promoting good democratic governance and preventing nations from becoming failed states .
but the solomons government deeply resents this approach , and has accused canberra of arrogance and of acting like a regional bully .

foreign minister patteson oti told pacific islands forum members that they should discuss an exit strategy .
the regional assistance mission to solomon islands -lrb- ramsi -rrb- began work in 2003 , to help restore peace after years of ethnic unrest .
australia , new zealand and other pacific states have contributed troops .
escalating tensions " the forum should start a dialogue process with all stakeholders to carefully examine an exit strategy for ramsi , " mr oti told members of the pacific islands forum on monday , during a visit to review the deployment .
" i 'm not saying that ramsi should leave tomorrow or soon , no , far from it .
but at least we can work towards a time-frame so that solomon islanders will not become dependent on ramsi , " mr oti is quoted as saying by the australian associated press .
he also said the mission should maintain its regional character rather than being " australian-dictated " .
solomons prime minister manasseh sogavare has also previously argued for a " clear exit strategy " for ramsi - a move that has angered australia - which has provided the bulk of the personnel for the mission .
in a sign of escalating tensions between honiara and canberra , australian foreign minister alexander downer wrote a full-page letter published in a solomons newspaper on friday , saying mr sogavare was trying to destroy ramsi .
he called on solomon islanders to support the mission and reject their government 's plans to re-arm the local police force .
" before ramsi , solomon islands sovereignty had been seized at the point of a gun , by bands of thugs and criminals , " mr downer said .
the australian government regards the security force in the solomon islands as crucial to its region-wide strategy of stamping out corruption , promoting good democratic governance and preventing nations from becoming failed states .
but the solomons government deeply resents this approach , and has accused canberra of arrogance and of acting like a regional bully .

user-generated content , mobile tv and location-based services are all likely to cause a buzz among the 60,000 visitors .
with one billion handsets sold last year , it is certainly in a healthy state but the majority of customers are still stuck in a talk and text world .
for ben wood , director at research firm ccs insight , this year 's conference will be the start of the journey to really bring the web to the mobile phone .
to succeed where earlier attempts have failed , will require the coming together of three crucial factors , he thinks .
" it is about more capable devices with a broadband experience and predictable pricing , " he said .
cool stuff flat-rate charging for data downloads is already happening - with 3 's bundled x-series service for example - and there will be a glut of handsets with better colour screens and more memory to persuade users to make the transition from voice to data .
also on show will be handsets that make use of a new standard - high-speed downlink packet access or hsdpa - which promises the broadband experience mr wood describes . "
more phones were connected in india in 2006 than the population of the uk " mike short , mobile data association available in high-end handsets by the end of the year , the technology may prove a good source of debate for the experts in barcelona but will mean very little to consumers .
" consumers should never have to talk about hsdpa .
this industry is too obsessed with technology and that needs to be taken out of the equation .
it should just be about cool stuff that people can do with their phones , " said mr wood .
already , there is plenty of cool stuff around to do with mobile phones .
among the companies chosen in o2 's annual ' 50 to watch ' list are firms that allow consumers to buy train tickets via sms -lrb- yourrail -rrb- , watch cctv footage of motorways -lrb- mxdata -rrb- , and even a company that allows businesses to catch rats wirelessly -lrb- wyless -rrb- .
net versus mobile taking number one slot in the list is yospace which allows operators such as o2 , vodafone , orange and 3 create spaces where customers can put and share their own content .
such services have captured the imagination of users , especially as operators such as 3 and o2 offer payouts to creators every time their video clip is downloaded .
3 's service seemetv has registered 12 million downloads since its launch and paid out £ 250,000 to contributors .
while there is obviously an appetite for such services , they could be overshadowed by more established internet brands as the recent deal between myspace and vodafone demonstrates .
yospace founder david springall is not worried about the net heavyweights .
" the difference between ourselves and the 400 pound gorillas of online is we understand the mobile space .
it is a very different medium , " he said .
" when contributors send in their content , we select the videos that go in the gallery .
it is a competitive environment rather than a soapbox for everyone , " he said .
for him , while the time is ripe for user-generated content on mobile phones , social networking is not ready to make the leap from the web to the handset .
others think that the march of web brands towards mobile is inevitable .
" these brands are lodged in peoples ' minds .
a whole generation of users have learnt about internet services that are always on , with guaranteed bandwidth and at a predictable cost , " said mr wood .
operators desperate to maintain control and make money out of what consumers do with their handsets need to learn some basic lessons , thinks bengt nordstrom , a mobile expert from swedish telecoms consultancy firm incode wireless .
" operators are worried about becoming mere bit pipes .
they want to retain control over content and brand but there is a growing realisation that that model does n't work well enough , " said mr nordstrom .
if the mobile industry wants find an application that captures the imagination in the way online brands such as ebay and myspace have , it needs to look at the way it operates .
" the mobile industry tries to decide what is good for the user while the internet encourages innovation and creativity from the ground up , " he said .
" it has to happen in mobile the same way as it does on the internet .
when you ask ' where are the corresponding companies for skype and google in the mobile world ? ' there are no good answers .
the mobile industry is realising that the net business model is better for fostering creativity and innovation , " he said .
asian market 3gsm is the ideal platform for mobile handset manufacturers to show off their wares and mr wood predicts that nokia will go big on location-based services , while motorola will talk up its linux-based operating system and lg will show off the phones it has developed in partnership with designer prada . "
wireless consumers have heard all about new high-end services that add to their monthly charges but they 're still beefing about niggling problems that detract from the user experience " bengt nordstrom , incode wireless although the show is bound to have plenty of devices set up for mobile tv , it may not be as big this year as last , predicts mike short , chairman of the mobile data association and vice president of research and development at o2 .
" the devices are becoming available but there are still problems not least to do with spectrum rights , " he said .
alongside the " regeneration of the industry into a world of data applications , " he thinks 3sgm will give more than a nod this year to countries more interested in basic functionality .
" more phones were connected in india in 2006 than the population of the uk .
it is time to acknowledge , address and learn from the asian influence , " he said .
whatever whiz-bang applications and devices are on show at 3gsm , it is important that the industry does not lose sight of real customer concerns , thinks mr nordstrom .
" battery life .
coverage holes .
confusing bills .
frustrating customer services .
wireless consumers have heard all about new high-end services that add to their monthly charges but they 're still beefing about niggling problems that detract from the user experience , " he said .
if 3gsm was run by consumers it is likely these issues would be higher up the agenda than they might be in barcelona .

user-generated content , mobile tv and location-based services are all likely to cause a buzz among the 60,000 visitors .
with one billion handsets sold last year , it is certainly in a healthy state but the majority of customers are still stuck in a talk and text world .
for ben wood , director at research firm ccs insight , this year 's conference will be the start of the journey to really bring the web to the mobile phone .
to succeed where earlier attempts have failed , will require the coming together of three crucial factors , he thinks .
" it is about more capable devices with a broadband experience and predictable pricing , " he said .
cool stuff flat-rate charging for data downloads is already happening - with 3 's bundled x-series service for example - and there will be a glut of handsets with better colour screens and more memory to persuade users to make the transition from voice to data .
also on show will be handsets that make use of a new standard - high-speed downlink packet access or hsdpa - which promises the broadband experience mr wood describes .
more phones were connected in india in 2006 than the population of the uk mike short , mobile data association available in high-end handsets by the end of the year , the technology may prove a good source of debate for the experts in barcelona but will mean very little to consumers .
" consumers should never have to talk about hsdpa .
this industry is too obsessed with technology and that needs to be taken out of the equation .
it should just be about cool stuff that people can do with their phones , " said mr wood .
already , there is plenty of cool stuff around to do with mobile phones .
among the companies chosen in o2 's annual ' 50 to watch ' list are firms that allow consumers to buy train tickets via sms -lrb- yourrail -rrb- , watch cctv footage of motorways -lrb- mxdata -rrb- , and even a company that allows businesses to catch rats wirelessly -lrb- wyless -rrb- .
net versus mobile taking number one slot in the list is yospace which allows operators such as o2 , vodafone , orange and 3 create spaces where customers can put and share their own content .
such services have captured the imagination of users , especially as operators such as 3 and o2 offer payouts to creators every time their video clip is downloaded .
3 's service seemetv has registered 12 million downloads since its launch and paid out £ 250,000 to contributors .

is social networking ready for mobile ?
" the difference between ourselves and the 400 pound gorillas of online is we understand the mobile space .
it is a very different medium , " he said .
" when contributors send in their content , we select the videos that go in the gallery .
it is a competitive environment rather than a soapbox for everyone , " he said .
for him , while the time is ripe for user-generated content on mobile phones , social networking is not ready to make the leap from the web to the handset .
others think that the march of web brands towards mobile is inevitable .
" these brands are lodged in peoples ' minds .
a whole generation of users have learnt about internet services that are always on , with guaranteed bandwidth and at a predictable cost , " said mr wood .
operators desperate to maintain control and make money out of what consumers do with their handsets need to learn some basic lessons , thinks bengt nordstrom , a mobile expert from swedish telecoms consultancy firm incode wireless .
" operators are worried about becoming mere bit pipes .
they want to retain control over content and brand but there is a growing realisation that that model does n't work well enough , " said mr nordstrom .
if the mobile industry wants find an application that captures the imagination in the way online brands such as ebay and myspace have , it needs to look at the way it operates .
" the mobile industry tries to decide what is good for the user while the internet encourages innovation and creativity from the ground up , " he said .
" it has to happen in mobile the same way as it does on the internet .
when you ask ' where are the corresponding companies for skype and google in the mobile world ? ' there are no good answers .
the mobile industry is realising that the net business model is better for fostering creativity and innovation , " he said .
asian market 3gsm is the ideal platform for mobile handset manufacturers to show off their wares and mr wood predicts that nokia will go big on location-based services , while motorola will talk up its linux-based operating system and lg will show off the phones it has developed in partnership with designer prada .

user-generated content , mobile tv and location-based services are all likely to cause a buzz among the 60,000 visitors .
with one billion handsets sold last year , it is certainly in a healthy state but the majority of customers are still stuck in a talk and text world .
for ben wood , director at research firm ccs insight , this year 's conference will be the start of the journey to really bring the web to the mobile phone .
to succeed where earlier attempts have failed , will require the coming together of three crucial factors , he thinks .
" it is about more capable devices with a broadband experience and predictable pricing , " he said .
cool stuff flat-rate charging for data downloads is already happening - with 3 's bundled x-series service for example - and there will be a glut of handsets with better colour screens and more memory to persuade users to make the transition from voice to data .
also on show will be handsets that make use of a new standard - high-speed downlink packet access or hsdpa - which promises the broadband experience mr wood describes .
more phones were connected in india in 2006 than the population of the uk mike short , mobile data association available in high-end handsets by the end of the year , the technology may prove a good source of debate for the experts in barcelona but will mean very little to consumers .
" consumers should never have to talk about hsdpa .
this industry is too obsessed with technology and that needs to be taken out of the equation .
it should just be about cool stuff that people can do with their phones , " said mr wood .
already , there is plenty of cool stuff around to do with mobile phones .
among the companies chosen in o2 's annual ' 50 to watch ' list are firms that allow consumers to buy train tickets via sms -lrb- yourrail -rrb- , watch cctv footage of motorways -lrb- mxdata -rrb- , and even a company that allows businesses to catch rats wirelessly -lrb- wyless -rrb- .
net versus mobile taking number one slot in the list is yospace which allows operators such as o2 , vodafone , orange and 3 create spaces where customers can put and share their own content .
such services have captured the imagination of users , especially as operators such as 3 and o2 offer payouts to creators every time their video clip is downloaded .
3 's service seemetv has registered 12 million downloads since its launch and paid out £ 250,000 to contributors .
while there is obviously an appetite for such services , they could be overshadowed by more established internet brands as the recent deal between myspace and vodafone demonstrates .
yospace founder david springall is not worried about the net heavyweights .
is social networking ready for mobile ?
" the difference between ourselves and the 400 pound gorillas of online is we understand the mobile space .
it is a very different medium , " he said .
" when contributors send in their content , we select the videos that go in the gallery .
it is a competitive environment rather than a soapbox for everyone , " he said .
for him , while the time is ripe for user-generated content on mobile phones , social networking is not ready to make the leap from the web to the handset .
others think that the march of web brands towards mobile is inevitable .
" these brands are lodged in peoples ' minds .
a whole generation of users have learnt about internet services that are always on , with guaranteed bandwidth and at a predictable cost , " said mr wood .
operators desperate to maintain control and make money out of what consumers do with their handsets need to learn some basic lessons , thinks bengt nordstrom , a mobile expert from swedish telecoms consultancy firm incode wireless .
" operators are worried about becoming mere bit pipes .
they want to retain control over content and brand but there is a growing realisation that that model does n't work well enough , " said mr nordstrom .
if the mobile industry wants find an application that captures the imagination in the way online brands such as ebay and myspace have , it needs to look at the way it operates .
" the mobile industry tries to decide what is good for the user while the internet encourages innovation and creativity from the ground up , " he said .
" it has to happen in mobile the same way as it does on the internet .
when you ask ' where are the corresponding companies for skype and google in the mobile world ? ' there are no good answers .
the mobile industry is realising that the net business model is better for fostering creativity and innovation , " he said .
asian market 3gsm is the ideal platform for mobile handset manufacturers to show off their wares and mr wood predicts that nokia will go big on location-based services , while motorola will talk up its linux-based operating system and lg will show off the phones it has developed in partnership with designer prada .
wireless consumers have heard all about new high-end services that add to their monthly charges but they 're still beefing about niggling problems that detract from the user experience bengt nordstrom , incode wireless although the show is bound to have plenty of devices set up for mobile tv , it may not be as big this year as last , predicts mike short , chairman of the mobile data association and vice president of research and development at o2 .

alongside the " regeneration of the industry into a world of data applications , " he thinks 3sgm will give more than a nod this year to countries more interested in basic functionality .

user-generated content , mobile tv and location-based services are all likely to cause a buzz among the 60,000 visitors .
with one billion handsets sold last year , it is certainly in a healthy state but the majority of customers are still stuck in a talk and text world .
for ben wood , director at research firm ccs insight , this year 's conference will be the start of the journey to really bring the web to the mobile phone .
to succeed where earlier attempts have failed , will require the coming together of three crucial factors , he thinks .
" it is about more capable devices with a broadband experience and predictable pricing , " he said .
cool stuff flat-rate charging for data downloads is already happening - with 3 's bundled x-series service for example - and there will be a glut of handsets with better colour screens and more memory to persuade users to make the transition from voice to data .
also on show will be handsets that make use of a new standard - high-speed downlink packet access or hsdpa - which promises the broadband experience mr wood describes .
more phones were connected in india in 2006 than the population of the uk mike short , mobile data association available in high-end handsets by the end of the year , the technology may prove a good source of debate for the experts in barcelona but will mean very little to consumers .
" consumers should never have to talk about hsdpa .
this industry is too obsessed with technology and that needs to be taken out of the equation .
it should just be about cool stuff that people can do with their phones , " said mr wood .
already , there is plenty of cool stuff around to do with mobile phones .
among the companies chosen in o2 's annual ' 50 to watch ' list are firms that allow consumers to buy train tickets via sms -lrb- yourrail -rrb- , watch cctv footage of motorways -lrb- mxdata -rrb- , and even a company that allows businesses to catch rats wirelessly -lrb- wyless -rrb- .
net versus mobile taking number one slot in the list is yospace which allows operators such as o2 , vodafone , orange and 3 create spaces where customers can put and share their own content .
such services have captured the imagination of users , especially as operators such as 3 and o2 offer payouts to creators every time their video clip is downloaded .
3 's service seemetv has registered 12 million downloads since its launch and paid out £ 250,000 to contributors .
while there is obviously an appetite for such services , they could be overshadowed by more established internet brands as the recent deal between myspace and vodafone demonstrates .
yospace founder david springall is not worried about the net heavyweights .
is social networking ready for mobile ?
" the difference between ourselves and the 400 pound gorillas of online is we understand the mobile space .
it is a very different medium , " he said .
" when contributors send in their content , we select the videos that go in the gallery .
it is a competitive environment rather than a soapbox for everyone , " he said .
for him , while the time is ripe for user-generated content on mobile phones , social networking is not ready to make the leap from the web to the handset .
others think that the march of web brands towards mobile is inevitable .
" these brands are lodged in peoples ' minds .
a whole generation of users have learnt about internet services that are always on , with guaranteed bandwidth and at a predictable cost , " said mr wood .
operators desperate to maintain control and make money out of what consumers do with their handsets need to learn some basic lessons , thinks bengt nordstrom , a mobile expert from swedish telecoms consultancy firm incode wireless .
" operators are worried about becoming mere bit pipes .
they want to retain control over content and brand but there is a growing realisation that that model does n't work well enough , " said mr nordstrom .
if the mobile industry wants find an application that captures the imagination in the way online brands such as ebay and myspace have , it needs to look at the way it operates .
" the mobile industry tries to decide what is good for the user while the internet encourages innovation and creativity from the ground up , " he said .
" it has to happen in mobile the same way as it does on the internet .
when you ask ' where are the corresponding companies for skype and google in the mobile world ? ' there are no good answers .
the mobile industry is realising that the net business model is better for fostering creativity and innovation , " he said .
asian market 3gsm is the ideal platform for mobile handset manufacturers to show off their wares and mr wood predicts that nokia will go big on location-based services , while motorola will talk up its linux-based operating system and lg will show off the phones it has developed in partnership with designer prada .
wireless consumers have heard all about new high-end services that add to their monthly charges but they 're still beefing about niggling problems that detract from the user experience bengt nordstrom , incode wireless although the show is bound to have plenty of devices set up for mobile tv , it may not be as big this year as last , predicts mike short , chairman of the mobile data association and vice president of research and development at o2 .
" the devices are becoming available but there are still problems not least to do with spectrum rights , " he said .
alongside the " regeneration of the industry into a world of data applications , " he thinks 3sgm will give more than a nod this year to countries more interested in basic functionality .
" more phones were connected in india in 2006 than the population of the uk .
it is time to acknowledge , address and learn from the asian influence , " he said .
whatever whiz-bang applications and devices are on show at 3gsm , it is important that the industry does not lose sight of real customer concerns , thinks mr nordstrom .
" battery life .
coverage holes .
confusing bills .
frustrating customer services .
wireless consumers have heard all about new high-end services that add to their monthly charges but they 're still beefing about niggling problems that detract from the user experience , " he said .

why do school holidays send some parents into the depths of despair .
nuala mccann reveals why co-ordinating children 's mid-term times can be a nightmare .
school 's out , but who 's at home ?
next week is mid-term ... for some .
i 'm off on holiday , because my son 's school is off for the week and , therefore , he needs someone home to look after him .
it might have been lovely .
i 'd like to have had a week in the sun as a family .
my husband , a teacher , can only be off when school dictates .
he , also , has a february week off .
his school is in the same city , a matter of a few miles from my son 's school , but his holiday is the following week .
it does not make sense .
it is precious time wasted .
in other european countries , school holidays are coordinated so that children living in the same area are off at the same time and children living in another region are off at a different time .
this ensures that there are rarely traffic gridlocks on the roads and le petit nicolas or la petite sophie always has elbow room on the nursery slopes because the mountains are never jam packed .
it sounds civilised , in a very french way .
is n't it time that schools in northern ireland got together and coordinated their holidays in a similar fashion ?
there 's an old joke that goes : " what are the two best things about being a teacher ? "
school holidays rarely leave parents feeling euphoric the answer is : " july and august " .
only those who have suffered a form three class every friday afternoon for a solid year appreciate the true horror of raging teenage hormones .
just how much baying at the school door can 13-year-olds do on a friday afternoon ?
teachers enjoy long holidays , but they have to pay up for the privilege .
no sooner has the caretaker clumped the padlock on the playground gates - at mid term , easter or in the summer - than the pound signs roll in the travel agents ' eyes and the price of a week in the sun takes such a sudden hike that you do n't need the heat to break out in a sweat .
pity the parents too .
the cost of sticking rigidly to holidays as laid down by the schools can double the price of a break .
naturally , it is cheaper to take children out of the classroom than to wait for the set holidays .
a survey published in the republic of ireland last week found that one in six parents took their children out of school to go on holidays .
almost half do so for financial reasons , the report , commissioned by the national educational welfare board , found .
a few years ago , travel agents in england were advised to warn parents about the rules governing how much time out children can have .
heading for the sun as a family at half term can be difficult truancy spot fines of £ 100 could apply if the rules were broken , the then education minister ivan lewis warned .
a recent high court ruling in england stated that if you take your children out of school to go on holiday , you could be prosecuted or face a fine or even three months in prison .
but would a £ 100 fine deter families who could save several hundred pounds by booking outside peak times ?
the price is just one issue .
school holidays rarely leave parents feeling euphoric .
children 's time off proves a major headache for couples trying to hold down two separate full-time jobs .
in northern ireland , anxious parents queue for hours to get their children into play schemes for the summer months of july and august .
they research drama clubs , art clubs , music clubs - they send them to week-long tennis courses and golf courses -anything to fill in the time , anything to find summer child care .
children who do n't enjoy such large group activities may have to grin and bear it .
summer grandparents are often called in to help out .
and , when all else fails , father and mother split up the long hot summer .
" when it comes to the summer , it is a major strategic puzzle that i have to work out , " one mother explained .
" that requires using what child care i already have , calling on any relatives i know , any student who is off for a few days and signing the children up for any summer camp i can get my hands on .
" i want my children to be stimulated and to enjoy exercise .
but it costs twice the amount it does for the rest of the year . "
another parent said that sometimes desperate situations call for equally desperate solutions .
" one of us takes the month of july off and the other takes august .
it is not ideal , as we 're not off together and we do n't enjoy a true family holiday , but at least the child care is covered , " she said .
so much for family life .

the cost of sticking rigidly to holidays as laid down by the schools can double the price of a break .
naturally , it is cheaper to take children out of the classroom than to wait for the set holidays .
a survey published in the republic of ireland last week found that one in six parents took their children out of school to go on holidays .
almost half do so for financial reasons , the report , commissioned by the national educational welfare board , found .
a few years ago , travel agents in england were advised to warn parents about the rules governing how much time out children can have .
heading for the sun as a family at half term can be difficult truancy spot fines of £ 100 could apply if the rules were broken , the then education minister ivan lewis warned .
a recent high court ruling in england stated that if you take your children out of school to go on holiday , you could be prosecuted or face a fine or even three months in prison .
but would a £ 100 fine deter families who could save several hundred pounds by booking outside peak times ?
the price is just one issue .
school holidays rarely leave parents feeling euphoric .
children 's time off proves a major headache for couples trying to hold down two separate full-time jobs .
in northern ireland , anxious parents queue for hours to get their children into play schemes for the summer months of july and august .
they research drama clubs , art clubs , music clubs - they send them to week-long tennis courses and golf courses -anything to fill in the time , anything to find summer child care .
children who do n't enjoy such large group activities may have to grin and bear it .
summer grandparents are often called in to help out .
and , when all else fails , father and mother split up the long hot summer .
" when it comes to the summer , it is a major strategic puzzle that i have to work out , " one mother explained .
" that requires using what child care i already have , calling on any relatives i know , any student who is off for a few days and signing the children up for any summer camp i can get my hands on .
" i want my children to be stimulated and to enjoy exercise .
but it costs twice the amount it does for the rest of the year . "
another parent said that sometimes desperate situations call for equally desperate solutions .
" one of us takes the month of july off and the other takes august .
it is not ideal , as we 're not off together and we do n't enjoy a true family holiday , but at least the child care is covered , " she said .
so much for family life .
