program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 03.06.2007 debate over new mosque in cologne heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne still has room for a minaret germany 's turkish islamic union is housed in a dilapidated factory in the ehrenfeld district of cologne .
controversially , the building is now set to be revamped as a mosque .
one critic has even received death threats . the site occupies the corner of two major roads in the city of cologne .
on one side is a 12-storey high building housing an estate agency , on the other are the deutsche telekom offices . nestling next to a petrol station is a run-down former factory - gray , crumbling and architecturally unassuming . since 1984 , this has been the spiritual home of some 3 million muslims in germany . but they 're finally about to get an upgrade .
the turkish islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- is planning to use its own money to renovate the headquarters and build a fully fledged mosque complete with two minarets , as well as a cultural center for the community . long overdue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany make life hard for its muslims ?
predictably , the plan has divided the city of cologne .
opposition is rife , but others have leapt to ditib 's defense , saying it is high time that cologne 's 120,000 muslims had a proper place of worship . " at the moment the situation is terrible , " said bekir alboga , who is in charge of inter-religious and inter-cultural co-operation at ditib .
" people pray out here in the car park , even in winter when it 's cold , snowing or raining , because it is a very small prayer room .
and where are muslims meant to pray , while christians or jews are in their pretty , representative houses of god ?
should our muslims really pray on tarmac in the blazing summer sun ? " right-wing resistance but not everyone in cologne shares alboga 's point of view , not least the radical right-wing citizens ' movement pro-cologne .
members of this group point out that there are some 45 mosques in cologne already - based mainly in abandoned factories , warehouses and shops - and that these fulfill the muslim community 's needs . the group 's leader , manfred rouhs , said that a large muslim cultural center will serve to encourage a separated turkish society rather than an integrated one . " these people only speak turkish , " he said .
" they see no need to learn german .
we think that 's the wrong way , and because of this we are critical of the project . " he said he feels there is a key difference between muslims gathering for worship in mosques and jews in synagogues in germany . " jews speak german , and they 've lived in germany since several hundred years , " rouhs said .
" because of this it 's no problem . " debate in jewish community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's synagogue in oranienburger straße in fact , the issue has also split the jewish community . jewish writer and journalist ralph giordano has come in for angry criticism within the community for taking a stance against the mosque on the grounds that it belies what he calls germany 's " failed integration . " what germany has seen instead is a " clash of two completely different cultures , " he said in the stuttgarter nachrichten . " the question is whether these cultures can ever be reconciled , " he said . his comments have drawn death threats from muslims , said giordano . " what kind of a state are we in that i can face a fatwa in germany ? " he asked . his colleague rafael seligmann told the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung that giordano 's position harks back to his childhood . " his persecution as a child under the nazis has eaten away at his soul , " he said . he also explained that many jews in germany are concerned by radical islam 's calls to destroy israel but insisted that giordano should not make his fears of anti-semitism an excuse to strip muslim citizens of their rights . public opinion pro cologne , meanwhile , launched an internet campaign to mobilize as many people as possible to attend an open forum in late may discussing the mosque . but when the meeting took place recently in a school assembly hall , a stone 's throw from the eventual site , the majority were more sympathetic to the mosque than to pro cologne . " for 20 years , thousands of people have been forced to say their prayers in an old factory building and i do n't think this is right , " said one local . " i think it 's very late that we start this process and i 'm very happy that we 're doing it now , " said another .
" i think it 's very good for cologne , and it 's very good for ehrenfeld ! " architect paul böhm is in charge of plans for the new mosque .
he told the crowd that despite the public uproar , he has no regrets taking the job … " i am a citizen of this town , and every day i see this old building which is nearly empty , but only a small room in the courtyard is used by muslims for praying , " he said .
" i 've always thought we need to find someone to build a real mosque for these people .
i 've wanted to help for a along time , and now i have the chance . " tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new mosque could be a new tourist atttraction for cologne citizens had their chance to put forward their complaints and concerns about the planned mosque , which focused mainly on traffic congestion on the already busy neighboring streets , and the height of the planned minarets . others simply took the floor to say how happy they were that cologne would finally have a proper mosque , adding that racism was not welcome in their multicultural city . marlis brederhorst , cologne 's official representative for integration was confident that the mosque would do the city good . " it 's wonderful , " she said .
" cologne is a city of churches , and its most beautiful buildings are churches .
now we 'll have another tourist attraction , and i think it 's good for integration for the muslims in cologne because this will be a mosque they can be proud of .

controversially , the building is now set to be revamped as a mosque .
one critic has even received death threats . the site occupies the corner of two major roads in the city of cologne .
on one side is a 12-storey high building housing an estate agency , on the other are the deutsche telekom offices . nestling next to a petrol station is a run-down former factory - gray , crumbling and architecturally unassuming . since 1984 , this has been the spiritual home of some 3 million muslims in germany . but they 're finally about to get an upgrade .
the turkish islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- is planning to use its own money to renovate the headquarters and build a fully fledged mosque complete with two minarets , as well as a cultural center for the community . long overdue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany make life hard for its muslims ?
predictably , the plan has divided the city of cologne .
opposition is rife , but others have leapt to ditib 's defense , saying it is high time that cologne 's 120,000 muslims had a proper place of worship . " at the moment the situation is terrible , " said bekir alboga , who is in charge of inter-religious and inter-cultural co-operation at ditib .
" people pray out here in the car park , even in winter when it 's cold , snowing or raining , because it is a very small prayer room .
and where are muslims meant to pray , while christians or jews are in their pretty , representative houses of god ?
should our muslims really pray on tarmac in the blazing summer sun ? " right-wing resistance but not everyone in cologne shares alboga 's point of view , not least the radical right-wing citizens ' movement pro-cologne .
members of this group point out that there are some 45 mosques in cologne already - based mainly in abandoned factories , warehouses and shops - and that these fulfill the muslim community 's needs . the group 's leader , manfred rouhs , said that a large muslim cultural center will serve to encourage a separated turkish society rather than an integrated one . " these people only speak turkish , " he said .
" they see no need to learn german .
we think that 's the wrong way , and because of this we are critical of the project . " he said he feels there is a key difference between muslims gathering for worship in mosques and jews in synagogues in germany . " jews speak german , and they 've lived in germany since several hundred years , " rouhs said .
" because of this it 's no problem . " debate in jewish community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's synagogue in oranienburger straße in fact , the issue has also split the jewish community . jewish writer and journalist ralph giordano has come in for angry criticism within the community for taking a stance against the mosque on the grounds that it belies what he calls germany 's " failed integration . " what germany has seen instead is a " clash of two completely different cultures , " he said in the stuttgarter nachrichten . " the question is whether these cultures can ever be reconciled , " he said . his comments have drawn death threats from muslims , said giordano . " what kind of a state are we in that i can face a fatwa in germany ? " he asked . his colleague rafael seligmann told the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung that giordano 's position harks back to his childhood . " his persecution as a child under the nazis has eaten away at his soul , " he said . he also explained that many jews in germany are concerned by radical islam 's calls to destroy israel but insisted that giordano should not make his fears of anti-semitism an excuse to strip muslim citizens of their rights . public opinion pro cologne , meanwhile , launched an internet campaign to mobilize as many people as possible to attend an open forum in late may discussing the mosque . but when the meeting took place recently in a school assembly hall , a stone 's throw from the eventual site , the majority were more sympathetic to the mosque than to pro cologne . " for 20 years , thousands of people have been forced to say their prayers in an old factory building and i do n't think this is right , " said one local .

but the trend is unlikely to continue on this scale once the meeting is over . since the beginning of the year , the group has received around 100 new membership applications a month .
in may , this even leapt to 500 - thanks , in part , to the police raids against g8 opponents in germany , the restrictions on demonstrations and other controversial measures that have hit the headlines .
attac has just under 18,000 members in germany and approximately 90,000 worldwide .
influx of members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac has grown fast in response to the g8 summit this wave of recruitment is clearly a result of the mobilization of the group ahead of next week 's summit .
since last autumn , the network has organized more than 1,000 discussion meetings in germany with the aim of mobilizing protesters .
attac has also organized events designed to give demonstrators practical training for the major rally , which took place on saturday in rostock .
in so-called handicraft workshops , members were making banners and dummies .
in action sessions , they 've been practising peaceful sit-down blockades .
g8 boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in attac workshops people can learn to make cardboard cut-outs like these ones " since the start of the year we 've been almost exclusively concentrating on the g8 , " said the attac spokeswoman frauke distelrath .
this growth spurt follows a period of crisis .
the german magazine stern reported last year that more and more people were leaving the organization .
but even in 2006 , the lowest point for the organization since it was set up in 2000 , there was a net gain of 10 members a month .
this is a situation that most political parties , unions and churches can only dream of . political scientist claus leggewie and author of the book " die globalisierung und ihre gegner " -lrb- globalization and its critics -rrb- described attac 's experience as a " normal growth crisis . "
he said the network was experiencing a very strong influx of members that would inevitably die back .
growth will slow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac includes conservatives like heiner geissler as well as left-wingers " social movements can not afford to be in a state of perpetual mobilization , " leggewie said .
" it will be left to a few activists to ensure stability and continuity . "
but he said the anti-globalization movement had been spared any real downturn because of the regular summit meetings that they can mobilize against . " criticism of globalization is a cross-party theme that affects almost all areas of politics - so the movement should also last longer than movements devoted to single causes that run out of steam at some point , " said ansgar klein , the editor of the research journal " neue soziale bewegungen " -lrb- new social movements -rrb- .
he thinks it is very unlikely that the demands of the globalization critics will be fulfilled in the near future . but the movement has made its mark on the g8 agenda with themes such as climate change and africa .
very recently , german chancellor angela merkel , who currently holds the six-month rotating presidency , said the summit was about " giving a human face to globalization " .
she also expressly welcomed the planned actions and protests .
mainstream response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel spoke about giving a human aspect to globalization in the lead-up to the summit " if globalization critique has also been taken up by the german chancellor then we will have to watch how these avowals are turned into practice , " said peter wahl , a member of attac 's co-ordination council .
he said that it would be important in the future to focus on concrete conceptual work . that could be more difficult than organizing isolated campaigns or mobilizing protest against a summit .
some 120 - very diverse - organizations belong to the network .
the spectrum spans church groups , environmental groups and unions .
attac counts both the former cdu general secretary heiner geissler and oskar lafontaine , of the left party , among its members . when the summit is over , the members will have more time to devote to working on their political program - another big project such as opposition to the g8 summit is not presently in sight .
the boom , currently being experienced by the organization , is likely to come to an end then , too .
activists like peter wahl are taking this in their stride .
" that 's just the normal rise and fall of the political cycle , " he said . dennis stute -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de almost 1,000 hurt after anti-g8 protests in germany police and protest organizers sunday laid the blame for the riot that erupted during an anti-g8 rally in the german port of rostock on groups bent on violence that had infiltrated the largely peaceful demonstors .

influx of members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac has grown fast in response to the g8 summit this wave of recruitment is clearly a result of the mobilization of the group ahead of next week 's summit .
since last autumn , the network has organized more than 1,000 discussion meetings in germany with the aim of mobilizing protesters .
attac has also organized events designed to give demonstrators practical training for the major rally , which took place on saturday in rostock .
in so-called handicraft workshops , members were making banners and dummies .
in action sessions , they 've been practising peaceful sit-down blockades .
g8 boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in attac workshops people can learn to make cardboard cut-outs like these ones " since the start of the year we 've been almost exclusively concentrating on the g8 , " said the attac spokeswoman frauke distelrath .
this growth spurt follows a period of crisis .
the german magazine stern reported last year that more and more people were leaving the organization .
but even in 2006 , the lowest point for the organization since it was set up in 2000 , there was a net gain of 10 members a month .
this is a situation that most political parties , unions and churches can only dream of . political scientist claus leggewie and author of the book " die globalisierung und ihre gegner " -lrb- globalization and its critics -rrb- described attac 's experience as a " normal growth crisis . "
he said the network was experiencing a very strong influx of members that would inevitably die back .
growth will slow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac includes conservatives like heiner geissler as well as left-wingers " social movements can not afford to be in a state of perpetual mobilization , " leggewie said .
" it will be left to a few activists to ensure stability and continuity . "
but he said the anti-globalization movement had been spared any real downturn because of the regular summit meetings that they can mobilize against . " criticism of globalization is a cross-party theme that affects almost all areas of politics - so the movement should also last longer than movements devoted to single causes that run out of steam at some point , " said ansgar klein , the editor of the research journal " neue soziale bewegungen " -lrb- new social movements -rrb- .
he thinks it is very unlikely that the demands of the globalization critics will be fulfilled in the near future . but the movement has made its mark on the g8 agenda with themes such as climate change and africa .
very recently , german chancellor angela merkel , who currently holds the six-month rotating presidency , said the summit was about " giving a human face to globalization " .
she also expressly welcomed the planned actions and protests .
mainstream response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel spoke about giving a human aspect to globalization in the lead-up to the summit " if globalization critique has also been taken up by the german chancellor then we will have to watch how these avowals are turned into practice , " said peter wahl , a member of attac 's co-ordination council .
he said that it would be important in the future to focus on concrete conceptual work . that could be more difficult than organizing isolated campaigns or mobilizing protest against a summit .
some 120 - very diverse - organizations belong to the network .
the spectrum spans church groups , environmental groups and unions .
attac counts both the former cdu general secretary heiner geissler and oskar lafontaine , of the left party , among its members . when the summit is over , the members will have more time to devote to working on their political program - another big project such as opposition to the g8 summit is not presently in sight .
the boom , currently being experienced by the organization , is likely to come to an end then , too .
activists like peter wahl are taking this in their stride .

lavrov shrugged off american insistence that its plan to deploy missile defense hardware in poland and the czech republic poses no threat , casting it as an attempt to encircle russia militarily .
" if strategic components of the american arsenal appear in europe near our borders , we are obliged to ... cut off potential threats from that deployment , " lavrov said in comments broadcast on the state-run television channel vesti-24 .
a threat to russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials say the system poses no threat to russia the us plan " wonderfully fits the overall picture of american global anti-missile defense , which according to our analysis - just look at the map - is being deployed along russia 's perimeter , and also china 's , incidentally . "
after repeated warnings from russia that the us proposals would set off a new arms race , moscow tested a new multi-warhead missile last week that putin said was a direct response to us actions .
and in his boldest remarks to date on the issue , the russian president has warned that russia would once again target europe with missiles like it did during the cold war .
" the anti-missile shield is part of a nuclear system that protects american territory , " putin said in an interview with newspapers from the group of eight industrialized nations .
" for the first time in history , elements of it are being moved to europe .
" we will get new targets in europe " " if the us nuclear potential extends across the european territory , we will get new targets in europe , " he said .
" it will then be up to our military experts to identify which targets will be aimed by ballistic missiles and which ones will be aimed by cruise missiles . "
the interview was due to be published on monday but pre-released by germany 's der spiegel magazine .
putin and his peers are meeting for a three-day g8 summit which begins in germany on wednesday .
" we want to re-balance the defense instruments with more efficient offensive equipment but we know that this could lead to a renewed arms race for which we are , however , not responsible , " putin said .
tensions over the plan have helped send relations between the two states to levels many analysts say have n't been seen since the cold war .
nato-russian cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can nato help diffuse the situation ?
in spite of the sharp words , lavrov pointed to a previous avenue of russian cooperation with the west on missile defence , saying : " it would be better to resume work within the framework of the nato-russia council on creating theater missile defense . "
developing a missile defense system to protect deployed troops from missile attacks is one of several joint programs by the nato-russia council , and is scheduled to be completed by 2010 .
washington says the central european shield , which foresees 10 missile interceptors in poland and radar in the czech republic , would protect against potential threats from states such as iran or north korea .
russia has responded with skepticism , suggesting the shield 's real goal is reducing russia 's military strength . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin lashes out at us , eu as russia tests missile russian president putin warned tuesday that a planned us missile defense shield would make europe a " powder keg " and lashed out at his eu critics .
russia 's military meanwhile successfully tested a new ballistic missile .
-lrb- 29.05.2007 -rrb- us and czech republic discuss missile shield us negotiators launched a second round of talks in prague tuesday over the location of a tracking radar station in the czech republic as part of an expanded missile defense shield in europe .

manfred stenner of the action alliance said police had maintained a " de-escalatory stance . "
but monty schaedel , spokesman for the rostock action alliance , called the police response " clumsy and unprofessional . "
police attributed the violence to 2,000 organized elements .
they put the total attendance at the rally at up to 30,000 , while the organizers said more than twice that number had participated .
the protest was aimed at the g8 summit scheduled to begin wednesday at the resort of heiligendamm some 25 kilometers -lrb- 15.5 miles -rrb- away .

but the trend is unlikely to continue on this scale once the meeting is over . since the beginning of the year , the group has received around 100 new membership applications a month .
in may , this even leapt to 500 - thanks , in part , to the police raids against g8 opponents in germany , the restrictions on demonstrations and other controversial measures that have hit the headlines .
attac has just under 18,000 members in germany and approximately 90,000 worldwide .
influx of members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac has grown fast in response to the g8 summit this wave of recruitment is clearly a result of the mobilization of the group ahead of next week 's summit .
since last autumn , the network has organized more than 1,000 discussion meetings in germany with the aim of mobilizing protesters .
attac has also organized events designed to give demonstrators practical training for the major rally , which took place on saturday in rostock .
in so-called handicraft workshops , members were making banners and dummies .
in action sessions , they 've been practising peaceful sit-down blockades .
g8 boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in attac workshops people can learn to make cardboard cut-outs like these ones " since the start of the year we 've been almost exclusively concentrating on the g8 , " said the attac spokeswoman frauke distelrath .
this growth spurt follows a period of crisis .
the german magazine stern reported last year that more and more people were leaving the organization .
but even in 2006 , the lowest point for the organization since it was set up in 2000 , there was a net gain of 10 members a month .
this is a situation that most political parties , unions and churches can only dream of . political scientist claus leggewie and author of the book " die globalisierung und ihre gegner " -lrb- globalization and its critics -rrb- described attac 's experience as a " normal growth crisis . "
he said the network was experiencing a very strong influx of members that would inevitably die back .
growth will slow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac includes conservatives like heiner geissler as well as left-wingers " social movements can not afford to be in a state of perpetual mobilization , " leggewie said .
" it will be left to a few activists to ensure stability and continuity . "
but he said the anti-globalization movement had been spared any real downturn because of the regular summit meetings that they can mobilize against . " criticism of globalization is a cross-party theme that affects almost all areas of politics - so the movement should also last longer than movements devoted to single causes that run out of steam at some point , " said ansgar klein , the editor of the research journal " neue soziale bewegungen " -lrb- new social movements -rrb- .
he thinks it is very unlikely that the demands of the globalization critics will be fulfilled in the near future . but the movement has made its mark on the g8 agenda with themes such as climate change and africa .
very recently , german chancellor angela merkel , who currently holds the six-month rotating presidency , said the summit was about " giving a human face to globalization " .
she also expressly welcomed the planned actions and protests .
mainstream response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel spoke about giving a human aspect to globalization in the lead-up to the summit " if globalization critique has also been taken up by the german chancellor then we will have to watch how these avowals are turned into practice , " said peter wahl , a member of attac 's co-ordination council .
he said that it would be important in the future to focus on concrete conceptual work . that could be more difficult than organizing isolated campaigns or mobilizing protest against a summit .
some 120 - very diverse - organizations belong to the network .
the spectrum spans church groups , environmental groups and unions .
attac counts both the former cdu general secretary heiner geissler and oskar lafontaine , of the left party , among its members . when the summit is over , the members will have more time to devote to working on their political program - another big project such as opposition to the g8 summit is not presently in sight .
the boom , currently being experienced by the organization , is likely to come to an end then , too .
activists like peter wahl are taking this in their stride .
" that 's just the normal rise and fall of the political cycle , " he said . dennis stute -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de almost 1,000 hurt after anti-g8 protests in germany police and protest organizers sunday laid the blame for the riot that erupted during an anti-g8 rally in the german port of rostock on groups bent on violence that had infiltrated the largely peaceful demonstors .
-lrb- 03.06.2007 -rrb- " a new day is dawning for globalization critics " around 100,000 demonstrators are expected at the g8 summit in june .

controversially , the building is now set to be revamped as a mosque .
one critic has even received death threats . the site occupies the corner of two major roads in the city of cologne .
on one side is a 12-storey high building housing an estate agency , on the other are the deutsche telekom offices . nestling next to a petrol station is a run-down former factory - gray , crumbling and architecturally unassuming . since 1984 , this has been the spiritual home of some 3 million muslims in germany . but they 're finally about to get an upgrade .
the turkish islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- is planning to use its own money to renovate the headquarters and build a fully fledged mosque complete with two minarets , as well as a cultural center for the community . long overdue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany make life hard for its muslims ?
predictably , the plan has divided the city of cologne .
opposition is rife , but others have leapt to ditib 's defense , saying it is high time that cologne 's 120,000 muslims had a proper place of worship . " at the moment the situation is terrible , " said bekir alboga , who is in charge of inter-religious and inter-cultural co-operation at ditib .
" people pray out here in the car park , even in winter when it 's cold , snowing or raining , because it is a very small prayer room .
and where are muslims meant to pray , while christians or jews are in their pretty , representative houses of god ?
should our muslims really pray on tarmac in the blazing summer sun ? " right-wing resistance but not everyone in cologne shares alboga 's point of view , not least the radical right-wing citizens ' movement pro-cologne .
members of this group point out that there are some 45 mosques in cologne already - based mainly in abandoned factories , warehouses and shops - and that these fulfill the muslim community 's needs . the group 's leader , manfred rouhs , said that a large muslim cultural center will serve to encourage a separated turkish society rather than an integrated one . " these people only speak turkish , " he said .
" they see no need to learn german .
we think that 's the wrong way , and because of this we are critical of the project . " he said he feels there is a key difference between muslims gathering for worship in mosques and jews in synagogues in germany . " jews speak german , and they 've lived in germany since several hundred years , " rouhs said .
" because of this it 's no problem . " debate in jewish community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's synagogue in oranienburger straße in fact , the issue has also split the jewish community . jewish writer and journalist ralph giordano has come in for angry criticism within the community for taking a stance against the mosque on the grounds that it belies what he calls germany 's " failed integration . " what germany has seen instead is a " clash of two completely different cultures , " he said in the stuttgarter nachrichten . " the question is whether these cultures can ever be reconciled , " he said . his comments have drawn death threats from muslims , said giordano . " what kind of a state are we in that i can face a fatwa in germany ? " he asked . his colleague rafael seligmann told the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung that giordano 's position harks back to his childhood . " his persecution as a child under the nazis has eaten away at his soul , " he said . he also explained that many jews in germany are concerned by radical islam 's calls to destroy israel but insisted that giordano should not make his fears of anti-semitism an excuse to strip muslim citizens of their rights . public opinion pro cologne , meanwhile , launched an internet campaign to mobilize as many people as possible to attend an open forum in late may discussing the mosque . but when the meeting took place recently in a school assembly hall , a stone 's throw from the eventual site , the majority were more sympathetic to the mosque than to pro cologne . " for 20 years , thousands of people have been forced to say their prayers in an old factory building and i do n't think this is right , " said one local . " i think it 's very late that we start this process and i 'm very happy that we 're doing it now , " said another .

controversially , the building is now set to be revamped as a mosque .
one critic has even received death threats . the site occupies the corner of two major roads in the city of cologne .
on one side is a 12-storey high building housing an estate agency , on the other are the deutsche telekom offices . nestling next to a petrol station is a run-down former factory - gray , crumbling and architecturally unassuming . since 1984 , this has been the spiritual home of some 3 million muslims in germany . but they 're finally about to get an upgrade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : security and protests at the g8 summit us demonstrators join the g8 protests police prevent protests as g8 summit gets going in germany the demonized face of g8 protests locals live with g8 protests in own backyard globalization -pipe- 03.06.2007 new members flock to join anti-globalization group in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " no-democracy zone heiligendamm , constitution disbanded " read the signs with the g8 summit in heiligendamm , germany just round the corner , attac is booming like never before .
but the trend is unlikely to continue on this scale once the meeting is over . since the beginning of the year , the group has received around 100 new membership applications a month .
in may , this even leapt to 500 - thanks , in part , to the police raids against g8 opponents in germany , the restrictions on demonstrations and other controversial measures that have hit the headlines .
attac has just under 18,000 members in germany and approximately 90,000 worldwide .
influx of members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac has grown fast in response to the g8 summit this wave of recruitment is clearly a result of the mobilization of the group ahead of next week 's summit .
since last autumn , the network has organized more than 1,000 discussion meetings in germany with the aim of mobilizing protesters .
attac has also organized events designed to give demonstrators practical training for the major rally , which took place on saturday in rostock .
in so-called handicraft workshops , members were making banners and dummies .
in action sessions , they 've been practising peaceful sit-down blockades .
g8 boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in attac workshops people can learn to make cardboard cut-outs like these ones " since the start of the year we 've been almost exclusively concentrating on the g8 , " said the attac spokeswoman frauke distelrath .
this growth spurt follows a period of crisis .
the german magazine stern reported last year that more and more people were leaving the organization .
but even in 2006 , the lowest point for the organization since it was set up in 2000 , there was a net gain of 10 members a month .
this is a situation that most political parties , unions and churches can only dream of . political scientist claus leggewie and author of the book " die globalisierung und ihre gegner " -lrb- globalization and its critics -rrb- described attac 's experience as a " normal growth crisis . "
he said the network was experiencing a very strong influx of members that would inevitably die back .
growth will slow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac includes conservatives like heiner geissler as well as left-wingers " social movements can not afford to be in a state of perpetual mobilization , " leggewie said .
" it will be left to a few activists to ensure stability and continuity . "
but he said the anti-globalization movement had been spared any real downturn because of the regular summit meetings that they can mobilize against . " criticism of globalization is a cross-party theme that affects almost all areas of politics - so the movement should also last longer than movements devoted to single causes that run out of steam at some point , " said ansgar klein , the editor of the research journal " neue soziale bewegungen " -lrb- new social movements -rrb- .
he thinks it is very unlikely that the demands of the globalization critics will be fulfilled in the near future . but the movement has made its mark on the g8 agenda with themes such as climate change and africa .
very recently , german chancellor angela merkel , who currently holds the six-month rotating presidency , said the summit was about " giving a human face to globalization " .
she also expressly welcomed the planned actions and protests .
mainstream response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel spoke about giving a human aspect to globalization in the lead-up to the summit " if globalization critique has also been taken up by the german chancellor then we will have to watch how these avowals are turned into practice , " said peter wahl , a member of attac 's co-ordination council .
he said that it would be important in the future to focus on concrete conceptual work . that could be more difficult than organizing isolated campaigns or mobilizing protest against a summit .
some 120 - very diverse - organizations belong to the network .
the spectrum spans church groups , environmental groups and unions .

it will be watching not just to see whether her direction will be controversial or , as it has happened in the past , roundly panned .
they will be straining to see what the future of the famed bayreuth opera festival might look like .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wagner family : gudrun -lrb- left -rrb- , wolfgang and katharina wagner recently told the munich newspaper münchner merkur that she felt ready to take charge of the summer festival , an annual high-profile magnet for the world 's music lovers that was founded by her great-grandfather , the operatic composer richard wagner . family feud much ink has been spilled to date detailing the wagner family 's ongoing feud over who should run the festival .
at different times , wolfgang 's other daughter by an earlier marriage , eva wagner-pasquier , and nike wagner , the daughter of wolfgang 's late brother wieland , have both laid claim to the throne on bayreuth 's fabled green hill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young wagner has been on a fast track to the top many see katharina wagner , wolfgang 's daughter with his current wife gudrun , as the person who is least capable of keeping audiences interested in the conservative but well-loved festival .
to date , katharina 's high-profile opera debuts have been ill received .
in 2006 , berlin audiences booed the opening night performance of puccini 's " il trittico " staged by the young wagner .
but katharina 's father and mother have held firm in their apparent resolve to have her take the reins from wolfgang wagner , who is 87 and has a lifetime contract with the bayreuth festival .
only wolfgang can terminate his contract , according to his 62-year-old wife .
much riding on " mastersinger " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel attends bayreuth every year due to arthritis , wolfgang wagner can now only walk with difficulty , gudrun wagner said .
in an interview published wednesday by the german weekly bunte , gudrun wagner said : " a wagner always runs bayreuth .
not keeping it in the family would mean unnecessarily abandoning something that exists nowhere else in the world . "
several years ago the director failed in a bid to install gudrun – who used to be wolfgang wagner 's secretary and is now widely seen as the power behind the throne at the festival - as his successor .
now , if the audience of wagner lovers accept the daughter 's first bayreuth production in july , her succession is seen as certain .
contenders to the throne gudrun wagner said in the interview that her daughter was " a very able artist and cultural manager who knows the ropes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner heads the weimar arts festival another great-granddaughter of richard wagner , nike wagner , 61 , has repeatedly voiced a desire to take over the " family business . "
she is the daughter of wieland wagner , the late brother of wolfgang wagner , and an accomplished stage and opera director .
but katharina wagner told muenchner merkur last week : " if the shareholders agree and i am satisfied with the terms , i would be ready to take over . "
she said she would not be happy to share the leadership in a team arrangement . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayreuth festival goes for youth in 2007 the bayreuth festival is keeping wagner in the family , announcing that the composer 's great-granddaughter , katharina , will open the festival with a new production of " the mastersingers of nuremberg .

controversially , the building is now set to be revamped as a mosque .
one critic has even received death threats . the site occupies the corner of two major roads in the city of cologne .
on one side is a 12-storey high building housing an estate agency , on the other are the deutsche telekom offices . nestling next to a petrol station is a run-down former factory - gray , crumbling and architecturally unassuming . since 1984 , this has been the spiritual home of some 3 million muslims in germany . but they 're finally about to get an upgrade .
the turkish islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- is planning to use its own money to renovate the headquarters and build a fully fledged mosque complete with two minarets , as well as a cultural center for the community . long overdue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany make life hard for its muslims ?
predictably , the plan has divided the city of cologne .
opposition is rife , but others have leapt to ditib 's defense , saying it is high time that cologne 's 120,000 muslims had a proper place of worship . " at the moment the situation is terrible , " said bekir alboga , who is in charge of inter-religious and inter-cultural co-operation at ditib .
" people pray out here in the car park , even in winter when it 's cold , snowing or raining , because it is a very small prayer room .
and where are muslims meant to pray , while christians or jews are in their pretty , representative houses of god ?
should our muslims really pray on tarmac in the blazing summer sun ? " right-wing resistance but not everyone in cologne shares alboga 's point of view , not least the radical right-wing citizens ' movement pro-cologne .
members of this group point out that there are some 45 mosques in cologne already - based mainly in abandoned factories , warehouses and shops - and that these fulfill the muslim community 's needs . the group 's leader , manfred rouhs , said that a large muslim cultural center will serve to encourage a separated turkish society rather than an integrated one . " these people only speak turkish , " he said .
" they see no need to learn german .
we think that 's the wrong way , and because of this we are critical of the project . " he said he feels there is a key difference between muslims gathering for worship in mosques and jews in synagogues in germany . " jews speak german , and they 've lived in germany since several hundred years , " rouhs said .
" because of this it 's no problem . " debate in jewish community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's synagogue in oranienburger straße in fact , the issue has also split the jewish community . jewish writer and journalist ralph giordano has come in for angry criticism within the community for taking a stance against the mosque on the grounds that it belies what he calls germany 's " failed integration . " what germany has seen instead is a " clash of two completely different cultures , " he said in the stuttgarter nachrichten . " the question is whether these cultures can ever be reconciled , " he said . his comments have drawn death threats from muslims , said giordano . " what kind of a state are we in that i can face a fatwa in germany ? " he asked . his colleague rafael seligmann told the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung that giordano 's position harks back to his childhood . " his persecution as a child under the nazis has eaten away at his soul , " he said . he also explained that many jews in germany are concerned by radical islam 's calls to destroy israel but insisted that giordano should not make his fears of anti-semitism an excuse to strip muslim citizens of their rights . public opinion pro cologne , meanwhile , launched an internet campaign to mobilize as many people as possible to attend an open forum in late may discussing the mosque . but when the meeting took place recently in a school assembly hall , a stone 's throw from the eventual site , the majority were more sympathetic to the mosque than to pro cologne . " for 20 years , thousands of people have been forced to say their prayers in an old factory building and i do n't think this is right , " said one local . " i think it 's very late that we start this process and i 'm very happy that we 're doing it now , " said another .
" i think it 's very good for cologne , and it 's very good for ehrenfeld ! " architect paul böhm is in charge of plans for the new mosque .
he told the crowd that despite the public uproar , he has no regrets taking the job … " i am a citizen of this town , and every day i see this old building which is nearly empty , but only a small room in the courtyard is used by muslims for praying , " he said .
" i 've always thought we need to find someone to build a real mosque for these people .
i 've wanted to help for a along time , and now i have the chance . " tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new mosque could be a new tourist atttraction for cologne citizens had their chance to put forward their complaints and concerns about the planned mosque , which focused mainly on traffic congestion on the already busy neighboring streets , and the height of the planned minarets . others simply took the floor to say how happy they were that cologne would finally have a proper mosque , adding that racism was not welcome in their multicultural city . marlis brederhorst , cologne 's official representative for integration was confident that the mosque would do the city good . " it 's wonderful , " she said .
" cologne is a city of churches , and its most beautiful buildings are churches .
now we 'll have another tourist attraction , and i think it 's good for integration for the muslims in cologne because this will be a mosque they can be proud of .

but the trend is unlikely to continue on this scale once the meeting is over . since the beginning of the year , the group has received around 100 new membership applications a month .
in may , this even leapt to 500 - thanks , in part , to the police raids against g8 opponents in germany , the restrictions on demonstrations and other controversial measures that have hit the headlines .
attac has just under 18,000 members in germany and approximately 90,000 worldwide .
influx of members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac has grown fast in response to the g8 summit this wave of recruitment is clearly a result of the mobilization of the group ahead of next week 's summit .
since last autumn , the network has organized more than 1,000 discussion meetings in germany with the aim of mobilizing protesters .
attac has also organized events designed to give demonstrators practical training for the major rally , which took place on saturday in rostock .
in so-called handicraft workshops , members were making banners and dummies .

g8 boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in attac workshops people can learn to make cardboard cut-outs like these ones " since the start of the year we 've been almost exclusively concentrating on the g8 , " said the attac spokeswoman frauke distelrath .
this growth spurt follows a period of crisis .
the german magazine stern reported last year that more and more people were leaving the organization .
but even in 2006 , the lowest point for the organization since it was set up in 2000 , there was a net gain of 10 members a month .
this is a situation that most political parties , unions and churches can only dream of . political scientist claus leggewie and author of the book " die globalisierung und ihre gegner " -lrb- globalization and its critics -rrb- described attac 's experience as a " normal growth crisis . "
he said the network was experiencing a very strong influx of members that would inevitably die back .
growth will slow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac includes conservatives like heiner geissler as well as left-wingers " social movements can not afford to be in a state of perpetual mobilization , " leggewie said .
" it will be left to a few activists to ensure stability and continuity . "
but he said the anti-globalization movement had been spared any real downturn because of the regular summit meetings that they can mobilize against . " criticism of globalization is a cross-party theme that affects almost all areas of politics - so the movement should also last longer than movements devoted to single causes that run out of steam at some point , " said ansgar klein , the editor of the research journal " neue soziale bewegungen " -lrb- new social movements -rrb- .
he thinks it is very unlikely that the demands of the globalization critics will be fulfilled in the near future . but the movement has made its mark on the g8 agenda with themes such as climate change and africa .
very recently , german chancellor angela merkel , who currently holds the six-month rotating presidency , said the summit was about " giving a human face to globalization " .
she also expressly welcomed the planned actions and protests .
mainstream response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel spoke about giving a human aspect to globalization in the lead-up to the summit " if globalization critique has also been taken up by the german chancellor then we will have to watch how these avowals are turned into practice , " said peter wahl , a member of attac 's co-ordination council .
he said that it would be important in the future to focus on concrete conceptual work . that could be more difficult than organizing isolated campaigns or mobilizing protest against a summit .
some 120 - very diverse - organizations belong to the network .
the spectrum spans church groups , environmental groups and unions .
attac counts both the former cdu general secretary heiner geissler and oskar lafontaine , of the left party , among its members . when the summit is over , the members will have more time to devote to working on their political program - another big project such as opposition to the g8 summit is not presently in sight .

it will be watching not just to see whether her direction will be controversial or , as it has happened in the past , roundly panned .
they will be straining to see what the future of the famed bayreuth opera festival might look like .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wagner family : gudrun -lrb- left -rrb- , wolfgang and katharina wagner recently told the munich newspaper münchner merkur that she felt ready to take charge of the summer festival , an annual high-profile magnet for the world 's music lovers that was founded by her great-grandfather , the operatic composer richard wagner . family feud much ink has been spilled to date detailing the wagner family 's ongoing feud over who should run the festival .
at different times , wolfgang 's other daughter by an earlier marriage , eva wagner-pasquier , and nike wagner , the daughter of wolfgang 's late brother wieland , have both laid claim to the throne on bayreuth 's fabled green hill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young wagner has been on a fast track to the top many see katharina wagner , wolfgang 's daughter with his current wife gudrun , as the person who is least capable of keeping audiences interested in the conservative but well-loved festival .
to date , katharina 's high-profile opera debuts have been ill received .
in 2006 , berlin audiences booed the opening night performance of puccini 's " il trittico " staged by the young wagner .
but katharina 's father and mother have held firm in their apparent resolve to have her take the reins from wolfgang wagner , who is 87 and has a lifetime contract with the bayreuth festival .
only wolfgang can terminate his contract , according to his 62-year-old wife .
much riding on " mastersinger " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel attends bayreuth every year due to arthritis , wolfgang wagner can now only walk with difficulty , gudrun wagner said .
in an interview published wednesday by the german weekly bunte , gudrun wagner said : " a wagner always runs bayreuth .
not keeping it in the family would mean unnecessarily abandoning something that exists nowhere else in the world . "
several years ago the director failed in a bid to install gudrun – who used to be wolfgang wagner 's secretary and is now widely seen as the power behind the throne at the festival - as his successor .
now , if the audience of wagner lovers accept the daughter 's first bayreuth production in july , her succession is seen as certain .
contenders to the throne gudrun wagner said in the interview that her daughter was " a very able artist and cultural manager who knows the ropes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner heads the weimar arts festival another great-granddaughter of richard wagner , nike wagner , 61 , has repeatedly voiced a desire to take over the " family business . "
she is the daughter of wieland wagner , the late brother of wolfgang wagner , and an accomplished stage and opera director .
but katharina wagner told muenchner merkur last week : " if the shareholders agree and i am satisfied with the terms , i would be ready to take over . "
she said she would not be happy to share the leadership in a team arrangement . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayreuth festival goes for youth in 2007 the bayreuth festival is keeping wagner in the family , announcing that the composer 's great-granddaughter , katharina , will open the festival with a new production of " the mastersingers of nuremberg .

-lrb- 02.08.2006 -rrb- debate over subsidies brings drama backstage in bayreuth nike wagner , the niece of bayreuth festival director wolfgang wagner , advocated cuts to the opera festival 's state subsidies .
her appeal aggravated family tensions , but raised valid questions on german art subsidies .

but the trend is unlikely to continue on this scale once the meeting is over . since the beginning of the year , the group has received around 100 new membership applications a month .
in may , this even leapt to 500 - thanks , in part , to the police raids against g8 opponents in germany , the restrictions on demonstrations and other controversial measures that have hit the headlines .
attac has just under 18,000 members in germany and approximately 90,000 worldwide .
influx of members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac has grown fast in response to the g8 summit this wave of recruitment is clearly a result of the mobilization of the group ahead of next week 's summit .
since last autumn , the network has organized more than 1,000 discussion meetings in germany with the aim of mobilizing protesters .
attac has also organized events designed to give demonstrators practical training for the major rally , which took place on saturday in rostock .
in so-called handicraft workshops , members were making banners and dummies .
in action sessions , they 've been practising peaceful sit-down blockades .
g8 boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in attac workshops people can learn to make cardboard cut-outs like these ones " since the start of the year we 've been almost exclusively concentrating on the g8 , " said the attac spokeswoman frauke distelrath .
this growth spurt follows a period of crisis .
the german magazine stern reported last year that more and more people were leaving the organization .
but even in 2006 , the lowest point for the organization since it was set up in 2000 , there was a net gain of 10 members a month .
this is a situation that most political parties , unions and churches can only dream of . political scientist claus leggewie and author of the book " die globalisierung und ihre gegner " -lrb- globalization and its critics -rrb- described attac 's experience as a " normal growth crisis . "
he said the network was experiencing a very strong influx of members that would inevitably die back .
growth will slow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac includes conservatives like heiner geissler as well as left-wingers " social movements can not afford to be in a state of perpetual mobilization , " leggewie said .
" it will be left to a few activists to ensure stability and continuity . "
but he said the anti-globalization movement had been spared any real downturn because of the regular summit meetings that they can mobilize against . " criticism of globalization is a cross-party theme that affects almost all areas of politics - so the movement should also last longer than movements devoted to single causes that run out of steam at some point , " said ansgar klein , the editor of the research journal " neue soziale bewegungen " -lrb- new social movements -rrb- .
he thinks it is very unlikely that the demands of the globalization critics will be fulfilled in the near future . but the movement has made its mark on the g8 agenda with themes such as climate change and africa .
very recently , german chancellor angela merkel , who currently holds the six-month rotating presidency , said the summit was about " giving a human face to globalization " .
she also expressly welcomed the planned actions and protests .
mainstream response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel spoke about giving a human aspect to globalization in the lead-up to the summit " if globalization critique has also been taken up by the german chancellor then we will have to watch how these avowals are turned into practice , " said peter wahl , a member of attac 's co-ordination council .
he said that it would be important in the future to focus on concrete conceptual work . that could be more difficult than organizing isolated campaigns or mobilizing protest against a summit .
some 120 - very diverse - organizations belong to the network .
the spectrum spans church groups , environmental groups and unions .
attac counts both the former cdu general secretary heiner geissler and oskar lafontaine , of the left party , among its members . when the summit is over , the members will have more time to devote to working on their political program - another big project such as opposition to the g8 summit is not presently in sight .
the boom , currently being experienced by the organization , is likely to come to an end then , too .
activists like peter wahl are taking this in their stride .
" that 's just the normal rise and fall of the political cycle , " he said . dennis stute -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de almost 1,000 hurt after anti-g8 protests in germany police and protest organizers sunday laid the blame for the riot that erupted during an anti-g8 rally in the german port of rostock on groups bent on violence that had infiltrated the largely peaceful demonstors .
-lrb- 03.06.2007 -rrb- " a new day is dawning for globalization critics " around 100,000 demonstrators are expected at the g8 summit in june .

controversially , the building is now set to be revamped as a mosque .
one critic has even received death threats . the site occupies the corner of two major roads in the city of cologne .
on one side is a 12-storey high building housing an estate agency , on the other are the deutsche telekom offices . nestling next to a petrol station is a run-down former factory - gray , crumbling and architecturally unassuming . since 1984 , this has been the spiritual home of some 3 million muslims in germany . but they 're finally about to get an upgrade .
the turkish islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- is planning to use its own money to renovate the headquarters and build a fully fledged mosque complete with two minarets , as well as a cultural center for the community . long overdue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany make life hard for its muslims ?
predictably , the plan has divided the city of cologne .
opposition is rife , but others have leapt to ditib 's defense , saying it is high time that cologne 's 120,000 muslims had a proper place of worship . " at the moment the situation is terrible , " said bekir alboga , who is in charge of inter-religious and inter-cultural co-operation at ditib .
" people pray out here in the car park , even in winter when it 's cold , snowing or raining , because it is a very small prayer room .
and where are muslims meant to pray , while christians or jews are in their pretty , representative houses of god ?
should our muslims really pray on tarmac in the blazing summer sun ? " right-wing resistance but not everyone in cologne shares alboga 's point of view , not least the radical right-wing citizens ' movement pro-cologne .
members of this group point out that there are some 45 mosques in cologne already - based mainly in abandoned factories , warehouses and shops - and that these fulfill the muslim community 's needs . the group 's leader , manfred rouhs , said that a large muslim cultural center will serve to encourage a separated turkish society rather than an integrated one . " these people only speak turkish , " he said .
" they see no need to learn german .
we think that 's the wrong way , and because of this we are critical of the project . " he said he feels there is a key difference between muslims gathering for worship in mosques and jews in synagogues in germany . " jews speak german , and they 've lived in germany since several hundred years , " rouhs said .
" because of this it 's no problem . " debate in jewish community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's synagogue in oranienburger straße in fact , the issue has also split the jewish community . jewish writer and journalist ralph giordano has come in for angry criticism within the community for taking a stance against the mosque on the grounds that it belies what he calls germany 's " failed integration . " what germany has seen instead is a " clash of two completely different cultures , " he said in the stuttgarter nachrichten . " the question is whether these cultures can ever be reconciled , " he said . his comments have drawn death threats from muslims , said giordano . " what kind of a state are we in that i can face a fatwa in germany ? " he asked . his colleague rafael seligmann told the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung that giordano 's position harks back to his childhood . " his persecution as a child under the nazis has eaten away at his soul , " he said . he also explained that many jews in germany are concerned by radical islam 's calls to destroy israel but insisted that giordano should not make his fears of anti-semitism an excuse to strip muslim citizens of their rights . public opinion pro cologne , meanwhile , launched an internet campaign to mobilize as many people as possible to attend an open forum in late may discussing the mosque . but when the meeting took place recently in a school assembly hall , a stone 's throw from the eventual site , the majority were more sympathetic to the mosque than to pro cologne . " for 20 years , thousands of people have been forced to say their prayers in an old factory building and i do n't think this is right , " said one local . " i think it 's very late that we start this process and i 'm very happy that we 're doing it now , " said another .
" i think it 's very good for cologne , and it 's very good for ehrenfeld ! " architect paul böhm is in charge of plans for the new mosque .
he told the crowd that despite the public uproar , he has no regrets taking the job … " i am a citizen of this town , and every day i see this old building which is nearly empty , but only a small room in the courtyard is used by muslims for praying , " he said .

in may , this even leapt to 500 - thanks , in part , to the police raids against g8 opponents in germany , the restrictions on demonstrations and other controversial measures that have hit the headlines .
attac has just under 18,000 members in germany and approximately 90,000 worldwide .

" criticism of globalization is a cross-party theme that affects almost all areas of politics - so the movement should also last longer than movements devoted to single causes that run out of steam at some point , " said ansgar klein , the editor of the research journal " neue soziale bewegungen " -lrb- new social movements -rrb- .
he thinks it is very unlikely that the demands of the globalization critics will be fulfilled in the near future . but the movement has made its mark on the g8 agenda with themes such as climate change and africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 03.06.2007 debate over new mosque in cologne heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne still has room for a minaret germany 's turkish islamic union is housed in a dilapidated factory in the ehrenfeld district of cologne .
controversially , the building is now set to be revamped as a mosque .
one critic has even received death threats . the site occupies the corner of two major roads in the city of cologne .
on one side is a 12-storey high building housing an estate agency , on the other are the deutsche telekom offices . nestling next to a petrol station is a run-down former factory - gray , crumbling and architecturally unassuming . since 1984 , this has been the spiritual home of some 3 million muslims in germany . but they 're finally about to get an upgrade .
the turkish islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- is planning to use its own money to renovate the headquarters and build a fully fledged mosque complete with two minarets , as well as a cultural center for the community . long overdue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany make life hard for its muslims ?
predictably , the plan has divided the city of cologne .
opposition is rife , but others have leapt to ditib 's defense , saying it is high time that cologne 's 120,000 muslims had a proper place of worship . " at the moment the situation is terrible , " said bekir alboga , who is in charge of inter-religious and inter-cultural co-operation at ditib .
" people pray out here in the car park , even in winter when it 's cold , snowing or raining , because it is a very small prayer room .
and where are muslims meant to pray , while christians or jews are in their pretty , representative houses of god ?
should our muslims really pray on tarmac in the blazing summer sun ? " right-wing resistance but not everyone in cologne shares alboga 's point of view , not least the radical right-wing citizens ' movement pro-cologne .
members of this group point out that there are some 45 mosques in cologne already - based mainly in abandoned factories , warehouses and shops - and that these fulfill the muslim community 's needs . the group 's leader , manfred rouhs , said that a large muslim cultural center will serve to encourage a separated turkish society rather than an integrated one . " these people only speak turkish , " he said .
" they see no need to learn german .
we think that 's the wrong way , and because of this we are critical of the project . " he said he feels there is a key difference between muslims gathering for worship in mosques and jews in synagogues in germany . " jews speak german , and they 've lived in germany since several hundred years , " rouhs said .
" because of this it 's no problem . " debate in jewish community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's synagogue in oranienburger straße in fact , the issue has also split the jewish community . jewish writer and journalist ralph giordano has come in for angry criticism within the community for taking a stance against the mosque on the grounds that it belies what he calls germany 's " failed integration . " what germany has seen instead is a " clash of two completely different cultures , " he said in the stuttgarter nachrichten . " the question is whether these cultures can ever be reconciled , " he said . his comments have drawn death threats from muslims , said giordano . " what kind of a state are we in that i can face a fatwa in germany ? " he asked . his colleague rafael seligmann told the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung that giordano 's position harks back to his childhood . " his persecution as a child under the nazis has eaten away at his soul , " he said . he also explained that many jews in germany are concerned by radical islam 's calls to destroy israel but insisted that giordano should not make his fears of anti-semitism an excuse to strip muslim citizens of their rights . public opinion pro cologne , meanwhile , launched an internet campaign to mobilize as many people as possible to attend an open forum in late may discussing the mosque . but when the meeting took place recently in a school assembly hall , a stone 's throw from the eventual site , the majority were more sympathetic to the mosque than to pro cologne . " for 20 years , thousands of people have been forced to say their prayers in an old factory building and i do n't think this is right , " said one local . " i think it 's very late that we start this process and i 'm very happy that we 're doing it now , " said another .

controversially , the building is now set to be revamped as a mosque .
one critic has even received death threats . the site occupies the corner of two major roads in the city of cologne .
on one side is a 12-storey high building housing an estate agency , on the other are the deutsche telekom offices . nestling next to a petrol station is a run-down former factory - gray , crumbling and architecturally unassuming . since 1984 , this has been the spiritual home of some 3 million muslims in germany . but they 're finally about to get an upgrade .
the turkish islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- is planning to use its own money to renovate the headquarters and build a fully fledged mosque complete with two minarets , as well as a cultural center for the community . long overdue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany make life hard for its muslims ?
predictably , the plan has divided the city of cologne .
opposition is rife , but others have leapt to ditib 's defense , saying it is high time that cologne 's 120,000 muslims had a proper place of worship . " at the moment the situation is terrible , " said bekir alboga , who is in charge of inter-religious and inter-cultural co-operation at ditib .
" people pray out here in the car park , even in winter when it 's cold , snowing or raining , because it is a very small prayer room .
and where are muslims meant to pray , while christians or jews are in their pretty , representative houses of god ?
should our muslims really pray on tarmac in the blazing summer sun ? " right-wing resistance but not everyone in cologne shares alboga 's point of view , not least the radical right-wing citizens ' movement pro-cologne .
members of this group point out that there are some 45 mosques in cologne already - based mainly in abandoned factories , warehouses and shops - and that these fulfill the muslim community 's needs . the group 's leader , manfred rouhs , said that a large muslim cultural center will serve to encourage a separated turkish society rather than an integrated one . " these people only speak turkish , " he said .
" they see no need to learn german .
we think that 's the wrong way , and because of this we are critical of the project . " he said he feels there is a key difference between muslims gathering for worship in mosques and jews in synagogues in germany . " jews speak german , and they 've lived in germany since several hundred years , " rouhs said .
" because of this it 's no problem . " debate in jewish community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's synagogue in oranienburger straße in fact , the issue has also split the jewish community . jewish writer and journalist ralph giordano has come in for angry criticism within the community for taking a stance against the mosque on the grounds that it belies what he calls germany 's " failed integration . " what germany has seen instead is a " clash of two completely different cultures , " he said in the stuttgarter nachrichten . " the question is whether these cultures can ever be reconciled , " he said . his comments have drawn death threats from muslims , said giordano . " what kind of a state are we in that i can face a fatwa in germany ? " he asked . his colleague rafael seligmann told the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung that giordano 's position harks back to his childhood . " his persecution as a child under the nazis has eaten away at his soul , " he said . he also explained that many jews in germany are concerned by radical islam 's calls to destroy israel but insisted that giordano should not make his fears of anti-semitism an excuse to strip muslim citizens of their rights . public opinion pro cologne , meanwhile , launched an internet campaign to mobilize as many people as possible to attend an open forum in late may discussing the mosque . but when the meeting took place recently in a school assembly hall , a stone 's throw from the eventual site , the majority were more sympathetic to the mosque than to pro cologne . " for 20 years , thousands of people have been forced to say their prayers in an old factory building and i do n't think this is right , " said one local . " i think it 's very late that we start this process and i 'm very happy that we 're doing it now , " said another .
" i think it 's very good for cologne , and it 's very good for ehrenfeld ! " architect paul böhm is in charge of plans for the new mosque .
he told the crowd that despite the public uproar , he has no regrets taking the job … " i am a citizen of this town , and every day i see this old building which is nearly empty , but only a small room in the courtyard is used by muslims for praying , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 03.06.2007 debate over new mosque in cologne heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne still has room for a minaret germany 's turkish islamic union is housed in a dilapidated factory in the ehrenfeld district of cologne .
controversially , the building is now set to be revamped as a mosque .
one critic has even received death threats . the site occupies the corner of two major roads in the city of cologne .
on one side is a 12-storey high building housing an estate agency , on the other are the deutsche telekom offices . nestling next to a petrol station is a run-down former factory - gray , crumbling and architecturally unassuming . since 1984 , this has been the spiritual home of some 3 million muslims in germany . but they 're finally about to get an upgrade .
the turkish islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- is planning to use its own money to renovate the headquarters and build a fully fledged mosque complete with two minarets , as well as a cultural center for the community . long overdue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany make life hard for its muslims ?
predictably , the plan has divided the city of cologne .
opposition is rife , but others have leapt to ditib 's defense , saying it is high time that cologne 's 120,000 muslims had a proper place of worship . " at the moment the situation is terrible , " said bekir alboga , who is in charge of inter-religious and inter-cultural co-operation at ditib .
" people pray out here in the car park , even in winter when it 's cold , snowing or raining , because it is a very small prayer room .
and where are muslims meant to pray , while christians or jews are in their pretty , representative houses of god ?
should our muslims really pray on tarmac in the blazing summer sun ? " right-wing resistance but not everyone in cologne shares alboga 's point of view , not least the radical right-wing citizens ' movement pro-cologne .
members of this group point out that there are some 45 mosques in cologne already - based mainly in abandoned factories , warehouses and shops - and that these fulfill the muslim community 's needs . the group 's leader , manfred rouhs , said that a large muslim cultural center will serve to encourage a separated turkish society rather than an integrated one . " these people only speak turkish , " he said .
" they see no need to learn german .
we think that 's the wrong way , and because of this we are critical of the project . " he said he feels there is a key difference between muslims gathering for worship in mosques and jews in synagogues in germany . " jews speak german , and they 've lived in germany since several hundred years , " rouhs said .
" because of this it 's no problem . " debate in jewish community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's synagogue in oranienburger straße in fact , the issue has also split the jewish community . jewish writer and journalist ralph giordano has come in for angry criticism within the community for taking a stance against the mosque on the grounds that it belies what he calls germany 's " failed integration . " what germany has seen instead is a " clash of two completely different cultures , " he said in the stuttgarter nachrichten . " the question is whether these cultures can ever be reconciled , " he said . his comments have drawn death threats from muslims , said giordano . " what kind of a state are we in that i can face a fatwa in germany ? " he asked . his colleague rafael seligmann told the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung that giordano 's position harks back to his childhood . " his persecution as a child under the nazis has eaten away at his soul , " he said . he also explained that many jews in germany are concerned by radical islam 's calls to destroy israel but insisted that giordano should not make his fears of anti-semitism an excuse to strip muslim citizens of their rights . public opinion pro cologne , meanwhile , launched an internet campaign to mobilize as many people as possible to attend an open forum in late may discussing the mosque . but when the meeting took place recently in a school assembly hall , a stone 's throw from the eventual site , the majority were more sympathetic to the mosque than to pro cologne . " for 20 years , thousands of people have been forced to say their prayers in an old factory building and i do n't think this is right , " said one local . " i think it 's very late that we start this process and i 'm very happy that we 're doing it now , " said another .
" i think it 's very good for cologne , and it 's very good for ehrenfeld ! " architect paul böhm is in charge of plans for the new mosque .
he told the crowd that despite the public uproar , he has no regrets taking the job … " i am a citizen of this town , and every day i see this old building which is nearly empty , but only a small room in the courtyard is used by muslims for praying , " he said .
" i 've always thought we need to find someone to build a real mosque for these people .
i 've wanted to help for a along time , and now i have the chance . " tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new mosque could be a new tourist atttraction for cologne citizens had their chance to put forward their complaints and concerns about the planned mosque , which focused mainly on traffic congestion on the already busy neighboring streets , and the height of the planned minarets . others simply took the floor to say how happy they were that cologne would finally have a proper mosque , adding that racism was not welcome in their multicultural city . marlis brederhorst , cologne 's official representative for integration was confident that the mosque would do the city good . " it 's wonderful , " she said .
" cologne is a city of churches , and its most beautiful buildings are churches .
now we 'll have another tourist attraction , and i think it 's good for integration for the muslims in cologne because this will be a mosque they can be proud of .

after repeated warnings from russia that the us proposals would set off a new arms race , moscow tested a new multi-warhead missile last week that putin said was a direct response to us actions .
and in his boldest remarks to date on the issue , the russian president has warned that russia would once again target europe with missiles like it did during the cold war .

lavrov shrugged off american insistence that its plan to deploy missile defense hardware in poland and the czech republic poses no threat , casting it as an attempt to encircle russia militarily .
" if strategic components of the american arsenal appear in europe near our borders , we are obliged to ... cut off potential threats from that deployment , " lavrov said in comments broadcast on the state-run television channel vesti-24 .
a threat to russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials say the system poses no threat to russia the us plan " wonderfully fits the overall picture of american global anti-missile defense , which according to our analysis - just look at the map - is being deployed along russia 's perimeter , and also china 's , incidentally . "
after repeated warnings from russia that the us proposals would set off a new arms race , moscow tested a new multi-warhead missile last week that putin said was a direct response to us actions .
and in his boldest remarks to date on the issue , the russian president has warned that russia would once again target europe with missiles like it did during the cold war .
" the anti-missile shield is part of a nuclear system that protects american territory , " putin said in an interview with newspapers from the group of eight industrialized nations .
" for the first time in history , elements of it are being moved to europe .
" we will get new targets in europe " " if the us nuclear potential extends across the european territory , we will get new targets in europe , " he said .
" it will then be up to our military experts to identify which targets will be aimed by ballistic missiles and which ones will be aimed by cruise missiles . "
the interview was due to be published on monday but pre-released by germany 's der spiegel magazine .
putin and his peers are meeting for a three-day g8 summit which begins in germany on wednesday .
" we want to re-balance the defense instruments with more efficient offensive equipment but we know that this could lead to a renewed arms race for which we are , however , not responsible , " putin said .
tensions over the plan have helped send relations between the two states to levels many analysts say have n't been seen since the cold war .
nato-russian cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can nato help diffuse the situation ?
in spite of the sharp words , lavrov pointed to a previous avenue of russian cooperation with the west on missile defence , saying : " it would be better to resume work within the framework of the nato-russia council on creating theater missile defense . "
developing a missile defense system to protect deployed troops from missile attacks is one of several joint programs by the nato-russia council , and is scheduled to be completed by 2010 .
washington says the central european shield , which foresees 10 missile interceptors in poland and radar in the czech republic , would protect against potential threats from states such as iran or north korea .

controversially , the building is now set to be revamped as a mosque .
one critic has even received death threats . the site occupies the corner of two major roads in the city of cologne .
on one side is a 12-storey high building housing an estate agency , on the other are the deutsche telekom offices . nestling next to a petrol station is a run-down former factory - gray , crumbling and architecturally unassuming . since 1984 , this has been the spiritual home of some 3 million muslims in germany . but they 're finally about to get an upgrade .
the turkish islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- is planning to use its own money to renovate the headquarters and build a fully fledged mosque complete with two minarets , as well as a cultural center for the community . long overdue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany make life hard for its muslims ?
predictably , the plan has divided the city of cologne .
opposition is rife , but others have leapt to ditib 's defense , saying it is high time that cologne 's 120,000 muslims had a proper place of worship . " at the moment the situation is terrible , " said bekir alboga , who is in charge of inter-religious and inter-cultural co-operation at ditib .
" people pray out here in the car park , even in winter when it 's cold , snowing or raining , because it is a very small prayer room .

should our muslims really pray on tarmac in the blazing summer sun ? " right-wing resistance but not everyone in cologne shares alboga 's point of view , not least the radical right-wing citizens ' movement pro-cologne .
members of this group point out that there are some 45 mosques in cologne already - based mainly in abandoned factories , warehouses and shops - and that these fulfill the muslim community 's needs . the group 's leader , manfred rouhs , said that a large muslim cultural center will serve to encourage a separated turkish society rather than an integrated one . " these people only speak turkish , " he said .

" his persecution as a child under the nazis has eaten away at his soul , " he said . he also explained that many jews in germany are concerned by radical islam 's calls to destroy israel but insisted that giordano should not make his fears of anti-semitism an excuse to strip muslim citizens of their rights . public opinion pro cologne , meanwhile , launched an internet campaign to mobilize as many people as possible to attend an open forum in late may discussing the mosque . but when the meeting took place recently in a school assembly hall , a stone 's throw from the eventual site , the majority were more sympathetic to the mosque than to pro cologne .

controversially , the building is now set to be revamped as a mosque .
one critic has even received death threats . the site occupies the corner of two major roads in the city of cologne .
on one side is a 12-storey high building housing an estate agency , on the other are the deutsche telekom offices . nestling next to a petrol station is a run-down former factory - gray , crumbling and architecturally unassuming . since 1984 , this has been the spiritual home of some 3 million muslims in germany . but they 're finally about to get an upgrade .
the turkish islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- is planning to use its own money to renovate the headquarters and build a fully fledged mosque complete with two minarets , as well as a cultural center for the community . long overdue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany make life hard for its muslims ?
predictably , the plan has divided the city of cologne .
opposition is rife , but others have leapt to ditib 's defense , saying it is high time that cologne 's 120,000 muslims had a proper place of worship . " at the moment the situation is terrible , " said bekir alboga , who is in charge of inter-religious and inter-cultural co-operation at ditib .
" people pray out here in the car park , even in winter when it 's cold , snowing or raining , because it is a very small prayer room .
and where are muslims meant to pray , while christians or jews are in their pretty , representative houses of god ?
should our muslims really pray on tarmac in the blazing summer sun ? " right-wing resistance but not everyone in cologne shares alboga 's point of view , not least the radical right-wing citizens ' movement pro-cologne .
members of this group point out that there are some 45 mosques in cologne already - based mainly in abandoned factories , warehouses and shops - and that these fulfill the muslim community 's needs . the group 's leader , manfred rouhs , said that a large muslim cultural center will serve to encourage a separated turkish society rather than an integrated one . " these people only speak turkish , " he said .
" they see no need to learn german .
we think that 's the wrong way , and because of this we are critical of the project . " he said he feels there is a key difference between muslims gathering for worship in mosques and jews in synagogues in germany . " jews speak german , and they 've lived in germany since several hundred years , " rouhs said .
" because of this it 's no problem . " debate in jewish community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's synagogue in oranienburger straße in fact , the issue has also split the jewish community . jewish writer and journalist ralph giordano has come in for angry criticism within the community for taking a stance against the mosque on the grounds that it belies what he calls germany 's " failed integration . " what germany has seen instead is a " clash of two completely different cultures , " he said in the stuttgarter nachrichten . " the question is whether these cultures can ever be reconciled , " he said . his comments have drawn death threats from muslims , said giordano . " what kind of a state are we in that i can face a fatwa in germany ? " he asked . his colleague rafael seligmann told the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung that giordano 's position harks back to his childhood . " his persecution as a child under the nazis has eaten away at his soul , " he said . he also explained that many jews in germany are concerned by radical islam 's calls to destroy israel but insisted that giordano should not make his fears of anti-semitism an excuse to strip muslim citizens of their rights . public opinion pro cologne , meanwhile , launched an internet campaign to mobilize as many people as possible to attend an open forum in late may discussing the mosque . but when the meeting took place recently in a school assembly hall , a stone 's throw from the eventual site , the majority were more sympathetic to the mosque than to pro cologne . " for 20 years , thousands of people have been forced to say their prayers in an old factory building and i do n't think this is right , " said one local . " i think it 's very late that we start this process and i 'm very happy that we 're doing it now , " said another .
" i think it 's very good for cologne , and it 's very good for ehrenfeld ! " architect paul böhm is in charge of plans for the new mosque .
he told the crowd that despite the public uproar , he has no regrets taking the job … " i am a citizen of this town , and every day i see this old building which is nearly empty , but only a small room in the courtyard is used by muslims for praying , " he said .
" i 've always thought we need to find someone to build a real mosque for these people .
i 've wanted to help for a along time , and now i have the chance . " tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new mosque could be a new tourist atttraction for cologne citizens had their chance to put forward their complaints and concerns about the planned mosque , which focused mainly on traffic congestion on the already busy neighboring streets , and the height of the planned minarets . others simply took the floor to say how happy they were that cologne would finally have a proper mosque , adding that racism was not welcome in their multicultural city . marlis brederhorst , cologne 's official representative for integration was confident that the mosque would do the city good . " it 's wonderful , " she said .
" cologne is a city of churches , and its most beautiful buildings are churches .
now we 'll have another tourist attraction , and i think it 's good for integration for the muslims in cologne because this will be a mosque they can be proud of .

lavrov shrugged off american insistence that its plan to deploy missile defense hardware in poland and the czech republic poses no threat , casting it as an attempt to encircle russia militarily .
" if strategic components of the american arsenal appear in europe near our borders , we are obliged to ... cut off potential threats from that deployment , " lavrov said in comments broadcast on the state-run television channel vesti-24 .
a threat to russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials say the system poses no threat to russia the us plan " wonderfully fits the overall picture of american global anti-missile defense , which according to our analysis - just look at the map - is being deployed along russia 's perimeter , and also china 's , incidentally . "
after repeated warnings from russia that the us proposals would set off a new arms race , moscow tested a new multi-warhead missile last week that putin said was a direct response to us actions .
and in his boldest remarks to date on the issue , the russian president has warned that russia would once again target europe with missiles like it did during the cold war .
" the anti-missile shield is part of a nuclear system that protects american territory , " putin said in an interview with newspapers from the group of eight industrialized nations .
" for the first time in history , elements of it are being moved to europe .
" we will get new targets in europe " " if the us nuclear potential extends across the european territory , we will get new targets in europe , " he said .
" it will then be up to our military experts to identify which targets will be aimed by ballistic missiles and which ones will be aimed by cruise missiles . "
the interview was due to be published on monday but pre-released by germany 's der spiegel magazine .
putin and his peers are meeting for a three-day g8 summit which begins in germany on wednesday .
" we want to re-balance the defense instruments with more efficient offensive equipment but we know that this could lead to a renewed arms race for which we are , however , not responsible , " putin said .
tensions over the plan have helped send relations between the two states to levels many analysts say have n't been seen since the cold war .
nato-russian cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can nato help diffuse the situation ?
in spite of the sharp words , lavrov pointed to a previous avenue of russian cooperation with the west on missile defence , saying : " it would be better to resume work within the framework of the nato-russia council on creating theater missile defense . "
developing a missile defense system to protect deployed troops from missile attacks is one of several joint programs by the nato-russia council , and is scheduled to be completed by 2010 .
washington says the central european shield , which foresees 10 missile interceptors in poland and radar in the czech republic , would protect against potential threats from states such as iran or north korea .
russia has responded with skepticism , suggesting the shield 's real goal is reducing russia 's military strength . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin lashes out at us , eu as russia tests missile russian president putin warned tuesday that a planned us missile defense shield would make europe a " powder keg " and lashed out at his eu critics .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials say the system poses no threat to russia the us plan " wonderfully fits the overall picture of american global anti-missile defense , which according to our analysis - just look at the map - is being deployed along russia 's perimeter , and also china 's , incidentally . "
after repeated warnings from russia that the us proposals would set off a new arms race , moscow tested a new multi-warhead missile last week that putin said was a direct response to us actions .
and in his boldest remarks to date on the issue , the russian president has warned that russia would once again target europe with missiles like it did during the cold war .
" the anti-missile shield is part of a nuclear system that protects american territory , " putin said in an interview with newspapers from the group of eight industrialized nations .
" for the first time in history , elements of it are being moved to europe .
" we will get new targets in europe " " if the us nuclear potential extends across the european territory , we will get new targets in europe , " he said .
" it will then be up to our military experts to identify which targets will be aimed by ballistic missiles and which ones will be aimed by cruise missiles . "
the interview was due to be published on monday but pre-released by germany 's der spiegel magazine .
putin and his peers are meeting for a three-day g8 summit which begins in germany on wednesday .
" we want to re-balance the defense instruments with more efficient offensive equipment but we know that this could lead to a renewed arms race for which we are , however , not responsible , " putin said .
tensions over the plan have helped send relations between the two states to levels many analysts say have n't been seen since the cold war .

developing a missile defense system to protect deployed troops from missile attacks is one of several joint programs by the nato-russia council , and is scheduled to be completed by 2010 .

a threat to russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials say the system poses no threat to russia the us plan " wonderfully fits the overall picture of american global anti-missile defense , which according to our analysis - just look at the map - is being deployed along russia 's perimeter , and also china 's , incidentally . "
after repeated warnings from russia that the us proposals would set off a new arms race , moscow tested a new multi-warhead missile last week that putin said was a direct response to us actions .
and in his boldest remarks to date on the issue , the russian president has warned that russia would once again target europe with missiles like it did during the cold war .
" the anti-missile shield is part of a nuclear system that protects american territory , " putin said in an interview with newspapers from the group of eight industrialized nations .
" for the first time in history , elements of it are being moved to europe .
" we will get new targets in europe " " if the us nuclear potential extends across the european territory , we will get new targets in europe , " he said .
" it will then be up to our military experts to identify which targets will be aimed by ballistic missiles and which ones will be aimed by cruise missiles . "
the interview was due to be published on monday but pre-released by germany 's der spiegel magazine .
putin and his peers are meeting for a three-day g8 summit which begins in germany on wednesday .
" we want to re-balance the defense instruments with more efficient offensive equipment but we know that this could lead to a renewed arms race for which we are , however , not responsible , " putin said .
tensions over the plan have helped send relations between the two states to levels many analysts say have n't been seen since the cold war .
nato-russian cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can nato help diffuse the situation ?
in spite of the sharp words , lavrov pointed to a previous avenue of russian cooperation with the west on missile defence , saying : " it would be better to resume work within the framework of the nato-russia council on creating theater missile defense . "
developing a missile defense system to protect deployed troops from missile attacks is one of several joint programs by the nato-russia council , and is scheduled to be completed by 2010 .
washington says the central european shield , which foresees 10 missile interceptors in poland and radar in the czech republic , would protect against potential threats from states such as iran or north korea .
russia has responded with skepticism , suggesting the shield 's real goal is reducing russia 's military strength . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin lashes out at us , eu as russia tests missile russian president putin warned tuesday that a planned us missile defense shield would make europe a " powder keg " and lashed out at his eu critics .

but the trend is unlikely to continue on this scale once the meeting is over . since the beginning of the year , the group has received around 100 new membership applications a month .
in may , this even leapt to 500 - thanks , in part , to the police raids against g8 opponents in germany , the restrictions on demonstrations and other controversial measures that have hit the headlines .
attac has just under 18,000 members in germany and approximately 90,000 worldwide .
influx of members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac has grown fast in response to the g8 summit this wave of recruitment is clearly a result of the mobilization of the group ahead of next week 's summit .
since last autumn , the network has organized more than 1,000 discussion meetings in germany with the aim of mobilizing protesters .
attac has also organized events designed to give demonstrators practical training for the major rally , which took place on saturday in rostock .
in so-called handicraft workshops , members were making banners and dummies .
in action sessions , they 've been practising peaceful sit-down blockades .
g8 boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in attac workshops people can learn to make cardboard cut-outs like these ones " since the start of the year we 've been almost exclusively concentrating on the g8 , " said the attac spokeswoman frauke distelrath .
this growth spurt follows a period of crisis .
the german magazine stern reported last year that more and more people were leaving the organization .
but even in 2006 , the lowest point for the organization since it was set up in 2000 , there was a net gain of 10 members a month .
this is a situation that most political parties , unions and churches can only dream of . political scientist claus leggewie and author of the book " die globalisierung und ihre gegner " -lrb- globalization and its critics -rrb- described attac 's experience as a " normal growth crisis . "
he said the network was experiencing a very strong influx of members that would inevitably die back .
growth will slow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac includes conservatives like heiner geissler as well as left-wingers " social movements can not afford to be in a state of perpetual mobilization , " leggewie said .
" it will be left to a few activists to ensure stability and continuity . "
but he said the anti-globalization movement had been spared any real downturn because of the regular summit meetings that they can mobilize against . " criticism of globalization is a cross-party theme that affects almost all areas of politics - so the movement should also last longer than movements devoted to single causes that run out of steam at some point , " said ansgar klein , the editor of the research journal " neue soziale bewegungen " -lrb- new social movements -rrb- .
he thinks it is very unlikely that the demands of the globalization critics will be fulfilled in the near future . but the movement has made its mark on the g8 agenda with themes such as climate change and africa .
very recently , german chancellor angela merkel , who currently holds the six-month rotating presidency , said the summit was about " giving a human face to globalization " .
she also expressly welcomed the planned actions and protests .
mainstream response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel spoke about giving a human aspect to globalization in the lead-up to the summit " if globalization critique has also been taken up by the german chancellor then we will have to watch how these avowals are turned into practice , " said peter wahl , a member of attac 's co-ordination council .

it will be watching not just to see whether her direction will be controversial or , as it has happened in the past , roundly panned .
they will be straining to see what the future of the famed bayreuth opera festival might look like .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wagner family : gudrun -lrb- left -rrb- , wolfgang and katharina wagner recently told the munich newspaper münchner merkur that she felt ready to take charge of the summer festival , an annual high-profile magnet for the world 's music lovers that was founded by her great-grandfather , the operatic composer richard wagner . family feud much ink has been spilled to date detailing the wagner family 's ongoing feud over who should run the festival .
at different times , wolfgang 's other daughter by an earlier marriage , eva wagner-pasquier , and nike wagner , the daughter of wolfgang 's late brother wieland , have both laid claim to the throne on bayreuth 's fabled green hill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young wagner has been on a fast track to the top many see katharina wagner , wolfgang 's daughter with his current wife gudrun , as the person who is least capable of keeping audiences interested in the conservative but well-loved festival .
to date , katharina 's high-profile opera debuts have been ill received .
in 2006 , berlin audiences booed the opening night performance of puccini 's " il trittico " staged by the young wagner .
but katharina 's father and mother have held firm in their apparent resolve to have her take the reins from wolfgang wagner , who is 87 and has a lifetime contract with the bayreuth festival .
only wolfgang can terminate his contract , according to his 62-year-old wife .
much riding on " mastersinger " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel attends bayreuth every year due to arthritis , wolfgang wagner can now only walk with difficulty , gudrun wagner said .
in an interview published wednesday by the german weekly bunte , gudrun wagner said : " a wagner always runs bayreuth .
not keeping it in the family would mean unnecessarily abandoning something that exists nowhere else in the world . "
several years ago the director failed in a bid to install gudrun – who used to be wolfgang wagner 's secretary and is now widely seen as the power behind the throne at the festival - as his successor .
now , if the audience of wagner lovers accept the daughter 's first bayreuth production in july , her succession is seen as certain .
contenders to the throne gudrun wagner said in the interview that her daughter was " a very able artist and cultural manager who knows the ropes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner heads the weimar arts festival another great-granddaughter of richard wagner , nike wagner , 61 , has repeatedly voiced a desire to take over the " family business . "
she is the daughter of wieland wagner , the late brother of wolfgang wagner , and an accomplished stage and opera director .
but katharina wagner told muenchner merkur last week : " if the shareholders agree and i am satisfied with the terms , i would be ready to take over . "
she said she would not be happy to share the leadership in a team arrangement . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayreuth festival goes for youth in 2007 the bayreuth festival is keeping wagner in the family , announcing that the composer 's great-granddaughter , katharina , will open the festival with a new production of " the mastersingers of nuremberg .

-lrb- 02.08.2006 -rrb- debate over subsidies brings drama backstage in bayreuth nike wagner , the niece of bayreuth festival director wolfgang wagner , advocated cuts to the opera festival 's state subsidies .

but the trend is unlikely to continue on this scale once the meeting is over . since the beginning of the year , the group has received around 100 new membership applications a month .
in may , this even leapt to 500 - thanks , in part , to the police raids against g8 opponents in germany , the restrictions on demonstrations and other controversial measures that have hit the headlines .
attac has just under 18,000 members in germany and approximately 90,000 worldwide .
influx of members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac has grown fast in response to the g8 summit this wave of recruitment is clearly a result of the mobilization of the group ahead of next week 's summit .
since last autumn , the network has organized more than 1,000 discussion meetings in germany with the aim of mobilizing protesters .
attac has also organized events designed to give demonstrators practical training for the major rally , which took place on saturday in rostock .
in so-called handicraft workshops , members were making banners and dummies .
in action sessions , they 've been practising peaceful sit-down blockades .
g8 boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in attac workshops people can learn to make cardboard cut-outs like these ones " since the start of the year we 've been almost exclusively concentrating on the g8 , " said the attac spokeswoman frauke distelrath .
this growth spurt follows a period of crisis .
the german magazine stern reported last year that more and more people were leaving the organization .
but even in 2006 , the lowest point for the organization since it was set up in 2000 , there was a net gain of 10 members a month .
this is a situation that most political parties , unions and churches can only dream of . political scientist claus leggewie and author of the book " die globalisierung und ihre gegner " -lrb- globalization and its critics -rrb- described attac 's experience as a " normal growth crisis . "
he said the network was experiencing a very strong influx of members that would inevitably die back .
growth will slow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac includes conservatives like heiner geissler as well as left-wingers " social movements can not afford to be in a state of perpetual mobilization , " leggewie said .
" it will be left to a few activists to ensure stability and continuity . "
but he said the anti-globalization movement had been spared any real downturn because of the regular summit meetings that they can mobilize against . " criticism of globalization is a cross-party theme that affects almost all areas of politics - so the movement should also last longer than movements devoted to single causes that run out of steam at some point , " said ansgar klein , the editor of the research journal " neue soziale bewegungen " -lrb- new social movements -rrb- .
he thinks it is very unlikely that the demands of the globalization critics will be fulfilled in the near future . but the movement has made its mark on the g8 agenda with themes such as climate change and africa .
very recently , german chancellor angela merkel , who currently holds the six-month rotating presidency , said the summit was about " giving a human face to globalization " .
she also expressly welcomed the planned actions and protests .
mainstream response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel spoke about giving a human aspect to globalization in the lead-up to the summit " if globalization critique has also been taken up by the german chancellor then we will have to watch how these avowals are turned into practice , " said peter wahl , a member of attac 's co-ordination council .
he said that it would be important in the future to focus on concrete conceptual work . that could be more difficult than organizing isolated campaigns or mobilizing protest against a summit .
some 120 - very diverse - organizations belong to the network .
the spectrum spans church groups , environmental groups and unions .
attac counts both the former cdu general secretary heiner geissler and oskar lafontaine , of the left party , among its members . when the summit is over , the members will have more time to devote to working on their political program - another big project such as opposition to the g8 summit is not presently in sight .
the boom , currently being experienced by the organization , is likely to come to an end then , too .
activists like peter wahl are taking this in their stride .
" that 's just the normal rise and fall of the political cycle , " he said . dennis stute -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de almost 1,000 hurt after anti-g8 protests in germany police and protest organizers sunday laid the blame for the riot that erupted during an anti-g8 rally in the german port of rostock on groups bent on violence that had infiltrated the largely peaceful demonstors .

lavrov shrugged off american insistence that its plan to deploy missile defense hardware in poland and the czech republic poses no threat , casting it as an attempt to encircle russia militarily .
" if strategic components of the american arsenal appear in europe near our borders , we are obliged to ... cut off potential threats from that deployment , " lavrov said in comments broadcast on the state-run television channel vesti-24 .
a threat to russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials say the system poses no threat to russia the us plan " wonderfully fits the overall picture of american global anti-missile defense , which according to our analysis - just look at the map - is being deployed along russia 's perimeter , and also china 's , incidentally . "
after repeated warnings from russia that the us proposals would set off a new arms race , moscow tested a new multi-warhead missile last week that putin said was a direct response to us actions .
and in his boldest remarks to date on the issue , the russian president has warned that russia would once again target europe with missiles like it did during the cold war .
" the anti-missile shield is part of a nuclear system that protects american territory , " putin said in an interview with newspapers from the group of eight industrialized nations .
" for the first time in history , elements of it are being moved to europe .
" we will get new targets in europe " " if the us nuclear potential extends across the european territory , we will get new targets in europe , " he said .
" it will then be up to our military experts to identify which targets will be aimed by ballistic missiles and which ones will be aimed by cruise missiles . "
the interview was due to be published on monday but pre-released by germany 's der spiegel magazine .
putin and his peers are meeting for a three-day g8 summit which begins in germany on wednesday .
" we want to re-balance the defense instruments with more efficient offensive equipment but we know that this could lead to a renewed arms race for which we are , however , not responsible , " putin said .
tensions over the plan have helped send relations between the two states to levels many analysts say have n't been seen since the cold war .
nato-russian cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can nato help diffuse the situation ?
in spite of the sharp words , lavrov pointed to a previous avenue of russian cooperation with the west on missile defence , saying : " it would be better to resume work within the framework of the nato-russia council on creating theater missile defense . "
developing a missile defense system to protect deployed troops from missile attacks is one of several joint programs by the nato-russia council , and is scheduled to be completed by 2010 .
washington says the central european shield , which foresees 10 missile interceptors in poland and radar in the czech republic , would protect against potential threats from states such as iran or north korea .
russia has responded with skepticism , suggesting the shield 's real goal is reducing russia 's military strength . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin lashes out at us , eu as russia tests missile russian president putin warned tuesday that a planned us missile defense shield would make europe a " powder keg " and lashed out at his eu critics .

it will be watching not just to see whether her direction will be controversial or , as it has happened in the past , roundly panned .
they will be straining to see what the future of the famed bayreuth opera festival might look like .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wagner family : gudrun -lrb- left -rrb- , wolfgang and katharina wagner recently told the munich newspaper münchner merkur that she felt ready to take charge of the summer festival , an annual high-profile magnet for the world 's music lovers that was founded by her great-grandfather , the operatic composer richard wagner . family feud much ink has been spilled to date detailing the wagner family 's ongoing feud over who should run the festival .
at different times , wolfgang 's other daughter by an earlier marriage , eva wagner-pasquier , and nike wagner , the daughter of wolfgang 's late brother wieland , have both laid claim to the throne on bayreuth 's fabled green hill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young wagner has been on a fast track to the top many see katharina wagner , wolfgang 's daughter with his current wife gudrun , as the person who is least capable of keeping audiences interested in the conservative but well-loved festival .
to date , katharina 's high-profile opera debuts have been ill received .
in 2006 , berlin audiences booed the opening night performance of puccini 's " il trittico " staged by the young wagner .
but katharina 's father and mother have held firm in their apparent resolve to have her take the reins from wolfgang wagner , who is 87 and has a lifetime contract with the bayreuth festival .
only wolfgang can terminate his contract , according to his 62-year-old wife .
much riding on " mastersinger " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel attends bayreuth every year due to arthritis , wolfgang wagner can now only walk with difficulty , gudrun wagner said .
in an interview published wednesday by the german weekly bunte , gudrun wagner said : " a wagner always runs bayreuth .
not keeping it in the family would mean unnecessarily abandoning something that exists nowhere else in the world . "
several years ago the director failed in a bid to install gudrun – who used to be wolfgang wagner 's secretary and is now widely seen as the power behind the throne at the festival - as his successor .
now , if the audience of wagner lovers accept the daughter 's first bayreuth production in july , her succession is seen as certain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 03.06.2007 putin : we will target europe if us builds missile system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and bush will get a chance to talk things over at the g8 summit in germany russia stepped up the cold war rhetoric on sunday with president vladimir putin warning it would point missiles at europe if the us expands its defenses near its borders . together with comments from foreign minister sergei lavrov , putin upped the stakes in a war of words with washington over us missile defense shield plans that have seen a sharp downward spiral in relations .
lavrov shrugged off american insistence that its plan to deploy missile defense hardware in poland and the czech republic poses no threat , casting it as an attempt to encircle russia militarily .
" if strategic components of the american arsenal appear in europe near our borders , we are obliged to ... cut off potential threats from that deployment , " lavrov said in comments broadcast on the state-run television channel vesti-24 .
a threat to russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials say the system poses no threat to russia the us plan " wonderfully fits the overall picture of american global anti-missile defense , which according to our analysis - just look at the map - is being deployed along russia 's perimeter , and also china 's , incidentally . "
after repeated warnings from russia that the us proposals would set off a new arms race , moscow tested a new multi-warhead missile last week that putin said was a direct response to us actions .
and in his boldest remarks to date on the issue , the russian president has warned that russia would once again target europe with missiles like it did during the cold war .
" the anti-missile shield is part of a nuclear system that protects american territory , " putin said in an interview with newspapers from the group of eight industrialized nations .
" for the first time in history , elements of it are being moved to europe .
" we will get new targets in europe " " if the us nuclear potential extends across the european territory , we will get new targets in europe , " he said .
" it will then be up to our military experts to identify which targets will be aimed by ballistic missiles and which ones will be aimed by cruise missiles . "
the interview was due to be published on monday but pre-released by germany 's der spiegel magazine .
putin and his peers are meeting for a three-day g8 summit which begins in germany on wednesday .
" we want to re-balance the defense instruments with more efficient offensive equipment but we know that this could lead to a renewed arms race for which we are , however , not responsible , " putin said .
tensions over the plan have helped send relations between the two states to levels many analysts say have n't been seen since the cold war .
nato-russian cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can nato help diffuse the situation ?
in spite of the sharp words , lavrov pointed to a previous avenue of russian cooperation with the west on missile defence , saying : " it would be better to resume work within the framework of the nato-russia council on creating theater missile defense . "
developing a missile defense system to protect deployed troops from missile attacks is one of several joint programs by the nato-russia council , and is scheduled to be completed by 2010 .
washington says the central european shield , which foresees 10 missile interceptors in poland and radar in the czech republic , would protect against potential threats from states such as iran or north korea .
russia has responded with skepticism , suggesting the shield 's real goal is reducing russia 's military strength . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin lashes out at us , eu as russia tests missile russian president putin warned tuesday that a planned us missile defense shield would make europe a " powder keg " and lashed out at his eu critics .

a threat to russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials say the system poses no threat to russia the us plan " wonderfully fits the overall picture of american global anti-missile defense , which according to our analysis - just look at the map - is being deployed along russia 's perimeter , and also china 's , incidentally . "
after repeated warnings from russia that the us proposals would set off a new arms race , moscow tested a new multi-warhead missile last week that putin said was a direct response to us actions .
and in his boldest remarks to date on the issue , the russian president has warned that russia would once again target europe with missiles like it did during the cold war .
" the anti-missile shield is part of a nuclear system that protects american territory , " putin said in an interview with newspapers from the group of eight industrialized nations .
" for the first time in history , elements of it are being moved to europe .
" we will get new targets in europe " " if the us nuclear potential extends across the european territory , we will get new targets in europe , " he said .
" it will then be up to our military experts to identify which targets will be aimed by ballistic missiles and which ones will be aimed by cruise missiles . "
the interview was due to be published on monday but pre-released by germany 's der spiegel magazine .
putin and his peers are meeting for a three-day g8 summit which begins in germany on wednesday .
" we want to re-balance the defense instruments with more efficient offensive equipment but we know that this could lead to a renewed arms race for which we are , however , not responsible , " putin said .
tensions over the plan have helped send relations between the two states to levels many analysts say have n't been seen since the cold war .

developing a missile defense system to protect deployed troops from missile attacks is one of several joint programs by the nato-russia council , and is scheduled to be completed by 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 03.06.2007 debate over new mosque in cologne heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne still has room for a minaret germany 's turkish islamic union is housed in a dilapidated factory in the ehrenfeld district of cologne .
controversially , the building is now set to be revamped as a mosque .
one critic has even received death threats . the site occupies the corner of two major roads in the city of cologne .
on one side is a 12-storey high building housing an estate agency , on the other are the deutsche telekom offices . nestling next to a petrol station is a run-down former factory - gray , crumbling and architecturally unassuming . since 1984 , this has been the spiritual home of some 3 million muslims in germany . but they 're finally about to get an upgrade .
the turkish islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- is planning to use its own money to renovate the headquarters and build a fully fledged mosque complete with two minarets , as well as a cultural center for the community . long overdue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany make life hard for its muslims ?
predictably , the plan has divided the city of cologne .
opposition is rife , but others have leapt to ditib 's defense , saying it is high time that cologne 's 120,000 muslims had a proper place of worship . " at the moment the situation is terrible , " said bekir alboga , who is in charge of inter-religious and inter-cultural co-operation at ditib .
" people pray out here in the car park , even in winter when it 's cold , snowing or raining , because it is a very small prayer room .
and where are muslims meant to pray , while christians or jews are in their pretty , representative houses of god ?
should our muslims really pray on tarmac in the blazing summer sun ? " right-wing resistance but not everyone in cologne shares alboga 's point of view , not least the radical right-wing citizens ' movement pro-cologne .
members of this group point out that there are some 45 mosques in cologne already - based mainly in abandoned factories , warehouses and shops - and that these fulfill the muslim community 's needs . the group 's leader , manfred rouhs , said that a large muslim cultural center will serve to encourage a separated turkish society rather than an integrated one . " these people only speak turkish , " he said .
" they see no need to learn german .
we think that 's the wrong way , and because of this we are critical of the project . " he said he feels there is a key difference between muslims gathering for worship in mosques and jews in synagogues in germany . " jews speak german , and they 've lived in germany since several hundred years , " rouhs said .
" because of this it 's no problem . " debate in jewish community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's synagogue in oranienburger straße in fact , the issue has also split the jewish community . jewish writer and journalist ralph giordano has come in for angry criticism within the community for taking a stance against the mosque on the grounds that it belies what he calls germany 's " failed integration . " what germany has seen instead is a " clash of two completely different cultures , " he said in the stuttgarter nachrichten . " the question is whether these cultures can ever be reconciled , " he said . his comments have drawn death threats from muslims , said giordano . " what kind of a state are we in that i can face a fatwa in germany ? " he asked . his colleague rafael seligmann told the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung that giordano 's position harks back to his childhood . " his persecution as a child under the nazis has eaten away at his soul , " he said . he also explained that many jews in germany are concerned by radical islam 's calls to destroy israel but insisted that giordano should not make his fears of anti-semitism an excuse to strip muslim citizens of their rights . public opinion pro cologne , meanwhile , launched an internet campaign to mobilize as many people as possible to attend an open forum in late may discussing the mosque . but when the meeting took place recently in a school assembly hall , a stone 's throw from the eventual site , the majority were more sympathetic to the mosque than to pro cologne . " for 20 years , thousands of people have been forced to say their prayers in an old factory building and i do n't think this is right , " said one local . " i think it 's very late that we start this process and i 'm very happy that we 're doing it now , " said another .
" i think it 's very good for cologne , and it 's very good for ehrenfeld ! " architect paul böhm is in charge of plans for the new mosque .
he told the crowd that despite the public uproar , he has no regrets taking the job … " i am a citizen of this town , and every day i see this old building which is nearly empty , but only a small room in the courtyard is used by muslims for praying , " he said .
" i 've always thought we need to find someone to build a real mosque for these people .
i 've wanted to help for a along time , and now i have the chance . " tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new mosque could be a new tourist atttraction for cologne citizens had their chance to put forward their complaints and concerns about the planned mosque , which focused mainly on traffic congestion on the already busy neighboring streets , and the height of the planned minarets . others simply took the floor to say how happy they were that cologne would finally have a proper mosque , adding that racism was not welcome in their multicultural city . marlis brederhorst , cologne 's official representative for integration was confident that the mosque would do the city good .

controversially , the building is now set to be revamped as a mosque .
one critic has even received death threats . the site occupies the corner of two major roads in the city of cologne .
on one side is a 12-storey high building housing an estate agency , on the other are the deutsche telekom offices . nestling next to a petrol station is a run-down former factory - gray , crumbling and architecturally unassuming . since 1984 , this has been the spiritual home of some 3 million muslims in germany . but they 're finally about to get an upgrade .
the turkish islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- is planning to use its own money to renovate the headquarters and build a fully fledged mosque complete with two minarets , as well as a cultural center for the community . long overdue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany make life hard for its muslims ?
predictably , the plan has divided the city of cologne .
opposition is rife , but others have leapt to ditib 's defense , saying it is high time that cologne 's 120,000 muslims had a proper place of worship . " at the moment the situation is terrible , " said bekir alboga , who is in charge of inter-religious and inter-cultural co-operation at ditib .
" people pray out here in the car park , even in winter when it 's cold , snowing or raining , because it is a very small prayer room .
and where are muslims meant to pray , while christians or jews are in their pretty , representative houses of god ?
should our muslims really pray on tarmac in the blazing summer sun ? " right-wing resistance but not everyone in cologne shares alboga 's point of view , not least the radical right-wing citizens ' movement pro-cologne .
members of this group point out that there are some 45 mosques in cologne already - based mainly in abandoned factories , warehouses and shops - and that these fulfill the muslim community 's needs . the group 's leader , manfred rouhs , said that a large muslim cultural center will serve to encourage a separated turkish society rather than an integrated one . " these people only speak turkish , " he said .
" they see no need to learn german .
we think that 's the wrong way , and because of this we are critical of the project . " he said he feels there is a key difference between muslims gathering for worship in mosques and jews in synagogues in germany . " jews speak german , and they 've lived in germany since several hundred years , " rouhs said .
" because of this it 's no problem . " debate in jewish community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's synagogue in oranienburger straße in fact , the issue has also split the jewish community . jewish writer and journalist ralph giordano has come in for angry criticism within the community for taking a stance against the mosque on the grounds that it belies what he calls germany 's " failed integration . " what germany has seen instead is a " clash of two completely different cultures , " he said in the stuttgarter nachrichten . " the question is whether these cultures can ever be reconciled , " he said . his comments have drawn death threats from muslims , said giordano . " what kind of a state are we in that i can face a fatwa in germany ? " he asked . his colleague rafael seligmann told the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung that giordano 's position harks back to his childhood . " his persecution as a child under the nazis has eaten away at his soul , " he said . he also explained that many jews in germany are concerned by radical islam 's calls to destroy israel but insisted that giordano should not make his fears of anti-semitism an excuse to strip muslim citizens of their rights . public opinion pro cologne , meanwhile , launched an internet campaign to mobilize as many people as possible to attend an open forum in late may discussing the mosque . but when the meeting took place recently in a school assembly hall , a stone 's throw from the eventual site , the majority were more sympathetic to the mosque than to pro cologne . " for 20 years , thousands of people have been forced to say their prayers in an old factory building and i do n't think this is right , " said one local . " i think it 's very late that we start this process and i 'm very happy that we 're doing it now , " said another .
" i think it 's very good for cologne , and it 's very good for ehrenfeld ! " architect paul böhm is in charge of plans for the new mosque .
he told the crowd that despite the public uproar , he has no regrets taking the job … " i am a citizen of this town , and every day i see this old building which is nearly empty , but only a small room in the courtyard is used by muslims for praying , " he said .
" i 've always thought we need to find someone to build a real mosque for these people .
i 've wanted to help for a along time , and now i have the chance . " tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new mosque could be a new tourist atttraction for cologne citizens had their chance to put forward their complaints and concerns about the planned mosque , which focused mainly on traffic congestion on the already busy neighboring streets , and the height of the planned minarets . others simply took the floor to say how happy they were that cologne would finally have a proper mosque , adding that racism was not welcome in their multicultural city . marlis brederhorst , cologne 's official representative for integration was confident that the mosque would do the city good . " it 's wonderful , " she said .
" cologne is a city of churches , and its most beautiful buildings are churches .
now we 'll have another tourist attraction , and i think it 's good for integration for the muslims in cologne because this will be a mosque they can be proud of .

most of those arrested were released after calm had returned to the city .

controversially , the building is now set to be revamped as a mosque .
one critic has even received death threats . the site occupies the corner of two major roads in the city of cologne .
on one side is a 12-storey high building housing an estate agency , on the other are the deutsche telekom offices . nestling next to a petrol station is a run-down former factory - gray , crumbling and architecturally unassuming . since 1984 , this has been the spiritual home of some 3 million muslims in germany . but they 're finally about to get an upgrade .
the turkish islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- is planning to use its own money to renovate the headquarters and build a fully fledged mosque complete with two minarets , as well as a cultural center for the community . long overdue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany make life hard for its muslims ?
predictably , the plan has divided the city of cologne .
opposition is rife , but others have leapt to ditib 's defense , saying it is high time that cologne 's 120,000 muslims had a proper place of worship . " at the moment the situation is terrible , " said bekir alboga , who is in charge of inter-religious and inter-cultural co-operation at ditib .
" people pray out here in the car park , even in winter when it 's cold , snowing or raining , because it is a very small prayer room .
and where are muslims meant to pray , while christians or jews are in their pretty , representative houses of god ?
should our muslims really pray on tarmac in the blazing summer sun ? " right-wing resistance but not everyone in cologne shares alboga 's point of view , not least the radical right-wing citizens ' movement pro-cologne .
members of this group point out that there are some 45 mosques in cologne already - based mainly in abandoned factories , warehouses and shops - and that these fulfill the muslim community 's needs . the group 's leader , manfred rouhs , said that a large muslim cultural center will serve to encourage a separated turkish society rather than an integrated one . " these people only speak turkish , " he said .
" they see no need to learn german .
we think that 's the wrong way , and because of this we are critical of the project . " he said he feels there is a key difference between muslims gathering for worship in mosques and jews in synagogues in germany . " jews speak german , and they 've lived in germany since several hundred years , " rouhs said .
" because of this it 's no problem . " debate in jewish community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's synagogue in oranienburger straße in fact , the issue has also split the jewish community . jewish writer and journalist ralph giordano has come in for angry criticism within the community for taking a stance against the mosque on the grounds that it belies what he calls germany 's " failed integration . " what germany has seen instead is a " clash of two completely different cultures , " he said in the stuttgarter nachrichten . " the question is whether these cultures can ever be reconciled , " he said . his comments have drawn death threats from muslims , said giordano . " what kind of a state are we in that i can face a fatwa in germany ? " he asked . his colleague rafael seligmann told the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung that giordano 's position harks back to his childhood . " his persecution as a child under the nazis has eaten away at his soul , " he said . he also explained that many jews in germany are concerned by radical islam 's calls to destroy israel but insisted that giordano should not make his fears of anti-semitism an excuse to strip muslim citizens of their rights . public opinion pro cologne , meanwhile , launched an internet campaign to mobilize as many people as possible to attend an open forum in late may discussing the mosque . but when the meeting took place recently in a school assembly hall , a stone 's throw from the eventual site , the majority were more sympathetic to the mosque than to pro cologne . " for 20 years , thousands of people have been forced to say their prayers in an old factory building and i do n't think this is right , " said one local . " i think it 's very late that we start this process and i 'm very happy that we 're doing it now , " said another .
" i think it 's very good for cologne , and it 's very good for ehrenfeld ! " architect paul böhm is in charge of plans for the new mosque .
he told the crowd that despite the public uproar , he has no regrets taking the job … " i am a citizen of this town , and every day i see this old building which is nearly empty , but only a small room in the courtyard is used by muslims for praying , " he said .
" i 've always thought we need to find someone to build a real mosque for these people .
i 've wanted to help for a along time , and now i have the chance . " tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new mosque could be a new tourist atttraction for cologne citizens had their chance to put forward their complaints and concerns about the planned mosque , which focused mainly on traffic congestion on the already busy neighboring streets , and the height of the planned minarets . others simply took the floor to say how happy they were that cologne would finally have a proper mosque , adding that racism was not welcome in their multicultural city . marlis brederhorst , cologne 's official representative for integration was confident that the mosque would do the city good . " it 's wonderful , " she said .
" cologne is a city of churches , and its most beautiful buildings are churches .
now we 'll have another tourist attraction , and i think it 's good for integration for the muslims in cologne because this will be a mosque they can be proud of .

lavrov shrugged off american insistence that its plan to deploy missile defense hardware in poland and the czech republic poses no threat , casting it as an attempt to encircle russia militarily .
" if strategic components of the american arsenal appear in europe near our borders , we are obliged to ... cut off potential threats from that deployment , " lavrov said in comments broadcast on the state-run television channel vesti-24 .

"
after repeated warnings from russia that the us proposals would set off a new arms race , moscow tested a new multi-warhead missile last week that putin said was a direct response to us actions .
and in his boldest remarks to date on the issue , the russian president has warned that russia would once again target europe with missiles like it did during the cold war .
" the anti-missile shield is part of a nuclear system that protects american territory , " putin said in an interview with newspapers from the group of eight industrialized nations .
" for the first time in history , elements of it are being moved to europe .
" we will get new targets in europe " " if the us nuclear potential extends across the european territory , we will get new targets in europe , " he said .
" it will then be up to our military experts to identify which targets will be aimed by ballistic missiles and which ones will be aimed by cruise missiles . "
the interview was due to be published on monday but pre-released by germany 's der spiegel magazine .
putin and his peers are meeting for a three-day g8 summit which begins in germany on wednesday .
" we want to re-balance the defense instruments with more efficient offensive equipment but we know that this could lead to a renewed arms race for which we are , however , not responsible , " putin said .
tensions over the plan have helped send relations between the two states to levels many analysts say have n't been seen since the cold war .

developing a missile defense system to protect deployed troops from missile attacks is one of several joint programs by the nato-russia council , and is scheduled to be completed by 2010 .

but the trend is unlikely to continue on this scale once the meeting is over . since the beginning of the year , the group has received around 100 new membership applications a month .
in may , this even leapt to 500 - thanks , in part , to the police raids against g8 opponents in germany , the restrictions on demonstrations and other controversial measures that have hit the headlines .
attac has just under 18,000 members in germany and approximately 90,000 worldwide .
influx of members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac has grown fast in response to the g8 summit this wave of recruitment is clearly a result of the mobilization of the group ahead of next week 's summit .
since last autumn , the network has organized more than 1,000 discussion meetings in germany with the aim of mobilizing protesters .
attac has also organized events designed to give demonstrators practical training for the major rally , which took place on saturday in rostock .
in so-called handicraft workshops , members were making banners and dummies .
in action sessions , they 've been practising peaceful sit-down blockades .
g8 boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in attac workshops people can learn to make cardboard cut-outs like these ones " since the start of the year we 've been almost exclusively concentrating on the g8 , " said the attac spokeswoman frauke distelrath .
this growth spurt follows a period of crisis .
the german magazine stern reported last year that more and more people were leaving the organization .
but even in 2006 , the lowest point for the organization since it was set up in 2000 , there was a net gain of 10 members a month .

controversially , the building is now set to be revamped as a mosque .
one critic has even received death threats . the site occupies the corner of two major roads in the city of cologne .
on one side is a 12-storey high building housing an estate agency , on the other are the deutsche telekom offices . nestling next to a petrol station is a run-down former factory - gray , crumbling and architecturally unassuming . since 1984 , this has been the spiritual home of some 3 million muslims in germany . but they 're finally about to get an upgrade .
the turkish islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- is planning to use its own money to renovate the headquarters and build a fully fledged mosque complete with two minarets , as well as a cultural center for the community . long overdue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany make life hard for its muslims ?
predictably , the plan has divided the city of cologne .
opposition is rife , but others have leapt to ditib 's defense , saying it is high time that cologne 's 120,000 muslims had a proper place of worship . " at the moment the situation is terrible , " said bekir alboga , who is in charge of inter-religious and inter-cultural co-operation at ditib .
" people pray out here in the car park , even in winter when it 's cold , snowing or raining , because it is a very small prayer room .
and where are muslims meant to pray , while christians or jews are in their pretty , representative houses of god ?
should our muslims really pray on tarmac in the blazing summer sun ? " right-wing resistance but not everyone in cologne shares alboga 's point of view , not least the radical right-wing citizens ' movement pro-cologne .
members of this group point out that there are some 45 mosques in cologne already - based mainly in abandoned factories , warehouses and shops - and that these fulfill the muslim community 's needs . the group 's leader , manfred rouhs , said that a large muslim cultural center will serve to encourage a separated turkish society rather than an integrated one . " these people only speak turkish , " he said .
" they see no need to learn german .
we think that 's the wrong way , and because of this we are critical of the project . " he said he feels there is a key difference between muslims gathering for worship in mosques and jews in synagogues in germany . " jews speak german , and they 've lived in germany since several hundred years , " rouhs said .
" because of this it 's no problem . " debate in jewish community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's synagogue in oranienburger straße in fact , the issue has also split the jewish community . jewish writer and journalist ralph giordano has come in for angry criticism within the community for taking a stance against the mosque on the grounds that it belies what he calls germany 's " failed integration . " what germany has seen instead is a " clash of two completely different cultures , " he said in the stuttgarter nachrichten . " the question is whether these cultures can ever be reconciled , " he said . his comments have drawn death threats from muslims , said giordano . " what kind of a state are we in that i can face a fatwa in germany ? " he asked . his colleague rafael seligmann told the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung that giordano 's position harks back to his childhood . " his persecution as a child under the nazis has eaten away at his soul , " he said . he also explained that many jews in germany are concerned by radical islam 's calls to destroy israel but insisted that giordano should not make his fears of anti-semitism an excuse to strip muslim citizens of their rights . public opinion pro cologne , meanwhile , launched an internet campaign to mobilize as many people as possible to attend an open forum in late may discussing the mosque . but when the meeting took place recently in a school assembly hall , a stone 's throw from the eventual site , the majority were more sympathetic to the mosque than to pro cologne . " for 20 years , thousands of people have been forced to say their prayers in an old factory building and i do n't think this is right , " said one local . " i think it 's very late that we start this process and i 'm very happy that we 're doing it now , " said another .
" i think it 's very good for cologne , and it 's very good for ehrenfeld ! " architect paul böhm is in charge of plans for the new mosque .
he told the crowd that despite the public uproar , he has no regrets taking the job … " i am a citizen of this town , and every day i see this old building which is nearly empty , but only a small room in the courtyard is used by muslims for praying , " he said .
" i 've always thought we need to find someone to build a real mosque for these people .
i 've wanted to help for a along time , and now i have the chance . " tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new mosque could be a new tourist atttraction for cologne citizens had their chance to put forward their complaints and concerns about the planned mosque , which focused mainly on traffic congestion on the already busy neighboring streets , and the height of the planned minarets . others simply took the floor to say how happy they were that cologne would finally have a proper mosque , adding that racism was not welcome in their multicultural city . marlis brederhorst , cologne 's official representative for integration was confident that the mosque would do the city good . " it 's wonderful , " she said .
" cologne is a city of churches , and its most beautiful buildings are churches .
now we 'll have another tourist attraction , and i think it 's good for integration for the muslims in cologne because this will be a mosque they can be proud of .

but the trend is unlikely to continue on this scale once the meeting is over . since the beginning of the year , the group has received around 100 new membership applications a month .
in may , this even leapt to 500 - thanks , in part , to the police raids against g8 opponents in germany , the restrictions on demonstrations and other controversial measures that have hit the headlines .
attac has just under 18,000 members in germany and approximately 90,000 worldwide .
influx of members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac has grown fast in response to the g8 summit this wave of recruitment is clearly a result of the mobilization of the group ahead of next week 's summit .
since last autumn , the network has organized more than 1,000 discussion meetings in germany with the aim of mobilizing protesters .
attac has also organized events designed to give demonstrators practical training for the major rally , which took place on saturday in rostock .
in so-called handicraft workshops , members were making banners and dummies .
in action sessions , they 've been practising peaceful sit-down blockades .
g8 boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in attac workshops people can learn to make cardboard cut-outs like these ones " since the start of the year we 've been almost exclusively concentrating on the g8 , " said the attac spokeswoman frauke distelrath .
this growth spurt follows a period of crisis .
the german magazine stern reported last year that more and more people were leaving the organization .
but even in 2006 , the lowest point for the organization since it was set up in 2000 , there was a net gain of 10 members a month .
this is a situation that most political parties , unions and churches can only dream of . political scientist claus leggewie and author of the book " die globalisierung und ihre gegner " -lrb- globalization and its critics -rrb- described attac 's experience as a " normal growth crisis . "
he said the network was experiencing a very strong influx of members that would inevitably die back .

but he said the anti-globalization movement had been spared any real downturn because of the regular summit meetings that they can mobilize against .

he thinks it is very unlikely that the demands of the globalization critics will be fulfilled in the near future . but the movement has made its mark on the g8 agenda with themes such as climate change and africa .

lavrov shrugged off american insistence that its plan to deploy missile defense hardware in poland and the czech republic poses no threat , casting it as an attempt to encircle russia militarily .
" if strategic components of the american arsenal appear in europe near our borders , we are obliged to ... cut off potential threats from that deployment , " lavrov said in comments broadcast on the state-run television channel vesti-24 .
a threat to russia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials say the system poses no threat to russia the us plan " wonderfully fits the overall picture of american global anti-missile defense , which according to our analysis - just look at the map - is being deployed along russia 's perimeter , and also china 's , incidentally . "
after repeated warnings from russia that the us proposals would set off a new arms race , moscow tested a new multi-warhead missile last week that putin said was a direct response to us actions .
and in his boldest remarks to date on the issue , the russian president has warned that russia would once again target europe with missiles like it did during the cold war .
" the anti-missile shield is part of a nuclear system that protects american territory , " putin said in an interview with newspapers from the group of eight industrialized nations .
" for the first time in history , elements of it are being moved to europe .
" we will get new targets in europe " " if the us nuclear potential extends across the european territory , we will get new targets in europe , " he said .
" it will then be up to our military experts to identify which targets will be aimed by ballistic missiles and which ones will be aimed by cruise missiles . "
the interview was due to be published on monday but pre-released by germany 's der spiegel magazine .
putin and his peers are meeting for a three-day g8 summit which begins in germany on wednesday .
" we want to re-balance the defense instruments with more efficient offensive equipment but we know that this could lead to a renewed arms race for which we are , however , not responsible , " putin said .
tensions over the plan have helped send relations between the two states to levels many analysts say have n't been seen since the cold war .
nato-russian cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can nato help diffuse the situation ?
in spite of the sharp words , lavrov pointed to a previous avenue of russian cooperation with the west on missile defence , saying : " it would be better to resume work within the framework of the nato-russia council on creating theater missile defense . "
developing a missile defense system to protect deployed troops from missile attacks is one of several joint programs by the nato-russia council , and is scheduled to be completed by 2010 .
washington says the central european shield , which foresees 10 missile interceptors in poland and radar in the czech republic , would protect against potential threats from states such as iran or north korea .
russia has responded with skepticism , suggesting the shield 's real goal is reducing russia 's military strength . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin lashes out at us , eu as russia tests missile russian president putin warned tuesday that a planned us missile defense shield would make europe a " powder keg " and lashed out at his eu critics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : security and protests at the g8 summit us demonstrators join the g8 protests police prevent protests as g8 summit gets going in germany the demonized face of g8 protests locals live with g8 protests in own backyard globalization -pipe- 03.06.2007 new members flock to join anti-globalization group in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " no-democracy zone heiligendamm , constitution disbanded " read the signs with the g8 summit in heiligendamm , germany just round the corner , attac is booming like never before .
but the trend is unlikely to continue on this scale once the meeting is over . since the beginning of the year , the group has received around 100 new membership applications a month .
in may , this even leapt to 500 - thanks , in part , to the police raids against g8 opponents in germany , the restrictions on demonstrations and other controversial measures that have hit the headlines .
attac has just under 18,000 members in germany and approximately 90,000 worldwide .
influx of members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac has grown fast in response to the g8 summit this wave of recruitment is clearly a result of the mobilization of the group ahead of next week 's summit .
since last autumn , the network has organized more than 1,000 discussion meetings in germany with the aim of mobilizing protesters .
attac has also organized events designed to give demonstrators practical training for the major rally , which took place on saturday in rostock .
in so-called handicraft workshops , members were making banners and dummies .
in action sessions , they 've been practising peaceful sit-down blockades .
g8 boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in attac workshops people can learn to make cardboard cut-outs like these ones " since the start of the year we 've been almost exclusively concentrating on the g8 , " said the attac spokeswoman frauke distelrath .
this growth spurt follows a period of crisis .
the german magazine stern reported last year that more and more people were leaving the organization .
but even in 2006 , the lowest point for the organization since it was set up in 2000 , there was a net gain of 10 members a month .
this is a situation that most political parties , unions and churches can only dream of . political scientist claus leggewie and author of the book " die globalisierung und ihre gegner " -lrb- globalization and its critics -rrb- described attac 's experience as a " normal growth crisis . "
he said the network was experiencing a very strong influx of members that would inevitably die back .
growth will slow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attac includes conservatives like heiner geissler as well as left-wingers " social movements can not afford to be in a state of perpetual mobilization , " leggewie said .
" it will be left to a few activists to ensure stability and continuity . "
but he said the anti-globalization movement had been spared any real downturn because of the regular summit meetings that they can mobilize against . " criticism of globalization is a cross-party theme that affects almost all areas of politics - so the movement should also last longer than movements devoted to single causes that run out of steam at some point , " said ansgar klein , the editor of the research journal " neue soziale bewegungen " -lrb- new social movements -rrb- .
he thinks it is very unlikely that the demands of the globalization critics will be fulfilled in the near future . but the movement has made its mark on the g8 agenda with themes such as climate change and africa .
very recently , german chancellor angela merkel , who currently holds the six-month rotating presidency , said the summit was about " giving a human face to globalization " .
she also expressly welcomed the planned actions and protests .
mainstream response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel spoke about giving a human aspect to globalization in the lead-up to the summit " if globalization critique has also been taken up by the german chancellor then we will have to watch how these avowals are turned into practice , " said peter wahl , a member of attac 's co-ordination council .
he said that it would be important in the future to focus on concrete conceptual work . that could be more difficult than organizing isolated campaigns or mobilizing protest against a summit .
some 120 - very diverse - organizations belong to the network .
the spectrum spans church groups , environmental groups and unions .
attac counts both the former cdu general secretary heiner geissler and oskar lafontaine , of the left party , among its members . when the summit is over , the members will have more time to devote to working on their political program - another big project such as opposition to the g8 summit is not presently in sight .
the boom , currently being experienced by the organization , is likely to come to an end then , too .
activists like peter wahl are taking this in their stride .
" that 's just the normal rise and fall of the political cycle , " he said . dennis stute -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de almost 1,000 hurt after anti-g8 protests in germany police and protest organizers sunday laid the blame for the riot that erupted during an anti-g8 rally in the german port of rostock on groups bent on violence that had infiltrated the largely peaceful demonstors .

controversially , the building is now set to be revamped as a mosque .
one critic has even received death threats . the site occupies the corner of two major roads in the city of cologne .
on one side is a 12-storey high building housing an estate agency , on the other are the deutsche telekom offices . nestling next to a petrol station is a run-down former factory - gray , crumbling and architecturally unassuming . since 1984 , this has been the spiritual home of some 3 million muslims in germany . but they 're finally about to get an upgrade .
the turkish islamic union -lrb- ditib -rrb- is planning to use its own money to renovate the headquarters and build a fully fledged mosque complete with two minarets , as well as a cultural center for the community . long overdue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany make life hard for its muslims ?
predictably , the plan has divided the city of cologne .
opposition is rife , but others have leapt to ditib 's defense , saying it is high time that cologne 's 120,000 muslims had a proper place of worship . " at the moment the situation is terrible , " said bekir alboga , who is in charge of inter-religious and inter-cultural co-operation at ditib .
" people pray out here in the car park , even in winter when it 's cold , snowing or raining , because it is a very small prayer room .
and where are muslims meant to pray , while christians or jews are in their pretty , representative houses of god ?
should our muslims really pray on tarmac in the blazing summer sun ? " right-wing resistance but not everyone in cologne shares alboga 's point of view , not least the radical right-wing citizens ' movement pro-cologne .
members of this group point out that there are some 45 mosques in cologne already - based mainly in abandoned factories , warehouses and shops - and that these fulfill the muslim community 's needs . the group 's leader , manfred rouhs , said that a large muslim cultural center will serve to encourage a separated turkish society rather than an integrated one . " these people only speak turkish , " he said .
" they see no need to learn german .
we think that 's the wrong way , and because of this we are critical of the project . " he said he feels there is a key difference between muslims gathering for worship in mosques and jews in synagogues in germany . " jews speak german , and they 've lived in germany since several hundred years , " rouhs said .
" because of this it 's no problem . " debate in jewish community bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's synagogue in oranienburger straße in fact , the issue has also split the jewish community . jewish writer and journalist ralph giordano has come in for angry criticism within the community for taking a stance against the mosque on the grounds that it belies what he calls germany 's " failed integration . " what germany has seen instead is a " clash of two completely different cultures , " he said in the stuttgarter nachrichten . " the question is whether these cultures can ever be reconciled , " he said . his comments have drawn death threats from muslims , said giordano . " what kind of a state are we in that i can face a fatwa in germany ? " he asked . his colleague rafael seligmann told the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung that giordano 's position harks back to his childhood . " his persecution as a child under the nazis has eaten away at his soul , " he said . he also explained that many jews in germany are concerned by radical islam 's calls to destroy israel but insisted that giordano should not make his fears of anti-semitism an excuse to strip muslim citizens of their rights . public opinion pro cologne , meanwhile , launched an internet campaign to mobilize as many people as possible to attend an open forum in late may discussing the mosque . but when the meeting took place recently in a school assembly hall , a stone 's throw from the eventual site , the majority were more sympathetic to the mosque than to pro cologne . " for 20 years , thousands of people have been forced to say their prayers in an old factory building and i do n't think this is right , " said one local . " i think it 's very late that we start this process and i 'm very happy that we 're doing it now , " said another .
" i think it 's very good for cologne , and it 's very good for ehrenfeld ! " architect paul böhm is in charge of plans for the new mosque .
he told the crowd that despite the public uproar , he has no regrets taking the job … " i am a citizen of this town , and every day i see this old building which is nearly empty , but only a small room in the courtyard is used by muslims for praying , " he said .
" i 've always thought we need to find someone to build a real mosque for these people .
i 've wanted to help for a along time , and now i have the chance . " tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new mosque could be a new tourist atttraction for cologne citizens had their chance to put forward their complaints and concerns about the planned mosque , which focused mainly on traffic congestion on the already busy neighboring streets , and the height of the planned minarets . others simply took the floor to say how happy they were that cologne would finally have a proper mosque , adding that racism was not welcome in their multicultural city . marlis brederhorst , cologne 's official representative for integration was confident that the mosque would do the city good . " it 's wonderful , " she said .
" cologne is a city of churches , and its most beautiful buildings are churches .
now we 'll have another tourist attraction , and i think it 's good for integration for the muslims in cologne because this will be a mosque they can be proud of .

it will be watching not just to see whether her direction will be controversial or , as it has happened in the past , roundly panned .
they will be straining to see what the future of the famed bayreuth opera festival might look like .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wagner family : gudrun -lrb- left -rrb- , wolfgang and katharina wagner recently told the munich newspaper münchner merkur that she felt ready to take charge of the summer festival , an annual high-profile magnet for the world 's music lovers that was founded by her great-grandfather , the operatic composer richard wagner . family feud much ink has been spilled to date detailing the wagner family 's ongoing feud over who should run the festival .
at different times , wolfgang 's other daughter by an earlier marriage , eva wagner-pasquier , and nike wagner , the daughter of wolfgang 's late brother wieland , have both laid claim to the throne on bayreuth 's fabled green hill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young wagner has been on a fast track to the top many see katharina wagner , wolfgang 's daughter with his current wife gudrun , as the person who is least capable of keeping audiences interested in the conservative but well-loved festival .
to date , katharina 's high-profile opera debuts have been ill received .
in 2006 , berlin audiences booed the opening night performance of puccini 's " il trittico " staged by the young wagner .
but katharina 's father and mother have held firm in their apparent resolve to have her take the reins from wolfgang wagner , who is 87 and has a lifetime contract with the bayreuth festival .
only wolfgang can terminate his contract , according to his 62-year-old wife .
much riding on " mastersinger " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel attends bayreuth every year due to arthritis , wolfgang wagner can now only walk with difficulty , gudrun wagner said .
in an interview published wednesday by the german weekly bunte , gudrun wagner said : " a wagner always runs bayreuth .
not keeping it in the family would mean unnecessarily abandoning something that exists nowhere else in the world . "
several years ago the director failed in a bid to install gudrun – who used to be wolfgang wagner 's secretary and is now widely seen as the power behind the throne at the festival - as his successor .
now , if the audience of wagner lovers accept the daughter 's first bayreuth production in july , her succession is seen as certain .
contenders to the throne gudrun wagner said in the interview that her daughter was " a very able artist and cultural manager who knows the ropes . "

it will be watching not just to see whether her direction will be controversial or , as it has happened in the past , roundly panned .
they will be straining to see what the future of the famed bayreuth opera festival might look like .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wagner family : gudrun -lrb- left -rrb- , wolfgang and katharina wagner recently told the munich newspaper münchner merkur that she felt ready to take charge of the summer festival , an annual high-profile magnet for the world 's music lovers that was founded by her great-grandfather , the operatic composer richard wagner . family feud much ink has been spilled to date detailing the wagner family 's ongoing feud over who should run the festival .
at different times , wolfgang 's other daughter by an earlier marriage , eva wagner-pasquier , and nike wagner , the daughter of wolfgang 's late brother wieland , have both laid claim to the throne on bayreuth 's fabled green hill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young wagner has been on a fast track to the top many see katharina wagner , wolfgang 's daughter with his current wife gudrun , as the person who is least capable of keeping audiences interested in the conservative but well-loved festival .
to date , katharina 's high-profile opera debuts have been ill received .
in 2006 , berlin audiences booed the opening night performance of puccini 's " il trittico " staged by the young wagner .
but katharina 's father and mother have held firm in their apparent resolve to have her take the reins from wolfgang wagner , who is 87 and has a lifetime contract with the bayreuth festival .
only wolfgang can terminate his contract , according to his 62-year-old wife .
much riding on " mastersinger " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel attends bayreuth every year due to arthritis , wolfgang wagner can now only walk with difficulty , gudrun wagner said .
in an interview published wednesday by the german weekly bunte , gudrun wagner said : " a wagner always runs bayreuth .
not keeping it in the family would mean unnecessarily abandoning something that exists nowhere else in the world . "
several years ago the director failed in a bid to install gudrun – who used to be wolfgang wagner 's secretary and is now widely seen as the power behind the throne at the festival - as his successor .
now , if the audience of wagner lovers accept the daughter 's first bayreuth production in july , her succession is seen as certain .
contenders to the throne gudrun wagner said in the interview that her daughter was " a very able artist and cultural manager who knows the ropes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner heads the weimar arts festival another great-granddaughter of richard wagner , nike wagner , 61 , has repeatedly voiced a desire to take over the " family business . "
she is the daughter of wieland wagner , the late brother of wolfgang wagner , and an accomplished stage and opera director .
but katharina wagner told muenchner merkur last week : " if the shareholders agree and i am satisfied with the terms , i would be ready to take over . "
she said she would not be happy to share the leadership in a team arrangement . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : bayreuth festival goes for youth in 2007 the bayreuth festival is keeping wagner in the family , announcing that the composer 's great-granddaughter , katharina , will open the festival with a new production of " the mastersingers of nuremberg .

the two-week meeting in the hague will also seek protection for the sawfish , cedar , and some corals .
conservation groups are targeting china 's tiger farming business .
the three-yearly cites meetings set restrictions on trade in species regarded as endangered or threatened .
this year 's summit on the 32-year old treaty brings 175 national delegations to the hague , along with other un agencies , and conservation and animal welfare organisations .
opposing visions two starkly different approaches to the largely banned ivory trade will be up for discussion .

concerns over mechanisms for monitoring the trade had prevented the second sale , approved in 2002 , from taking place .
but on the eve of the meeting , a technical committee decided that mechanisms to monitor poaching in africa were sufficiently effective , and that japan had established proper safeguards to ensure only the designated ivory was imported .
south africa , botswana and namibia will sell 60 tonnes to the asian nation .
conservationists believe any extension in legal exports will fuel the already substantial illegal trade .
" every time cites even talks about relaxing the ivory ban , poaching goes up , " said peter pueschel of the international fund for animal welfare -lrb- ifaw -rrb- .
a recent report from the wildlife trade monitoring organisation traffic said there were now 92 seizures of illegal ivory seizures each month .
all at sea fresh from a string of defeats at the international whaling commission in alaska , japan is trying another route to an expansion of whaling by asking cites to review restrictions on trading whale meat .
conservation and animal welfare organisations are also alarmed by china 's bid for a relaxation of rules on trading products from tiger farms which have sprung up in recent decades .
" if you open up a legal trade in tiger parts , it opens up a huge demand which can obviously cause problems for the wild populations , " observed dave eastham , head of wildlife at the world society for the protection of animals -lrb- wspa -rrb- .

it was " an action movie and i was in it , " bowen told an audience at the 20th hay festival in powys .
of seeing dead bodies , the cardiff-born journalist said he was struck more by the impact of war on the living .
" what affects me more are people who are alive , " he said .
" when people are dead there is nothing you can do for them .

he said his partner said it was like he was " having an affair with an entire country . "
bowen admitted there could be moral ambivalence , such as covering the " grotesque barbarity " of serbian shelling of a funeral of two children , but which brought a compelling story .
" for us to have a good day , means someone has one of the worst days of their lives or the last day of their life . "
bad dreams bowen admitted he could understand world war ii veterans and their heightened memories , saying experiencing conflict " turns up the volume of everything , makes the colours brighter . "
he also talked of the watershed moment in 2000 when his driver / fixer abed takkoush was killed by an artillery shell in southern lebanon , as bowen filmed a piece to camera .
as well as " feeling guilty having survived " , he suffered post traumatic stress .
" there were bad dreams , hyper vigilance - when you think something bad is going to happen .
" i 'd be in a taxi queue at paddington and looking at where i could shelter from the bombs .
" i 'd get flashbacks , but had some treatment and therapy and once i was reassured that this was quite normal , i was on the mend . "
part of this rehabilitation was his stint as presenter on bbc breakfast , which he felt surreal and said left him frustrated , " kicking the walls " as he walked to the studio .

" i was also getting up a 3.30 in the morning , it was like flying to new york and back , it was like i had permanent jet lag . "
reporting now in a global 24-hour media , correspondents were now " much more visible " , said bowen .
" a lot of people want to influence the news agenda .
that can be quite benign but at a more sinister level it can be appalling and violent . "
as for the prospects for the middle east , exacerbated by the problems in iraq , bowen admitted it was " hard to be positive . "
he said : " i 'm pessimistic - i really hope i 'm wrong " .
he said he could see problems which were " going to last a long time and get worse .
