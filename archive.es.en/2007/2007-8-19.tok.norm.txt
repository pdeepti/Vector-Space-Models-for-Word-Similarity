" i rate this a very convincing and compact concept , " bach said .
" i am happy that the winter sports federations ratified it unanimously and that the decision was reached quickly . "
the german winter sports federations agreed on friday that a munich bid would only involve three venues .
under the proposals , the city itself would stage ice events , garmisch-partenkirchen would offer snow sports and bobsleigh , while skeleton sledding and luge would take place at königssee .
having hosted the summer olympics in 1972 and now bidding for the winter olympics , munich is hoping to become the first city to stage both prestigious events .
garmisch-partenkirchen organized the only winter olympics so far in germany in 1936 .
unique chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : königssee already ran with salzburg in an unsuccessful bid to win the 2014 games " the german winter sports federations see munich 's bid as a unique chance and support it unanimously , " said alfons hoermann , president of the german ski federation , after the meeting .
traditional resorts such as ruhpolding -lrb- biathlon -rrb- , inzell -lrb- speed skating -rrb- and oberstdorf -lrb- nordic ski -rrb- were dropped from the concept , with bach reiterating that " only a compact proposal has a chance . "
the final dosb decision on the munich bid is set for early december .
it has already ruled out a bid for summer games in the near future despite interest from hamburg and berlin .
bavaria 's state capital will reportedly have to spend up to 35 million euros -lrb- $ 48 million -rrb- if the dosb approves its bid .
vancouver is set to host the 2010 winter games and sochi was last month elected to stage the event in 2014 .
the 2018 host city will be elected by the international olympic committee in four years ' time . dw-staff / dpa -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

book reviews are known to incur the wrath of authors and publishers , as well as readers .
that 's why professional literary critics are not exactly the most popular bunch in germany . literary critics enjoy a conflicting reputation in germany .
they are much needed when it comes to weeding out the most important out of 90.000 books that get published in the country year after year .
yet they are also seen as bigheaded know-it-all 's who shred other authors to pieces as payback for their own unsuccessful writing careers .
much has changed in the german marketplace for books over the past decade : reviews no longer exist only in newspapers , journals , magazines and special book-broadcasts , but also on the internet , written by readers for readers .
some see this as a trend that could endanger professional literary criticism .
malicious freeloaders ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics are needed to single out the most important books " you do n't want to be a critic , because it has a bad reputation in the society , " said critic jörg magenau , who writes for the nationwide süddeutsche zeitung .
" critics are people who are malicious about other people 's accomplishments , while they themselves have nothing to offer - that is the cliché of the critic . "
" it 's like being a guy who kind of freeloads off of other people 's accomplishments .
you do n't want to be that guy .
you want to be productive yourself .
i think that 's what 's behind it , " he said .
indeed , literature critics in germany have a reputation as humorless know-it-alls , who are disliked by authors , publishers and readers alike .
above it all , critics today are threatened by the publishers ' marketing .
reading in an accelerated marketplace reviewers have to read more and they have to read faster if they want to succeed in the accelerated publishing market .
they also have to come to terms with the fact that their reviews are not paid well , unless they join the small and exclusive group of full-time critics for major newspapers or journals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has become an important source for book recommendations sigrid löffler , the " grand lady " of german literary criticism and publisher of the magazine literature , is very skeptical about her own profession .
" i can only discourage people to be freelancing literary critics in this marketplace , " löffler said .
" the critic would have to write a great number of reviews to be able to earn a living from his or her writing .
reviewers are paid per each line , so their reviews have to be very long .
they also have to read faster and faster , and to produce their texts more rapidly .
all of this is very ominous !
it harms the quality of the texts , as well as the opinion , " she said .
literary middleman sounds better than literary critic elke heidenreich , host of " lesen " - a successful tv show about literature - strictly avoids the label " critic " even though she is sometimes referred to as germany 's female literary pope -lrb- in reference to marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's most famous critic -rrb- .
she likes to call herself a middleman and not a critic .
" i am innately a literary critic , but with my role on tv , i am not a literary middleman , " she said .
is it because the word " critic " sounds too intellectual ?
what happened to the german tradition of criticism along the lines of kurt tucholsky , alfred polgar or alfred kerr ?
is there anything left of that critical spirit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt tucholsky pop-literature changed the world of criticism " i think that the standards are getting lost , " said writer , journalist and critic hubert winkels .
" and not only the technical standards , but also the value and appreciation of what literature can be , " he said .
winkels believes that a shift happened within the practice of literary criticism itself , due to the hype which the success of pop-literature created in germany ten years ago .
authors have become just like pop stars , books have become like top-ten-hits , and readings have turned into parties .
nowadays , criticism is also forced to produce immediate effects and satisfy directly .
this goes against the notion of what literary criticism traditionally stood for : written analysis of books .
ready when the book is published bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the literature hype has changed a lot about the way books are reviewed an anti-intellectual atmosphere in the german book industry is evident .
there is an addiction to superlatives : praising books to heavens or sending them off to hell .
there is also a bizarre competition among german newspapers to review the top books so quickly , that critics sometimes do n't even have enough time to read the books . " the increasing trend is to write the review of an allegedly important book on the day that it is published , " löfler said .
" because of that , some of the really important new books are read negligently and quickly , because there is not enough time . "
" on the day of publication , there are 150 reviews in the german-speaking area .
a conversation among the critics is impossible .
there is no exchange . " she said .
reviews are needed whether good or bad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some books get up to 150 reviews on the day they are published many readers today consider book criticism as a kind of book recommendation , whether on the internet or on television .

" if authors write books , and we do n't talk about them , that 's something resembling death for literature and every single author , " said literary critic jörg magenau .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 19.08.2007 literary critics in germany : despised but much needed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who wil influence our decisions about what books to read in the future ?
book reviews are known to incur the wrath of authors and publishers , as well as readers .
that 's why professional literary critics are not exactly the most popular bunch in germany . literary critics enjoy a conflicting reputation in germany .
they are much needed when it comes to weeding out the most important out of 90.000 books that get published in the country year after year .
yet they are also seen as bigheaded know-it-all 's who shred other authors to pieces as payback for their own unsuccessful writing careers .
much has changed in the german marketplace for books over the past decade : reviews no longer exist only in newspapers , journals , magazines and special book-broadcasts , but also on the internet , written by readers for readers .
some see this as a trend that could endanger professional literary criticism .
malicious freeloaders ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics are needed to single out the most important books " you do n't want to be a critic , because it has a bad reputation in the society , " said critic jörg magenau , who writes for the nationwide süddeutsche zeitung .
" critics are people who are malicious about other people 's accomplishments , while they themselves have nothing to offer - that is the cliché of the critic . "
" it 's like being a guy who kind of freeloads off of other people 's accomplishments .
you do n't want to be that guy .
you want to be productive yourself .
i think that 's what 's behind it , " he said .
indeed , literature critics in germany have a reputation as humorless know-it-alls , who are disliked by authors , publishers and readers alike .
above it all , critics today are threatened by the publishers ' marketing .
reading in an accelerated marketplace reviewers have to read more and they have to read faster if they want to succeed in the accelerated publishing market .
they also have to come to terms with the fact that their reviews are not paid well , unless they join the small and exclusive group of full-time critics for major newspapers or journals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has become an important source for book recommendations sigrid löffler , the " grand lady " of german literary criticism and publisher of the magazine literature , is very skeptical about her own profession .
" i can only discourage people to be freelancing literary critics in this marketplace , " löffler said .
" the critic would have to write a great number of reviews to be able to earn a living from his or her writing .
reviewers are paid per each line , so their reviews have to be very long .
they also have to read faster and faster , and to produce their texts more rapidly .
all of this is very ominous !
it harms the quality of the texts , as well as the opinion , " she said .
literary middleman sounds better than literary critic elke heidenreich , host of " lesen " - a successful tv show about literature - strictly avoids the label " critic " even though she is sometimes referred to as germany 's female literary pope -lrb- in reference to marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's most famous critic -rrb- .
she likes to call herself a middleman and not a critic .
" i am innately a literary critic , but with my role on tv , i am not a literary middleman , " she said .
is it because the word " critic " sounds too intellectual ?
what happened to the german tradition of criticism along the lines of kurt tucholsky , alfred polgar or alfred kerr ?
is there anything left of that critical spirit ?

book reviews are known to incur the wrath of authors and publishers , as well as readers .
that 's why professional literary critics are not exactly the most popular bunch in germany . literary critics enjoy a conflicting reputation in germany .
they are much needed when it comes to weeding out the most important out of 90.000 books that get published in the country year after year .
yet they are also seen as bigheaded know-it-all 's who shred other authors to pieces as payback for their own unsuccessful writing careers .
much has changed in the german marketplace for books over the past decade : reviews no longer exist only in newspapers , journals , magazines and special book-broadcasts , but also on the internet , written by readers for readers .
some see this as a trend that could endanger professional literary criticism .
malicious freeloaders ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics are needed to single out the most important books " you do n't want to be a critic , because it has a bad reputation in the society , " said critic jörg magenau , who writes for the nationwide süddeutsche zeitung .
" critics are people who are malicious about other people 's accomplishments , while they themselves have nothing to offer - that is the cliché of the critic . "
" it 's like being a guy who kind of freeloads off of other people 's accomplishments .
you do n't want to be that guy .
you want to be productive yourself .
i think that 's what 's behind it , " he said .
indeed , literature critics in germany have a reputation as humorless know-it-alls , who are disliked by authors , publishers and readers alike .
above it all , critics today are threatened by the publishers ' marketing .
reading in an accelerated marketplace reviewers have to read more and they have to read faster if they want to succeed in the accelerated publishing market .
they also have to come to terms with the fact that their reviews are not paid well , unless they join the small and exclusive group of full-time critics for major newspapers or journals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has become an important source for book recommendations sigrid löffler , the " grand lady " of german literary criticism and publisher of the magazine literature , is very skeptical about her own profession .
" i can only discourage people to be freelancing literary critics in this marketplace , " löffler said .
" the critic would have to write a great number of reviews to be able to earn a living from his or her writing .
reviewers are paid per each line , so their reviews have to be very long .
they also have to read faster and faster , and to produce their texts more rapidly .
all of this is very ominous !
it harms the quality of the texts , as well as the opinion , " she said .
literary middleman sounds better than literary critic elke heidenreich , host of " lesen " - a successful tv show about literature - strictly avoids the label " critic " even though she is sometimes referred to as germany 's female literary pope -lrb- in reference to marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's most famous critic -rrb- .
she likes to call herself a middleman and not a critic .
" i am innately a literary critic , but with my role on tv , i am not a literary middleman , " she said .
is it because the word " critic " sounds too intellectual ?
what happened to the german tradition of criticism along the lines of kurt tucholsky , alfred polgar or alfred kerr ?
is there anything left of that critical spirit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt tucholsky pop-literature changed the world of criticism " i think that the standards are getting lost , " said writer , journalist and critic hubert winkels .
" and not only the technical standards , but also the value and appreciation of what literature can be , " he said .

thanks to goethe 's literary classic " faust , " the leipzig tavern is also one of the world 's most famous . " auerbachs keller , " a cozy nearly 500-year-old drinking den in the eastern german city of leipzig , offers a special brew - " mephisto 's feuer " or " mephisto 's fire . " the devilishly delicious speciality drink is named after one of goethe 's most famous fictional characters . it 's easy to find the vault-like pub . just stroll towards the famous mädler passage arcade in the city center and you 're likely to be welcomed by bronze figures created by painter and sculptor matthieu molitor -lrb- 1873-1929 -rrb- .
the figures , cast from goethe 's " faust , " point the way towards the cavernous pub . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mädler passage in leipzig heinrich stromer of auerbach , located in bavaria , moved to leipzig in 1497 .
the physician married the daughter of councilman hans hummelhain , from whom stromer inherited the building that would later go down in the annals of literary and drinking history . the doctor opened up a wine bar in the building 's basement in 1525 .
it was the second oldest tavern in leipzig and one of the oldest in germany , and became a popular watering hole for students and professors . pact with the devil johann wolfgang von goethe , germany 's most celebrated poet , spent much of his time during his university years in the 1760s in auerbachs keller .
goethe , famed for his eloquence , also knew how to enjoy a glass of wine or two .
or perhaps even a little more - the poet was said to have imbibed up to three bottles a day . auerbachs keller also became a source of inspiration for goethe .
according to legend , the historical dr faustus , a dubious magician and alchemist from wittenberg , chanced upon the tavern in 1525 .
goethe used that setting in his own famous masterpiece of " faust , " a story in which a medieval scholar makes a pact with the devil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legends on the walls scenes and legends from both the " faust " tales cover the walls and even ceilings of auberbachs keller .
historical paintings as well as sculptures by artists from various eras portray the visit of the scholar and the devil in the roomy inn . the graphic depictions are n't just found in the legendary tavern but all over leipzig - on postcards , in books , on paper napkins , mugs , cake , biscuits and a slew of other souvenirs . article based on news reports -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i rate this a very convincing and compact concept , " bach said .
" i am happy that the winter sports federations ratified it unanimously and that the decision was reached quickly . "
the german winter sports federations agreed on friday that a munich bid would only involve three venues .
under the proposals , the city itself would stage ice events , garmisch-partenkirchen would offer snow sports and bobsleigh , while skeleton sledding and luge would take place at königssee .
having hosted the summer olympics in 1972 and now bidding for the winter olympics , munich is hoping to become the first city to stage both prestigious events .
garmisch-partenkirchen organized the only winter olympics so far in germany in 1936 .
unique chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : königssee already ran with salzburg in an unsuccessful bid to win the 2014 games " the german winter sports federations see munich 's bid as a unique chance and support it unanimously , " said alfons hoermann , president of the german ski federation , after the meeting .
traditional resorts such as ruhpolding -lrb- biathlon -rrb- , inzell -lrb- speed skating -rrb- and oberstdorf -lrb- nordic ski -rrb- were dropped from the concept , with bach reiterating that " only a compact proposal has a chance . "
the final dosb decision on the munich bid is set for early december .
it has already ruled out a bid for summer games in the near future despite interest from hamburg and berlin .
bavaria 's state capital will reportedly have to spend up to 35 million euros -lrb- $ 48 million -rrb- if the dosb approves its bid .
vancouver is set to host the 2010 winter games and sochi was last month elected to stage the event in 2014 .
the 2018 host city will be elected by the international olympic committee in four years ' time . dw-staff / dpa -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

book reviews are known to incur the wrath of authors and publishers , as well as readers .
that 's why professional literary critics are not exactly the most popular bunch in germany . literary critics enjoy a conflicting reputation in germany .
they are much needed when it comes to weeding out the most important out of 90.000 books that get published in the country year after year .
yet they are also seen as bigheaded know-it-all 's who shred other authors to pieces as payback for their own unsuccessful writing careers .
much has changed in the german marketplace for books over the past decade : reviews no longer exist only in newspapers , journals , magazines and special book-broadcasts , but also on the internet , written by readers for readers .
some see this as a trend that could endanger professional literary criticism .
malicious freeloaders ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics are needed to single out the most important books " you do n't want to be a critic , because it has a bad reputation in the society , " said critic jörg magenau , who writes for the nationwide süddeutsche zeitung .
" critics are people who are malicious about other people 's accomplishments , while they themselves have nothing to offer - that is the cliché of the critic . "
" it 's like being a guy who kind of freeloads off of other people 's accomplishments .
you do n't want to be that guy .
you want to be productive yourself .
i think that 's what 's behind it , " he said .
indeed , literature critics in germany have a reputation as humorless know-it-alls , who are disliked by authors , publishers and readers alike .
above it all , critics today are threatened by the publishers ' marketing .
reading in an accelerated marketplace reviewers have to read more and they have to read faster if they want to succeed in the accelerated publishing market .
they also have to come to terms with the fact that their reviews are not paid well , unless they join the small and exclusive group of full-time critics for major newspapers or journals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has become an important source for book recommendations sigrid löffler , the " grand lady " of german literary criticism and publisher of the magazine literature , is very skeptical about her own profession .
" i can only discourage people to be freelancing literary critics in this marketplace , " löffler said .
" the critic would have to write a great number of reviews to be able to earn a living from his or her writing .
reviewers are paid per each line , so their reviews have to be very long .
they also have to read faster and faster , and to produce their texts more rapidly .
all of this is very ominous !
it harms the quality of the texts , as well as the opinion , " she said .
literary middleman sounds better than literary critic elke heidenreich , host of " lesen " - a successful tv show about literature - strictly avoids the label " critic " even though she is sometimes referred to as germany 's female literary pope -lrb- in reference to marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's most famous critic -rrb- .
she likes to call herself a middleman and not a critic .
" i am innately a literary critic , but with my role on tv , i am not a literary middleman , " she said .
is it because the word " critic " sounds too intellectual ?
what happened to the german tradition of criticism along the lines of kurt tucholsky , alfred polgar or alfred kerr ?
is there anything left of that critical spirit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt tucholsky pop-literature changed the world of criticism " i think that the standards are getting lost , " said writer , journalist and critic hubert winkels .
" and not only the technical standards , but also the value and appreciation of what literature can be , " he said .
winkels believes that a shift happened within the practice of literary criticism itself , due to the hype which the success of pop-literature created in germany ten years ago .
authors have become just like pop stars , books have become like top-ten-hits , and readings have turned into parties .
nowadays , criticism is also forced to produce immediate effects and satisfy directly .
this goes against the notion of what literary criticism traditionally stood for : written analysis of books .
ready when the book is published bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the literature hype has changed a lot about the way books are reviewed an anti-intellectual atmosphere in the german book industry is evident .
there is an addiction to superlatives : praising books to heavens or sending them off to hell .
there is also a bizarre competition among german newspapers to review the top books so quickly , that critics sometimes do n't even have enough time to read the books . " the increasing trend is to write the review of an allegedly important book on the day that it is published , " löfler said .
" because of that , some of the really important new books are read negligently and quickly , because there is not enough time . "
" on the day of publication , there are 150 reviews in the german-speaking area .
a conversation among the critics is impossible .

book reviews are known to incur the wrath of authors and publishers , as well as readers .
that 's why professional literary critics are not exactly the most popular bunch in germany . literary critics enjoy a conflicting reputation in germany .
they are much needed when it comes to weeding out the most important out of 90.000 books that get published in the country year after year .
yet they are also seen as bigheaded know-it-all 's who shred other authors to pieces as payback for their own unsuccessful writing careers .
much has changed in the german marketplace for books over the past decade : reviews no longer exist only in newspapers , journals , magazines and special book-broadcasts , but also on the internet , written by readers for readers .
some see this as a trend that could endanger professional literary criticism .
malicious freeloaders ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics are needed to single out the most important books " you do n't want to be a critic , because it has a bad reputation in the society , " said critic jörg magenau , who writes for the nationwide süddeutsche zeitung .
" critics are people who are malicious about other people 's accomplishments , while they themselves have nothing to offer - that is the cliché of the critic . "
" it 's like being a guy who kind of freeloads off of other people 's accomplishments .
you do n't want to be that guy .
you want to be productive yourself .
i think that 's what 's behind it , " he said .
indeed , literature critics in germany have a reputation as humorless know-it-alls , who are disliked by authors , publishers and readers alike .
above it all , critics today are threatened by the publishers ' marketing .
reading in an accelerated marketplace reviewers have to read more and they have to read faster if they want to succeed in the accelerated publishing market .
they also have to come to terms with the fact that their reviews are not paid well , unless they join the small and exclusive group of full-time critics for major newspapers or journals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has become an important source for book recommendations sigrid löffler , the " grand lady " of german literary criticism and publisher of the magazine literature , is very skeptical about her own profession .
" i can only discourage people to be freelancing literary critics in this marketplace , " löffler said .
" the critic would have to write a great number of reviews to be able to earn a living from his or her writing .
reviewers are paid per each line , so their reviews have to be very long .
they also have to read faster and faster , and to produce their texts more rapidly .
all of this is very ominous !
it harms the quality of the texts , as well as the opinion , " she said .
literary middleman sounds better than literary critic elke heidenreich , host of " lesen " - a successful tv show about literature - strictly avoids the label " critic " even though she is sometimes referred to as germany 's female literary pope -lrb- in reference to marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's most famous critic -rrb- .
she likes to call herself a middleman and not a critic .
" i am innately a literary critic , but with my role on tv , i am not a literary middleman , " she said .
is it because the word " critic " sounds too intellectual ?
what happened to the german tradition of criticism along the lines of kurt tucholsky , alfred polgar or alfred kerr ?
is there anything left of that critical spirit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt tucholsky pop-literature changed the world of criticism " i think that the standards are getting lost , " said writer , journalist and critic hubert winkels .
" and not only the technical standards , but also the value and appreciation of what literature can be , " he said .
winkels believes that a shift happened within the practice of literary criticism itself , due to the hype which the success of pop-literature created in germany ten years ago .
authors have become just like pop stars , books have become like top-ten-hits , and readings have turned into parties .
nowadays , criticism is also forced to produce immediate effects and satisfy directly .
this goes against the notion of what literary criticism traditionally stood for : written analysis of books .
ready when the book is published bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the literature hype has changed a lot about the way books are reviewed an anti-intellectual atmosphere in the german book industry is evident .
there is an addiction to superlatives : praising books to heavens or sending them off to hell .
there is also a bizarre competition among german newspapers to review the top books so quickly , that critics sometimes do n't even have enough time to read the books . " the increasing trend is to write the review of an allegedly important book on the day that it is published , " löfler said .
" because of that , some of the really important new books are read negligently and quickly , because there is not enough time . "
" on the day of publication , there are 150 reviews in the german-speaking area .
a conversation among the critics is impossible .
there is no exchange . " she said .
reviews are needed whether good or bad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some books get up to 150 reviews on the day they are published many readers today consider book criticism as a kind of book recommendation , whether on the internet or on television .
there is a large amount of forums , where readers can exchange their reading experiences .
professional critics are thereby pushed aside .
yet it is professional critics who prevent the descent of literature into utter consumerism .
" if authors write books , and we do n't talk about them , that 's something resembling death for literature and every single author , " said literary critic jörg magenau .
" as much as authors hate their critics , because the latter never write what the former want , or hope for , there is a need for literary criticism .
if there was no literary criticism , there would be no literature . " dw staff -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in the case of hedge funds , we need to know where the capital comes from and how high the credit risks are , " merkel said in an interview for bild am sonntag , which was published on sunday .
merkel stressed that the world 's top rating agencies should also be more open about the way they calculate their ratings .
" in the future it should be clear what the basis of their ratings of companies is , " merkel said .
" there ca n't be some black box from which something comes out and which no one understands . "
during the annual summit of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialized nation in june , germany - the current g8 president - pushed for an international agreement that would require more openness from hedge funds , but without success .
the united states , in particular , has resisted any such moves .
" it 's unsatisfactory that that it takes so long to agree on the appropriate international measures , " merkel said .
after the storm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : financial markets all over the world felt the effects of the crisis in the us merkel 's criticism of the financial markets came only days after central banks around the world started pumping tens of billions of dollars into the global financial system aimed at calming continued liquidity fears in the wake of a significant crisis in the us home loan sector .
merkel said the developments in recent weeks showed " how urgent it is that we have greater transparency on international financial markets . "
earlier on saturday , publicly-owned regional german bank sachsenlb said it had to be bailed out to the tune of 17.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.3 billion -rrb- by the country 's savings banks because of exposure to the us subprime loan crisis .
another german bank , ikb , was rescued earlier in the week with an $ 8.1 billion liquidity line extended by state-owned development bank kfw , its main shareholder .
global economy , global problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who pays the price of risky investments ?
the international financial crisis was sparked by concerns that us homeowners would not be able to make repayments on so-called subprime mortgages .
subprime mortgage loans involve greater risk , as they are granted to borrowers with limited or tarnished credit histories .
falling housing prices in the united states have made it more difficult for borrowers to meet their long-term payments .
this led to a strong rise in mortgage foreclosures and the subsequent bankruptcy of several major subprime mortgage lenders .
with losses from risky us home loans to borrowers with poor credit histories being felt across the atlantic , " at the end of the day , we all risk paying the price of the opaqueness often associated with the selling on of loans , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i rate this a very convincing and compact concept , " bach said .
" i am happy that the winter sports federations ratified it unanimously and that the decision was reached quickly . "
the german winter sports federations agreed on friday that a munich bid would only involve three venues .
under the proposals , the city itself would stage ice events , garmisch-partenkirchen would offer snow sports and bobsleigh , while skeleton sledding and luge would take place at königssee .
having hosted the summer olympics in 1972 and now bidding for the winter olympics , munich is hoping to become the first city to stage both prestigious events .
garmisch-partenkirchen organized the only winter olympics so far in germany in 1936 .
unique chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : königssee already ran with salzburg in an unsuccessful bid to win the 2014 games " the german winter sports federations see munich 's bid as a unique chance and support it unanimously , " said alfons hoermann , president of the german ski federation , after the meeting .
traditional resorts such as ruhpolding -lrb- biathlon -rrb- , inzell -lrb- speed skating -rrb- and oberstdorf -lrb- nordic ski -rrb- were dropped from the concept , with bach reiterating that " only a compact proposal has a chance . "
the final dosb decision on the munich bid is set for early december .
it has already ruled out a bid for summer games in the near future despite interest from hamburg and berlin .
bavaria 's state capital will reportedly have to spend up to 35 million euros -lrb- $ 48 million -rrb- if the dosb approves its bid .
vancouver is set to host the 2010 winter games and sochi was last month elected to stage the event in 2014 .
the 2018 host city will be elected by the international olympic committee in four years ' time . dw-staff / dpa -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i rate this a very convincing and compact concept , " bach said .
" i am happy that the winter sports federations ratified it unanimously and that the decision was reached quickly . "
the german winter sports federations agreed on friday that a munich bid would only involve three venues .
under the proposals , the city itself would stage ice events , garmisch-partenkirchen would offer snow sports and bobsleigh , while skeleton sledding and luge would take place at königssee .
having hosted the summer olympics in 1972 and now bidding for the winter olympics , munich is hoping to become the first city to stage both prestigious events .
garmisch-partenkirchen organized the only winter olympics so far in germany in 1936 .
unique chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : königssee already ran with salzburg in an unsuccessful bid to win the 2014 games " the german winter sports federations see munich 's bid as a unique chance and support it unanimously , " said alfons hoermann , president of the german ski federation , after the meeting .
traditional resorts such as ruhpolding -lrb- biathlon -rrb- , inzell -lrb- speed skating -rrb- and oberstdorf -lrb- nordic ski -rrb- were dropped from the concept , with bach reiterating that " only a compact proposal has a chance . "
the final dosb decision on the munich bid is set for early december .
it has already ruled out a bid for summer games in the near future despite interest from hamburg and berlin .
bavaria 's state capital will reportedly have to spend up to 35 million euros -lrb- $ 48 million -rrb- if the dosb approves its bid .
vancouver is set to host the 2010 winter games and sochi was last month elected to stage the event in 2014 .
the 2018 host city will be elected by the international olympic committee in four years ' time . dw-staff / dpa -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

book reviews are known to incur the wrath of authors and publishers , as well as readers .
that 's why professional literary critics are not exactly the most popular bunch in germany . literary critics enjoy a conflicting reputation in germany .
they are much needed when it comes to weeding out the most important out of 90.000 books that get published in the country year after year .
yet they are also seen as bigheaded know-it-all 's who shred other authors to pieces as payback for their own unsuccessful writing careers .
much has changed in the german marketplace for books over the past decade : reviews no longer exist only in newspapers , journals , magazines and special book-broadcasts , but also on the internet , written by readers for readers .
some see this as a trend that could endanger professional literary criticism .
malicious freeloaders ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics are needed to single out the most important books " you do n't want to be a critic , because it has a bad reputation in the society , " said critic jörg magenau , who writes for the nationwide süddeutsche zeitung .
" critics are people who are malicious about other people 's accomplishments , while they themselves have nothing to offer - that is the cliché of the critic . "
" it 's like being a guy who kind of freeloads off of other people 's accomplishments .
you do n't want to be that guy .
you want to be productive yourself .
i think that 's what 's behind it , " he said .
indeed , literature critics in germany have a reputation as humorless know-it-alls , who are disliked by authors , publishers and readers alike .
above it all , critics today are threatened by the publishers ' marketing .
reading in an accelerated marketplace reviewers have to read more and they have to read faster if they want to succeed in the accelerated publishing market .
they also have to come to terms with the fact that their reviews are not paid well , unless they join the small and exclusive group of full-time critics for major newspapers or journals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has become an important source for book recommendations sigrid löffler , the " grand lady " of german literary criticism and publisher of the magazine literature , is very skeptical about her own profession .
" i can only discourage people to be freelancing literary critics in this marketplace , " löffler said .
" the critic would have to write a great number of reviews to be able to earn a living from his or her writing .
reviewers are paid per each line , so their reviews have to be very long .
they also have to read faster and faster , and to produce their texts more rapidly .
all of this is very ominous !
it harms the quality of the texts , as well as the opinion , " she said .
literary middleman sounds better than literary critic elke heidenreich , host of " lesen " - a successful tv show about literature - strictly avoids the label " critic " even though she is sometimes referred to as germany 's female literary pope -lrb- in reference to marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's most famous critic -rrb- .
she likes to call herself a middleman and not a critic .
" i am innately a literary critic , but with my role on tv , i am not a literary middleman , " she said .
is it because the word " critic " sounds too intellectual ?
what happened to the german tradition of criticism along the lines of kurt tucholsky , alfred polgar or alfred kerr ?
is there anything left of that critical spirit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt tucholsky pop-literature changed the world of criticism " i think that the standards are getting lost , " said writer , journalist and critic hubert winkels .
" and not only the technical standards , but also the value and appreciation of what literature can be , " he said .
winkels believes that a shift happened within the practice of literary criticism itself , due to the hype which the success of pop-literature created in germany ten years ago .
authors have become just like pop stars , books have become like top-ten-hits , and readings have turned into parties .
nowadays , criticism is also forced to produce immediate effects and satisfy directly .
this goes against the notion of what literary criticism traditionally stood for : written analysis of books .
ready when the book is published bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the literature hype has changed a lot about the way books are reviewed an anti-intellectual atmosphere in the german book industry is evident .
there is an addiction to superlatives : praising books to heavens or sending them off to hell .
there is also a bizarre competition among german newspapers to review the top books so quickly , that critics sometimes do n't even have enough time to read the books . " the increasing trend is to write the review of an allegedly important book on the day that it is published , " löfler said .
" because of that , some of the really important new books are read negligently and quickly , because there is not enough time . "
" on the day of publication , there are 150 reviews in the german-speaking area .
a conversation among the critics is impossible .
there is no exchange . " she said .
reviews are needed whether good or bad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some books get up to 150 reviews on the day they are published many readers today consider book criticism as a kind of book recommendation , whether on the internet or on television .
there is a large amount of forums , where readers can exchange their reading experiences .
professional critics are thereby pushed aside .
yet it is professional critics who prevent the descent of literature into utter consumerism .
" if authors write books , and we do n't talk about them , that 's something resembling death for literature and every single author , " said literary critic jörg magenau .
" as much as authors hate their critics , because the latter never write what the former want , or hope for , there is a need for literary criticism .
if there was no literary criticism , there would be no literature . " dw staff -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

book reviews are known to incur the wrath of authors and publishers , as well as readers .
that 's why professional literary critics are not exactly the most popular bunch in germany . literary critics enjoy a conflicting reputation in germany .
they are much needed when it comes to weeding out the most important out of 90.000 books that get published in the country year after year .
yet they are also seen as bigheaded know-it-all 's who shred other authors to pieces as payback for their own unsuccessful writing careers .
much has changed in the german marketplace for books over the past decade : reviews no longer exist only in newspapers , journals , magazines and special book-broadcasts , but also on the internet , written by readers for readers .
some see this as a trend that could endanger professional literary criticism .
malicious freeloaders ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics are needed to single out the most important books " you do n't want to be a critic , because it has a bad reputation in the society , " said critic jörg magenau , who writes for the nationwide süddeutsche zeitung .
" critics are people who are malicious about other people 's accomplishments , while they themselves have nothing to offer - that is the cliché of the critic . "
" it 's like being a guy who kind of freeloads off of other people 's accomplishments .
you do n't want to be that guy .
you want to be productive yourself .
i think that 's what 's behind it , " he said .
indeed , literature critics in germany have a reputation as humorless know-it-alls , who are disliked by authors , publishers and readers alike .
above it all , critics today are threatened by the publishers ' marketing .
reading in an accelerated marketplace reviewers have to read more and they have to read faster if they want to succeed in the accelerated publishing market .
they also have to come to terms with the fact that their reviews are not paid well , unless they join the small and exclusive group of full-time critics for major newspapers or journals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has become an important source for book recommendations sigrid löffler , the " grand lady " of german literary criticism and publisher of the magazine literature , is very skeptical about her own profession .
" i can only discourage people to be freelancing literary critics in this marketplace , " löffler said .
" the critic would have to write a great number of reviews to be able to earn a living from his or her writing .
reviewers are paid per each line , so their reviews have to be very long .
they also have to read faster and faster , and to produce their texts more rapidly .
all of this is very ominous !
it harms the quality of the texts , as well as the opinion , " she said .
literary middleman sounds better than literary critic elke heidenreich , host of " lesen " - a successful tv show about literature - strictly avoids the label " critic " even though she is sometimes referred to as germany 's female literary pope -lrb- in reference to marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's most famous critic -rrb- .
she likes to call herself a middleman and not a critic .
" i am innately a literary critic , but with my role on tv , i am not a literary middleman , " she said .
is it because the word " critic " sounds too intellectual ?

" in the case of hedge funds , we need to know where the capital comes from and how high the credit risks are , " merkel said in an interview for bild am sonntag , which was published on sunday .
merkel stressed that the world 's top rating agencies should also be more open about the way they calculate their ratings .
" in the future it should be clear what the basis of their ratings of companies is , " merkel said .
" there ca n't be some black box from which something comes out and which no one understands . "
during the annual summit of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialized nation in june , germany - the current g8 president - pushed for an international agreement that would require more openness from hedge funds , but without success .
the united states , in particular , has resisted any such moves .
" it 's unsatisfactory that that it takes so long to agree on the appropriate international measures , " merkel said .
after the storm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : financial markets all over the world felt the effects of the crisis in the us merkel 's criticism of the financial markets came only days after central banks around the world started pumping tens of billions of dollars into the global financial system aimed at calming continued liquidity fears in the wake of a significant crisis in the us home loan sector .
merkel said the developments in recent weeks showed " how urgent it is that we have greater transparency on international financial markets . "
earlier on saturday , publicly-owned regional german bank sachsenlb said it had to be bailed out to the tune of 17.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.3 billion -rrb- by the country 's savings banks because of exposure to the us subprime loan crisis .
another german bank , ikb , was rescued earlier in the week with an $ 8.1 billion liquidity line extended by state-owned development bank kfw , its main shareholder .
global economy , global problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who pays the price of risky investments ?
the international financial crisis was sparked by concerns that us homeowners would not be able to make repayments on so-called subprime mortgages .
subprime mortgage loans involve greater risk , as they are granted to borrowers with limited or tarnished credit histories .
falling housing prices in the united states have made it more difficult for borrowers to meet their long-term payments .
this led to a strong rise in mortgage foreclosures and the subsequent bankruptcy of several major subprime mortgage lenders .
with losses from risky us home loans to borrowers with poor credit histories being felt across the atlantic , " at the end of the day , we all risk paying the price of the opaqueness often associated with the selling on of loans , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in the case of hedge funds , we need to know where the capital comes from and how high the credit risks are , " merkel said in an interview for bild am sonntag , which was published on sunday .
merkel stressed that the world 's top rating agencies should also be more open about the way they calculate their ratings .
" in the future it should be clear what the basis of their ratings of companies is , " merkel said .
" there ca n't be some black box from which something comes out and which no one understands . "
during the annual summit of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialized nation in june , germany - the current g8 president - pushed for an international agreement that would require more openness from hedge funds , but without success .
the united states , in particular , has resisted any such moves .
" it 's unsatisfactory that that it takes so long to agree on the appropriate international measures , " merkel said .
after the storm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : financial markets all over the world felt the effects of the crisis in the us merkel 's criticism of the financial markets came only days after central banks around the world started pumping tens of billions of dollars into the global financial system aimed at calming continued liquidity fears in the wake of a significant crisis in the us home loan sector .
merkel said the developments in recent weeks showed " how urgent it is that we have greater transparency on international financial markets . "
earlier on saturday , publicly-owned regional german bank sachsenlb said it had to be bailed out to the tune of 17.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.3 billion -rrb- by the country 's savings banks because of exposure to the us subprime loan crisis .
another german bank , ikb , was rescued earlier in the week with an $ 8.1 billion liquidity line extended by state-owned development bank kfw , its main shareholder .
global economy , global problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who pays the price of risky investments ?
the international financial crisis was sparked by concerns that us homeowners would not be able to make repayments on so-called subprime mortgages .
subprime mortgage loans involve greater risk , as they are granted to borrowers with limited or tarnished credit histories .
falling housing prices in the united states have made it more difficult for borrowers to meet their long-term payments .
this led to a strong rise in mortgage foreclosures and the subsequent bankruptcy of several major subprime mortgage lenders .
with losses from risky us home loans to borrowers with poor credit histories being felt across the atlantic , " at the end of the day , we all risk paying the price of the opaqueness often associated with the selling on of loans , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in the future it should be clear what the basis of their ratings of companies is , " merkel said .
" there ca n't be some black box from which something comes out and which no one understands . "
during the annual summit of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialized nation in june , germany - the current g8 president - pushed for an international agreement that would require more openness from hedge funds , but without success .

this led to a strong rise in mortgage foreclosures and the subsequent bankruptcy of several major subprime mortgage lenders .

" in the case of hedge funds , we need to know where the capital comes from and how high the credit risks are , " merkel said in an interview for bild am sonntag , which was published on sunday .
merkel stressed that the world 's top rating agencies should also be more open about the way they calculate their ratings .
" in the future it should be clear what the basis of their ratings of companies is , " merkel said .
" there ca n't be some black box from which something comes out and which no one understands . "
during the annual summit of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialized nation in june , germany - the current g8 president - pushed for an international agreement that would require more openness from hedge funds , but without success .
the united states , in particular , has resisted any such moves .
" it 's unsatisfactory that that it takes so long to agree on the appropriate international measures , " merkel said .
after the storm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : financial markets all over the world felt the effects of the crisis in the us merkel 's criticism of the financial markets came only days after central banks around the world started pumping tens of billions of dollars into the global financial system aimed at calming continued liquidity fears in the wake of a significant crisis in the us home loan sector .
merkel said the developments in recent weeks showed " how urgent it is that we have greater transparency on international financial markets . "
earlier on saturday , publicly-owned regional german bank sachsenlb said it had to be bailed out to the tune of 17.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.3 billion -rrb- by the country 's savings banks because of exposure to the us subprime loan crisis .
another german bank , ikb , was rescued earlier in the week with an $ 8.1 billion liquidity line extended by state-owned development bank kfw , its main shareholder .
global economy , global problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who pays the price of risky investments ?
the international financial crisis was sparked by concerns that us homeowners would not be able to make repayments on so-called subprime mortgages .
subprime mortgage loans involve greater risk , as they are granted to borrowers with limited or tarnished credit histories .
falling housing prices in the united states have made it more difficult for borrowers to meet their long-term payments .
this led to a strong rise in mortgage foreclosures and the subsequent bankruptcy of several major subprime mortgage lenders .
with losses from risky us home loans to borrowers with poor credit histories being felt across the atlantic , " at the end of the day , we all risk paying the price of the opaqueness often associated with the selling on of loans , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

during the annual summit of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialized nation in june , germany - the current g8 president - pushed for an international agreement that would require more openness from hedge funds , but without success .
the united states , in particular , has resisted any such moves .

after the storm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : financial markets all over the world felt the effects of the crisis in the us merkel 's criticism of the financial markets came only days after central banks around the world started pumping tens of billions of dollars into the global financial system aimed at calming continued liquidity fears in the wake of a significant crisis in the us home loan sector .

the international financial crisis was sparked by concerns that us homeowners would not be able to make repayments on so-called subprime mortgages .
subprime mortgage loans involve greater risk , as they are granted to borrowers with limited or tarnished credit histories .
falling housing prices in the united states have made it more difficult for borrowers to meet their long-term payments .
this led to a strong rise in mortgage foreclosures and the subsequent bankruptcy of several major subprime mortgage lenders .
with losses from risky us home loans to borrowers with poor credit histories being felt across the atlantic , " at the end of the day , we all risk paying the price of the opaqueness often associated with the selling on of loans , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i rate this a very convincing and compact concept , " bach said .
" i am happy that the winter sports federations ratified it unanimously and that the decision was reached quickly . "
the german winter sports federations agreed on friday that a munich bid would only involve three venues .
under the proposals , the city itself would stage ice events , garmisch-partenkirchen would offer snow sports and bobsleigh , while skeleton sledding and luge would take place at königssee .
having hosted the summer olympics in 1972 and now bidding for the winter olympics , munich is hoping to become the first city to stage both prestigious events .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 19.08.2007 literary critics in germany : despised but much needed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who wil influence our decisions about what books to read in the future ?
book reviews are known to incur the wrath of authors and publishers , as well as readers .
that 's why professional literary critics are not exactly the most popular bunch in germany . literary critics enjoy a conflicting reputation in germany .
they are much needed when it comes to weeding out the most important out of 90.000 books that get published in the country year after year .
yet they are also seen as bigheaded know-it-all 's who shred other authors to pieces as payback for their own unsuccessful writing careers .
much has changed in the german marketplace for books over the past decade : reviews no longer exist only in newspapers , journals , magazines and special book-broadcasts , but also on the internet , written by readers for readers .
some see this as a trend that could endanger professional literary criticism .
malicious freeloaders ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics are needed to single out the most important books " you do n't want to be a critic , because it has a bad reputation in the society , " said critic jörg magenau , who writes for the nationwide süddeutsche zeitung .
" critics are people who are malicious about other people 's accomplishments , while they themselves have nothing to offer - that is the cliché of the critic . "
" it 's like being a guy who kind of freeloads off of other people 's accomplishments .
you do n't want to be that guy .
you want to be productive yourself .
i think that 's what 's behind it , " he said .
indeed , literature critics in germany have a reputation as humorless know-it-alls , who are disliked by authors , publishers and readers alike .
above it all , critics today are threatened by the publishers ' marketing .
reading in an accelerated marketplace reviewers have to read more and they have to read faster if they want to succeed in the accelerated publishing market .
they also have to come to terms with the fact that their reviews are not paid well , unless they join the small and exclusive group of full-time critics for major newspapers or journals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has become an important source for book recommendations sigrid löffler , the " grand lady " of german literary criticism and publisher of the magazine literature , is very skeptical about her own profession .
" i can only discourage people to be freelancing literary critics in this marketplace , " löffler said .
" the critic would have to write a great number of reviews to be able to earn a living from his or her writing .
reviewers are paid per each line , so their reviews have to be very long .
they also have to read faster and faster , and to produce their texts more rapidly .
all of this is very ominous !
it harms the quality of the texts , as well as the opinion , " she said .
literary middleman sounds better than literary critic elke heidenreich , host of " lesen " - a successful tv show about literature - strictly avoids the label " critic " even though she is sometimes referred to as germany 's female literary pope -lrb- in reference to marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's most famous critic -rrb- .
she likes to call herself a middleman and not a critic .
" i am innately a literary critic , but with my role on tv , i am not a literary middleman , " she said .
is it because the word " critic " sounds too intellectual ?
what happened to the german tradition of criticism along the lines of kurt tucholsky , alfred polgar or alfred kerr ?
is there anything left of that critical spirit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt tucholsky pop-literature changed the world of criticism " i think that the standards are getting lost , " said writer , journalist and critic hubert winkels .
" and not only the technical standards , but also the value and appreciation of what literature can be , " he said .
winkels believes that a shift happened within the practice of literary criticism itself , due to the hype which the success of pop-literature created in germany ten years ago .
authors have become just like pop stars , books have become like top-ten-hits , and readings have turned into parties .
nowadays , criticism is also forced to produce immediate effects and satisfy directly .
this goes against the notion of what literary criticism traditionally stood for : written analysis of books .
ready when the book is published bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the literature hype has changed a lot about the way books are reviewed an anti-intellectual atmosphere in the german book industry is evident .
there is an addiction to superlatives : praising books to heavens or sending them off to hell .
there is also a bizarre competition among german newspapers to review the top books so quickly , that critics sometimes do n't even have enough time to read the books . " the increasing trend is to write the review of an allegedly important book on the day that it is published , " löfler said .
" because of that , some of the really important new books are read negligently and quickly , because there is not enough time . "
" on the day of publication , there are 150 reviews in the german-speaking area .
a conversation among the critics is impossible .
there is no exchange . " she said .
reviews are needed whether good or bad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some books get up to 150 reviews on the day they are published many readers today consider book criticism as a kind of book recommendation , whether on the internet or on television .
there is a large amount of forums , where readers can exchange their reading experiences .
professional critics are thereby pushed aside .
yet it is professional critics who prevent the descent of literature into utter consumerism .
" if authors write books , and we do n't talk about them , that 's something resembling death for literature and every single author , " said literary critic jörg magenau .
" as much as authors hate their critics , because the latter never write what the former want , or hope for , there is a need for literary criticism .
if there was no literary criticism , there would be no literature . " dw staff -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if authors write books , and we do n't talk about them , that 's something resembling death for literature and every single author , " said literary critic jörg magenau .
" as much as authors hate their critics , because the latter never write what the former want , or hope for , there is a need for literary criticism .
if there was no literary criticism , there would be no literature . " dw staff -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i rate this a very convincing and compact concept , " bach said .
" i am happy that the winter sports federations ratified it unanimously and that the decision was reached quickly . "
the german winter sports federations agreed on friday that a munich bid would only involve three venues .
under the proposals , the city itself would stage ice events , garmisch-partenkirchen would offer snow sports and bobsleigh , while skeleton sledding and luge would take place at königssee .
having hosted the summer olympics in 1972 and now bidding for the winter olympics , munich is hoping to become the first city to stage both prestigious events .
garmisch-partenkirchen organized the only winter olympics so far in germany in 1936 .
unique chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : königssee already ran with salzburg in an unsuccessful bid to win the 2014 games " the german winter sports federations see munich 's bid as a unique chance and support it unanimously , " said alfons hoermann , president of the german ski federation , after the meeting .
traditional resorts such as ruhpolding -lrb- biathlon -rrb- , inzell -lrb- speed skating -rrb- and oberstdorf -lrb- nordic ski -rrb- were dropped from the concept , with bach reiterating that " only a compact proposal has a chance . "
the final dosb decision on the munich bid is set for early december .
it has already ruled out a bid for summer games in the near future despite interest from hamburg and berlin .
bavaria 's state capital will reportedly have to spend up to 35 million euros -lrb- $ 48 million -rrb- if the dosb approves its bid .
vancouver is set to host the 2010 winter games and sochi was last month elected to stage the event in 2014 .

" in the case of hedge funds , we need to know where the capital comes from and how high the credit risks are , " merkel said in an interview for bild am sonntag , which was published on sunday .
merkel stressed that the world 's top rating agencies should also be more open about the way they calculate their ratings .
" in the future it should be clear what the basis of their ratings of companies is , " merkel said .
" there ca n't be some black box from which something comes out and which no one understands . "
during the annual summit of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialized nation in june , germany - the current g8 president - pushed for an international agreement that would require more openness from hedge funds , but without success .
the united states , in particular , has resisted any such moves .
" it 's unsatisfactory that that it takes so long to agree on the appropriate international measures , " merkel said .
after the storm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : financial markets all over the world felt the effects of the crisis in the us merkel 's criticism of the financial markets came only days after central banks around the world started pumping tens of billions of dollars into the global financial system aimed at calming continued liquidity fears in the wake of a significant crisis in the us home loan sector .
merkel said the developments in recent weeks showed " how urgent it is that we have greater transparency on international financial markets . "
earlier on saturday , publicly-owned regional german bank sachsenlb said it had to be bailed out to the tune of 17.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.3 billion -rrb- by the country 's savings banks because of exposure to the us subprime loan crisis .
another german bank , ikb , was rescued earlier in the week with an $ 8.1 billion liquidity line extended by state-owned development bank kfw , its main shareholder .
global economy , global problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who pays the price of risky investments ?
the international financial crisis was sparked by concerns that us homeowners would not be able to make repayments on so-called subprime mortgages .
subprime mortgage loans involve greater risk , as they are granted to borrowers with limited or tarnished credit histories .
falling housing prices in the united states have made it more difficult for borrowers to meet their long-term payments .
this led to a strong rise in mortgage foreclosures and the subsequent bankruptcy of several major subprime mortgage lenders .
with losses from risky us home loans to borrowers with poor credit histories being felt across the atlantic , " at the end of the day , we all risk paying the price of the opaqueness often associated with the selling on of loans , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 19.08.2007 literary critics in germany : despised but much needed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who wil influence our decisions about what books to read in the future ?
book reviews are known to incur the wrath of authors and publishers , as well as readers .
that 's why professional literary critics are not exactly the most popular bunch in germany . literary critics enjoy a conflicting reputation in germany .
they are much needed when it comes to weeding out the most important out of 90.000 books that get published in the country year after year .
yet they are also seen as bigheaded know-it-all 's who shred other authors to pieces as payback for their own unsuccessful writing careers .
much has changed in the german marketplace for books over the past decade : reviews no longer exist only in newspapers , journals , magazines and special book-broadcasts , but also on the internet , written by readers for readers .
some see this as a trend that could endanger professional literary criticism .
malicious freeloaders ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics are needed to single out the most important books " you do n't want to be a critic , because it has a bad reputation in the society , " said critic jörg magenau , who writes for the nationwide süddeutsche zeitung .
" critics are people who are malicious about other people 's accomplishments , while they themselves have nothing to offer - that is the cliché of the critic . "
" it 's like being a guy who kind of freeloads off of other people 's accomplishments .
you do n't want to be that guy .
you want to be productive yourself .
i think that 's what 's behind it , " he said .
indeed , literature critics in germany have a reputation as humorless know-it-alls , who are disliked by authors , publishers and readers alike .
above it all , critics today are threatened by the publishers ' marketing .
reading in an accelerated marketplace reviewers have to read more and they have to read faster if they want to succeed in the accelerated publishing market .
they also have to come to terms with the fact that their reviews are not paid well , unless they join the small and exclusive group of full-time critics for major newspapers or journals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has become an important source for book recommendations sigrid löffler , the " grand lady " of german literary criticism and publisher of the magazine literature , is very skeptical about her own profession .
" i can only discourage people to be freelancing literary critics in this marketplace , " löffler said .
" the critic would have to write a great number of reviews to be able to earn a living from his or her writing .
reviewers are paid per each line , so their reviews have to be very long .
they also have to read faster and faster , and to produce their texts more rapidly .
all of this is very ominous !
it harms the quality of the texts , as well as the opinion , " she said .
literary middleman sounds better than literary critic elke heidenreich , host of " lesen " - a successful tv show about literature - strictly avoids the label " critic " even though she is sometimes referred to as germany 's female literary pope -lrb- in reference to marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's most famous critic -rrb- .
she likes to call herself a middleman and not a critic .
" i am innately a literary critic , but with my role on tv , i am not a literary middleman , " she said .
is it because the word " critic " sounds too intellectual ?
what happened to the german tradition of criticism along the lines of kurt tucholsky , alfred polgar or alfred kerr ?
is there anything left of that critical spirit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt tucholsky pop-literature changed the world of criticism " i think that the standards are getting lost , " said writer , journalist and critic hubert winkels .
" and not only the technical standards , but also the value and appreciation of what literature can be , " he said .
winkels believes that a shift happened within the practice of literary criticism itself , due to the hype which the success of pop-literature created in germany ten years ago .
authors have become just like pop stars , books have become like top-ten-hits , and readings have turned into parties .
nowadays , criticism is also forced to produce immediate effects and satisfy directly .
this goes against the notion of what literary criticism traditionally stood for : written analysis of books .
ready when the book is published bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the literature hype has changed a lot about the way books are reviewed an anti-intellectual atmosphere in the german book industry is evident .
there is an addiction to superlatives : praising books to heavens or sending them off to hell .
there is also a bizarre competition among german newspapers to review the top books so quickly , that critics sometimes do n't even have enough time to read the books . " the increasing trend is to write the review of an allegedly important book on the day that it is published , " löfler said .
" because of that , some of the really important new books are read negligently and quickly , because there is not enough time . "
" on the day of publication , there are 150 reviews in the german-speaking area .
a conversation among the critics is impossible .
there is no exchange . " she said .
reviews are needed whether good or bad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some books get up to 150 reviews on the day they are published many readers today consider book criticism as a kind of book recommendation , whether on the internet or on television .
there is a large amount of forums , where readers can exchange their reading experiences .
professional critics are thereby pushed aside .
yet it is professional critics who prevent the descent of literature into utter consumerism .
" if authors write books , and we do n't talk about them , that 's something resembling death for literature and every single author , " said literary critic jörg magenau .
" as much as authors hate their critics , because the latter never write what the former want , or hope for , there is a need for literary criticism .
if there was no literary criticism , there would be no literature . " dw staff -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i rate this a very convincing and compact concept , " bach said .
" i am happy that the winter sports federations ratified it unanimously and that the decision was reached quickly . "
the german winter sports federations agreed on friday that a munich bid would only involve three venues .
under the proposals , the city itself would stage ice events , garmisch-partenkirchen would offer snow sports and bobsleigh , while skeleton sledding and luge would take place at königssee .
having hosted the summer olympics in 1972 and now bidding for the winter olympics , munich is hoping to become the first city to stage both prestigious events .
garmisch-partenkirchen organized the only winter olympics so far in germany in 1936 .

" in the case of hedge funds , we need to know where the capital comes from and how high the credit risks are , " merkel said in an interview for bild am sonntag , which was published on sunday .
merkel stressed that the world 's top rating agencies should also be more open about the way they calculate their ratings .
" in the future it should be clear what the basis of their ratings of companies is , " merkel said .
" there ca n't be some black box from which something comes out and which no one understands . "
during the annual summit of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialized nation in june , germany - the current g8 president - pushed for an international agreement that would require more openness from hedge funds , but without success .
the united states , in particular , has resisted any such moves .
" it 's unsatisfactory that that it takes so long to agree on the appropriate international measures , " merkel said .
after the storm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : financial markets all over the world felt the effects of the crisis in the us merkel 's criticism of the financial markets came only days after central banks around the world started pumping tens of billions of dollars into the global financial system aimed at calming continued liquidity fears in the wake of a significant crisis in the us home loan sector .
merkel said the developments in recent weeks showed " how urgent it is that we have greater transparency on international financial markets . "
earlier on saturday , publicly-owned regional german bank sachsenlb said it had to be bailed out to the tune of 17.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.3 billion -rrb- by the country 's savings banks because of exposure to the us subprime loan crisis .

the international financial crisis was sparked by concerns that us homeowners would not be able to make repayments on so-called subprime mortgages .
subprime mortgage loans involve greater risk , as they are granted to borrowers with limited or tarnished credit histories .
falling housing prices in the united states have made it more difficult for borrowers to meet their long-term payments .
this led to a strong rise in mortgage foreclosures and the subsequent bankruptcy of several major subprime mortgage lenders .

" in the case of hedge funds , we need to know where the capital comes from and how high the credit risks are , " merkel said in an interview for bild am sonntag , which was published on sunday .
merkel stressed that the world 's top rating agencies should also be more open about the way they calculate their ratings .
" in the future it should be clear what the basis of their ratings of companies is , " merkel said .
" there ca n't be some black box from which something comes out and which no one understands . "
during the annual summit of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialized nation in june , germany - the current g8 president - pushed for an international agreement that would require more openness from hedge funds , but without success .
the united states , in particular , has resisted any such moves .
" it 's unsatisfactory that that it takes so long to agree on the appropriate international measures , " merkel said .
after the storm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : financial markets all over the world felt the effects of the crisis in the us merkel 's criticism of the financial markets came only days after central banks around the world started pumping tens of billions of dollars into the global financial system aimed at calming continued liquidity fears in the wake of a significant crisis in the us home loan sector .
merkel said the developments in recent weeks showed " how urgent it is that we have greater transparency on international financial markets . "
earlier on saturday , publicly-owned regional german bank sachsenlb said it had to be bailed out to the tune of 17.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.3 billion -rrb- by the country 's savings banks because of exposure to the us subprime loan crisis .
another german bank , ikb , was rescued earlier in the week with an $ 8.1 billion liquidity line extended by state-owned development bank kfw , its main shareholder .
global economy , global problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who pays the price of risky investments ?
the international financial crisis was sparked by concerns that us homeowners would not be able to make repayments on so-called subprime mortgages .
subprime mortgage loans involve greater risk , as they are granted to borrowers with limited or tarnished credit histories .
falling housing prices in the united states have made it more difficult for borrowers to meet their long-term payments .
this led to a strong rise in mortgage foreclosures and the subsequent bankruptcy of several major subprime mortgage lenders .
with losses from risky us home loans to borrowers with poor credit histories being felt across the atlantic , " at the end of the day , we all risk paying the price of the opaqueness often associated with the selling on of loans , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in the case of hedge funds , we need to know where the capital comes from and how high the credit risks are , " merkel said in an interview for bild am sonntag , which was published on sunday .
merkel stressed that the world 's top rating agencies should also be more open about the way they calculate their ratings .
" in the future it should be clear what the basis of their ratings of companies is , " merkel said .
" there ca n't be some black box from which something comes out and which no one understands . "
during the annual summit of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialized nation in june , germany - the current g8 president - pushed for an international agreement that would require more openness from hedge funds , but without success .
the united states , in particular , has resisted any such moves .
" it 's unsatisfactory that that it takes so long to agree on the appropriate international measures , " merkel said .
after the storm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : financial markets all over the world felt the effects of the crisis in the us merkel 's criticism of the financial markets came only days after central banks around the world started pumping tens of billions of dollars into the global financial system aimed at calming continued liquidity fears in the wake of a significant crisis in the us home loan sector .
merkel said the developments in recent weeks showed " how urgent it is that we have greater transparency on international financial markets . "
earlier on saturday , publicly-owned regional german bank sachsenlb said it had to be bailed out to the tune of 17.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 23.3 billion -rrb- by the country 's savings banks because of exposure to the us subprime loan crisis .
another german bank , ikb , was rescued earlier in the week with an $ 8.1 billion liquidity line extended by state-owned development bank kfw , its main shareholder .
global economy , global problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who pays the price of risky investments ?
the international financial crisis was sparked by concerns that us homeowners would not be able to make repayments on so-called subprime mortgages .
subprime mortgage loans involve greater risk , as they are granted to borrowers with limited or tarnished credit histories .
falling housing prices in the united states have made it more difficult for borrowers to meet their long-term payments .
this led to a strong rise in mortgage foreclosures and the subsequent bankruptcy of several major subprime mortgage lenders .
with losses from risky us home loans to borrowers with poor credit histories being felt across the atlantic , " at the end of the day , we all risk paying the price of the opaqueness often associated with the selling on of loans , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thanks to goethe 's literary classic " faust , " the leipzig tavern is also one of the world 's most famous . " auerbachs keller , " a cozy nearly 500-year-old drinking den in the eastern german city of leipzig , offers a special brew - " mephisto 's feuer " or " mephisto 's fire . " the devilishly delicious speciality drink is named after one of goethe 's most famous fictional characters . it 's easy to find the vault-like pub . just stroll towards the famous mädler passage arcade in the city center and you 're likely to be welcomed by bronze figures created by painter and sculptor matthieu molitor -lrb- 1873-1929 -rrb- .
the figures , cast from goethe 's " faust , " point the way towards the cavernous pub . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mädler passage in leipzig heinrich stromer of auerbach , located in bavaria , moved to leipzig in 1497 .
the physician married the daughter of councilman hans hummelhain , from whom stromer inherited the building that would later go down in the annals of literary and drinking history . the doctor opened up a wine bar in the building 's basement in 1525 .
it was the second oldest tavern in leipzig and one of the oldest in germany , and became a popular watering hole for students and professors . pact with the devil johann wolfgang von goethe , germany 's most celebrated poet , spent much of his time during his university years in the 1760s in auerbachs keller .
goethe , famed for his eloquence , also knew how to enjoy a glass of wine or two .
or perhaps even a little more - the poet was said to have imbibed up to three bottles a day . auerbachs keller also became a source of inspiration for goethe .
according to legend , the historical dr faustus , a dubious magician and alchemist from wittenberg , chanced upon the tavern in 1525 .
goethe used that setting in his own famous masterpiece of " faust , " a story in which a medieval scholar makes a pact with the devil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legends on the walls scenes and legends from both the " faust " tales cover the walls and even ceilings of auberbachs keller .
historical paintings as well as sculptures by artists from various eras portray the visit of the scholar and the devil in the roomy inn . the graphic depictions are n't just found in the legendary tavern but all over leipzig - on postcards , in books , on paper napkins , mugs , cake , biscuits and a slew of other souvenirs . article based on news reports -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i rate this a very convincing and compact concept , " bach said .
" i am happy that the winter sports federations ratified it unanimously and that the decision was reached quickly . "
the german winter sports federations agreed on friday that a munich bid would only involve three venues .
under the proposals , the city itself would stage ice events , garmisch-partenkirchen would offer snow sports and bobsleigh , while skeleton sledding and luge would take place at königssee .
having hosted the summer olympics in 1972 and now bidding for the winter olympics , munich is hoping to become the first city to stage both prestigious events .
garmisch-partenkirchen organized the only winter olympics so far in germany in 1936 .
unique chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : königssee already ran with salzburg in an unsuccessful bid to win the 2014 games " the german winter sports federations see munich 's bid as a unique chance and support it unanimously , " said alfons hoermann , president of the german ski federation , after the meeting .
traditional resorts such as ruhpolding -lrb- biathlon -rrb- , inzell -lrb- speed skating -rrb- and oberstdorf -lrb- nordic ski -rrb- were dropped from the concept , with bach reiterating that " only a compact proposal has a chance . "
the final dosb decision on the munich bid is set for early december .
it has already ruled out a bid for summer games in the near future despite interest from hamburg and berlin .
bavaria 's state capital will reportedly have to spend up to 35 million euros -lrb- $ 48 million -rrb- if the dosb approves its bid .
vancouver is set to host the 2010 winter games and sochi was last month elected to stage the event in 2014 .

book reviews are known to incur the wrath of authors and publishers , as well as readers .
that 's why professional literary critics are not exactly the most popular bunch in germany . literary critics enjoy a conflicting reputation in germany .
they are much needed when it comes to weeding out the most important out of 90.000 books that get published in the country year after year .
yet they are also seen as bigheaded know-it-all 's who shred other authors to pieces as payback for their own unsuccessful writing careers .
much has changed in the german marketplace for books over the past decade : reviews no longer exist only in newspapers , journals , magazines and special book-broadcasts , but also on the internet , written by readers for readers .
some see this as a trend that could endanger professional literary criticism .
malicious freeloaders ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics are needed to single out the most important books " you do n't want to be a critic , because it has a bad reputation in the society , " said critic jörg magenau , who writes for the nationwide süddeutsche zeitung .
" critics are people who are malicious about other people 's accomplishments , while they themselves have nothing to offer - that is the cliché of the critic . "
" it 's like being a guy who kind of freeloads off of other people 's accomplishments .
you do n't want to be that guy .
you want to be productive yourself .
i think that 's what 's behind it , " he said .
indeed , literature critics in germany have a reputation as humorless know-it-alls , who are disliked by authors , publishers and readers alike .
above it all , critics today are threatened by the publishers ' marketing .
reading in an accelerated marketplace reviewers have to read more and they have to read faster if they want to succeed in the accelerated publishing market .
they also have to come to terms with the fact that their reviews are not paid well , unless they join the small and exclusive group of full-time critics for major newspapers or journals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has become an important source for book recommendations sigrid löffler , the " grand lady " of german literary criticism and publisher of the magazine literature , is very skeptical about her own profession .
" i can only discourage people to be freelancing literary critics in this marketplace , " löffler said .
" the critic would have to write a great number of reviews to be able to earn a living from his or her writing .
reviewers are paid per each line , so their reviews have to be very long .

" i am innately a literary critic , but with my role on tv , i am not a literary middleman , " she said .
is it because the word " critic " sounds too intellectual ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt tucholsky pop-literature changed the world of criticism " i think that the standards are getting lost , " said writer , journalist and critic hubert winkels .

book reviews are known to incur the wrath of authors and publishers , as well as readers .
that 's why professional literary critics are not exactly the most popular bunch in germany . literary critics enjoy a conflicting reputation in germany .
they are much needed when it comes to weeding out the most important out of 90.000 books that get published in the country year after year .
yet they are also seen as bigheaded know-it-all 's who shred other authors to pieces as payback for their own unsuccessful writing careers .
much has changed in the german marketplace for books over the past decade : reviews no longer exist only in newspapers , journals , magazines and special book-broadcasts , but also on the internet , written by readers for readers .
some see this as a trend that could endanger professional literary criticism .
malicious freeloaders ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics are needed to single out the most important books " you do n't want to be a critic , because it has a bad reputation in the society , " said critic jörg magenau , who writes for the nationwide süddeutsche zeitung .
" critics are people who are malicious about other people 's accomplishments , while they themselves have nothing to offer - that is the cliché of the critic . "
" it 's like being a guy who kind of freeloads off of other people 's accomplishments .
you do n't want to be that guy .
you want to be productive yourself .
i think that 's what 's behind it , " he said .
indeed , literature critics in germany have a reputation as humorless know-it-alls , who are disliked by authors , publishers and readers alike .
above it all , critics today are threatened by the publishers ' marketing .
reading in an accelerated marketplace reviewers have to read more and they have to read faster if they want to succeed in the accelerated publishing market .
they also have to come to terms with the fact that their reviews are not paid well , unless they join the small and exclusive group of full-time critics for major newspapers or journals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has become an important source for book recommendations sigrid löffler , the " grand lady " of german literary criticism and publisher of the magazine literature , is very skeptical about her own profession .
" i can only discourage people to be freelancing literary critics in this marketplace , " löffler said .
" the critic would have to write a great number of reviews to be able to earn a living from his or her writing .
reviewers are paid per each line , so their reviews have to be very long .
they also have to read faster and faster , and to produce their texts more rapidly .
all of this is very ominous !
it harms the quality of the texts , as well as the opinion , " she said .
literary middleman sounds better than literary critic elke heidenreich , host of " lesen " - a successful tv show about literature - strictly avoids the label " critic " even though she is sometimes referred to as germany 's female literary pope -lrb- in reference to marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's most famous critic -rrb- .
she likes to call herself a middleman and not a critic .
" i am innately a literary critic , but with my role on tv , i am not a literary middleman , " she said .
is it because the word " critic " sounds too intellectual ?

is there anything left of that critical spirit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt tucholsky pop-literature changed the world of criticism " i think that the standards are getting lost , " said writer , journalist and critic hubert winkels .
" and not only the technical standards , but also the value and appreciation of what literature can be , " he said .
winkels believes that a shift happened within the practice of literary criticism itself , due to the hype which the success of pop-literature created in germany ten years ago .
authors have become just like pop stars , books have become like top-ten-hits , and readings have turned into parties .
nowadays , criticism is also forced to produce immediate effects and satisfy directly .

there is an addiction to superlatives : praising books to heavens or sending them off to hell .
there is also a bizarre competition among german newspapers to review the top books so quickly , that critics sometimes do n't even have enough time to read the books . " the increasing trend is to write the review of an allegedly important book on the day that it is published , " löfler said .
" because of that , some of the really important new books are read negligently and quickly , because there is not enough time . "

" i rate this a very convincing and compact concept , " bach said .
" i am happy that the winter sports federations ratified it unanimously and that the decision was reached quickly . "
the german winter sports federations agreed on friday that a munich bid would only involve three venues .
under the proposals , the city itself would stage ice events , garmisch-partenkirchen would offer snow sports and bobsleigh , while skeleton sledding and luge would take place at königssee .
having hosted the summer olympics in 1972 and now bidding for the winter olympics , munich is hoping to become the first city to stage both prestigious events .
garmisch-partenkirchen organized the only winter olympics so far in germany in 1936 .
unique chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : königssee already ran with salzburg in an unsuccessful bid to win the 2014 games " the german winter sports federations see munich 's bid as a unique chance and support it unanimously , " said alfons hoermann , president of the german ski federation , after the meeting .
traditional resorts such as ruhpolding -lrb- biathlon -rrb- , inzell -lrb- speed skating -rrb- and oberstdorf -lrb- nordic ski -rrb- were dropped from the concept , with bach reiterating that " only a compact proposal has a chance . "
the final dosb decision on the munich bid is set for early december .
it has already ruled out a bid for summer games in the near future despite interest from hamburg and berlin .
bavaria 's state capital will reportedly have to spend up to 35 million euros -lrb- $ 48 million -rrb- if the dosb approves its bid .

book reviews are known to incur the wrath of authors and publishers , as well as readers .
that 's why professional literary critics are not exactly the most popular bunch in germany . literary critics enjoy a conflicting reputation in germany .
they are much needed when it comes to weeding out the most important out of 90.000 books that get published in the country year after year .
yet they are also seen as bigheaded know-it-all 's who shred other authors to pieces as payback for their own unsuccessful writing careers .
much has changed in the german marketplace for books over the past decade : reviews no longer exist only in newspapers , journals , magazines and special book-broadcasts , but also on the internet , written by readers for readers .
some see this as a trend that could endanger professional literary criticism .
malicious freeloaders ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics are needed to single out the most important books " you do n't want to be a critic , because it has a bad reputation in the society , " said critic jörg magenau , who writes for the nationwide süddeutsche zeitung .
" critics are people who are malicious about other people 's accomplishments , while they themselves have nothing to offer - that is the cliché of the critic . "
" it 's like being a guy who kind of freeloads off of other people 's accomplishments .
you do n't want to be that guy .
you want to be productive yourself .
i think that 's what 's behind it , " he said .
indeed , literature critics in germany have a reputation as humorless know-it-alls , who are disliked by authors , publishers and readers alike .
above it all , critics today are threatened by the publishers ' marketing .
reading in an accelerated marketplace reviewers have to read more and they have to read faster if they want to succeed in the accelerated publishing market .
they also have to come to terms with the fact that their reviews are not paid well , unless they join the small and exclusive group of full-time critics for major newspapers or journals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has become an important source for book recommendations sigrid löffler , the " grand lady " of german literary criticism and publisher of the magazine literature , is very skeptical about her own profession .
" i can only discourage people to be freelancing literary critics in this marketplace , " löffler said .
" the critic would have to write a great number of reviews to be able to earn a living from his or her writing .
reviewers are paid per each line , so their reviews have to be very long .
they also have to read faster and faster , and to produce their texts more rapidly .
all of this is very ominous !
it harms the quality of the texts , as well as the opinion , " she said .
literary middleman sounds better than literary critic elke heidenreich , host of " lesen " - a successful tv show about literature - strictly avoids the label " critic " even though she is sometimes referred to as germany 's female literary pope -lrb- in reference to marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's most famous critic -rrb- .
she likes to call herself a middleman and not a critic .
" i am innately a literary critic , but with my role on tv , i am not a literary middleman , " she said .
is it because the word " critic " sounds too intellectual ?
what happened to the german tradition of criticism along the lines of kurt tucholsky , alfred polgar or alfred kerr ?
is there anything left of that critical spirit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt tucholsky pop-literature changed the world of criticism " i think that the standards are getting lost , " said writer , journalist and critic hubert winkels .
" and not only the technical standards , but also the value and appreciation of what literature can be , " he said .
winkels believes that a shift happened within the practice of literary criticism itself , due to the hype which the success of pop-literature created in germany ten years ago .
authors have become just like pop stars , books have become like top-ten-hits , and readings have turned into parties .
nowadays , criticism is also forced to produce immediate effects and satisfy directly .

there is an addiction to superlatives : praising books to heavens or sending them off to hell .
there is also a bizarre competition among german newspapers to review the top books so quickly , that critics sometimes do n't even have enough time to read the books . " the increasing trend is to write the review of an allegedly important book on the day that it is published , " löfler said .
" because of that , some of the really important new books are read negligently and quickly , because there is not enough time . "
" on the day of publication , there are 150 reviews in the german-speaking area .

" i rate this a very convincing and compact concept , " bach said .
" i am happy that the winter sports federations ratified it unanimously and that the decision was reached quickly . "
the german winter sports federations agreed on friday that a munich bid would only involve three venues .
under the proposals , the city itself would stage ice events , garmisch-partenkirchen would offer snow sports and bobsleigh , while skeleton sledding and luge would take place at königssee .
having hosted the summer olympics in 1972 and now bidding for the winter olympics , munich is hoping to become the first city to stage both prestigious events .
garmisch-partenkirchen organized the only winter olympics so far in germany in 1936 .
unique chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : königssee already ran with salzburg in an unsuccessful bid to win the 2014 games " the german winter sports federations see munich 's bid as a unique chance and support it unanimously , " said alfons hoermann , president of the german ski federation , after the meeting .
traditional resorts such as ruhpolding -lrb- biathlon -rrb- , inzell -lrb- speed skating -rrb- and oberstdorf -lrb- nordic ski -rrb- were dropped from the concept , with bach reiterating that " only a compact proposal has a chance . "
the final dosb decision on the munich bid is set for early december .

" i rate this a very convincing and compact concept , " bach said .
" i am happy that the winter sports federations ratified it unanimously and that the decision was reached quickly . "
the german winter sports federations agreed on friday that a munich bid would only involve three venues .
under the proposals , the city itself would stage ice events , garmisch-partenkirchen would offer snow sports and bobsleigh , while skeleton sledding and luge would take place at königssee .
having hosted the summer olympics in 1972 and now bidding for the winter olympics , munich is hoping to become the first city to stage both prestigious events .
garmisch-partenkirchen organized the only winter olympics so far in germany in 1936 .
unique chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : königssee already ran with salzburg in an unsuccessful bid to win the 2014 games " the german winter sports federations see munich 's bid as a unique chance and support it unanimously , " said alfons hoermann , president of the german ski federation , after the meeting .
traditional resorts such as ruhpolding -lrb- biathlon -rrb- , inzell -lrb- speed skating -rrb- and oberstdorf -lrb- nordic ski -rrb- were dropped from the concept , with bach reiterating that " only a compact proposal has a chance . "
the final dosb decision on the munich bid is set for early december .

book reviews are known to incur the wrath of authors and publishers , as well as readers .
that 's why professional literary critics are not exactly the most popular bunch in germany . literary critics enjoy a conflicting reputation in germany .
they are much needed when it comes to weeding out the most important out of 90.000 books that get published in the country year after year .
yet they are also seen as bigheaded know-it-all 's who shred other authors to pieces as payback for their own unsuccessful writing careers .
much has changed in the german marketplace for books over the past decade : reviews no longer exist only in newspapers , journals , magazines and special book-broadcasts , but also on the internet , written by readers for readers .
some see this as a trend that could endanger professional literary criticism .
malicious freeloaders ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics are needed to single out the most important books " you do n't want to be a critic , because it has a bad reputation in the society , " said critic jörg magenau , who writes for the nationwide süddeutsche zeitung .
" critics are people who are malicious about other people 's accomplishments , while they themselves have nothing to offer - that is the cliché of the critic . "
" it 's like being a guy who kind of freeloads off of other people 's accomplishments .
you do n't want to be that guy .
you want to be productive yourself .
i think that 's what 's behind it , " he said .
indeed , literature critics in germany have a reputation as humorless know-it-alls , who are disliked by authors , publishers and readers alike .
above it all , critics today are threatened by the publishers ' marketing .
reading in an accelerated marketplace reviewers have to read more and they have to read faster if they want to succeed in the accelerated publishing market .
they also have to come to terms with the fact that their reviews are not paid well , unless they join the small and exclusive group of full-time critics for major newspapers or journals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has become an important source for book recommendations sigrid löffler , the " grand lady " of german literary criticism and publisher of the magazine literature , is very skeptical about her own profession .
" i can only discourage people to be freelancing literary critics in this marketplace , " löffler said .
" the critic would have to write a great number of reviews to be able to earn a living from his or her writing .
reviewers are paid per each line , so their reviews have to be very long .
they also have to read faster and faster , and to produce their texts more rapidly .
all of this is very ominous !
it harms the quality of the texts , as well as the opinion , " she said .
literary middleman sounds better than literary critic elke heidenreich , host of " lesen " - a successful tv show about literature - strictly avoids the label " critic " even though she is sometimes referred to as germany 's female literary pope -lrb- in reference to marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's most famous critic -rrb- .
she likes to call herself a middleman and not a critic .
" i am innately a literary critic , but with my role on tv , i am not a literary middleman , " she said .
is it because the word " critic " sounds too intellectual ?
what happened to the german tradition of criticism along the lines of kurt tucholsky , alfred polgar or alfred kerr ?
is there anything left of that critical spirit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt tucholsky pop-literature changed the world of criticism " i think that the standards are getting lost , " said writer , journalist and critic hubert winkels .
" and not only the technical standards , but also the value and appreciation of what literature can be , " he said .
winkels believes that a shift happened within the practice of literary criticism itself , due to the hype which the success of pop-literature created in germany ten years ago .
authors have become just like pop stars , books have become like top-ten-hits , and readings have turned into parties .
nowadays , criticism is also forced to produce immediate effects and satisfy directly .
this goes against the notion of what literary criticism traditionally stood for : written analysis of books .
ready when the book is published bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the literature hype has changed a lot about the way books are reviewed an anti-intellectual atmosphere in the german book industry is evident .
there is an addiction to superlatives : praising books to heavens or sending them off to hell .
there is also a bizarre competition among german newspapers to review the top books so quickly , that critics sometimes do n't even have enough time to read the books . " the increasing trend is to write the review of an allegedly important book on the day that it is published , " löfler said .
" because of that , some of the really important new books are read negligently and quickly , because there is not enough time . "
" on the day of publication , there are 150 reviews in the german-speaking area .
a conversation among the critics is impossible .
there is no exchange . " she said .
reviews are needed whether good or bad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some books get up to 150 reviews on the day they are published many readers today consider book criticism as a kind of book recommendation , whether on the internet or on television .
there is a large amount of forums , where readers can exchange their reading experiences .
professional critics are thereby pushed aside .
yet it is professional critics who prevent the descent of literature into utter consumerism .
" if authors write books , and we do n't talk about them , that 's something resembling death for literature and every single author , " said literary critic jörg magenau .
" as much as authors hate their critics , because the latter never write what the former want , or hope for , there is a need for literary criticism .
if there was no literary criticism , there would be no literature . " dw staff -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics are needed to single out the most important books " you do n't want to be a critic , because it has a bad reputation in the society , " said critic jörg magenau , who writes for the nationwide süddeutsche zeitung .
" critics are people who are malicious about other people 's accomplishments , while they themselves have nothing to offer - that is the cliché of the critic . "
" it 's like being a guy who kind of freeloads off of other people 's accomplishments .
you do n't want to be that guy .
you want to be productive yourself .
i think that 's what 's behind it , " he said .
indeed , literature critics in germany have a reputation as humorless know-it-alls , who are disliked by authors , publishers and readers alike .
above it all , critics today are threatened by the publishers ' marketing .
reading in an accelerated marketplace reviewers have to read more and they have to read faster if they want to succeed in the accelerated publishing market .
they also have to come to terms with the fact that their reviews are not paid well , unless they join the small and exclusive group of full-time critics for major newspapers or journals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has become an important source for book recommendations sigrid löffler , the " grand lady " of german literary criticism and publisher of the magazine literature , is very skeptical about her own profession .
" i can only discourage people to be freelancing literary critics in this marketplace , " löffler said .
" the critic would have to write a great number of reviews to be able to earn a living from his or her writing .
reviewers are paid per each line , so their reviews have to be very long .
they also have to read faster and faster , and to produce their texts more rapidly .
all of this is very ominous !
it harms the quality of the texts , as well as the opinion , " she said .
literary middleman sounds better than literary critic elke heidenreich , host of " lesen " - a successful tv show about literature - strictly avoids the label " critic " even though she is sometimes referred to as germany 's female literary pope -lrb- in reference to marcel reich-ranicki , germany 's most famous critic -rrb- .
she likes to call herself a middleman and not a critic .
" i am innately a literary critic , but with my role on tv , i am not a literary middleman , " she said .
is it because the word " critic " sounds too intellectual ?
what happened to the german tradition of criticism along the lines of kurt tucholsky , alfred polgar or alfred kerr ?
is there anything left of that critical spirit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt tucholsky pop-literature changed the world of criticism " i think that the standards are getting lost , " said writer , journalist and critic hubert winkels .
" and not only the technical standards , but also the value and appreciation of what literature can be , " he said .
winkels believes that a shift happened within the practice of literary criticism itself , due to the hype which the success of pop-literature created in germany ten years ago .
authors have become just like pop stars , books have become like top-ten-hits , and readings have turned into parties .
nowadays , criticism is also forced to produce immediate effects and satisfy directly .
this goes against the notion of what literary criticism traditionally stood for : written analysis of books .
ready when the book is published bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the literature hype has changed a lot about the way books are reviewed an anti-intellectual atmosphere in the german book industry is evident .
there is an addiction to superlatives : praising books to heavens or sending them off to hell .
there is also a bizarre competition among german newspapers to review the top books so quickly , that critics sometimes do n't even have enough time to read the books . " the increasing trend is to write the review of an allegedly important book on the day that it is published , " löfler said .
" because of that , some of the really important new books are read negligently and quickly , because there is not enough time . "
" on the day of publication , there are 150 reviews in the german-speaking area .
a conversation among the critics is impossible .
there is no exchange . " she said .
reviews are needed whether good or bad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some books get up to 150 reviews on the day they are published many readers today consider book criticism as a kind of book recommendation , whether on the internet or on television .
there is a large amount of forums , where readers can exchange their reading experiences .
professional critics are thereby pushed aside .
yet it is professional critics who prevent the descent of literature into utter consumerism .
" if authors write books , and we do n't talk about them , that 's something resembling death for literature and every single author , " said literary critic jörg magenau .
" as much as authors hate their critics , because the latter never write what the former want , or hope for , there is a need for literary criticism .
if there was no literary criticism , there would be no literature . " dw staff -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

book reviews are known to incur the wrath of authors and publishers , as well as readers .
that 's why professional literary critics are not exactly the most popular bunch in germany . literary critics enjoy a conflicting reputation in germany .
they are much needed when it comes to weeding out the most important out of 90.000 books that get published in the country year after year .
yet they are also seen as bigheaded know-it-all 's who shred other authors to pieces as payback for their own unsuccessful writing careers .
much has changed in the german marketplace for books over the past decade : reviews no longer exist only in newspapers , journals , magazines and special book-broadcasts , but also on the internet , written by readers for readers .
some see this as a trend that could endanger professional literary criticism .

torrential rain had caused a river to burst its banks , sending flood water cascading down an old shaft into the mine where the men were working .
rescuers are desperately trying to pump the water out but the chances of finding anyone alive appear slim .
chief rescuer zhu wenyu said he thought the miners had no hope of survival .
the main mine affected , where 172 miners are missing , was completely inundated and many of the missing appear to be stranded far below the surface .
nine other miners are also trapped at a nearby pit .
these accidents are a reminder that chinese coal mines are among the most dangerous in the world , the bbc 's michael bristow reports from beijing .
desperate protest the breach in the dyke on the river wen was finally closed on sunday and pipes and high-speed pumps have been installed , state media report .
continuing rain has frustrated rescuers ' efforts at the mine shandong 's communist party chief , li jianguo , called for " no efforts to be spared " during the rescue work , according to state radio .
distraught relatives of the missing miners have been demonstrating outside the huayuan mining company in xintai city , 450km -lrb- 280 miles -rrb- south of beijing .
yelling abuse at guards , they tried to push their way through barriers after being refused access to the main flooded mine , and demanded that journalists be allowed to investigate properly what had happened .
ren hua , whose husband is one of those trapped , told the associated press that she had been called on friday and told there was no problem and that water was being pumped out of the mine .
but when she arrived on saturday with her 11-year-old son she found the pumping had not started .
" we want to know how much work has been done and whether they are drawing off the water , " she added , weeping .
when the mines became flooded on friday , amid flash floods brought on by rainfall of about 205mm , 584 miners managed to escape .

torrential rain had caused a river to burst its banks , sending flood water cascading down an old shaft into the mine where the men were working .
rescuers are desperately trying to pump the water out but the chances of finding anyone alive appear slim .
chief rescuer zhu wenyu said he thought the miners had no hope of survival .
the main mine affected , where 172 miners are missing , was completely inundated and many of the missing appear to be stranded far below the surface .
nine other miners are also trapped at a nearby pit .
these accidents are a reminder that chinese coal mines are among the most dangerous in the world , the bbc 's michael bristow reports from beijing .
desperate protest the breach in the dyke on the river wen was finally closed on sunday and pipes and high-speed pumps have been installed , state media report .
continuing rain has frustrated rescuers ' efforts at the mine rescue teams shandong 's communist party chief , li jianguo , called for " no efforts to be spared " during the rescue work , according to state radio .
distraught relatives of the missing miners have been demonstrating outside the huayuan mining company in xintai city , 450km -lrb- 280 miles -rrb- south of beijing .
yelling abuse at guards , they tried to push their way through barriers after being refused access to the main flooded mine , and demanded that journalists be allowed to investigate properly what had happened .
ren hua , whose husband is one of those trapped , told the associated press that she had been called on friday and told there was no problem and that water was being pumped out of the mine .
but when she arrived on saturday with her 11-year-old son she found the pumping had not started .
" we want to know how much work has been done and whether they are drawing off the water , " she added , weeping .
when the mines became flooded on friday , amid flash floods brought on by rainfall of about 205mm , 584 miners managed to escape .

kevin rudd went to the club in manhattan in september 2003 during a visit to the city as a un observer .
mr rudd has released a statement apologising for any offence which his actions may have caused .
he is currently riding high in the polls , with a national election expected before the end of the year .
a bookish intellectual with a strong christian faith , kevin rudd has a slightly dull , even nerdy public persona , so many australians will have been surprised to read of his drunken , late-night visit to a new york strip club .
popular figure in september 2003 mr rudd had travelled to new york to attend the united nations as a representative of the australian government .
during his stay he was out for dinner with a new york-based journalist and a fellow labor party mp , after which they went on to a gentleman 's club called scores .
according to the sunday telegraph - one of australia 's leading tabloids - mr rudd was then asked to leave because of inappropriate behaviour .
in a statement released to reporters , the labor leader has confirmed he visited the club but can not recall precisely what happened on the night because he had too much to drink .
he apologised if he had caused any offence and said that he told his wife at the time .
mr rudd became the labor leader in december last year and has enjoyed almost stratospheric approval ratings ever since .
it is unclear if this revelation will damage his chances of becoming prime minister in the election expected before the end of the year .
but in a country which once elected a champion beer drinker as its prime minister - labor 's bob hawke - many think it might actually enhance his chances of success .
