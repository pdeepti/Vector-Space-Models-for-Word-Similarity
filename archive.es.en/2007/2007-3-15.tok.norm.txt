" without the cooperation of these countries , we will not be successful in this area , " german environment minister sigmar gabriel said . a spokesman for gabriel 's ministry said that no concrete decisions were expected from the potsdam talks , which were designed to launch " an honest dialogue " on climate issues . " international negotiations on climate control need urgent political momentum , " he said .
" this is the only way to master the challenge of the century .

" a meeting of this kind brings together the perpetrators of two-thirds of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions and the consumers of around three-quarters of the planet 's biological capacity , " he said . no climate protection without usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steiner praised brazilian efforts to preserve rain forests in addition to climate issues , biodiversity will also be on the agenda of the meeting when the talks start in earnest on friday morning after informal discussions over dinner on thursday . head of the united nations environment program , achim steiner , said on thursday that no progress could be made to stop international climate change without the involvement of the united states .
he also added that there was " no alternative to dialogue . " gabriel , however , said he thought the us , the world 's largest emitter of carbon dioxide , would join a coalition against global warming if developing countries also took part in a trading scheme to buy and sell the right to emit greenhouse gasses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 15.03.2007 " the potential is there for mitigating climate change " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have debated forgoing holidays to combat global warming the european union has ratified an ambitious pact to reduce greenhouse gases .
now , the british government is pushing for its own legally binding targets to reduce emissions even more .
is germany ready for the same ? prime minister tony blair called a draft climate change bill in the uk " revolutionary . "
if it is passed , it would impose legally binding targets to reduce co2 emissions by 60 percent by 2050 . in the past few weeks , german politicians have come up with all sorts of suggestions for trying to reduce emissions and protect the environment - everything from staying home on vacation rather than flying to faraway places to banning " stand-by " modes on electric appliances . dw-world.de spoke with stefan thomas at the wuppertal institute for climate , environment and energy . chancellor angela merkel played a major role in the eu 's agreement last week to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
yet britain has now taken it a step further and proposed a new law that would set legally binding limits on greenhouse gases .
could germany still be doing more ? bildunterschrift : stefan thomas of the wuppertal institute in their treaty , the christian democrats and social democrats in germany 's ruling coalition have set out a political target of limiting co2 emissions by 30 percent in germany without condition , and more if the eu commits itself to the same .
so it 's a similar target to the one in great britain , at least for 2020 .
also , the german parliament has adopted a long-term target of a 60-80 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions , so things are similar in both countries . for me , the question is whether it is really a step forward to have legally binding commitments on the part of the government , or if it is n't more important to look at what the governments are actually doing to reach those targets . what do you see the german government doing ? it has developed good policies on renewable energies for the production of electricity ; it has also developed policies on renewable energies for the production of heat and cooling , and more importantly , also for energy efficiency in the heating sector .
it could do more on energy efficiency regarding electricity end use . german green party parliamentary leader renate künast has said the " stand-by mode " in many appliances should be done away with .
what do you think ? things need to be done wherever possible to conserve energy .
where stand-by mode is need for certain appliances , it should be reduced to using one kilowatt per hour or less .
technology exists for that and it would also be more cost-effective .
it is expected that the european commission will present a proposal for a limit to stand-by energy consumption within the next one or two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hole in the ozone layer over the antarctic has grown over the past few years is responsibility merely being pushed onto the " little guy " ?
what about big factories which may be very inefficient ? we must all do our share .
the producers of goods must do what they can to reduce energy consumption ; there must be inroads in the construction sector to improve energy efficiency in homes and office buildings and energy-consuming industries must do everything they can to conserve energy .
they can also save a lot of money in the process .
people in the residential sector and in private households , of course , must also do something .
i see the role of the government in setting the right framework and providing incentives . you said the technology exists for improving efficiency in the stand-by mode of appliances .
why is n't that being translated into the creation of new products and appliances ? a lot has been achieved already .
stand-by consumption among televisions and vcrs is much lower than it was five or 10 years ago , but as long as there is no enforcement or performance standards , and no legal requirements to provide consumption figures in stand-by modes or even when appliances are being used , there is not enough incentive for manufacturers to optimize all their products .
maximum stand-by power requirements could be made legally binding , making stand-by modes in new products limited to one kilowatt .
also , mandatory labels should be introduced informing consumers about the television they intend to buy actually consumes in energy ; such labels already exist for refrigerators and washing machines . bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and european commission head barroso at the eu summit on the climate and energy this month along a different vein , german politicians have called for reducing speed limits on german highways to help reduce co2 emissions .
does that make sense ?
yes .
one study shows that the direct effect of imposing speed limits would be a reduction of two percent of co2 emissions in the transport sector .
but , since the german car industry is so important in germany , restricting speeds would send a signal to both sides of the market - to the buyers and the manufacturers - that there is not much use in building bigger and heavier cars with stronger motors . of course , speed limits would have the added effect of making roads safer as fewer accidents would occur . are we still thinking too small in terms of climate change and environmental protection ? it 's hard for a lot of people to know where to start .
i think we are making progress in many countries , but a lot still needs to be done .
the buildings in most european countries must be reviewed .
of course , there 's an incentive now with high energy prices to improve the energy efficiency of buildings .
education and financial incentives for builders and consumers are also essential to encourage people to take the initiative and apply alternatives that could be more energy efficient , such as insulating their homes , or replacing water heaters with condensing or solar systems . the potential is there for mitigating climate change .
energy efficiency can reduce consumption by about half by the middle of this century .
more than half of the remaining energy needs could be provided by renewable energies .
both energy efficiency improvements and renewable energies need investments initially , but they then save energy .
and so , if we balance the higher initials investments with the savings that come later , the net extra costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions are quite minimal . louisa schaefer interviewed stefan thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany skeptical about environmental speed limits german politicians scoffed at the idea that speed limits on the country 's autobahns would prevent global warming .
yet the recent european interest in climate change has the german auto industry worried about its image .

he was referring to the threats posed by climate change and international terrorism . call for cooperation " the list of future tasks is long , but one thing is clear - we will only be able to face them if we work together , " steinmeier said .
" the era of nation states is over , at least to the extent that none of our countries can solve these problems on its own . " he also called on the two blocs , which are home to about one-sixth of the world 's population , to help kick-start stalled world trade organization talks . " together however we have a huge pool of resources at our disposal , " steinmeier said .
" some 500 million people live in the eu today , 560 million in the asean countries .
that is over one billion citizens .

" free trade discussions although a free trade deal between the eu and asean is not officially on the agenda in nuremberg , the issue is likely to be raised . the eu executive , the european commission , expects to receive a negotiating mandate from member states for a free trade agreement with asean in the next few months . eu efforts to broker a deal were given fresh impetus when asean nations agreed at a summit in the philippines in january to create a single market of their members by 2015 . myanmar problem yet it remains unclear how the eu can achieve the delicate balancing act of establishing freer trade links while maintaining its strong stance on myanmar . steinmeier will personally express the european concerns to myanmar 's foreign minister u nyan win , diplomats said . but his message is likely to fall on deaf ears as myanmar has repeatedly refused to implement reforms demanded by its bigger asean neighbors and continues to keep pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi under house arrest . thailand meanwhile is expected to use the meeting to inform the eu how it has emerged from a military coup last september . asean comprises brunei , cambodia , indonesia , laos , malaysia , myanmar , the philippines , singapore , thailand and vietnam . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-india summit to foster economic ties the seventh eu-india economic summit will open on friday in finnish capital helsinki .

" if there is not a significant intensification of climate protection , by the year 2100 the total costs caused by climate change could be nearly 3,000 billion euros , " said claudia kemfert , the institute 's environment expert . the report takes into account costs from the direct effects of climate problems including floods , droughts , forest fires and major storms as well as indirect consequences such as increased energy costs and measures to protect dikes and water protection walls . energy revolution needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current energy production methods would have to change if the temperature rises " we require nothing less than an energy revolution , " kemfert added .
" the costs of climate protection are clearly lower than the costs of climate change . " nearly all industrial sectors would be affected by the change , especially the finance industry and existing companies , she said .
the institute calculated that the average german household would face annual extra costs of about 250 euros for heat and electricity . higher temperatures would also have major effects on the landscape .

" if there is not a significant intensification of climate protection , by the year 2100 the total costs caused by climate change could be nearly 3,000 billion euros , " said claudia kemfert , the institute 's environment expert . the report takes into account costs from the direct effects of climate problems including floods , droughts , forest fires and major storms as well as indirect consequences such as increased energy costs and measures to protect dikes and water protection walls . energy revolution needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current energy production methods would have to change if the temperature rises " we require nothing less than an energy revolution , " kemfert added .
" the costs of climate protection are clearly lower than the costs of climate change . " nearly all industrial sectors would be affected by the change , especially the finance industry and existing companies , she said .

he was referring to the threats posed by climate change and international terrorism . call for cooperation " the list of future tasks is long , but one thing is clear - we will only be able to face them if we work together , " steinmeier said .
" the era of nation states is over , at least to the extent that none of our countries can solve these problems on its own . " he also called on the two blocs , which are home to about one-sixth of the world 's population , to help kick-start stalled world trade organization talks . " together however we have a huge pool of resources at our disposal , " steinmeier said .
" some 500 million people live in the eu today , 560 million in the asean countries .
that is over one billion citizens .

" free trade discussions although a free trade deal between the eu and asean is not officially on the agenda in nuremberg , the issue is likely to be raised . the eu executive , the european commission , expects to receive a negotiating mandate from member states for a free trade agreement with asean in the next few months . eu efforts to broker a deal were given fresh impetus when asean nations agreed at a summit in the philippines in january to create a single market of their members by 2015 . myanmar problem yet it remains unclear how the eu can achieve the delicate balancing act of establishing freer trade links while maintaining its strong stance on myanmar . steinmeier will personally express the european concerns to myanmar 's foreign minister u nyan win , diplomats said . but his message is likely to fall on deaf ears as myanmar has repeatedly refused to implement reforms demanded by its bigger asean neighbors and continues to keep pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi under house arrest . thailand meanwhile is expected to use the meeting to inform the eu how it has emerged from a military coup last september . asean comprises brunei , cambodia , indonesia , laos , malaysia , myanmar , the philippines , singapore , thailand and vietnam . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-india summit to foster economic ties the seventh eu-india economic summit will open on friday in finnish capital helsinki .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.03.2007 " i try to be an example of an ' ok ' american " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanning different worlds leaves the author in " the discomfort zone " jonathan franzen is an american author whose 2001 book , " the corrections , " was a bestseller on both sides of the atlantic .
franzen was recently in germany promoting his autobiographical memoir , " the discomfort zone . " jonathan franzen 's new memoir groups six chapters with subjects ranging from his childhood love for " peanuts " comics , to the time he spent studying german literature as a fulbright scholar in berlin , to his current obsession with bird watching .
franzen spoke to dw-world.de shortly before he read to a sell-out crowd at the cologne opera house , as part of this week 's litcologne international literary festival .
dw-world.de : jonathan franzen , how do you explain the success of your writing in europe , considering that your subjects and themes are so essentially american ?
my impression is that europeans in general are much more generous about reading american literature than americans are about reading foreign literature .
some of that may have to do with what entertainment mavens we americans are .
some of the more abstract and philosophically preoccupied european fiction does n't translate so well back the other direction . but i think a lot of it has to do with our being , for better or worse , the one superpower .
and even if you are the enemy of the us - and i can understand why in the last six years you might have been an enemy - it still helps to know that enemy . otherwise , i can say , i 've got great publishers in europe . with bush in the white house and the war in iraq , america 's stock is down right now in europe .
as a result it seems that the balance between admiring and deriding american culture is tipping toward the negative .
what does this mean for an american writer ? the irony of the plummeting of american stock , under cheney and bush , is that europe - each time i come over here - looks more and more like america .
so there is a certain psychological necessity to finding something to hate .
in a way , bush and cheney have given the europeans a great gift - they 've made it morally defensible to dislike the country . i think expats and american writers alike have something verging on a national responsibility to remind europeans that bush didn ’ t win the first election , and he barely won the second one - it was , in its own way , stolen .
and that less than a third of the american population thinks he 's doing a good job .
that 's what i would hope to do as an american writer , to try and be an example of an ok - which is to say , self-critical - american . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franzen : " bush and cheney have made it morally defensible to dislike the us " when you say europe and america are more and more alike , what are you referring to ? i mean the shopping centers .
i got on a train in berlin yesterday , and it was like getting on a plane at the pittsburgh airport : the train station as shopping mall . it just does n't feel like bahnhof zoo .
if you look hard enough , you can still find the imbiss -lrb- snack bar -rrb- , but you have to go by the clothing stores , and the electronics stores , and the banks .
always the banks . can you tell me about the title of your new " personal history , " " the discomfort zone ? " i grew up in the middle of a battlefield in my own family , with very different personalities that were warring with each other .
and i grew up in the middle of a country that was , at the time , very divided between an older generation and a rebellious youth movement generation .
and i 've gone on to inhabit an intensely polarized country - the red-blue , conservative / less-conservative division of the country .
and as a writer i have tried to bridge an almost unbridgeable american gap between the populist and the seriously literary . and in all of these instances , i have felt sympathy for both sides .
and i think just setting yourself up as someone who has affection for both europe and america , and wants to defend one to the other , all of these are themselves recipes for discomfort . and then of course there are the many psychopathologies that i live with as well , that toss off their own discomforts . there is a chapter in " the discomfort zone " called " the foreign language . "
on the surface it appears to be about your learning german and reading german literature . but if you look closer , the chapter is really all about , well , sex , and self-discovery .
did german literature really play such a big role in your personal development ? absolutely , yes .
one of the reasons i studied german was that it was a ticket to europe , a way for my parents to approve of my coming over here by myself , without their surveillance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's annual international literature festival has been on since 2001 and my already-existing interest in being a writer was made much , much worse by my exposure to modern german literature - modern prose in particular - in that it made writing seem not only like a fun job and something i could do to get some attention and entertain people , but like a religion almost .
something that could give meaning to my life , and something that could be part of an effort to really transform myself , and to become the person i needed to be in order to escape from my parents and move on in life . so all of that was really bound up in those exciting years , of 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 .
and i feel fortunate that it was germany , just because i continue to have the highest respect for german literature . a significant theme in " the discomfort zone " is your obsession with your current hobby , bird watching . have you been bird watching during your book tour in germany ? i spent a wonderful eight hours in a field northeast of berlin .
we saw 45 different species of birds , six or seven of them new to me .
it was the real highlight of this trip !
although it 's also nice to do the public presentations and meet readers . at the end of your book , you seem to have grown more comfortable with yourself - not least thanks to the enjoyment you find in bird watching .
would you say you have reached a " comfort zone " after all ? i don ’ t actually feel as if i 'm in a much more easeful place .
even to be out in nature looking at birds , it brings me great joy but it also is really , minute by minute , full of great sadness over the terrible future in store for so many species on the planet , as we change the climate and destroy more and more habitat . so it 's maybe not as exquisite an embarrassment ; it 's turned into something more like a weird mixture of joy and great sadness .
but i would still call it discomfort . but in your book , you talk about coming into your apartment in new york and being grateful that you had at last become the person you always wanted to be … right ? actually , i talk about coming into my apartment and not recognizing the person who lives there - that it feels like i 'm in somebody else 's apartment . whoops .
guess i got that wrong . sorry to disappoint you .
no , that was yet another moment of discomfort . are you working on another novel ?
if so , is it harder to do considering the huge success of " the corrections ? "
winning the national book award is a hard act to follow . i am writing a novel - and it would be hard even if i hadn ’ t had the success with " the corrections . "
it 's always hard , but it 's not like i don ’ t have a lot of confidence now .
yet the more time that goes on , the more stuff you 've used up , so ... no , the the pressure does n't bother me so much .
it 's there , but there is always some sort of pressure like that . there 's always something to complain about as a writer .

" this is fundamental to reach peace , stability and independence of lebanon , " he said . the eu 's top diplomat said he hoped to return to damascus for another round of discussions , but implicitly linked it to syria 's taking the " proper decisions " and its willingness to cooperate on the peace process and on the stability in the region . eu changes policy direction solana 's visit marks a thawing in the relationship between the eu and syria .
official eu contacts with the country have been frozen since the murder of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri in beirut in 2005 .
that attack was widely blamed on syria , which continues to deny any involvement . solana 's visit to damascus comes after france dropped its objections to eu contacts with syria ; french president jacques chirac was a close friend of hariri . but at the damascus press conference , solana avoided a question on whether the eu would completely end the isolation imposed on syria , saying the important thing was that " we are now here , and we are talking in a frank and clear way and look towards the future in a more constructive way . " at the press conference held jointly with the eu official , syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem applauded solana 's talks with assad and other syrian officials as " fruitful and constructive " and stressed that syria supported the full implementation of resolution 1701 . afp / dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu summit closes with focus on middle east as a summit of european leaders concluded friday , chancellor angela merkel said germany would take over the eu presidency in january knowing that it had members ' support for an ambitious six-month program .

he was referring to the threats posed by climate change and international terrorism . call for cooperation " the list of future tasks is long , but one thing is clear - we will only be able to face them if we work together , " steinmeier said .
" the era of nation states is over , at least to the extent that none of our countries can solve these problems on its own . " he also called on the two blocs , which are home to about one-sixth of the world 's population , to help kick-start stalled world trade organization talks . " together however we have a huge pool of resources at our disposal , " steinmeier said .
" some 500 million people live in the eu today , 560 million in the asean countries .
that is over one billion citizens . " the final nuremberg declaration , which is to be signed on the second and final day of the talks that are held every two years , was also expected to make references to human rights and democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : briefing the media : steinmeier -lrb- r . -rrb- and his indonesian counterpart , hassan wirayuda along with the us , the 27-country eu has long criticized asean member myanmar on its rights record . the gathering in the southern german city marks a milestone as the partners are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the establishment of their relations . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said ahead of the meeting that relations between the two regions were " ready to shift up a gear . " free trade discussions although a free trade deal between the eu and asean is not officially on the agenda in nuremberg , the issue is likely to be raised . the eu executive , the european commission , expects to receive a negotiating mandate from member states for a free trade agreement with asean in the next few months . eu efforts to broker a deal were given fresh impetus when asean nations agreed at a summit in the philippines in january to create a single market of their members by 2015 . myanmar problem yet it remains unclear how the eu can achieve the delicate balancing act of establishing freer trade links while maintaining its strong stance on myanmar . steinmeier will personally express the european concerns to myanmar 's foreign minister u nyan win , diplomats said . but his message is likely to fall on deaf ears as myanmar has repeatedly refused to implement reforms demanded by its bigger asean neighbors and continues to keep pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi under house arrest . thailand meanwhile is expected to use the meeting to inform the eu how it has emerged from a military coup last september . asean comprises brunei , cambodia , indonesia , laos , malaysia , myanmar , the philippines , singapore , thailand and vietnam . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-india summit to foster economic ties the seventh eu-india economic summit will open on friday in finnish capital helsinki .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.03.2007 " i try to be an example of an ' ok ' american " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanning different worlds leaves the author in " the discomfort zone " jonathan franzen is an american author whose 2001 book , " the corrections , " was a bestseller on both sides of the atlantic .
franzen was recently in germany promoting his autobiographical memoir , " the discomfort zone . " jonathan franzen 's new memoir groups six chapters with subjects ranging from his childhood love for " peanuts " comics , to the time he spent studying german literature as a fulbright scholar in berlin , to his current obsession with bird watching .
franzen spoke to dw-world.de shortly before he read to a sell-out crowd at the cologne opera house , as part of this week 's litcologne international literary festival .
dw-world.de : jonathan franzen , how do you explain the success of your writing in europe , considering that your subjects and themes are so essentially american ?
my impression is that europeans in general are much more generous about reading american literature than americans are about reading foreign literature .
some of that may have to do with what entertainment mavens we americans are .
some of the more abstract and philosophically preoccupied european fiction does n't translate so well back the other direction . but i think a lot of it has to do with our being , for better or worse , the one superpower .
and even if you are the enemy of the us - and i can understand why in the last six years you might have been an enemy - it still helps to know that enemy . otherwise , i can say , i 've got great publishers in europe . with bush in the white house and the war in iraq , america 's stock is down right now in europe .
as a result it seems that the balance between admiring and deriding american culture is tipping toward the negative .
what does this mean for an american writer ? the irony of the plummeting of american stock , under cheney and bush , is that europe - each time i come over here - looks more and more like america .
so there is a certain psychological necessity to finding something to hate .
in a way , bush and cheney have given the europeans a great gift - they 've made it morally defensible to dislike the country . i think expats and american writers alike have something verging on a national responsibility to remind europeans that bush didn ’ t win the first election , and he barely won the second one - it was , in its own way , stolen .
and that less than a third of the american population thinks he 's doing a good job .
that 's what i would hope to do as an american writer , to try and be an example of an ok - which is to say , self-critical - american . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franzen : " bush and cheney have made it morally defensible to dislike the us " when you say europe and america are more and more alike , what are you referring to ? i mean the shopping centers .
i got on a train in berlin yesterday , and it was like getting on a plane at the pittsburgh airport : the train station as shopping mall . it just does n't feel like bahnhof zoo .
if you look hard enough , you can still find the imbiss -lrb- snack bar -rrb- , but you have to go by the clothing stores , and the electronics stores , and the banks .
always the banks . can you tell me about the title of your new " personal history , " " the discomfort zone ? " i grew up in the middle of a battlefield in my own family , with very different personalities that were warring with each other .
and i grew up in the middle of a country that was , at the time , very divided between an older generation and a rebellious youth movement generation .
and i 've gone on to inhabit an intensely polarized country - the red-blue , conservative / less-conservative division of the country .
and as a writer i have tried to bridge an almost unbridgeable american gap between the populist and the seriously literary . and in all of these instances , i have felt sympathy for both sides .
and i think just setting yourself up as someone who has affection for both europe and america , and wants to defend one to the other , all of these are themselves recipes for discomfort . and then of course there are the many psychopathologies that i live with as well , that toss off their own discomforts . there is a chapter in " the discomfort zone " called " the foreign language . "
on the surface it appears to be about your learning german and reading german literature . but if you look closer , the chapter is really all about , well , sex , and self-discovery .
did german literature really play such a big role in your personal development ? absolutely , yes .
one of the reasons i studied german was that it was a ticket to europe , a way for my parents to approve of my coming over here by myself , without their surveillance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's annual international literature festival has been on since 2001 and my already-existing interest in being a writer was made much , much worse by my exposure to modern german literature - modern prose in particular - in that it made writing seem not only like a fun job and something i could do to get some attention and entertain people , but like a religion almost .
something that could give meaning to my life , and something that could be part of an effort to really transform myself , and to become the person i needed to be in order to escape from my parents and move on in life . so all of that was really bound up in those exciting years , of 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 .
and i feel fortunate that it was germany , just because i continue to have the highest respect for german literature . a significant theme in " the discomfort zone " is your obsession with your current hobby , bird watching . have you been bird watching during your book tour in germany ? i spent a wonderful eight hours in a field northeast of berlin .
we saw 45 different species of birds , six or seven of them new to me .
it was the real highlight of this trip !
although it 's also nice to do the public presentations and meet readers . at the end of your book , you seem to have grown more comfortable with yourself - not least thanks to the enjoyment you find in bird watching .
would you say you have reached a " comfort zone " after all ? i don ’ t actually feel as if i 'm in a much more easeful place .
even to be out in nature looking at birds , it brings me great joy but it also is really , minute by minute , full of great sadness over the terrible future in store for so many species on the planet , as we change the climate and destroy more and more habitat . so it 's maybe not as exquisite an embarrassment ; it 's turned into something more like a weird mixture of joy and great sadness .
but i would still call it discomfort . but in your book , you talk about coming into your apartment in new york and being grateful that you had at last become the person you always wanted to be … right ? actually , i talk about coming into my apartment and not recognizing the person who lives there - that it feels like i 'm in somebody else 's apartment . whoops .
guess i got that wrong . sorry to disappoint you .
no , that was yet another moment of discomfort . are you working on another novel ?
if so , is it harder to do considering the huge success of " the corrections ? "
winning the national book award is a hard act to follow . i am writing a novel - and it would be hard even if i hadn ’ t had the success with " the corrections . "
it 's always hard , but it 's not like i don ’ t have a lot of confidence now .
yet the more time that goes on , the more stuff you 've used up , so ... no , the the pressure does n't bother me so much .
it 's there , but there is always some sort of pressure like that . there 's always something to complain about as a writer .

in a way , bush and cheney have given the europeans a great gift - they 've made it morally defensible to dislike the country . i think expats and american writers alike have something verging on a national responsibility to remind europeans that bush didn ’ t win the first election , and he barely won the second one - it was , in its own way , stolen .
and that less than a third of the american population thinks he 's doing a good job .
that 's what i would hope to do as an american writer , to try and be an example of an ok - which is to say , self-critical - american . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franzen : " bush and cheney have made it morally defensible to dislike the us " when you say europe and america are more and more alike , what are you referring to ? i mean the shopping centers .
i got on a train in berlin yesterday , and it was like getting on a plane at the pittsburgh airport : the train station as shopping mall . it just does n't feel like bahnhof zoo .
if you look hard enough , you can still find the imbiss -lrb- snack bar -rrb- , but you have to go by the clothing stores , and the electronics stores , and the banks .
always the banks . can you tell me about the title of your new " personal history , " " the discomfort zone ? " i grew up in the middle of a battlefield in my own family , with very different personalities that were warring with each other .
and i grew up in the middle of a country that was , at the time , very divided between an older generation and a rebellious youth movement generation .
and i 've gone on to inhabit an intensely polarized country - the red-blue , conservative / less-conservative division of the country .
and as a writer i have tried to bridge an almost unbridgeable american gap between the populist and the seriously literary . and in all of these instances , i have felt sympathy for both sides .
and i think just setting yourself up as someone who has affection for both europe and america , and wants to defend one to the other , all of these are themselves recipes for discomfort . and then of course there are the many psychopathologies that i live with as well , that toss off their own discomforts . there is a chapter in " the discomfort zone " called " the foreign language . "
on the surface it appears to be about your learning german and reading german literature . but if you look closer , the chapter is really all about , well , sex , and self-discovery .
did german literature really play such a big role in your personal development ? absolutely , yes .
one of the reasons i studied german was that it was a ticket to europe , a way for my parents to approve of my coming over here by myself , without their surveillance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's annual international literature festival has been on since 2001 and my already-existing interest in being a writer was made much , much worse by my exposure to modern german literature - modern prose in particular - in that it made writing seem not only like a fun job and something i could do to get some attention and entertain people , but like a religion almost .
something that could give meaning to my life , and something that could be part of an effort to really transform myself , and to become the person i needed to be in order to escape from my parents and move on in life . so all of that was really bound up in those exciting years , of 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 .
and i feel fortunate that it was germany , just because i continue to have the highest respect for german literature . a significant theme in " the discomfort zone " is your obsession with your current hobby , bird watching . have you been bird watching during your book tour in germany ? i spent a wonderful eight hours in a field northeast of berlin .
we saw 45 different species of birds , six or seven of them new to me .
it was the real highlight of this trip !
although it 's also nice to do the public presentations and meet readers . at the end of your book , you seem to have grown more comfortable with yourself - not least thanks to the enjoyment you find in bird watching .
would you say you have reached a " comfort zone " after all ? i don ’ t actually feel as if i 'm in a much more easeful place .
even to be out in nature looking at birds , it brings me great joy but it also is really , minute by minute , full of great sadness over the terrible future in store for so many species on the planet , as we change the climate and destroy more and more habitat . so it 's maybe not as exquisite an embarrassment ; it 's turned into something more like a weird mixture of joy and great sadness .
but i would still call it discomfort . but in your book , you talk about coming into your apartment in new york and being grateful that you had at last become the person you always wanted to be … right ? actually , i talk about coming into my apartment and not recognizing the person who lives there - that it feels like i 'm in somebody else 's apartment . whoops .
guess i got that wrong . sorry to disappoint you .
no , that was yet another moment of discomfort . are you working on another novel ?
if so , is it harder to do considering the huge success of " the corrections ? "
winning the national book award is a hard act to follow . i am writing a novel - and it would be hard even if i hadn ’ t had the success with " the corrections . "
it 's always hard , but it 's not like i don ’ t have a lot of confidence now .
yet the more time that goes on , the more stuff you 've used up , so ... no , the the pressure does n't bother me so much .
it 's there , but there is always some sort of pressure like that . there 's always something to complain about as a writer .
but this is n't a very good time for me to complain - i have a lot to be grateful for . jennifer abramsohn interviewed jonathan franzen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book tips : dw-world.de 's pick of top german books in english are you a book worm ?

" if there is not a significant intensification of climate protection , by the year 2100 the total costs caused by climate change could be nearly 3,000 billion euros , " said claudia kemfert , the institute 's environment expert . the report takes into account costs from the direct effects of climate problems including floods , droughts , forest fires and major storms as well as indirect consequences such as increased energy costs and measures to protect dikes and water protection walls . energy revolution needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current energy production methods would have to change if the temperature rises " we require nothing less than an energy revolution , " kemfert added .
" the costs of climate protection are clearly lower than the costs of climate change . " nearly all industrial sectors would be affected by the change , especially the finance industry and existing companies , she said .
the institute calculated that the average german household would face annual extra costs of about 250 euros for heat and electricity . higher temperatures would also have major effects on the landscape .
an increase of 1 degree celsius would leave 60 percent of german ski areas without snow . malaria headed to europe ? kempfert , however , said she did not expect the temperature change to stay under 2.5 degrees celsius , and that measures would need to be taken to keep the increase to below 4.5 degrees celsius and prevent higher rates of diseases that currently only affect tropical and subtropical regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising temperatures would send german skiers farther in search of snow kemfert said economic losses can be expected even if there is a reduction in greenhouse gases , which are though to play a large role in global warming .
the eu 's new goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent before 2020 " will not stop climate change , " she added . climate change can only be held in check if emissions are cut and renewable energy use is increased in the united states and expanding economies , such as china and india , otherwise it is " very probably that climate change speeds up , " kemfert said . other forecasts other german institutions have presented similar , or worse , predictions of the effects of global warming . germany 's max planck institute estimated that climate change would cost german about 27 billion euros a year by 2050 .

he was referring to the threats posed by climate change and international terrorism . call for cooperation " the list of future tasks is long , but one thing is clear - we will only be able to face them if we work together , " steinmeier said .
" the era of nation states is over , at least to the extent that none of our countries can solve these problems on its own . " he also called on the two blocs , which are home to about one-sixth of the world 's population , to help kick-start stalled world trade organization talks . " together however we have a huge pool of resources at our disposal , " steinmeier said .
" some 500 million people live in the eu today , 560 million in the asean countries .
that is over one billion citizens .

" free trade discussions although a free trade deal between the eu and asean is not officially on the agenda in nuremberg , the issue is likely to be raised . the eu executive , the european commission , expects to receive a negotiating mandate from member states for a free trade agreement with asean in the next few months . eu efforts to broker a deal were given fresh impetus when asean nations agreed at a summit in the philippines in january to create a single market of their members by 2015 . myanmar problem yet it remains unclear how the eu can achieve the delicate balancing act of establishing freer trade links while maintaining its strong stance on myanmar . steinmeier will personally express the european concerns to myanmar 's foreign minister u nyan win , diplomats said . but his message is likely to fall on deaf ears as myanmar has repeatedly refused to implement reforms demanded by its bigger asean neighbors and continues to keep pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi under house arrest . thailand meanwhile is expected to use the meeting to inform the eu how it has emerged from a military coup last september . asean comprises brunei , cambodia , indonesia , laos , malaysia , myanmar , the philippines , singapore , thailand and vietnam . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-india summit to foster economic ties the seventh eu-india economic summit will open on friday in finnish capital helsinki .

now , the british government is pushing for its own legally binding targets to reduce emissions even more .
is germany ready for the same ? prime minister tony blair called a draft climate change bill in the uk " revolutionary . "
if it is passed , it would impose legally binding targets to reduce co2 emissions by 60 percent by 2050 . in the past few weeks , german politicians have come up with all sorts of suggestions for trying to reduce emissions and protect the environment - everything from staying home on vacation rather than flying to faraway places to banning " stand-by " modes on electric appliances . dw-world.de spoke with stefan thomas at the wuppertal institute for climate , environment and energy . chancellor angela merkel played a major role in the eu 's agreement last week to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
yet britain has now taken it a step further and proposed a new law that would set legally binding limits on greenhouse gases .
could germany still be doing more ? bildunterschrift : stefan thomas of the wuppertal institute in their treaty , the christian democrats and social democrats in germany 's ruling coalition have set out a political target of limiting co2 emissions by 30 percent in germany without condition , and more if the eu commits itself to the same .
so it 's a similar target to the one in great britain , at least for 2020 .
also , the german parliament has adopted a long-term target of a 60-80 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions , so things are similar in both countries . for me , the question is whether it is really a step forward to have legally binding commitments on the part of the government , or if it is n't more important to look at what the governments are actually doing to reach those targets . what do you see the german government doing ? it has developed good policies on renewable energies for the production of electricity ; it has also developed policies on renewable energies for the production of heat and cooling , and more importantly , also for energy efficiency in the heating sector .
it could do more on energy efficiency regarding electricity end use . german green party parliamentary leader renate künast has said the " stand-by mode " in many appliances should be done away with .
what do you think ? things need to be done wherever possible to conserve energy .
where stand-by mode is need for certain appliances , it should be reduced to using one kilowatt per hour or less .
technology exists for that and it would also be more cost-effective .
it is expected that the european commission will present a proposal for a limit to stand-by energy consumption within the next one or two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hole in the ozone layer over the antarctic has grown over the past few years is responsibility merely being pushed onto the " little guy " ?
what about big factories which may be very inefficient ? we must all do our share .
the producers of goods must do what they can to reduce energy consumption ; there must be inroads in the construction sector to improve energy efficiency in homes and office buildings and energy-consuming industries must do everything they can to conserve energy .
they can also save a lot of money in the process .
people in the residential sector and in private households , of course , must also do something .
i see the role of the government in setting the right framework and providing incentives . you said the technology exists for improving efficiency in the stand-by mode of appliances .
why is n't that being translated into the creation of new products and appliances ? a lot has been achieved already .
stand-by consumption among televisions and vcrs is much lower than it was five or 10 years ago , but as long as there is no enforcement or performance standards , and no legal requirements to provide consumption figures in stand-by modes or even when appliances are being used , there is not enough incentive for manufacturers to optimize all their products .
maximum stand-by power requirements could be made legally binding , making stand-by modes in new products limited to one kilowatt .
also , mandatory labels should be introduced informing consumers about the television they intend to buy actually consumes in energy ; such labels already exist for refrigerators and washing machines . bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and european commission head barroso at the eu summit on the climate and energy this month along a different vein , german politicians have called for reducing speed limits on german highways to help reduce co2 emissions .
does that make sense ?
yes .
one study shows that the direct effect of imposing speed limits would be a reduction of two percent of co2 emissions in the transport sector .
but , since the german car industry is so important in germany , restricting speeds would send a signal to both sides of the market - to the buyers and the manufacturers - that there is not much use in building bigger and heavier cars with stronger motors . of course , speed limits would have the added effect of making roads safer as fewer accidents would occur . are we still thinking too small in terms of climate change and environmental protection ? it 's hard for a lot of people to know where to start .
i think we are making progress in many countries , but a lot still needs to be done .
the buildings in most european countries must be reviewed .
of course , there 's an incentive now with high energy prices to improve the energy efficiency of buildings .
education and financial incentives for builders and consumers are also essential to encourage people to take the initiative and apply alternatives that could be more energy efficient , such as insulating their homes , or replacing water heaters with condensing or solar systems . the potential is there for mitigating climate change .
energy efficiency can reduce consumption by about half by the middle of this century .
more than half of the remaining energy needs could be provided by renewable energies .
both energy efficiency improvements and renewable energies need investments initially , but they then save energy .
and so , if we balance the higher initials investments with the savings that come later , the net extra costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions are quite minimal . louisa schaefer interviewed stefan thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany skeptical about environmental speed limits german politicians scoffed at the idea that speed limits on the country 's autobahns would prevent global warming .

also , the german parliament has adopted a long-term target of a 60-80 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions , so things are similar in both countries . for me , the question is whether it is really a step forward to have legally binding commitments on the part of the government , or if it is n't more important to look at what the governments are actually doing to reach those targets . what do you see the german government doing ? it has developed good policies on renewable energies for the production of electricity ; it has also developed policies on renewable energies for the production of heat and cooling , and more importantly , also for energy efficiency in the heating sector .
it could do more on energy efficiency regarding electricity end use . german green party parliamentary leader renate künast has said the " stand-by mode " in many appliances should be done away with .
what do you think ? things need to be done wherever possible to conserve energy .
where stand-by mode is need for certain appliances , it should be reduced to using one kilowatt per hour or less .
technology exists for that and it would also be more cost-effective .
it is expected that the european commission will present a proposal for a limit to stand-by energy consumption within the next one or two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hole in the ozone layer over the antarctic has grown over the past few years is responsibility merely being pushed onto the " little guy " ?
what about big factories which may be very inefficient ? we must all do our share .
the producers of goods must do what they can to reduce energy consumption ; there must be inroads in the construction sector to improve energy efficiency in homes and office buildings and energy-consuming industries must do everything they can to conserve energy .
they can also save a lot of money in the process .
people in the residential sector and in private households , of course , must also do something .
i see the role of the government in setting the right framework and providing incentives . you said the technology exists for improving efficiency in the stand-by mode of appliances .
why is n't that being translated into the creation of new products and appliances ? a lot has been achieved already .
stand-by consumption among televisions and vcrs is much lower than it was five or 10 years ago , but as long as there is no enforcement or performance standards , and no legal requirements to provide consumption figures in stand-by modes or even when appliances are being used , there is not enough incentive for manufacturers to optimize all their products .
maximum stand-by power requirements could be made legally binding , making stand-by modes in new products limited to one kilowatt .
also , mandatory labels should be introduced informing consumers about the television they intend to buy actually consumes in energy ; such labels already exist for refrigerators and washing machines . bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and european commission head barroso at the eu summit on the climate and energy this month along a different vein , german politicians have called for reducing speed limits on german highways to help reduce co2 emissions .
does that make sense ?
yes .
one study shows that the direct effect of imposing speed limits would be a reduction of two percent of co2 emissions in the transport sector .
but , since the german car industry is so important in germany , restricting speeds would send a signal to both sides of the market - to the buyers and the manufacturers - that there is not much use in building bigger and heavier cars with stronger motors . of course , speed limits would have the added effect of making roads safer as fewer accidents would occur . are we still thinking too small in terms of climate change and environmental protection ? it 's hard for a lot of people to know where to start .
i think we are making progress in many countries , but a lot still needs to be done .
the buildings in most european countries must be reviewed .
of course , there 's an incentive now with high energy prices to improve the energy efficiency of buildings .
education and financial incentives for builders and consumers are also essential to encourage people to take the initiative and apply alternatives that could be more energy efficient , such as insulating their homes , or replacing water heaters with condensing or solar systems . the potential is there for mitigating climate change .
energy efficiency can reduce consumption by about half by the middle of this century .
more than half of the remaining energy needs could be provided by renewable energies .
both energy efficiency improvements and renewable energies need investments initially , but they then save energy .
and so , if we balance the higher initials investments with the savings that come later , the net extra costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions are quite minimal . louisa schaefer interviewed stefan thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany skeptical about environmental speed limits german politicians scoffed at the idea that speed limits on the country 's autobahns would prevent global warming .

now , the british government is pushing for its own legally binding targets to reduce emissions even more .
is germany ready for the same ? prime minister tony blair called a draft climate change bill in the uk " revolutionary . "
if it is passed , it would impose legally binding targets to reduce co2 emissions by 60 percent by 2050 . in the past few weeks , german politicians have come up with all sorts of suggestions for trying to reduce emissions and protect the environment - everything from staying home on vacation rather than flying to faraway places to banning " stand-by " modes on electric appliances . dw-world.de spoke with stefan thomas at the wuppertal institute for climate , environment and energy . chancellor angela merkel played a major role in the eu 's agreement last week to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
yet britain has now taken it a step further and proposed a new law that would set legally binding limits on greenhouse gases .

" i 'm lost for words , " he said after a dream uefa cup debut .
" i did n't think i 'd get on , especially so soon after the break .
it 's a dream come true and a huge thing for me . " after a goalless first-half , bremen 's patience paid off when they built on their 1-0 lead from the first-leg with two well-taken goals that left coach thomas schaaf pleased with his side 's steady build-up and deadly finishing . " we had to be patient , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.03.2007 " i try to be an example of an ' ok ' american " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanning different worlds leaves the author in " the discomfort zone " jonathan franzen is an american author whose 2001 book , " the corrections , " was a bestseller on both sides of the atlantic .
franzen was recently in germany promoting his autobiographical memoir , " the discomfort zone . " jonathan franzen 's new memoir groups six chapters with subjects ranging from his childhood love for " peanuts " comics , to the time he spent studying german literature as a fulbright scholar in berlin , to his current obsession with bird watching .
franzen spoke to dw-world.de shortly before he read to a sell-out crowd at the cologne opera house , as part of this week 's litcologne international literary festival .
dw-world.de : jonathan franzen , how do you explain the success of your writing in europe , considering that your subjects and themes are so essentially american ?
my impression is that europeans in general are much more generous about reading american literature than americans are about reading foreign literature .
some of that may have to do with what entertainment mavens we americans are .
some of the more abstract and philosophically preoccupied european fiction does n't translate so well back the other direction . but i think a lot of it has to do with our being , for better or worse , the one superpower .
and even if you are the enemy of the us - and i can understand why in the last six years you might have been an enemy - it still helps to know that enemy . otherwise , i can say , i 've got great publishers in europe . with bush in the white house and the war in iraq , america 's stock is down right now in europe .
as a result it seems that the balance between admiring and deriding american culture is tipping toward the negative .
what does this mean for an american writer ? the irony of the plummeting of american stock , under cheney and bush , is that europe - each time i come over here - looks more and more like america .
so there is a certain psychological necessity to finding something to hate .
in a way , bush and cheney have given the europeans a great gift - they 've made it morally defensible to dislike the country . i think expats and american writers alike have something verging on a national responsibility to remind europeans that bush didn ’ t win the first election , and he barely won the second one - it was , in its own way , stolen .
and that less than a third of the american population thinks he 's doing a good job .
that 's what i would hope to do as an american writer , to try and be an example of an ok - which is to say , self-critical - american . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franzen : " bush and cheney have made it morally defensible to dislike the us " when you say europe and america are more and more alike , what are you referring to ? i mean the shopping centers .
i got on a train in berlin yesterday , and it was like getting on a plane at the pittsburgh airport : the train station as shopping mall . it just does n't feel like bahnhof zoo .
if you look hard enough , you can still find the imbiss -lrb- snack bar -rrb- , but you have to go by the clothing stores , and the electronics stores , and the banks .
always the banks . can you tell me about the title of your new " personal history , " " the discomfort zone ? " i grew up in the middle of a battlefield in my own family , with very different personalities that were warring with each other .
and i grew up in the middle of a country that was , at the time , very divided between an older generation and a rebellious youth movement generation .
and i 've gone on to inhabit an intensely polarized country - the red-blue , conservative / less-conservative division of the country .
and as a writer i have tried to bridge an almost unbridgeable american gap between the populist and the seriously literary . and in all of these instances , i have felt sympathy for both sides .
and i think just setting yourself up as someone who has affection for both europe and america , and wants to defend one to the other , all of these are themselves recipes for discomfort . and then of course there are the many psychopathologies that i live with as well , that toss off their own discomforts . there is a chapter in " the discomfort zone " called " the foreign language . "
on the surface it appears to be about your learning german and reading german literature . but if you look closer , the chapter is really all about , well , sex , and self-discovery .
did german literature really play such a big role in your personal development ? absolutely , yes .
one of the reasons i studied german was that it was a ticket to europe , a way for my parents to approve of my coming over here by myself , without their surveillance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's annual international literature festival has been on since 2001 and my already-existing interest in being a writer was made much , much worse by my exposure to modern german literature - modern prose in particular - in that it made writing seem not only like a fun job and something i could do to get some attention and entertain people , but like a religion almost .
something that could give meaning to my life , and something that could be part of an effort to really transform myself , and to become the person i needed to be in order to escape from my parents and move on in life . so all of that was really bound up in those exciting years , of 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 .
and i feel fortunate that it was germany , just because i continue to have the highest respect for german literature . a significant theme in " the discomfort zone " is your obsession with your current hobby , bird watching . have you been bird watching during your book tour in germany ? i spent a wonderful eight hours in a field northeast of berlin .
we saw 45 different species of birds , six or seven of them new to me .
it was the real highlight of this trip !
although it 's also nice to do the public presentations and meet readers . at the end of your book , you seem to have grown more comfortable with yourself - not least thanks to the enjoyment you find in bird watching .
would you say you have reached a " comfort zone " after all ? i don ’ t actually feel as if i 'm in a much more easeful place .
even to be out in nature looking at birds , it brings me great joy but it also is really , minute by minute , full of great sadness over the terrible future in store for so many species on the planet , as we change the climate and destroy more and more habitat . so it 's maybe not as exquisite an embarrassment ; it 's turned into something more like a weird mixture of joy and great sadness .
but i would still call it discomfort . but in your book , you talk about coming into your apartment in new york and being grateful that you had at last become the person you always wanted to be … right ? actually , i talk about coming into my apartment and not recognizing the person who lives there - that it feels like i 'm in somebody else 's apartment . whoops .
guess i got that wrong . sorry to disappoint you .
no , that was yet another moment of discomfort . are you working on another novel ?
if so , is it harder to do considering the huge success of " the corrections ? "
winning the national book award is a hard act to follow . i am writing a novel - and it would be hard even if i hadn ’ t had the success with " the corrections . "
it 's always hard , but it 's not like i don ’ t have a lot of confidence now .
yet the more time that goes on , the more stuff you 've used up , so ... no , the the pressure does n't bother me so much .

franzen was recently in germany promoting his autobiographical memoir , " the discomfort zone . " jonathan franzen 's new memoir groups six chapters with subjects ranging from his childhood love for " peanuts " comics , to the time he spent studying german literature as a fulbright scholar in berlin , to his current obsession with bird watching .
franzen spoke to dw-world.de shortly before he read to a sell-out crowd at the cologne opera house , as part of this week 's litcologne international literary festival .
dw-world.de : jonathan franzen , how do you explain the success of your writing in europe , considering that your subjects and themes are so essentially american ?
my impression is that europeans in general are much more generous about reading american literature than americans are about reading foreign literature .
some of that may have to do with what entertainment mavens we americans are .
some of the more abstract and philosophically preoccupied european fiction does n't translate so well back the other direction . but i think a lot of it has to do with our being , for better or worse , the one superpower .
and even if you are the enemy of the us - and i can understand why in the last six years you might have been an enemy - it still helps to know that enemy . otherwise , i can say , i 've got great publishers in europe . with bush in the white house and the war in iraq , america 's stock is down right now in europe .

" jonathan franzen 's new memoir groups six chapters with subjects ranging from his childhood love for " peanuts " comics , to the time he spent studying german literature as a fulbright scholar in berlin , to his current obsession with bird watching .
franzen spoke to dw-world.de shortly before he read to a sell-out crowd at the cologne opera house , as part of this week 's litcologne international literary festival .
dw-world.de : jonathan franzen , how do you explain the success of your writing in europe , considering that your subjects and themes are so essentially american ?
my impression is that europeans in general are much more generous about reading american literature than americans are about reading foreign literature .
some of that may have to do with what entertainment mavens we americans are .
some of the more abstract and philosophically preoccupied european fiction does n't translate so well back the other direction . but i think a lot of it has to do with our being , for better or worse , the one superpower .
and even if you are the enemy of the us - and i can understand why in the last six years you might have been an enemy - it still helps to know that enemy . otherwise , i can say , i 've got great publishers in europe . with bush in the white house and the war in iraq , america 's stock is down right now in europe .
as a result it seems that the balance between admiring and deriding american culture is tipping toward the negative .
what does this mean for an american writer ? the irony of the plummeting of american stock , under cheney and bush , is that europe - each time i come over here - looks more and more like america .
so there is a certain psychological necessity to finding something to hate .
in a way , bush and cheney have given the europeans a great gift - they 've made it morally defensible to dislike the country . i think expats and american writers alike have something verging on a national responsibility to remind europeans that bush didn ’ t win the first election , and he barely won the second one - it was , in its own way , stolen .
and that less than a third of the american population thinks he 's doing a good job .
that 's what i would hope to do as an american writer , to try and be an example of an ok - which is to say , self-critical - american . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franzen : " bush and cheney have made it morally defensible to dislike the us " when you say europe and america are more and more alike , what are you referring to ? i mean the shopping centers .
i got on a train in berlin yesterday , and it was like getting on a plane at the pittsburgh airport : the train station as shopping mall . it just does n't feel like bahnhof zoo .
if you look hard enough , you can still find the imbiss -lrb- snack bar -rrb- , but you have to go by the clothing stores , and the electronics stores , and the banks .
always the banks . can you tell me about the title of your new " personal history , " " the discomfort zone ? " i grew up in the middle of a battlefield in my own family , with very different personalities that were warring with each other .
and i grew up in the middle of a country that was , at the time , very divided between an older generation and a rebellious youth movement generation .
and i 've gone on to inhabit an intensely polarized country - the red-blue , conservative / less-conservative division of the country .
and as a writer i have tried to bridge an almost unbridgeable american gap between the populist and the seriously literary . and in all of these instances , i have felt sympathy for both sides .
and i think just setting yourself up as someone who has affection for both europe and america , and wants to defend one to the other , all of these are themselves recipes for discomfort . and then of course there are the many psychopathologies that i live with as well , that toss off their own discomforts . there is a chapter in " the discomfort zone " called " the foreign language . "
on the surface it appears to be about your learning german and reading german literature . but if you look closer , the chapter is really all about , well , sex , and self-discovery .
did german literature really play such a big role in your personal development ? absolutely , yes .
one of the reasons i studied german was that it was a ticket to europe , a way for my parents to approve of my coming over here by myself , without their surveillance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's annual international literature festival has been on since 2001 and my already-existing interest in being a writer was made much , much worse by my exposure to modern german literature - modern prose in particular - in that it made writing seem not only like a fun job and something i could do to get some attention and entertain people , but like a religion almost .
something that could give meaning to my life , and something that could be part of an effort to really transform myself , and to become the person i needed to be in order to escape from my parents and move on in life . so all of that was really bound up in those exciting years , of 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 .
and i feel fortunate that it was germany , just because i continue to have the highest respect for german literature . a significant theme in " the discomfort zone " is your obsession with your current hobby , bird watching . have you been bird watching during your book tour in germany ? i spent a wonderful eight hours in a field northeast of berlin .
we saw 45 different species of birds , six or seven of them new to me .
it was the real highlight of this trip !
although it 's also nice to do the public presentations and meet readers . at the end of your book , you seem to have grown more comfortable with yourself - not least thanks to the enjoyment you find in bird watching .
would you say you have reached a " comfort zone " after all ? i don ’ t actually feel as if i 'm in a much more easeful place .
even to be out in nature looking at birds , it brings me great joy but it also is really , minute by minute , full of great sadness over the terrible future in store for so many species on the planet , as we change the climate and destroy more and more habitat . so it 's maybe not as exquisite an embarrassment ; it 's turned into something more like a weird mixture of joy and great sadness .
but i would still call it discomfort . but in your book , you talk about coming into your apartment in new york and being grateful that you had at last become the person you always wanted to be … right ? actually , i talk about coming into my apartment and not recognizing the person who lives there - that it feels like i 'm in somebody else 's apartment . whoops .
guess i got that wrong . sorry to disappoint you .
no , that was yet another moment of discomfort . are you working on another novel ?
if so , is it harder to do considering the huge success of " the corrections ? "
winning the national book award is a hard act to follow . i am writing a novel - and it would be hard even if i hadn ’ t had the success with " the corrections . "
it 's always hard , but it 's not like i don ’ t have a lot of confidence now .
yet the more time that goes on , the more stuff you 've used up , so ... no , the the pressure does n't bother me so much .
it 's there , but there is always some sort of pressure like that . there 's always something to complain about as a writer .

" this is fundamental to reach peace , stability and independence of lebanon , " he said . the eu 's top diplomat said he hoped to return to damascus for another round of discussions , but implicitly linked it to syria 's taking the " proper decisions " and its willingness to cooperate on the peace process and on the stability in the region . eu changes policy direction solana 's visit marks a thawing in the relationship between the eu and syria .
official eu contacts with the country have been frozen since the murder of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri in beirut in 2005 .
that attack was widely blamed on syria , which continues to deny any involvement . solana 's visit to damascus comes after france dropped its objections to eu contacts with syria ; french president jacques chirac was a close friend of hariri . but at the damascus press conference , solana avoided a question on whether the eu would completely end the isolation imposed on syria , saying the important thing was that " we are now here , and we are talking in a frank and clear way and look towards the future in a more constructive way . " at the press conference held jointly with the eu official , syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem applauded solana 's talks with assad and other syrian officials as " fruitful and constructive " and stressed that syria supported the full implementation of resolution 1701 . afp / dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu summit closes with focus on middle east as a summit of european leaders concluded friday , chancellor angela merkel said germany would take over the eu presidency in january knowing that it had members ' support for an ambitious six-month program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.03.2007 " the potential is there for mitigating climate change " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have debated forgoing holidays to combat global warming the european union has ratified an ambitious pact to reduce greenhouse gases .
now , the british government is pushing for its own legally binding targets to reduce emissions even more .
is germany ready for the same ? prime minister tony blair called a draft climate change bill in the uk " revolutionary . "
if it is passed , it would impose legally binding targets to reduce co2 emissions by 60 percent by 2050 . in the past few weeks , german politicians have come up with all sorts of suggestions for trying to reduce emissions and protect the environment - everything from staying home on vacation rather than flying to faraway places to banning " stand-by " modes on electric appliances . dw-world.de spoke with stefan thomas at the wuppertal institute for climate , environment and energy . chancellor angela merkel played a major role in the eu 's agreement last week to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
yet britain has now taken it a step further and proposed a new law that would set legally binding limits on greenhouse gases .
could germany still be doing more ? bildunterschrift : stefan thomas of the wuppertal institute in their treaty , the christian democrats and social democrats in germany 's ruling coalition have set out a political target of limiting co2 emissions by 30 percent in germany without condition , and more if the eu commits itself to the same .
so it 's a similar target to the one in great britain , at least for 2020 .
also , the german parliament has adopted a long-term target of a 60-80 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions , so things are similar in both countries . for me , the question is whether it is really a step forward to have legally binding commitments on the part of the government , or if it is n't more important to look at what the governments are actually doing to reach those targets . what do you see the german government doing ? it has developed good policies on renewable energies for the production of electricity ; it has also developed policies on renewable energies for the production of heat and cooling , and more importantly , also for energy efficiency in the heating sector .
it could do more on energy efficiency regarding electricity end use . german green party parliamentary leader renate künast has said the " stand-by mode " in many appliances should be done away with .
what do you think ? things need to be done wherever possible to conserve energy .
where stand-by mode is need for certain appliances , it should be reduced to using one kilowatt per hour or less .
technology exists for that and it would also be more cost-effective .
it is expected that the european commission will present a proposal for a limit to stand-by energy consumption within the next one or two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hole in the ozone layer over the antarctic has grown over the past few years is responsibility merely being pushed onto the " little guy " ?
what about big factories which may be very inefficient ? we must all do our share .
the producers of goods must do what they can to reduce energy consumption ; there must be inroads in the construction sector to improve energy efficiency in homes and office buildings and energy-consuming industries must do everything they can to conserve energy .
they can also save a lot of money in the process .
people in the residential sector and in private households , of course , must also do something .
i see the role of the government in setting the right framework and providing incentives . you said the technology exists for improving efficiency in the stand-by mode of appliances .
why is n't that being translated into the creation of new products and appliances ? a lot has been achieved already .
stand-by consumption among televisions and vcrs is much lower than it was five or 10 years ago , but as long as there is no enforcement or performance standards , and no legal requirements to provide consumption figures in stand-by modes or even when appliances are being used , there is not enough incentive for manufacturers to optimize all their products .
maximum stand-by power requirements could be made legally binding , making stand-by modes in new products limited to one kilowatt .
also , mandatory labels should be introduced informing consumers about the television they intend to buy actually consumes in energy ; such labels already exist for refrigerators and washing machines . bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and european commission head barroso at the eu summit on the climate and energy this month along a different vein , german politicians have called for reducing speed limits on german highways to help reduce co2 emissions .
does that make sense ?
yes .
one study shows that the direct effect of imposing speed limits would be a reduction of two percent of co2 emissions in the transport sector .
but , since the german car industry is so important in germany , restricting speeds would send a signal to both sides of the market - to the buyers and the manufacturers - that there is not much use in building bigger and heavier cars with stronger motors . of course , speed limits would have the added effect of making roads safer as fewer accidents would occur . are we still thinking too small in terms of climate change and environmental protection ? it 's hard for a lot of people to know where to start .
i think we are making progress in many countries , but a lot still needs to be done .
the buildings in most european countries must be reviewed .
of course , there 's an incentive now with high energy prices to improve the energy efficiency of buildings .
education and financial incentives for builders and consumers are also essential to encourage people to take the initiative and apply alternatives that could be more energy efficient , such as insulating their homes , or replacing water heaters with condensing or solar systems . the potential is there for mitigating climate change .
energy efficiency can reduce consumption by about half by the middle of this century .
more than half of the remaining energy needs could be provided by renewable energies .
both energy efficiency improvements and renewable energies need investments initially , but they then save energy .
and so , if we balance the higher initials investments with the savings that come later , the net extra costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions are quite minimal . louisa schaefer interviewed stefan thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany skeptical about environmental speed limits german politicians scoffed at the idea that speed limits on the country 's autobahns would prevent global warming .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.03.2007 " i try to be an example of an ' ok ' american " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanning different worlds leaves the author in " the discomfort zone " jonathan franzen is an american author whose 2001 book , " the corrections , " was a bestseller on both sides of the atlantic .
franzen was recently in germany promoting his autobiographical memoir , " the discomfort zone . " jonathan franzen 's new memoir groups six chapters with subjects ranging from his childhood love for " peanuts " comics , to the time he spent studying german literature as a fulbright scholar in berlin , to his current obsession with bird watching .
franzen spoke to dw-world.de shortly before he read to a sell-out crowd at the cologne opera house , as part of this week 's litcologne international literary festival .
dw-world.de : jonathan franzen , how do you explain the success of your writing in europe , considering that your subjects and themes are so essentially american ?
my impression is that europeans in general are much more generous about reading american literature than americans are about reading foreign literature .
some of that may have to do with what entertainment mavens we americans are .
some of the more abstract and philosophically preoccupied european fiction does n't translate so well back the other direction . but i think a lot of it has to do with our being , for better or worse , the one superpower .
and even if you are the enemy of the us - and i can understand why in the last six years you might have been an enemy - it still helps to know that enemy . otherwise , i can say , i 've got great publishers in europe . with bush in the white house and the war in iraq , america 's stock is down right now in europe .
as a result it seems that the balance between admiring and deriding american culture is tipping toward the negative .
what does this mean for an american writer ? the irony of the plummeting of american stock , under cheney and bush , is that europe - each time i come over here - looks more and more like america .
so there is a certain psychological necessity to finding something to hate .
in a way , bush and cheney have given the europeans a great gift - they 've made it morally defensible to dislike the country . i think expats and american writers alike have something verging on a national responsibility to remind europeans that bush didn ’ t win the first election , and he barely won the second one - it was , in its own way , stolen .
and that less than a third of the american population thinks he 's doing a good job .
that 's what i would hope to do as an american writer , to try and be an example of an ok - which is to say , self-critical - american . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franzen : " bush and cheney have made it morally defensible to dislike the us " when you say europe and america are more and more alike , what are you referring to ? i mean the shopping centers .
i got on a train in berlin yesterday , and it was like getting on a plane at the pittsburgh airport : the train station as shopping mall . it just does n't feel like bahnhof zoo .
if you look hard enough , you can still find the imbiss -lrb- snack bar -rrb- , but you have to go by the clothing stores , and the electronics stores , and the banks .
always the banks . can you tell me about the title of your new " personal history , " " the discomfort zone ? " i grew up in the middle of a battlefield in my own family , with very different personalities that were warring with each other .
and i grew up in the middle of a country that was , at the time , very divided between an older generation and a rebellious youth movement generation .
and i 've gone on to inhabit an intensely polarized country - the red-blue , conservative / less-conservative division of the country .
and as a writer i have tried to bridge an almost unbridgeable american gap between the populist and the seriously literary . and in all of these instances , i have felt sympathy for both sides .
and i think just setting yourself up as someone who has affection for both europe and america , and wants to defend one to the other , all of these are themselves recipes for discomfort . and then of course there are the many psychopathologies that i live with as well , that toss off their own discomforts . there is a chapter in " the discomfort zone " called " the foreign language . "
on the surface it appears to be about your learning german and reading german literature . but if you look closer , the chapter is really all about , well , sex , and self-discovery .
did german literature really play such a big role in your personal development ? absolutely , yes .
one of the reasons i studied german was that it was a ticket to europe , a way for my parents to approve of my coming over here by myself , without their surveillance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's annual international literature festival has been on since 2001 and my already-existing interest in being a writer was made much , much worse by my exposure to modern german literature - modern prose in particular - in that it made writing seem not only like a fun job and something i could do to get some attention and entertain people , but like a religion almost .
something that could give meaning to my life , and something that could be part of an effort to really transform myself , and to become the person i needed to be in order to escape from my parents and move on in life . so all of that was really bound up in those exciting years , of 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 .
and i feel fortunate that it was germany , just because i continue to have the highest respect for german literature . a significant theme in " the discomfort zone " is your obsession with your current hobby , bird watching . have you been bird watching during your book tour in germany ? i spent a wonderful eight hours in a field northeast of berlin .
we saw 45 different species of birds , six or seven of them new to me .
it was the real highlight of this trip !
although it 's also nice to do the public presentations and meet readers . at the end of your book , you seem to have grown more comfortable with yourself - not least thanks to the enjoyment you find in bird watching .
would you say you have reached a " comfort zone " after all ? i don ’ t actually feel as if i 'm in a much more easeful place .
even to be out in nature looking at birds , it brings me great joy but it also is really , minute by minute , full of great sadness over the terrible future in store for so many species on the planet , as we change the climate and destroy more and more habitat . so it 's maybe not as exquisite an embarrassment ; it 's turned into something more like a weird mixture of joy and great sadness .
but i would still call it discomfort . but in your book , you talk about coming into your apartment in new york and being grateful that you had at last become the person you always wanted to be … right ? actually , i talk about coming into my apartment and not recognizing the person who lives there - that it feels like i 'm in somebody else 's apartment . whoops .
guess i got that wrong . sorry to disappoint you .
no , that was yet another moment of discomfort . are you working on another novel ?
if so , is it harder to do considering the huge success of " the corrections ? "
winning the national book award is a hard act to follow . i am writing a novel - and it would be hard even if i hadn ’ t had the success with " the corrections . "
it 's always hard , but it 's not like i don ’ t have a lot of confidence now .
yet the more time that goes on , the more stuff you 've used up , so ... no , the the pressure does n't bother me so much .
it 's there , but there is always some sort of pressure like that . there 's always something to complain about as a writer .
but this is n't a very good time for me to complain - i have a lot to be grateful for . jennifer abramsohn interviewed jonathan franzen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book tips : dw-world.de 's pick of top german books in english are you a book worm ?

if it is passed , it would impose legally binding targets to reduce co2 emissions by 60 percent by 2050 . in the past few weeks , german politicians have come up with all sorts of suggestions for trying to reduce emissions and protect the environment - everything from staying home on vacation rather than flying to faraway places to banning " stand-by " modes on electric appliances . dw-world.de spoke with stefan thomas at the wuppertal institute for climate , environment and energy . chancellor angela merkel played a major role in the eu 's agreement last week to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
yet britain has now taken it a step further and proposed a new law that would set legally binding limits on greenhouse gases .
could germany still be doing more ? bildunterschrift : stefan thomas of the wuppertal institute in their treaty , the christian democrats and social democrats in germany 's ruling coalition have set out a political target of limiting co2 emissions by 30 percent in germany without condition , and more if the eu commits itself to the same .
so it 's a similar target to the one in great britain , at least for 2020 .
also , the german parliament has adopted a long-term target of a 60-80 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions , so things are similar in both countries . for me , the question is whether it is really a step forward to have legally binding commitments on the part of the government , or if it is n't more important to look at what the governments are actually doing to reach those targets . what do you see the german government doing ? it has developed good policies on renewable energies for the production of electricity ; it has also developed policies on renewable energies for the production of heat and cooling , and more importantly , also for energy efficiency in the heating sector .
it could do more on energy efficiency regarding electricity end use . german green party parliamentary leader renate künast has said the " stand-by mode " in many appliances should be done away with .
what do you think ? things need to be done wherever possible to conserve energy .
where stand-by mode is need for certain appliances , it should be reduced to using one kilowatt per hour or less .

it is expected that the european commission will present a proposal for a limit to stand-by energy consumption within the next one or two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hole in the ozone layer over the antarctic has grown over the past few years is responsibility merely being pushed onto the " little guy " ?
what about big factories which may be very inefficient ? we must all do our share .
the producers of goods must do what they can to reduce energy consumption ; there must be inroads in the construction sector to improve energy efficiency in homes and office buildings and energy-consuming industries must do everything they can to conserve energy .
they can also save a lot of money in the process .
people in the residential sector and in private households , of course , must also do something .
i see the role of the government in setting the right framework and providing incentives . you said the technology exists for improving efficiency in the stand-by mode of appliances .
why is n't that being translated into the creation of new products and appliances ? a lot has been achieved already .
stand-by consumption among televisions and vcrs is much lower than it was five or 10 years ago , but as long as there is no enforcement or performance standards , and no legal requirements to provide consumption figures in stand-by modes or even when appliances are being used , there is not enough incentive for manufacturers to optimize all their products .
maximum stand-by power requirements could be made legally binding , making stand-by modes in new products limited to one kilowatt .
also , mandatory labels should be introduced informing consumers about the television they intend to buy actually consumes in energy ; such labels already exist for refrigerators and washing machines . bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and european commission head barroso at the eu summit on the climate and energy this month along a different vein , german politicians have called for reducing speed limits on german highways to help reduce co2 emissions .

now , the british government is pushing for its own legally binding targets to reduce emissions even more .
is germany ready for the same ? prime minister tony blair called a draft climate change bill in the uk " revolutionary . "
if it is passed , it would impose legally binding targets to reduce co2 emissions by 60 percent by 2050 . in the past few weeks , german politicians have come up with all sorts of suggestions for trying to reduce emissions and protect the environment - everything from staying home on vacation rather than flying to faraway places to banning " stand-by " modes on electric appliances . dw-world.de spoke with stefan thomas at the wuppertal institute for climate , environment and energy . chancellor angela merkel played a major role in the eu 's agreement last week to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
yet britain has now taken it a step further and proposed a new law that would set legally binding limits on greenhouse gases .
could germany still be doing more ? bildunterschrift : stefan thomas of the wuppertal institute in their treaty , the christian democrats and social democrats in germany 's ruling coalition have set out a political target of limiting co2 emissions by 30 percent in germany without condition , and more if the eu commits itself to the same .
so it 's a similar target to the one in great britain , at least for 2020 .
also , the german parliament has adopted a long-term target of a 60-80 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions , so things are similar in both countries . for me , the question is whether it is really a step forward to have legally binding commitments on the part of the government , or if it is n't more important to look at what the governments are actually doing to reach those targets . what do you see the german government doing ? it has developed good policies on renewable energies for the production of electricity ; it has also developed policies on renewable energies for the production of heat and cooling , and more importantly , also for energy efficiency in the heating sector .
it could do more on energy efficiency regarding electricity end use . german green party parliamentary leader renate künast has said the " stand-by mode " in many appliances should be done away with .
what do you think ? things need to be done wherever possible to conserve energy .
where stand-by mode is need for certain appliances , it should be reduced to using one kilowatt per hour or less .
technology exists for that and it would also be more cost-effective .
it is expected that the european commission will present a proposal for a limit to stand-by energy consumption within the next one or two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hole in the ozone layer over the antarctic has grown over the past few years is responsibility merely being pushed onto the " little guy " ?
what about big factories which may be very inefficient ? we must all do our share .
the producers of goods must do what they can to reduce energy consumption ; there must be inroads in the construction sector to improve energy efficiency in homes and office buildings and energy-consuming industries must do everything they can to conserve energy .

stand-by consumption among televisions and vcrs is much lower than it was five or 10 years ago , but as long as there is no enforcement or performance standards , and no legal requirements to provide consumption figures in stand-by modes or even when appliances are being used , there is not enough incentive for manufacturers to optimize all their products .

does that make sense ?
yes .
one study shows that the direct effect of imposing speed limits would be a reduction of two percent of co2 emissions in the transport sector .
but , since the german car industry is so important in germany , restricting speeds would send a signal to both sides of the market - to the buyers and the manufacturers - that there is not much use in building bigger and heavier cars with stronger motors . of course , speed limits would have the added effect of making roads safer as fewer accidents would occur . are we still thinking too small in terms of climate change and environmental protection ? it 's hard for a lot of people to know where to start .

education and financial incentives for builders and consumers are also essential to encourage people to take the initiative and apply alternatives that could be more energy efficient , such as insulating their homes , or replacing water heaters with condensing or solar systems . the potential is there for mitigating climate change .
energy efficiency can reduce consumption by about half by the middle of this century .
more than half of the remaining energy needs could be provided by renewable energies .

" this is fundamental to reach peace , stability and independence of lebanon , " he said . the eu 's top diplomat said he hoped to return to damascus for another round of discussions , but implicitly linked it to syria 's taking the " proper decisions " and its willingness to cooperate on the peace process and on the stability in the region . eu changes policy direction solana 's visit marks a thawing in the relationship between the eu and syria .
official eu contacts with the country have been frozen since the murder of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri in beirut in 2005 .
that attack was widely blamed on syria , which continues to deny any involvement . solana 's visit to damascus comes after france dropped its objections to eu contacts with syria ; french president jacques chirac was a close friend of hariri . but at the damascus press conference , solana avoided a question on whether the eu would completely end the isolation imposed on syria , saying the important thing was that " we are now here , and we are talking in a frank and clear way and look towards the future in a more constructive way . " at the press conference held jointly with the eu official , syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem applauded solana 's talks with assad and other syrian officials as " fruitful and constructive " and stressed that syria supported the full implementation of resolution 1701 . afp / dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu summit closes with focus on middle east as a summit of european leaders concluded friday , chancellor angela merkel said germany would take over the eu presidency in january knowing that it had members ' support for an ambitious six-month program .

he was referring to the threats posed by climate change and international terrorism . call for cooperation " the list of future tasks is long , but one thing is clear - we will only be able to face them if we work together , " steinmeier said .
" the era of nation states is over , at least to the extent that none of our countries can solve these problems on its own .

" together however we have a huge pool of resources at our disposal , " steinmeier said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.03.2007 " i try to be an example of an ' ok ' american " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanning different worlds leaves the author in " the discomfort zone " jonathan franzen is an american author whose 2001 book , " the corrections , " was a bestseller on both sides of the atlantic .
franzen was recently in germany promoting his autobiographical memoir , " the discomfort zone . " jonathan franzen 's new memoir groups six chapters with subjects ranging from his childhood love for " peanuts " comics , to the time he spent studying german literature as a fulbright scholar in berlin , to his current obsession with bird watching .
franzen spoke to dw-world.de shortly before he read to a sell-out crowd at the cologne opera house , as part of this week 's litcologne international literary festival .
dw-world.de : jonathan franzen , how do you explain the success of your writing in europe , considering that your subjects and themes are so essentially american ?
my impression is that europeans in general are much more generous about reading american literature than americans are about reading foreign literature .
some of that may have to do with what entertainment mavens we americans are .
some of the more abstract and philosophically preoccupied european fiction does n't translate so well back the other direction . but i think a lot of it has to do with our being , for better or worse , the one superpower .
and even if you are the enemy of the us - and i can understand why in the last six years you might have been an enemy - it still helps to know that enemy . otherwise , i can say , i 've got great publishers in europe . with bush in the white house and the war in iraq , america 's stock is down right now in europe .
as a result it seems that the balance between admiring and deriding american culture is tipping toward the negative .
what does this mean for an american writer ? the irony of the plummeting of american stock , under cheney and bush , is that europe - each time i come over here - looks more and more like america .
so there is a certain psychological necessity to finding something to hate .
in a way , bush and cheney have given the europeans a great gift - they 've made it morally defensible to dislike the country . i think expats and american writers alike have something verging on a national responsibility to remind europeans that bush didn ’ t win the first election , and he barely won the second one - it was , in its own way , stolen .
and that less than a third of the american population thinks he 's doing a good job .
that 's what i would hope to do as an american writer , to try and be an example of an ok - which is to say , self-critical - american . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franzen : " bush and cheney have made it morally defensible to dislike the us " when you say europe and america are more and more alike , what are you referring to ? i mean the shopping centers .
i got on a train in berlin yesterday , and it was like getting on a plane at the pittsburgh airport : the train station as shopping mall . it just does n't feel like bahnhof zoo .
if you look hard enough , you can still find the imbiss -lrb- snack bar -rrb- , but you have to go by the clothing stores , and the electronics stores , and the banks .
always the banks . can you tell me about the title of your new " personal history , " " the discomfort zone ? " i grew up in the middle of a battlefield in my own family , with very different personalities that were warring with each other .
and i grew up in the middle of a country that was , at the time , very divided between an older generation and a rebellious youth movement generation .
and i 've gone on to inhabit an intensely polarized country - the red-blue , conservative / less-conservative division of the country .
and as a writer i have tried to bridge an almost unbridgeable american gap between the populist and the seriously literary . and in all of these instances , i have felt sympathy for both sides .
and i think just setting yourself up as someone who has affection for both europe and america , and wants to defend one to the other , all of these are themselves recipes for discomfort . and then of course there are the many psychopathologies that i live with as well , that toss off their own discomforts . there is a chapter in " the discomfort zone " called " the foreign language . "
on the surface it appears to be about your learning german and reading german literature . but if you look closer , the chapter is really all about , well , sex , and self-discovery .
did german literature really play such a big role in your personal development ? absolutely , yes .
one of the reasons i studied german was that it was a ticket to europe , a way for my parents to approve of my coming over here by myself , without their surveillance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's annual international literature festival has been on since 2001 and my already-existing interest in being a writer was made much , much worse by my exposure to modern german literature - modern prose in particular - in that it made writing seem not only like a fun job and something i could do to get some attention and entertain people , but like a religion almost .
something that could give meaning to my life , and something that could be part of an effort to really transform myself , and to become the person i needed to be in order to escape from my parents and move on in life . so all of that was really bound up in those exciting years , of 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 .
and i feel fortunate that it was germany , just because i continue to have the highest respect for german literature . a significant theme in " the discomfort zone " is your obsession with your current hobby , bird watching . have you been bird watching during your book tour in germany ? i spent a wonderful eight hours in a field northeast of berlin .
we saw 45 different species of birds , six or seven of them new to me .
it was the real highlight of this trip !
although it 's also nice to do the public presentations and meet readers . at the end of your book , you seem to have grown more comfortable with yourself - not least thanks to the enjoyment you find in bird watching .
would you say you have reached a " comfort zone " after all ? i don ’ t actually feel as if i 'm in a much more easeful place .
even to be out in nature looking at birds , it brings me great joy but it also is really , minute by minute , full of great sadness over the terrible future in store for so many species on the planet , as we change the climate and destroy more and more habitat . so it 's maybe not as exquisite an embarrassment ; it 's turned into something more like a weird mixture of joy and great sadness .
but i would still call it discomfort . but in your book , you talk about coming into your apartment in new york and being grateful that you had at last become the person you always wanted to be … right ? actually , i talk about coming into my apartment and not recognizing the person who lives there - that it feels like i 'm in somebody else 's apartment . whoops .
guess i got that wrong . sorry to disappoint you .
no , that was yet another moment of discomfort . are you working on another novel ?
if so , is it harder to do considering the huge success of " the corrections ? "
winning the national book award is a hard act to follow . i am writing a novel - and it would be hard even if i hadn ’ t had the success with " the corrections . "
it 's always hard , but it 's not like i don ’ t have a lot of confidence now .
yet the more time that goes on , the more stuff you 've used up , so ... no , the the pressure does n't bother me so much .
it 's there , but there is always some sort of pressure like that . there 's always something to complain about as a writer .

something that could give meaning to my life , and something that could be part of an effort to really transform myself , and to become the person i needed to be in order to escape from my parents and move on in life . so all of that was really bound up in those exciting years , of 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 .

franzen was recently in germany promoting his autobiographical memoir , " the discomfort zone . " jonathan franzen 's new memoir groups six chapters with subjects ranging from his childhood love for " peanuts " comics , to the time he spent studying german literature as a fulbright scholar in berlin , to his current obsession with bird watching .
franzen spoke to dw-world.de shortly before he read to a sell-out crowd at the cologne opera house , as part of this week 's litcologne international literary festival .
dw-world.de : jonathan franzen , how do you explain the success of your writing in europe , considering that your subjects and themes are so essentially american ?
my impression is that europeans in general are much more generous about reading american literature than americans are about reading foreign literature .
some of that may have to do with what entertainment mavens we americans are .
some of the more abstract and philosophically preoccupied european fiction does n't translate so well back the other direction . but i think a lot of it has to do with our being , for better or worse , the one superpower .
and even if you are the enemy of the us - and i can understand why in the last six years you might have been an enemy - it still helps to know that enemy . otherwise , i can say , i 've got great publishers in europe . with bush in the white house and the war in iraq , america 's stock is down right now in europe .
as a result it seems that the balance between admiring and deriding american culture is tipping toward the negative .
what does this mean for an american writer ? the irony of the plummeting of american stock , under cheney and bush , is that europe - each time i come over here - looks more and more like america .
so there is a certain psychological necessity to finding something to hate .
in a way , bush and cheney have given the europeans a great gift - they 've made it morally defensible to dislike the country . i think expats and american writers alike have something verging on a national responsibility to remind europeans that bush didn ’ t win the first election , and he barely won the second one - it was , in its own way , stolen .
and that less than a third of the american population thinks he 's doing a good job .
that 's what i would hope to do as an american writer , to try and be an example of an ok - which is to say , self-critical - american . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franzen : " bush and cheney have made it morally defensible to dislike the us " when you say europe and america are more and more alike , what are you referring to ? i mean the shopping centers .
i got on a train in berlin yesterday , and it was like getting on a plane at the pittsburgh airport : the train station as shopping mall . it just does n't feel like bahnhof zoo .
if you look hard enough , you can still find the imbiss -lrb- snack bar -rrb- , but you have to go by the clothing stores , and the electronics stores , and the banks .
always the banks . can you tell me about the title of your new " personal history , " " the discomfort zone ? " i grew up in the middle of a battlefield in my own family , with very different personalities that were warring with each other .
and i grew up in the middle of a country that was , at the time , very divided between an older generation and a rebellious youth movement generation .
and i 've gone on to inhabit an intensely polarized country - the red-blue , conservative / less-conservative division of the country .
and as a writer i have tried to bridge an almost unbridgeable american gap between the populist and the seriously literary . and in all of these instances , i have felt sympathy for both sides .
and i think just setting yourself up as someone who has affection for both europe and america , and wants to defend one to the other , all of these are themselves recipes for discomfort . and then of course there are the many psychopathologies that i live with as well , that toss off their own discomforts . there is a chapter in " the discomfort zone " called " the foreign language .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.03.2007 " i try to be an example of an ' ok ' american " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanning different worlds leaves the author in " the discomfort zone " jonathan franzen is an american author whose 2001 book , " the corrections , " was a bestseller on both sides of the atlantic .
franzen was recently in germany promoting his autobiographical memoir , " the discomfort zone . " jonathan franzen 's new memoir groups six chapters with subjects ranging from his childhood love for " peanuts " comics , to the time he spent studying german literature as a fulbright scholar in berlin , to his current obsession with bird watching .
franzen spoke to dw-world.de shortly before he read to a sell-out crowd at the cologne opera house , as part of this week 's litcologne international literary festival .
dw-world.de : jonathan franzen , how do you explain the success of your writing in europe , considering that your subjects and themes are so essentially american ?
my impression is that europeans in general are much more generous about reading american literature than americans are about reading foreign literature .
some of that may have to do with what entertainment mavens we americans are .
some of the more abstract and philosophically preoccupied european fiction does n't translate so well back the other direction . but i think a lot of it has to do with our being , for better or worse , the one superpower .
and even if you are the enemy of the us - and i can understand why in the last six years you might have been an enemy - it still helps to know that enemy . otherwise , i can say , i 've got great publishers in europe . with bush in the white house and the war in iraq , america 's stock is down right now in europe .
as a result it seems that the balance between admiring and deriding american culture is tipping toward the negative .
what does this mean for an american writer ? the irony of the plummeting of american stock , under cheney and bush , is that europe - each time i come over here - looks more and more like america .
so there is a certain psychological necessity to finding something to hate .
in a way , bush and cheney have given the europeans a great gift - they 've made it morally defensible to dislike the country . i think expats and american writers alike have something verging on a national responsibility to remind europeans that bush didn ’ t win the first election , and he barely won the second one - it was , in its own way , stolen .
and that less than a third of the american population thinks he 's doing a good job .
that 's what i would hope to do as an american writer , to try and be an example of an ok - which is to say , self-critical - american . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franzen : " bush and cheney have made it morally defensible to dislike the us " when you say europe and america are more and more alike , what are you referring to ? i mean the shopping centers .
i got on a train in berlin yesterday , and it was like getting on a plane at the pittsburgh airport : the train station as shopping mall . it just does n't feel like bahnhof zoo .
if you look hard enough , you can still find the imbiss -lrb- snack bar -rrb- , but you have to go by the clothing stores , and the electronics stores , and the banks .
always the banks . can you tell me about the title of your new " personal history , " " the discomfort zone ? " i grew up in the middle of a battlefield in my own family , with very different personalities that were warring with each other .
and i grew up in the middle of a country that was , at the time , very divided between an older generation and a rebellious youth movement generation .
and i 've gone on to inhabit an intensely polarized country - the red-blue , conservative / less-conservative division of the country .
and as a writer i have tried to bridge an almost unbridgeable american gap between the populist and the seriously literary . and in all of these instances , i have felt sympathy for both sides .
and i think just setting yourself up as someone who has affection for both europe and america , and wants to defend one to the other , all of these are themselves recipes for discomfort . and then of course there are the many psychopathologies that i live with as well , that toss off their own discomforts . there is a chapter in " the discomfort zone " called " the foreign language . "
on the surface it appears to be about your learning german and reading german literature . but if you look closer , the chapter is really all about , well , sex , and self-discovery .
did german literature really play such a big role in your personal development ? absolutely , yes .
one of the reasons i studied german was that it was a ticket to europe , a way for my parents to approve of my coming over here by myself , without their surveillance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's annual international literature festival has been on since 2001 and my already-existing interest in being a writer was made much , much worse by my exposure to modern german literature - modern prose in particular - in that it made writing seem not only like a fun job and something i could do to get some attention and entertain people , but like a religion almost .
something that could give meaning to my life , and something that could be part of an effort to really transform myself , and to become the person i needed to be in order to escape from my parents and move on in life . so all of that was really bound up in those exciting years , of 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 .
and i feel fortunate that it was germany , just because i continue to have the highest respect for german literature . a significant theme in " the discomfort zone " is your obsession with your current hobby , bird watching . have you been bird watching during your book tour in germany ? i spent a wonderful eight hours in a field northeast of berlin .
we saw 45 different species of birds , six or seven of them new to me .
it was the real highlight of this trip !
although it 's also nice to do the public presentations and meet readers . at the end of your book , you seem to have grown more comfortable with yourself - not least thanks to the enjoyment you find in bird watching .
would you say you have reached a " comfort zone " after all ? i don ’ t actually feel as if i 'm in a much more easeful place .
even to be out in nature looking at birds , it brings me great joy but it also is really , minute by minute , full of great sadness over the terrible future in store for so many species on the planet , as we change the climate and destroy more and more habitat . so it 's maybe not as exquisite an embarrassment ; it 's turned into something more like a weird mixture of joy and great sadness .
but i would still call it discomfort . but in your book , you talk about coming into your apartment in new york and being grateful that you had at last become the person you always wanted to be … right ? actually , i talk about coming into my apartment and not recognizing the person who lives there - that it feels like i 'm in somebody else 's apartment . whoops .
guess i got that wrong . sorry to disappoint you .
no , that was yet another moment of discomfort . are you working on another novel ?
if so , is it harder to do considering the huge success of " the corrections ? "
winning the national book award is a hard act to follow . i am writing a novel - and it would be hard even if i hadn ’ t had the success with " the corrections . "
it 's always hard , but it 's not like i don ’ t have a lot of confidence now .
yet the more time that goes on , the more stuff you 've used up , so ... no , the the pressure does n't bother me so much .
it 's there , but there is always some sort of pressure like that . there 's always something to complain about as a writer .
but this is n't a very good time for me to complain - i have a lot to be grateful for . jennifer abramsohn interviewed jonathan franzen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book tips : dw-world.de 's pick of top german books in english are you a book worm ?

now , the british government is pushing for its own legally binding targets to reduce emissions even more .
is germany ready for the same ? prime minister tony blair called a draft climate change bill in the uk " revolutionary . "
if it is passed , it would impose legally binding targets to reduce co2 emissions by 60 percent by 2050 . in the past few weeks , german politicians have come up with all sorts of suggestions for trying to reduce emissions and protect the environment - everything from staying home on vacation rather than flying to faraway places to banning " stand-by " modes on electric appliances . dw-world.de spoke with stefan thomas at the wuppertal institute for climate , environment and energy . chancellor angela merkel played a major role in the eu 's agreement last week to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
yet britain has now taken it a step further and proposed a new law that would set legally binding limits on greenhouse gases .
could germany still be doing more ? bildunterschrift : stefan thomas of the wuppertal institute in their treaty , the christian democrats and social democrats in germany 's ruling coalition have set out a political target of limiting co2 emissions by 30 percent in germany without condition , and more if the eu commits itself to the same .
so it 's a similar target to the one in great britain , at least for 2020 .
also , the german parliament has adopted a long-term target of a 60-80 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions , so things are similar in both countries . for me , the question is whether it is really a step forward to have legally binding commitments on the part of the government , or if it is n't more important to look at what the governments are actually doing to reach those targets . what do you see the german government doing ? it has developed good policies on renewable energies for the production of electricity ; it has also developed policies on renewable energies for the production of heat and cooling , and more importantly , also for energy efficiency in the heating sector .
it could do more on energy efficiency regarding electricity end use . german green party parliamentary leader renate künast has said the " stand-by mode " in many appliances should be done away with .
what do you think ? things need to be done wherever possible to conserve energy .
where stand-by mode is need for certain appliances , it should be reduced to using one kilowatt per hour or less .
technology exists for that and it would also be more cost-effective .
it is expected that the european commission will present a proposal for a limit to stand-by energy consumption within the next one or two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hole in the ozone layer over the antarctic has grown over the past few years is responsibility merely being pushed onto the " little guy " ?
what about big factories which may be very inefficient ? we must all do our share .
the producers of goods must do what they can to reduce energy consumption ; there must be inroads in the construction sector to improve energy efficiency in homes and office buildings and energy-consuming industries must do everything they can to conserve energy .
they can also save a lot of money in the process .
people in the residential sector and in private households , of course , must also do something .
i see the role of the government in setting the right framework and providing incentives . you said the technology exists for improving efficiency in the stand-by mode of appliances .
why is n't that being translated into the creation of new products and appliances ? a lot has been achieved already .
stand-by consumption among televisions and vcrs is much lower than it was five or 10 years ago , but as long as there is no enforcement or performance standards , and no legal requirements to provide consumption figures in stand-by modes or even when appliances are being used , there is not enough incentive for manufacturers to optimize all their products .
maximum stand-by power requirements could be made legally binding , making stand-by modes in new products limited to one kilowatt .
also , mandatory labels should be introduced informing consumers about the television they intend to buy actually consumes in energy ; such labels already exist for refrigerators and washing machines . bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and european commission head barroso at the eu summit on the climate and energy this month along a different vein , german politicians have called for reducing speed limits on german highways to help reduce co2 emissions .
does that make sense ?
yes .
one study shows that the direct effect of imposing speed limits would be a reduction of two percent of co2 emissions in the transport sector .
but , since the german car industry is so important in germany , restricting speeds would send a signal to both sides of the market - to the buyers and the manufacturers - that there is not much use in building bigger and heavier cars with stronger motors . of course , speed limits would have the added effect of making roads safer as fewer accidents would occur . are we still thinking too small in terms of climate change and environmental protection ? it 's hard for a lot of people to know where to start .
i think we are making progress in many countries , but a lot still needs to be done .
the buildings in most european countries must be reviewed .
of course , there 's an incentive now with high energy prices to improve the energy efficiency of buildings .
education and financial incentives for builders and consumers are also essential to encourage people to take the initiative and apply alternatives that could be more energy efficient , such as insulating their homes , or replacing water heaters with condensing or solar systems . the potential is there for mitigating climate change .
energy efficiency can reduce consumption by about half by the middle of this century .
more than half of the remaining energy needs could be provided by renewable energies .
both energy efficiency improvements and renewable energies need investments initially , but they then save energy .
and so , if we balance the higher initials investments with the savings that come later , the net extra costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions are quite minimal . louisa schaefer interviewed stefan thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany skeptical about environmental speed limits german politicians scoffed at the idea that speed limits on the country 's autobahns would prevent global warming .
yet the recent european interest in climate change has the german auto industry worried about its image .

now , the british government is pushing for its own legally binding targets to reduce emissions even more .
is germany ready for the same ? prime minister tony blair called a draft climate change bill in the uk " revolutionary . "
if it is passed , it would impose legally binding targets to reduce co2 emissions by 60 percent by 2050 . in the past few weeks , german politicians have come up with all sorts of suggestions for trying to reduce emissions and protect the environment - everything from staying home on vacation rather than flying to faraway places to banning " stand-by " modes on electric appliances . dw-world.de spoke with stefan thomas at the wuppertal institute for climate , environment and energy . chancellor angela merkel played a major role in the eu 's agreement last week to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
yet britain has now taken it a step further and proposed a new law that would set legally binding limits on greenhouse gases .
could germany still be doing more ? bildunterschrift : stefan thomas of the wuppertal institute in their treaty , the christian democrats and social democrats in germany 's ruling coalition have set out a political target of limiting co2 emissions by 30 percent in germany without condition , and more if the eu commits itself to the same .
so it 's a similar target to the one in great britain , at least for 2020 .
also , the german parliament has adopted a long-term target of a 60-80 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions , so things are similar in both countries . for me , the question is whether it is really a step forward to have legally binding commitments on the part of the government , or if it is n't more important to look at what the governments are actually doing to reach those targets . what do you see the german government doing ? it has developed good policies on renewable energies for the production of electricity ; it has also developed policies on renewable energies for the production of heat and cooling , and more importantly , also for energy efficiency in the heating sector .
it could do more on energy efficiency regarding electricity end use . german green party parliamentary leader renate künast has said the " stand-by mode " in many appliances should be done away with .
what do you think ? things need to be done wherever possible to conserve energy .
where stand-by mode is need for certain appliances , it should be reduced to using one kilowatt per hour or less .
technology exists for that and it would also be more cost-effective .
it is expected that the european commission will present a proposal for a limit to stand-by energy consumption within the next one or two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hole in the ozone layer over the antarctic has grown over the past few years is responsibility merely being pushed onto the " little guy " ?
what about big factories which may be very inefficient ? we must all do our share .
the producers of goods must do what they can to reduce energy consumption ; there must be inroads in the construction sector to improve energy efficiency in homes and office buildings and energy-consuming industries must do everything they can to conserve energy .
they can also save a lot of money in the process .
people in the residential sector and in private households , of course , must also do something .
i see the role of the government in setting the right framework and providing incentives . you said the technology exists for improving efficiency in the stand-by mode of appliances .
why is n't that being translated into the creation of new products and appliances ? a lot has been achieved already .
stand-by consumption among televisions and vcrs is much lower than it was five or 10 years ago , but as long as there is no enforcement or performance standards , and no legal requirements to provide consumption figures in stand-by modes or even when appliances are being used , there is not enough incentive for manufacturers to optimize all their products .
maximum stand-by power requirements could be made legally binding , making stand-by modes in new products limited to one kilowatt .
also , mandatory labels should be introduced informing consumers about the television they intend to buy actually consumes in energy ; such labels already exist for refrigerators and washing machines . bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and european commission head barroso at the eu summit on the climate and energy this month along a different vein , german politicians have called for reducing speed limits on german highways to help reduce co2 emissions .
does that make sense ?
yes .
one study shows that the direct effect of imposing speed limits would be a reduction of two percent of co2 emissions in the transport sector .
but , since the german car industry is so important in germany , restricting speeds would send a signal to both sides of the market - to the buyers and the manufacturers - that there is not much use in building bigger and heavier cars with stronger motors . of course , speed limits would have the added effect of making roads safer as fewer accidents would occur . are we still thinking too small in terms of climate change and environmental protection ? it 's hard for a lot of people to know where to start .
i think we are making progress in many countries , but a lot still needs to be done .
the buildings in most european countries must be reviewed .
of course , there 's an incentive now with high energy prices to improve the energy efficiency of buildings .
education and financial incentives for builders and consumers are also essential to encourage people to take the initiative and apply alternatives that could be more energy efficient , such as insulating their homes , or replacing water heaters with condensing or solar systems . the potential is there for mitigating climate change .

" this is fundamental to reach peace , stability and independence of lebanon , " he said . the eu 's top diplomat said he hoped to return to damascus for another round of discussions , but implicitly linked it to syria 's taking the " proper decisions " and its willingness to cooperate on the peace process and on the stability in the region . eu changes policy direction solana 's visit marks a thawing in the relationship between the eu and syria .
official eu contacts with the country have been frozen since the murder of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri in beirut in 2005 .
that attack was widely blamed on syria , which continues to deny any involvement . solana 's visit to damascus comes after france dropped its objections to eu contacts with syria ; french president jacques chirac was a close friend of hariri . but at the damascus press conference , solana avoided a question on whether the eu would completely end the isolation imposed on syria , saying the important thing was that " we are now here , and we are talking in a frank and clear way and look towards the future in a more constructive way . " at the press conference held jointly with the eu official , syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem applauded solana 's talks with assad and other syrian officials as " fruitful and constructive " and stressed that syria supported the full implementation of resolution 1701 . afp / dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu summit closes with focus on middle east as a summit of european leaders concluded friday , chancellor angela merkel said germany would take over the eu presidency in january knowing that it had members ' support for an ambitious six-month program .

" this is fundamental to reach peace , stability and independence of lebanon , " he said . the eu 's top diplomat said he hoped to return to damascus for another round of discussions , but implicitly linked it to syria 's taking the " proper decisions " and its willingness to cooperate on the peace process and on the stability in the region . eu changes policy direction solana 's visit marks a thawing in the relationship between the eu and syria .
official eu contacts with the country have been frozen since the murder of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri in beirut in 2005 .
that attack was widely blamed on syria , which continues to deny any involvement . solana 's visit to damascus comes after france dropped its objections to eu contacts with syria ; french president jacques chirac was a close friend of hariri . but at the damascus press conference , solana avoided a question on whether the eu would completely end the isolation imposed on syria , saying the important thing was that " we are now here , and we are talking in a frank and clear way and look towards the future in a more constructive way . " at the press conference held jointly with the eu official , syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem applauded solana 's talks with assad and other syrian officials as " fruitful and constructive " and stressed that syria supported the full implementation of resolution 1701 . afp / dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu summit closes with focus on middle east as a summit of european leaders concluded friday , chancellor angela merkel said germany would take over the eu presidency in january knowing that it had members ' support for an ambitious six-month program .

" if there is not a significant intensification of climate protection , by the year 2100 the total costs caused by climate change could be nearly 3,000 billion euros , " said claudia kemfert , the institute 's environment expert . the report takes into account costs from the direct effects of climate problems including floods , droughts , forest fires and major storms as well as indirect consequences such as increased energy costs and measures to protect dikes and water protection walls . energy revolution needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current energy production methods would have to change if the temperature rises " we require nothing less than an energy revolution , " kemfert added .
" the costs of climate protection are clearly lower than the costs of climate change . " nearly all industrial sectors would be affected by the change , especially the finance industry and existing companies , she said .
the institute calculated that the average german household would face annual extra costs of about 250 euros for heat and electricity . higher temperatures would also have major effects on the landscape .
an increase of 1 degree celsius would leave 60 percent of german ski areas without snow . malaria headed to europe ? kempfert , however , said she did not expect the temperature change to stay under 2.5 degrees celsius , and that measures would need to be taken to keep the increase to below 4.5 degrees celsius and prevent higher rates of diseases that currently only affect tropical and subtropical regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising temperatures would send german skiers farther in search of snow kemfert said economic losses can be expected even if there is a reduction in greenhouse gases , which are though to play a large role in global warming .
the eu 's new goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent before 2020 " will not stop climate change , " she added . climate change can only be held in check if emissions are cut and renewable energy use is increased in the united states and expanding economies , such as china and india , otherwise it is " very probably that climate change speeds up , " kemfert said . other forecasts other german institutions have presented similar , or worse , predictions of the effects of global warming . germany 's max planck institute estimated that climate change would cost german about 27 billion euros a year by 2050 .
the kiel institute for the world economy said higher temperatures could mean a 12 percent drop in productivity , equal to a 10 billion euro drop in germany 's gross domestic product . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the potential is there for mitigating climate change " the european union has ratified an ambitious pact to reduce greenhouse gases .

" we are assuming that no german airbus employee will work as normal on friday , " union spokesperson daniel friedrich said . the union said they expected some 20,000 demonstrators to converge on the northern city of hamburg for a rally there . french accuse germans however , according to a report in the french daily , liberation , a spat has broken out between two powerful french and german unions involved in the strikes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metalworkers union ig metall is one of the most powerful unions in germany the trigger was a flyer distributed by the french union , cfe-cgc at the beginning of march .

in friday , workers in toulouse , meaulte , nantes and saint-nazaire are expected to strike . and in spain , two unions , the ccoo and the ugt , have called on 9,000 workers at seven sites to stop work for an hour in protest . airbus parent company eads has said that the financial crisis at the plane maker is " extremely serious " and that it can no longer delay making cost savings . the cuts , together with the total or partial disposal of six sites , are intended to save five billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- by 2010 and pull the company out of a crisis caused by delays to the a380 superjumbo program , seen as critical to airbus ' bid to catch up with us rival boeing . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus reports massive losses as franco-german tensions rise airbus parent company eads had more bad news for its sick aviation subsidiary when the first operating loss in its history was announced .

" without the cooperation of these countries , we will not be successful in this area , " german environment minister sigmar gabriel said . a spokesman for gabriel 's ministry said that no concrete decisions were expected from the potsdam talks , which were designed to launch " an honest dialogue " on climate issues . " international negotiations on climate control need urgent political momentum , " he said .
" this is the only way to master the challenge of the century . " gabriel added that input from the three-day meeting would go into the g8 summit hosted by germany in june and the un climate conference on the indonesian island of bali in december . positions vary greatly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel said he knew many opinions existed regarding global warming the german minister , however , did admit that finding a compromise would be difficult , as many developing countries regarded protecting the environment as a hurdle to their economic growth . " the positions of the industrial states and developing nations are still far apart from each other , " gabriel said .
" the interests of developing and emerging nations are the starting points for the debate . " ministry sources said germany , as leader of the g8 , was looking for agreements between the bloc and emerging economies that would help to provide successor agreements to the kyoto protocol . 2007 a ' decisive ' year for planet the 1997 treaty sets legally binding targets for developed countries to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases blamed for global warming by 2012 compared with 1990 levels . " the year 2007 is a decisive one for international climate control , " said gabriel , adding that the potsdam talks would seek to identify obstacles on the way to a post-kyoto deal . the minister said the talks between the emerging economies and g8 members germany , france , italy , japan , britain , canada , the us and russia would also discuss the best way to remove these obstacles . " a meeting of this kind brings together the perpetrators of two-thirds of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions and the consumers of around three-quarters of the planet 's biological capacity , " he said . no climate protection without usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steiner praised brazilian efforts to preserve rain forests in addition to climate issues , biodiversity will also be on the agenda of the meeting when the talks start in earnest on friday morning after informal discussions over dinner on thursday . head of the united nations environment program , achim steiner , said on thursday that no progress could be made to stop international climate change without the involvement of the united states .
he also added that there was " no alternative to dialogue . " gabriel , however , said he thought the us , the world 's largest emitter of carbon dioxide , would join a coalition against global warming if developing countries also took part in a trading scheme to buy and sell the right to emit greenhouse gasses . " the usa will not allow there to be an operating financial market that they are not a part of , " he said .

he was referring to the threats posed by climate change and international terrorism . call for cooperation " the list of future tasks is long , but one thing is clear - we will only be able to face them if we work together , " steinmeier said .
" the era of nation states is over , at least to the extent that none of our countries can solve these problems on its own . " he also called on the two blocs , which are home to about one-sixth of the world 's population , to help kick-start stalled world trade organization talks .

" free trade discussions although a free trade deal between the eu and asean is not officially on the agenda in nuremberg , the issue is likely to be raised . the eu executive , the european commission , expects to receive a negotiating mandate from member states for a free trade agreement with asean in the next few months . eu efforts to broker a deal were given fresh impetus when asean nations agreed at a summit in the philippines in january to create a single market of their members by 2015 . myanmar problem yet it remains unclear how the eu can achieve the delicate balancing act of establishing freer trade links while maintaining its strong stance on myanmar . steinmeier will personally express the european concerns to myanmar 's foreign minister u nyan win , diplomats said . but his message is likely to fall on deaf ears as myanmar has repeatedly refused to implement reforms demanded by its bigger asean neighbors and continues to keep pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi under house arrest . thailand meanwhile is expected to use the meeting to inform the eu how it has emerged from a military coup last september . asean comprises brunei , cambodia , indonesia , laos , malaysia , myanmar , the philippines , singapore , thailand and vietnam . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-india summit to foster economic ties the seventh eu-india economic summit will open on friday in finnish capital helsinki .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.03.2007 " i try to be an example of an ' ok ' american " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanning different worlds leaves the author in " the discomfort zone " jonathan franzen is an american author whose 2001 book , " the corrections , " was a bestseller on both sides of the atlantic .
franzen was recently in germany promoting his autobiographical memoir , " the discomfort zone . " jonathan franzen 's new memoir groups six chapters with subjects ranging from his childhood love for " peanuts " comics , to the time he spent studying german literature as a fulbright scholar in berlin , to his current obsession with bird watching .
franzen spoke to dw-world.de shortly before he read to a sell-out crowd at the cologne opera house , as part of this week 's litcologne international literary festival .
dw-world.de : jonathan franzen , how do you explain the success of your writing in europe , considering that your subjects and themes are so essentially american ?
my impression is that europeans in general are much more generous about reading american literature than americans are about reading foreign literature .
some of that may have to do with what entertainment mavens we americans are .
some of the more abstract and philosophically preoccupied european fiction does n't translate so well back the other direction . but i think a lot of it has to do with our being , for better or worse , the one superpower .
and even if you are the enemy of the us - and i can understand why in the last six years you might have been an enemy - it still helps to know that enemy . otherwise , i can say , i 've got great publishers in europe . with bush in the white house and the war in iraq , america 's stock is down right now in europe .
as a result it seems that the balance between admiring and deriding american culture is tipping toward the negative .
what does this mean for an american writer ? the irony of the plummeting of american stock , under cheney and bush , is that europe - each time i come over here - looks more and more like america .
so there is a certain psychological necessity to finding something to hate .
in a way , bush and cheney have given the europeans a great gift - they 've made it morally defensible to dislike the country . i think expats and american writers alike have something verging on a national responsibility to remind europeans that bush didn ’ t win the first election , and he barely won the second one - it was , in its own way , stolen .
and that less than a third of the american population thinks he 's doing a good job .
that 's what i would hope to do as an american writer , to try and be an example of an ok - which is to say , self-critical - american . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franzen : " bush and cheney have made it morally defensible to dislike the us " when you say europe and america are more and more alike , what are you referring to ? i mean the shopping centers .
i got on a train in berlin yesterday , and it was like getting on a plane at the pittsburgh airport : the train station as shopping mall . it just does n't feel like bahnhof zoo .
if you look hard enough , you can still find the imbiss -lrb- snack bar -rrb- , but you have to go by the clothing stores , and the electronics stores , and the banks .
always the banks . can you tell me about the title of your new " personal history , " " the discomfort zone ? " i grew up in the middle of a battlefield in my own family , with very different personalities that were warring with each other .
and i grew up in the middle of a country that was , at the time , very divided between an older generation and a rebellious youth movement generation .
and i 've gone on to inhabit an intensely polarized country - the red-blue , conservative / less-conservative division of the country .
and as a writer i have tried to bridge an almost unbridgeable american gap between the populist and the seriously literary . and in all of these instances , i have felt sympathy for both sides .
and i think just setting yourself up as someone who has affection for both europe and america , and wants to defend one to the other , all of these are themselves recipes for discomfort . and then of course there are the many psychopathologies that i live with as well , that toss off their own discomforts . there is a chapter in " the discomfort zone " called " the foreign language . "
on the surface it appears to be about your learning german and reading german literature . but if you look closer , the chapter is really all about , well , sex , and self-discovery .
did german literature really play such a big role in your personal development ? absolutely , yes .
one of the reasons i studied german was that it was a ticket to europe , a way for my parents to approve of my coming over here by myself , without their surveillance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's annual international literature festival has been on since 2001 and my already-existing interest in being a writer was made much , much worse by my exposure to modern german literature - modern prose in particular - in that it made writing seem not only like a fun job and something i could do to get some attention and entertain people , but like a religion almost .
something that could give meaning to my life , and something that could be part of an effort to really transform myself , and to become the person i needed to be in order to escape from my parents and move on in life . so all of that was really bound up in those exciting years , of 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 .
and i feel fortunate that it was germany , just because i continue to have the highest respect for german literature . a significant theme in " the discomfort zone " is your obsession with your current hobby , bird watching . have you been bird watching during your book tour in germany ? i spent a wonderful eight hours in a field northeast of berlin .
we saw 45 different species of birds , six or seven of them new to me .
it was the real highlight of this trip !
although it 's also nice to do the public presentations and meet readers . at the end of your book , you seem to have grown more comfortable with yourself - not least thanks to the enjoyment you find in bird watching .
would you say you have reached a " comfort zone " after all ? i don ’ t actually feel as if i 'm in a much more easeful place .
even to be out in nature looking at birds , it brings me great joy but it also is really , minute by minute , full of great sadness over the terrible future in store for so many species on the planet , as we change the climate and destroy more and more habitat . so it 's maybe not as exquisite an embarrassment ; it 's turned into something more like a weird mixture of joy and great sadness .
but i would still call it discomfort . but in your book , you talk about coming into your apartment in new york and being grateful that you had at last become the person you always wanted to be … right ? actually , i talk about coming into my apartment and not recognizing the person who lives there - that it feels like i 'm in somebody else 's apartment . whoops .
guess i got that wrong . sorry to disappoint you .
no , that was yet another moment of discomfort . are you working on another novel ?
if so , is it harder to do considering the huge success of " the corrections ? "
winning the national book award is a hard act to follow . i am writing a novel - and it would be hard even if i hadn ’ t had the success with " the corrections . "
it 's always hard , but it 's not like i don ’ t have a lot of confidence now .
yet the more time that goes on , the more stuff you 've used up , so ... no , the the pressure does n't bother me so much .
it 's there , but there is always some sort of pressure like that . there 's always something to complain about as a writer .
but this is n't a very good time for me to complain - i have a lot to be grateful for . jennifer abramsohn interviewed jonathan franzen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book tips : dw-world.de 's pick of top german books in english are you a book worm ?

franzen spoke to dw-world.de shortly before he read to a sell-out crowd at the cologne opera house , as part of this week 's litcologne international literary festival .
dw-world.de : jonathan franzen , how do you explain the success of your writing in europe , considering that your subjects and themes are so essentially american ?
my impression is that europeans in general are much more generous about reading american literature than americans are about reading foreign literature .
some of that may have to do with what entertainment mavens we americans are .
some of the more abstract and philosophically preoccupied european fiction does n't translate so well back the other direction . but i think a lot of it has to do with our being , for better or worse , the one superpower .
and even if you are the enemy of the us - and i can understand why in the last six years you might have been an enemy - it still helps to know that enemy . otherwise , i can say , i 've got great publishers in europe . with bush in the white house and the war in iraq , america 's stock is down right now in europe .
as a result it seems that the balance between admiring and deriding american culture is tipping toward the negative .
what does this mean for an american writer ? the irony of the plummeting of american stock , under cheney and bush , is that europe - each time i come over here - looks more and more like america .
so there is a certain psychological necessity to finding something to hate .
in a way , bush and cheney have given the europeans a great gift - they 've made it morally defensible to dislike the country . i think expats and american writers alike have something verging on a national responsibility to remind europeans that bush didn ’ t win the first election , and he barely won the second one - it was , in its own way , stolen .
and that less than a third of the american population thinks he 's doing a good job .
that 's what i would hope to do as an american writer , to try and be an example of an ok - which is to say , self-critical - american . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franzen : " bush and cheney have made it morally defensible to dislike the us " when you say europe and america are more and more alike , what are you referring to ? i mean the shopping centers .
i got on a train in berlin yesterday , and it was like getting on a plane at the pittsburgh airport : the train station as shopping mall . it just does n't feel like bahnhof zoo .
if you look hard enough , you can still find the imbiss -lrb- snack bar -rrb- , but you have to go by the clothing stores , and the electronics stores , and the banks .
always the banks . can you tell me about the title of your new " personal history , " " the discomfort zone ? " i grew up in the middle of a battlefield in my own family , with very different personalities that were warring with each other .
and i grew up in the middle of a country that was , at the time , very divided between an older generation and a rebellious youth movement generation .
and i 've gone on to inhabit an intensely polarized country - the red-blue , conservative / less-conservative division of the country .
and as a writer i have tried to bridge an almost unbridgeable american gap between the populist and the seriously literary . and in all of these instances , i have felt sympathy for both sides .
and i think just setting yourself up as someone who has affection for both europe and america , and wants to defend one to the other , all of these are themselves recipes for discomfort . and then of course there are the many psychopathologies that i live with as well , that toss off their own discomforts . there is a chapter in " the discomfort zone " called " the foreign language . "
on the surface it appears to be about your learning german and reading german literature . but if you look closer , the chapter is really all about , well , sex , and self-discovery .
did german literature really play such a big role in your personal development ? absolutely , yes .
one of the reasons i studied german was that it was a ticket to europe , a way for my parents to approve of my coming over here by myself , without their surveillance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's annual international literature festival has been on since 2001 and my already-existing interest in being a writer was made much , much worse by my exposure to modern german literature - modern prose in particular - in that it made writing seem not only like a fun job and something i could do to get some attention and entertain people , but like a religion almost .
something that could give meaning to my life , and something that could be part of an effort to really transform myself , and to become the person i needed to be in order to escape from my parents and move on in life . so all of that was really bound up in those exciting years , of 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 .
and i feel fortunate that it was germany , just because i continue to have the highest respect for german literature . a significant theme in " the discomfort zone " is your obsession with your current hobby , bird watching . have you been bird watching during your book tour in germany ? i spent a wonderful eight hours in a field northeast of berlin .
we saw 45 different species of birds , six or seven of them new to me .
it was the real highlight of this trip !
although it 's also nice to do the public presentations and meet readers . at the end of your book , you seem to have grown more comfortable with yourself - not least thanks to the enjoyment you find in bird watching .
would you say you have reached a " comfort zone " after all ? i don ’ t actually feel as if i 'm in a much more easeful place .
even to be out in nature looking at birds , it brings me great joy but it also is really , minute by minute , full of great sadness over the terrible future in store for so many species on the planet , as we change the climate and destroy more and more habitat . so it 's maybe not as exquisite an embarrassment ; it 's turned into something more like a weird mixture of joy and great sadness .
but i would still call it discomfort . but in your book , you talk about coming into your apartment in new york and being grateful that you had at last become the person you always wanted to be … right ? actually , i talk about coming into my apartment and not recognizing the person who lives there - that it feels like i 'm in somebody else 's apartment . whoops .
guess i got that wrong . sorry to disappoint you .
no , that was yet another moment of discomfort . are you working on another novel ?
if so , is it harder to do considering the huge success of " the corrections ? "
winning the national book award is a hard act to follow . i am writing a novel - and it would be hard even if i hadn ’ t had the success with " the corrections . "
it 's always hard , but it 's not like i don ’ t have a lot of confidence now .
yet the more time that goes on , the more stuff you 've used up , so ... no , the the pressure does n't bother me so much .
it 's there , but there is always some sort of pressure like that . there 's always something to complain about as a writer .

now , the british government is pushing for its own legally binding targets to reduce emissions even more .
is germany ready for the same ? prime minister tony blair called a draft climate change bill in the uk " revolutionary . "
if it is passed , it would impose legally binding targets to reduce co2 emissions by 60 percent by 2050 . in the past few weeks , german politicians have come up with all sorts of suggestions for trying to reduce emissions and protect the environment - everything from staying home on vacation rather than flying to faraway places to banning " stand-by " modes on electric appliances . dw-world.de spoke with stefan thomas at the wuppertal institute for climate , environment and energy . chancellor angela merkel played a major role in the eu 's agreement last week to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
yet britain has now taken it a step further and proposed a new law that would set legally binding limits on greenhouse gases .
could germany still be doing more ? bildunterschrift : stefan thomas of the wuppertal institute in their treaty , the christian democrats and social democrats in germany 's ruling coalition have set out a political target of limiting co2 emissions by 30 percent in germany without condition , and more if the eu commits itself to the same .
so it 's a similar target to the one in great britain , at least for 2020 .
also , the german parliament has adopted a long-term target of a 60-80 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions , so things are similar in both countries . for me , the question is whether it is really a step forward to have legally binding commitments on the part of the government , or if it is n't more important to look at what the governments are actually doing to reach those targets . what do you see the german government doing ? it has developed good policies on renewable energies for the production of electricity ; it has also developed policies on renewable energies for the production of heat and cooling , and more importantly , also for energy efficiency in the heating sector .
it could do more on energy efficiency regarding electricity end use . german green party parliamentary leader renate künast has said the " stand-by mode " in many appliances should be done away with .
what do you think ? things need to be done wherever possible to conserve energy .
where stand-by mode is need for certain appliances , it should be reduced to using one kilowatt per hour or less .
technology exists for that and it would also be more cost-effective .
it is expected that the european commission will present a proposal for a limit to stand-by energy consumption within the next one or two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hole in the ozone layer over the antarctic has grown over the past few years is responsibility merely being pushed onto the " little guy " ?
what about big factories which may be very inefficient ? we must all do our share .
the producers of goods must do what they can to reduce energy consumption ; there must be inroads in the construction sector to improve energy efficiency in homes and office buildings and energy-consuming industries must do everything they can to conserve energy .
they can also save a lot of money in the process .
people in the residential sector and in private households , of course , must also do something .
i see the role of the government in setting the right framework and providing incentives . you said the technology exists for improving efficiency in the stand-by mode of appliances .
why is n't that being translated into the creation of new products and appliances ? a lot has been achieved already .
stand-by consumption among televisions and vcrs is much lower than it was five or 10 years ago , but as long as there is no enforcement or performance standards , and no legal requirements to provide consumption figures in stand-by modes or even when appliances are being used , there is not enough incentive for manufacturers to optimize all their products .
maximum stand-by power requirements could be made legally binding , making stand-by modes in new products limited to one kilowatt .
also , mandatory labels should be introduced informing consumers about the television they intend to buy actually consumes in energy ; such labels already exist for refrigerators and washing machines . bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and european commission head barroso at the eu summit on the climate and energy this month along a different vein , german politicians have called for reducing speed limits on german highways to help reduce co2 emissions .
does that make sense ?
yes .
one study shows that the direct effect of imposing speed limits would be a reduction of two percent of co2 emissions in the transport sector .
but , since the german car industry is so important in germany , restricting speeds would send a signal to both sides of the market - to the buyers and the manufacturers - that there is not much use in building bigger and heavier cars with stronger motors . of course , speed limits would have the added effect of making roads safer as fewer accidents would occur . are we still thinking too small in terms of climate change and environmental protection ? it 's hard for a lot of people to know where to start .
i think we are making progress in many countries , but a lot still needs to be done .
the buildings in most european countries must be reviewed .
of course , there 's an incentive now with high energy prices to improve the energy efficiency of buildings .
education and financial incentives for builders and consumers are also essential to encourage people to take the initiative and apply alternatives that could be more energy efficient , such as insulating their homes , or replacing water heaters with condensing or solar systems . the potential is there for mitigating climate change .
energy efficiency can reduce consumption by about half by the middle of this century .
more than half of the remaining energy needs could be provided by renewable energies .
both energy efficiency improvements and renewable energies need investments initially , but they then save energy .
and so , if we balance the higher initials investments with the savings that come later , the net extra costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions are quite minimal . louisa schaefer interviewed stefan thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany skeptical about environmental speed limits german politicians scoffed at the idea that speed limits on the country 's autobahns would prevent global warming .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.03.2007 " the potential is there for mitigating climate change " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have debated forgoing holidays to combat global warming the european union has ratified an ambitious pact to reduce greenhouse gases .
now , the british government is pushing for its own legally binding targets to reduce emissions even more .
is germany ready for the same ? prime minister tony blair called a draft climate change bill in the uk " revolutionary . "
if it is passed , it would impose legally binding targets to reduce co2 emissions by 60 percent by 2050 . in the past few weeks , german politicians have come up with all sorts of suggestions for trying to reduce emissions and protect the environment - everything from staying home on vacation rather than flying to faraway places to banning " stand-by " modes on electric appliances . dw-world.de spoke with stefan thomas at the wuppertal institute for climate , environment and energy . chancellor angela merkel played a major role in the eu 's agreement last week to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
yet britain has now taken it a step further and proposed a new law that would set legally binding limits on greenhouse gases .
could germany still be doing more ? bildunterschrift : stefan thomas of the wuppertal institute in their treaty , the christian democrats and social democrats in germany 's ruling coalition have set out a political target of limiting co2 emissions by 30 percent in germany without condition , and more if the eu commits itself to the same .
so it 's a similar target to the one in great britain , at least for 2020 .
also , the german parliament has adopted a long-term target of a 60-80 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions , so things are similar in both countries . for me , the question is whether it is really a step forward to have legally binding commitments on the part of the government , or if it is n't more important to look at what the governments are actually doing to reach those targets . what do you see the german government doing ? it has developed good policies on renewable energies for the production of electricity ; it has also developed policies on renewable energies for the production of heat and cooling , and more importantly , also for energy efficiency in the heating sector .
it could do more on energy efficiency regarding electricity end use . german green party parliamentary leader renate künast has said the " stand-by mode " in many appliances should be done away with .
what do you think ? things need to be done wherever possible to conserve energy .
where stand-by mode is need for certain appliances , it should be reduced to using one kilowatt per hour or less .
technology exists for that and it would also be more cost-effective .
it is expected that the european commission will present a proposal for a limit to stand-by energy consumption within the next one or two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hole in the ozone layer over the antarctic has grown over the past few years is responsibility merely being pushed onto the " little guy " ?
what about big factories which may be very inefficient ? we must all do our share .
the producers of goods must do what they can to reduce energy consumption ; there must be inroads in the construction sector to improve energy efficiency in homes and office buildings and energy-consuming industries must do everything they can to conserve energy .
they can also save a lot of money in the process .
people in the residential sector and in private households , of course , must also do something .
i see the role of the government in setting the right framework and providing incentives . you said the technology exists for improving efficiency in the stand-by mode of appliances .
why is n't that being translated into the creation of new products and appliances ? a lot has been achieved already .
stand-by consumption among televisions and vcrs is much lower than it was five or 10 years ago , but as long as there is no enforcement or performance standards , and no legal requirements to provide consumption figures in stand-by modes or even when appliances are being used , there is not enough incentive for manufacturers to optimize all their products .
maximum stand-by power requirements could be made legally binding , making stand-by modes in new products limited to one kilowatt .
also , mandatory labels should be introduced informing consumers about the television they intend to buy actually consumes in energy ; such labels already exist for refrigerators and washing machines . bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and european commission head barroso at the eu summit on the climate and energy this month along a different vein , german politicians have called for reducing speed limits on german highways to help reduce co2 emissions .
does that make sense ?
yes .
one study shows that the direct effect of imposing speed limits would be a reduction of two percent of co2 emissions in the transport sector .
but , since the german car industry is so important in germany , restricting speeds would send a signal to both sides of the market - to the buyers and the manufacturers - that there is not much use in building bigger and heavier cars with stronger motors . of course , speed limits would have the added effect of making roads safer as fewer accidents would occur . are we still thinking too small in terms of climate change and environmental protection ? it 's hard for a lot of people to know where to start .
i think we are making progress in many countries , but a lot still needs to be done .
the buildings in most european countries must be reviewed .
of course , there 's an incentive now with high energy prices to improve the energy efficiency of buildings .
education and financial incentives for builders and consumers are also essential to encourage people to take the initiative and apply alternatives that could be more energy efficient , such as insulating their homes , or replacing water heaters with condensing or solar systems . the potential is there for mitigating climate change .
energy efficiency can reduce consumption by about half by the middle of this century .
more than half of the remaining energy needs could be provided by renewable energies .
both energy efficiency improvements and renewable energies need investments initially , but they then save energy .
and so , if we balance the higher initials investments with the savings that come later , the net extra costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions are quite minimal . louisa schaefer interviewed stefan thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany skeptical about environmental speed limits german politicians scoffed at the idea that speed limits on the country 's autobahns would prevent global warming .
yet the recent european interest in climate change has the german auto industry worried about its image .

he was referring to the threats posed by climate change and international terrorism . call for cooperation " the list of future tasks is long , but one thing is clear - we will only be able to face them if we work together , " steinmeier said .
" the era of nation states is over , at least to the extent that none of our countries can solve these problems on its own . " he also called on the two blocs , which are home to about one-sixth of the world 's population , to help kick-start stalled world trade organization talks . " together however we have a huge pool of resources at our disposal , " steinmeier said .
" some 500 million people live in the eu today , 560 million in the asean countries .
that is over one billion citizens . " the final nuremberg declaration , which is to be signed on the second and final day of the talks that are held every two years , was also expected to make references to human rights and democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : briefing the media : steinmeier -lrb- r . -rrb- and his indonesian counterpart , hassan wirayuda along with the us , the 27-country eu has long criticized asean member myanmar on its rights record . the gathering in the southern german city marks a milestone as the partners are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the establishment of their relations . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said ahead of the meeting that relations between the two regions were " ready to shift up a gear . " free trade discussions although a free trade deal between the eu and asean is not officially on the agenda in nuremberg , the issue is likely to be raised . the eu executive , the european commission , expects to receive a negotiating mandate from member states for a free trade agreement with asean in the next few months . eu efforts to broker a deal were given fresh impetus when asean nations agreed at a summit in the philippines in january to create a single market of their members by 2015 . myanmar problem yet it remains unclear how the eu can achieve the delicate balancing act of establishing freer trade links while maintaining its strong stance on myanmar . steinmeier will personally express the european concerns to myanmar 's foreign minister u nyan win , diplomats said . but his message is likely to fall on deaf ears as myanmar has repeatedly refused to implement reforms demanded by its bigger asean neighbors and continues to keep pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi under house arrest . thailand meanwhile is expected to use the meeting to inform the eu how it has emerged from a military coup last september . asean comprises brunei , cambodia , indonesia , laos , malaysia , myanmar , the philippines , singapore , thailand and vietnam . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-india summit to foster economic ties the seventh eu-india economic summit will open on friday in finnish capital helsinki .

" this is fundamental to reach peace , stability and independence of lebanon , " he said . the eu 's top diplomat said he hoped to return to damascus for another round of discussions , but implicitly linked it to syria 's taking the " proper decisions " and its willingness to cooperate on the peace process and on the stability in the region . eu changes policy direction solana 's visit marks a thawing in the relationship between the eu and syria .
official eu contacts with the country have been frozen since the murder of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri in beirut in 2005 .
that attack was widely blamed on syria , which continues to deny any involvement . solana 's visit to damascus comes after france dropped its objections to eu contacts with syria ; french president jacques chirac was a close friend of hariri . but at the damascus press conference , solana avoided a question on whether the eu would completely end the isolation imposed on syria , saying the important thing was that " we are now here , and we are talking in a frank and clear way and look towards the future in a more constructive way . " at the press conference held jointly with the eu official , syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem applauded solana 's talks with assad and other syrian officials as " fruitful and constructive " and stressed that syria supported the full implementation of resolution 1701 . afp / dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu summit closes with focus on middle east as a summit of european leaders concluded friday , chancellor angela merkel said germany would take over the eu presidency in january knowing that it had members ' support for an ambitious six-month program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.03.2007 " i try to be an example of an ' ok ' american " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanning different worlds leaves the author in " the discomfort zone " jonathan franzen is an american author whose 2001 book , " the corrections , " was a bestseller on both sides of the atlantic .
franzen was recently in germany promoting his autobiographical memoir , " the discomfort zone . " jonathan franzen 's new memoir groups six chapters with subjects ranging from his childhood love for " peanuts " comics , to the time he spent studying german literature as a fulbright scholar in berlin , to his current obsession with bird watching .
franzen spoke to dw-world.de shortly before he read to a sell-out crowd at the cologne opera house , as part of this week 's litcologne international literary festival .
dw-world.de : jonathan franzen , how do you explain the success of your writing in europe , considering that your subjects and themes are so essentially american ?
my impression is that europeans in general are much more generous about reading american literature than americans are about reading foreign literature .
some of that may have to do with what entertainment mavens we americans are .
some of the more abstract and philosophically preoccupied european fiction does n't translate so well back the other direction . but i think a lot of it has to do with our being , for better or worse , the one superpower .
and even if you are the enemy of the us - and i can understand why in the last six years you might have been an enemy - it still helps to know that enemy . otherwise , i can say , i 've got great publishers in europe . with bush in the white house and the war in iraq , america 's stock is down right now in europe .
as a result it seems that the balance between admiring and deriding american culture is tipping toward the negative .
what does this mean for an american writer ? the irony of the plummeting of american stock , under cheney and bush , is that europe - each time i come over here - looks more and more like america .
so there is a certain psychological necessity to finding something to hate .
in a way , bush and cheney have given the europeans a great gift - they 've made it morally defensible to dislike the country . i think expats and american writers alike have something verging on a national responsibility to remind europeans that bush didn ’ t win the first election , and he barely won the second one - it was , in its own way , stolen .
and that less than a third of the american population thinks he 's doing a good job .
that 's what i would hope to do as an american writer , to try and be an example of an ok - which is to say , self-critical - american . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franzen : " bush and cheney have made it morally defensible to dislike the us " when you say europe and america are more and more alike , what are you referring to ? i mean the shopping centers .
i got on a train in berlin yesterday , and it was like getting on a plane at the pittsburgh airport : the train station as shopping mall . it just does n't feel like bahnhof zoo .
if you look hard enough , you can still find the imbiss -lrb- snack bar -rrb- , but you have to go by the clothing stores , and the electronics stores , and the banks .
always the banks . can you tell me about the title of your new " personal history , " " the discomfort zone ? " i grew up in the middle of a battlefield in my own family , with very different personalities that were warring with each other .
and i grew up in the middle of a country that was , at the time , very divided between an older generation and a rebellious youth movement generation .
and i 've gone on to inhabit an intensely polarized country - the red-blue , conservative / less-conservative division of the country .
and as a writer i have tried to bridge an almost unbridgeable american gap between the populist and the seriously literary . and in all of these instances , i have felt sympathy for both sides .
and i think just setting yourself up as someone who has affection for both europe and america , and wants to defend one to the other , all of these are themselves recipes for discomfort . and then of course there are the many psychopathologies that i live with as well , that toss off their own discomforts . there is a chapter in " the discomfort zone " called " the foreign language . "
on the surface it appears to be about your learning german and reading german literature . but if you look closer , the chapter is really all about , well , sex , and self-discovery .
did german literature really play such a big role in your personal development ? absolutely , yes .
one of the reasons i studied german was that it was a ticket to europe , a way for my parents to approve of my coming over here by myself , without their surveillance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's annual international literature festival has been on since 2001 and my already-existing interest in being a writer was made much , much worse by my exposure to modern german literature - modern prose in particular - in that it made writing seem not only like a fun job and something i could do to get some attention and entertain people , but like a religion almost .
something that could give meaning to my life , and something that could be part of an effort to really transform myself , and to become the person i needed to be in order to escape from my parents and move on in life . so all of that was really bound up in those exciting years , of 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 .
and i feel fortunate that it was germany , just because i continue to have the highest respect for german literature . a significant theme in " the discomfort zone " is your obsession with your current hobby , bird watching . have you been bird watching during your book tour in germany ? i spent a wonderful eight hours in a field northeast of berlin .
we saw 45 different species of birds , six or seven of them new to me .
it was the real highlight of this trip !
although it 's also nice to do the public presentations and meet readers . at the end of your book , you seem to have grown more comfortable with yourself - not least thanks to the enjoyment you find in bird watching .
would you say you have reached a " comfort zone " after all ? i don ’ t actually feel as if i 'm in a much more easeful place .
even to be out in nature looking at birds , it brings me great joy but it also is really , minute by minute , full of great sadness over the terrible future in store for so many species on the planet , as we change the climate and destroy more and more habitat . so it 's maybe not as exquisite an embarrassment ; it 's turned into something more like a weird mixture of joy and great sadness .
but i would still call it discomfort . but in your book , you talk about coming into your apartment in new york and being grateful that you had at last become the person you always wanted to be … right ? actually , i talk about coming into my apartment and not recognizing the person who lives there - that it feels like i 'm in somebody else 's apartment . whoops .
guess i got that wrong . sorry to disappoint you .
no , that was yet another moment of discomfort . are you working on another novel ?
if so , is it harder to do considering the huge success of " the corrections ? "
winning the national book award is a hard act to follow . i am writing a novel - and it would be hard even if i hadn ’ t had the success with " the corrections . "
it 's always hard , but it 's not like i don ’ t have a lot of confidence now .
yet the more time that goes on , the more stuff you 've used up , so ... no , the the pressure does n't bother me so much .
it 's there , but there is always some sort of pressure like that . there 's always something to complain about as a writer .
but this is n't a very good time for me to complain - i have a lot to be grateful for . jennifer abramsohn interviewed jonathan franzen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book tips : dw-world.de 's pick of top german books in english are you a book worm ?

if you look hard enough , you can still find the imbiss -lrb- snack bar -rrb- , but you have to go by the clothing stores , and the electronics stores , and the banks .
always the banks . can you tell me about the title of your new " personal history , " " the discomfort zone ? " i grew up in the middle of a battlefield in my own family , with very different personalities that were warring with each other .
and i grew up in the middle of a country that was , at the time , very divided between an older generation and a rebellious youth movement generation .
and i 've gone on to inhabit an intensely polarized country - the red-blue , conservative / less-conservative division of the country .
and as a writer i have tried to bridge an almost unbridgeable american gap between the populist and the seriously literary . and in all of these instances , i have felt sympathy for both sides .
and i think just setting yourself up as someone who has affection for both europe and america , and wants to defend one to the other , all of these are themselves recipes for discomfort . and then of course there are the many psychopathologies that i live with as well , that toss off their own discomforts . there is a chapter in " the discomfort zone " called " the foreign language . "
on the surface it appears to be about your learning german and reading german literature . but if you look closer , the chapter is really all about , well , sex , and self-discovery .
did german literature really play such a big role in your personal development ? absolutely , yes .
one of the reasons i studied german was that it was a ticket to europe , a way for my parents to approve of my coming over here by myself , without their surveillance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's annual international literature festival has been on since 2001 and my already-existing interest in being a writer was made much , much worse by my exposure to modern german literature - modern prose in particular - in that it made writing seem not only like a fun job and something i could do to get some attention and entertain people , but like a religion almost .
something that could give meaning to my life , and something that could be part of an effort to really transform myself , and to become the person i needed to be in order to escape from my parents and move on in life . so all of that was really bound up in those exciting years , of 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 .
and i feel fortunate that it was germany , just because i continue to have the highest respect for german literature . a significant theme in " the discomfort zone " is your obsession with your current hobby , bird watching . have you been bird watching during your book tour in germany ? i spent a wonderful eight hours in a field northeast of berlin .
we saw 45 different species of birds , six or seven of them new to me .
it was the real highlight of this trip !
although it 's also nice to do the public presentations and meet readers . at the end of your book , you seem to have grown more comfortable with yourself - not least thanks to the enjoyment you find in bird watching .
would you say you have reached a " comfort zone " after all ? i don ’ t actually feel as if i 'm in a much more easeful place .
even to be out in nature looking at birds , it brings me great joy but it also is really , minute by minute , full of great sadness over the terrible future in store for so many species on the planet , as we change the climate and destroy more and more habitat . so it 's maybe not as exquisite an embarrassment ; it 's turned into something more like a weird mixture of joy and great sadness .
but i would still call it discomfort . but in your book , you talk about coming into your apartment in new york and being grateful that you had at last become the person you always wanted to be … right ? actually , i talk about coming into my apartment and not recognizing the person who lives there - that it feels like i 'm in somebody else 's apartment . whoops .
guess i got that wrong . sorry to disappoint you .
no , that was yet another moment of discomfort . are you working on another novel ?
if so , is it harder to do considering the huge success of " the corrections ? "
winning the national book award is a hard act to follow . i am writing a novel - and it would be hard even if i hadn ’ t had the success with " the corrections . "
it 's always hard , but it 's not like i don ’ t have a lot of confidence now .
yet the more time that goes on , the more stuff you 've used up , so ... no , the the pressure does n't bother me so much .
it 's there , but there is always some sort of pressure like that . there 's always something to complain about as a writer .

franzen was recently in germany promoting his autobiographical memoir , " the discomfort zone . " jonathan franzen 's new memoir groups six chapters with subjects ranging from his childhood love for " peanuts " comics , to the time he spent studying german literature as a fulbright scholar in berlin , to his current obsession with bird watching .
franzen spoke to dw-world.de shortly before he read to a sell-out crowd at the cologne opera house , as part of this week 's litcologne international literary festival .
dw-world.de : jonathan franzen , how do you explain the success of your writing in europe , considering that your subjects and themes are so essentially american ?
my impression is that europeans in general are much more generous about reading american literature than americans are about reading foreign literature .
some of that may have to do with what entertainment mavens we americans are .
some of the more abstract and philosophically preoccupied european fiction does n't translate so well back the other direction . but i think a lot of it has to do with our being , for better or worse , the one superpower .
and even if you are the enemy of the us - and i can understand why in the last six years you might have been an enemy - it still helps to know that enemy . otherwise , i can say , i 've got great publishers in europe . with bush in the white house and the war in iraq , america 's stock is down right now in europe .
as a result it seems that the balance between admiring and deriding american culture is tipping toward the negative .
what does this mean for an american writer ? the irony of the plummeting of american stock , under cheney and bush , is that europe - each time i come over here - looks more and more like america .
so there is a certain psychological necessity to finding something to hate .
in a way , bush and cheney have given the europeans a great gift - they 've made it morally defensible to dislike the country . i think expats and american writers alike have something verging on a national responsibility to remind europeans that bush didn ’ t win the first election , and he barely won the second one - it was , in its own way , stolen .
and that less than a third of the american population thinks he 's doing a good job .
that 's what i would hope to do as an american writer , to try and be an example of an ok - which is to say , self-critical - american . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franzen : " bush and cheney have made it morally defensible to dislike the us " when you say europe and america are more and more alike , what are you referring to ? i mean the shopping centers .

some of the more abstract and philosophically preoccupied european fiction does n't translate so well back the other direction . but i think a lot of it has to do with our being , for better or worse , the one superpower .
and even if you are the enemy of the us - and i can understand why in the last six years you might have been an enemy - it still helps to know that enemy . otherwise , i can say , i 've got great publishers in europe . with bush in the white house and the war in iraq , america 's stock is down right now in europe .
as a result it seems that the balance between admiring and deriding american culture is tipping toward the negative .
what does this mean for an american writer ? the irony of the plummeting of american stock , under cheney and bush , is that europe - each time i come over here - looks more and more like america .
so there is a certain psychological necessity to finding something to hate .
in a way , bush and cheney have given the europeans a great gift - they 've made it morally defensible to dislike the country . i think expats and american writers alike have something verging on a national responsibility to remind europeans that bush didn ’ t win the first election , and he barely won the second one - it was , in its own way , stolen .
and that less than a third of the american population thinks he 's doing a good job .
that 's what i would hope to do as an american writer , to try and be an example of an ok - which is to say , self-critical - american . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franzen : " bush and cheney have made it morally defensible to dislike the us " when you say europe and america are more and more alike , what are you referring to ? i mean the shopping centers .
i got on a train in berlin yesterday , and it was like getting on a plane at the pittsburgh airport : the train station as shopping mall . it just does n't feel like bahnhof zoo .
if you look hard enough , you can still find the imbiss -lrb- snack bar -rrb- , but you have to go by the clothing stores , and the electronics stores , and the banks .
always the banks . can you tell me about the title of your new " personal history , " " the discomfort zone ? " i grew up in the middle of a battlefield in my own family , with very different personalities that were warring with each other .
and i grew up in the middle of a country that was , at the time , very divided between an older generation and a rebellious youth movement generation .
and i 've gone on to inhabit an intensely polarized country - the red-blue , conservative / less-conservative division of the country .
and as a writer i have tried to bridge an almost unbridgeable american gap between the populist and the seriously literary . and in all of these instances , i have felt sympathy for both sides .
and i think just setting yourself up as someone who has affection for both europe and america , and wants to defend one to the other , all of these are themselves recipes for discomfort . and then of course there are the many psychopathologies that i live with as well , that toss off their own discomforts . there is a chapter in " the discomfort zone " called " the foreign language . "
on the surface it appears to be about your learning german and reading german literature . but if you look closer , the chapter is really all about , well , sex , and self-discovery .
did german literature really play such a big role in your personal development ? absolutely , yes .
one of the reasons i studied german was that it was a ticket to europe , a way for my parents to approve of my coming over here by myself , without their surveillance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's annual international literature festival has been on since 2001 and my already-existing interest in being a writer was made much , much worse by my exposure to modern german literature - modern prose in particular - in that it made writing seem not only like a fun job and something i could do to get some attention and entertain people , but like a religion almost .
something that could give meaning to my life , and something that could be part of an effort to really transform myself , and to become the person i needed to be in order to escape from my parents and move on in life . so all of that was really bound up in those exciting years , of 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 .
and i feel fortunate that it was germany , just because i continue to have the highest respect for german literature . a significant theme in " the discomfort zone " is your obsession with your current hobby , bird watching . have you been bird watching during your book tour in germany ? i spent a wonderful eight hours in a field northeast of berlin .
we saw 45 different species of birds , six or seven of them new to me .
it was the real highlight of this trip !
although it 's also nice to do the public presentations and meet readers . at the end of your book , you seem to have grown more comfortable with yourself - not least thanks to the enjoyment you find in bird watching .
would you say you have reached a " comfort zone " after all ? i don ’ t actually feel as if i 'm in a much more easeful place .
even to be out in nature looking at birds , it brings me great joy but it also is really , minute by minute , full of great sadness over the terrible future in store for so many species on the planet , as we change the climate and destroy more and more habitat . so it 's maybe not as exquisite an embarrassment ; it 's turned into something more like a weird mixture of joy and great sadness .
but i would still call it discomfort . but in your book , you talk about coming into your apartment in new york and being grateful that you had at last become the person you always wanted to be … right ? actually , i talk about coming into my apartment and not recognizing the person who lives there - that it feels like i 'm in somebody else 's apartment . whoops .
guess i got that wrong . sorry to disappoint you .
no , that was yet another moment of discomfort . are you working on another novel ?
if so , is it harder to do considering the huge success of " the corrections ? "
winning the national book award is a hard act to follow . i am writing a novel - and it would be hard even if i hadn ’ t had the success with " the corrections . "
it 's always hard , but it 's not like i don ’ t have a lot of confidence now .
yet the more time that goes on , the more stuff you 've used up , so ... no , the the pressure does n't bother me so much .
it 's there , but there is always some sort of pressure like that . there 's always something to complain about as a writer .
but this is n't a very good time for me to complain - i have a lot to be grateful for . jennifer abramsohn interviewed jonathan franzen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book tips : dw-world.de 's pick of top german books in english are you a book worm ?

now , the british government is pushing for its own legally binding targets to reduce emissions even more .
is germany ready for the same ? prime minister tony blair called a draft climate change bill in the uk " revolutionary . "
if it is passed , it would impose legally binding targets to reduce co2 emissions by 60 percent by 2050 . in the past few weeks , german politicians have come up with all sorts of suggestions for trying to reduce emissions and protect the environment - everything from staying home on vacation rather than flying to faraway places to banning " stand-by " modes on electric appliances . dw-world.de spoke with stefan thomas at the wuppertal institute for climate , environment and energy . chancellor angela merkel played a major role in the eu 's agreement last week to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
yet britain has now taken it a step further and proposed a new law that would set legally binding limits on greenhouse gases .
could germany still be doing more ? bildunterschrift : stefan thomas of the wuppertal institute in their treaty , the christian democrats and social democrats in germany 's ruling coalition have set out a political target of limiting co2 emissions by 30 percent in germany without condition , and more if the eu commits itself to the same .
so it 's a similar target to the one in great britain , at least for 2020 .
also , the german parliament has adopted a long-term target of a 60-80 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions , so things are similar in both countries . for me , the question is whether it is really a step forward to have legally binding commitments on the part of the government , or if it is n't more important to look at what the governments are actually doing to reach those targets . what do you see the german government doing ? it has developed good policies on renewable energies for the production of electricity ; it has also developed policies on renewable energies for the production of heat and cooling , and more importantly , also for energy efficiency in the heating sector .
it could do more on energy efficiency regarding electricity end use . german green party parliamentary leader renate künast has said the " stand-by mode " in many appliances should be done away with .
what do you think ? things need to be done wherever possible to conserve energy .
where stand-by mode is need for certain appliances , it should be reduced to using one kilowatt per hour or less .
technology exists for that and it would also be more cost-effective .
it is expected that the european commission will present a proposal for a limit to stand-by energy consumption within the next one or two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hole in the ozone layer over the antarctic has grown over the past few years is responsibility merely being pushed onto the " little guy " ?
what about big factories which may be very inefficient ? we must all do our share .
the producers of goods must do what they can to reduce energy consumption ; there must be inroads in the construction sector to improve energy efficiency in homes and office buildings and energy-consuming industries must do everything they can to conserve energy .
they can also save a lot of money in the process .
people in the residential sector and in private households , of course , must also do something .
i see the role of the government in setting the right framework and providing incentives . you said the technology exists for improving efficiency in the stand-by mode of appliances .
why is n't that being translated into the creation of new products and appliances ? a lot has been achieved already .
stand-by consumption among televisions and vcrs is much lower than it was five or 10 years ago , but as long as there is no enforcement or performance standards , and no legal requirements to provide consumption figures in stand-by modes or even when appliances are being used , there is not enough incentive for manufacturers to optimize all their products .
maximum stand-by power requirements could be made legally binding , making stand-by modes in new products limited to one kilowatt .
also , mandatory labels should be introduced informing consumers about the television they intend to buy actually consumes in energy ; such labels already exist for refrigerators and washing machines . bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and european commission head barroso at the eu summit on the climate and energy this month along a different vein , german politicians have called for reducing speed limits on german highways to help reduce co2 emissions .
does that make sense ?
yes .
one study shows that the direct effect of imposing speed limits would be a reduction of two percent of co2 emissions in the transport sector .
but , since the german car industry is so important in germany , restricting speeds would send a signal to both sides of the market - to the buyers and the manufacturers - that there is not much use in building bigger and heavier cars with stronger motors . of course , speed limits would have the added effect of making roads safer as fewer accidents would occur . are we still thinking too small in terms of climate change and environmental protection ? it 's hard for a lot of people to know where to start .
i think we are making progress in many countries , but a lot still needs to be done .
the buildings in most european countries must be reviewed .
of course , there 's an incentive now with high energy prices to improve the energy efficiency of buildings .
education and financial incentives for builders and consumers are also essential to encourage people to take the initiative and apply alternatives that could be more energy efficient , such as insulating their homes , or replacing water heaters with condensing or solar systems . the potential is there for mitigating climate change .
energy efficiency can reduce consumption by about half by the middle of this century .
more than half of the remaining energy needs could be provided by renewable energies .
both energy efficiency improvements and renewable energies need investments initially , but they then save energy .
and so , if we balance the higher initials investments with the savings that come later , the net extra costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions are quite minimal . louisa schaefer interviewed stefan thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany skeptical about environmental speed limits german politicians scoffed at the idea that speed limits on the country 's autobahns would prevent global warming .

now , the british government is pushing for its own legally binding targets to reduce emissions even more .
is germany ready for the same ? prime minister tony blair called a draft climate change bill in the uk " revolutionary . "
if it is passed , it would impose legally binding targets to reduce co2 emissions by 60 percent by 2050 . in the past few weeks , german politicians have come up with all sorts of suggestions for trying to reduce emissions and protect the environment - everything from staying home on vacation rather than flying to faraway places to banning " stand-by " modes on electric appliances . dw-world.de spoke with stefan thomas at the wuppertal institute for climate , environment and energy . chancellor angela merkel played a major role in the eu 's agreement last week to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
yet britain has now taken it a step further and proposed a new law that would set legally binding limits on greenhouse gases .
could germany still be doing more ? bildunterschrift : stefan thomas of the wuppertal institute in their treaty , the christian democrats and social democrats in germany 's ruling coalition have set out a political target of limiting co2 emissions by 30 percent in germany without condition , and more if the eu commits itself to the same .
so it 's a similar target to the one in great britain , at least for 2020 .
also , the german parliament has adopted a long-term target of a 60-80 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions , so things are similar in both countries . for me , the question is whether it is really a step forward to have legally binding commitments on the part of the government , or if it is n't more important to look at what the governments are actually doing to reach those targets . what do you see the german government doing ? it has developed good policies on renewable energies for the production of electricity ; it has also developed policies on renewable energies for the production of heat and cooling , and more importantly , also for energy efficiency in the heating sector .
it could do more on energy efficiency regarding electricity end use . german green party parliamentary leader renate künast has said the " stand-by mode " in many appliances should be done away with .
what do you think ? things need to be done wherever possible to conserve energy .
where stand-by mode is need for certain appliances , it should be reduced to using one kilowatt per hour or less .
technology exists for that and it would also be more cost-effective .
it is expected that the european commission will present a proposal for a limit to stand-by energy consumption within the next one or two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hole in the ozone layer over the antarctic has grown over the past few years is responsibility merely being pushed onto the " little guy " ?
what about big factories which may be very inefficient ? we must all do our share .
the producers of goods must do what they can to reduce energy consumption ; there must be inroads in the construction sector to improve energy efficiency in homes and office buildings and energy-consuming industries must do everything they can to conserve energy .
they can also save a lot of money in the process .
people in the residential sector and in private households , of course , must also do something .
i see the role of the government in setting the right framework and providing incentives . you said the technology exists for improving efficiency in the stand-by mode of appliances .
why is n't that being translated into the creation of new products and appliances ? a lot has been achieved already .
stand-by consumption among televisions and vcrs is much lower than it was five or 10 years ago , but as long as there is no enforcement or performance standards , and no legal requirements to provide consumption figures in stand-by modes or even when appliances are being used , there is not enough incentive for manufacturers to optimize all their products .
maximum stand-by power requirements could be made legally binding , making stand-by modes in new products limited to one kilowatt .
also , mandatory labels should be introduced informing consumers about the television they intend to buy actually consumes in energy ; such labels already exist for refrigerators and washing machines . bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and european commission head barroso at the eu summit on the climate and energy this month along a different vein , german politicians have called for reducing speed limits on german highways to help reduce co2 emissions .
does that make sense ?
yes .
one study shows that the direct effect of imposing speed limits would be a reduction of two percent of co2 emissions in the transport sector .
but , since the german car industry is so important in germany , restricting speeds would send a signal to both sides of the market - to the buyers and the manufacturers - that there is not much use in building bigger and heavier cars with stronger motors . of course , speed limits would have the added effect of making roads safer as fewer accidents would occur . are we still thinking too small in terms of climate change and environmental protection ? it 's hard for a lot of people to know where to start .
i think we are making progress in many countries , but a lot still needs to be done .
the buildings in most european countries must be reviewed .
of course , there 's an incentive now with high energy prices to improve the energy efficiency of buildings .
education and financial incentives for builders and consumers are also essential to encourage people to take the initiative and apply alternatives that could be more energy efficient , such as insulating their homes , or replacing water heaters with condensing or solar systems . the potential is there for mitigating climate change .
energy efficiency can reduce consumption by about half by the middle of this century .
more than half of the remaining energy needs could be provided by renewable energies .
both energy efficiency improvements and renewable energies need investments initially , but they then save energy .
and so , if we balance the higher initials investments with the savings that come later , the net extra costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions are quite minimal . louisa schaefer interviewed stefan thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany skeptical about environmental speed limits german politicians scoffed at the idea that speed limits on the country 's autobahns would prevent global warming .

he was referring to the threats posed by climate change and international terrorism . call for cooperation " the list of future tasks is long , but one thing is clear - we will only be able to face them if we work together , " steinmeier said .
" the era of nation states is over , at least to the extent that none of our countries can solve these problems on its own . " he also called on the two blocs , which are home to about one-sixth of the world 's population , to help kick-start stalled world trade organization talks . " together however we have a huge pool of resources at our disposal , " steinmeier said .
" some 500 million people live in the eu today , 560 million in the asean countries .

" free trade discussions although a free trade deal between the eu and asean is not officially on the agenda in nuremberg , the issue is likely to be raised . the eu executive , the european commission , expects to receive a negotiating mandate from member states for a free trade agreement with asean in the next few months . eu efforts to broker a deal were given fresh impetus when asean nations agreed at a summit in the philippines in january to create a single market of their members by 2015 . myanmar problem yet it remains unclear how the eu can achieve the delicate balancing act of establishing freer trade links while maintaining its strong stance on myanmar . steinmeier will personally express the european concerns to myanmar 's foreign minister u nyan win , diplomats said . but his message is likely to fall on deaf ears as myanmar has repeatedly refused to implement reforms demanded by its bigger asean neighbors and continues to keep pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi under house arrest . thailand meanwhile is expected to use the meeting to inform the eu how it has emerged from a military coup last september . asean comprises brunei , cambodia , indonesia , laos , malaysia , myanmar , the philippines , singapore , thailand and vietnam . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-india summit to foster economic ties the seventh eu-india economic summit will open on friday in finnish capital helsinki .

" we are assuming that no german airbus employee will work as normal on friday , " union spokesperson daniel friedrich said . the union said they expected some 20,000 demonstrators to converge on the northern city of hamburg for a rally there . french accuse germans however , according to a report in the french daily , liberation , a spat has broken out between two powerful french and german unions involved in the strikes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metalworkers union ig metall is one of the most powerful unions in germany the trigger was a flyer distributed by the french union , cfe-cgc at the beginning of march .
in the letter , the union said that even though the germans were responsible for the expensive delays for the giant airbus a380 , they were still compensated with a new production line in the hamburg plant . according to liberation , at a meeting in the french city of toulouse on wednesday , germany 's ig metall representative horst niehus accused the cfe-cgc of " populism " and " nationalism . "
the french union reportedly defended the flyer as necessary . the chairperson of ig metall , jutta blankau , did n't mince words speaking to the berlin daily tagesspiegel -lrb- friday edition -rrb- .

in friday , workers in toulouse , meaulte , nantes and saint-nazaire are expected to strike . and in spain , two unions , the ccoo and the ugt , have called on 9,000 workers at seven sites to stop work for an hour in protest . airbus parent company eads has said that the financial crisis at the plane maker is " extremely serious " and that it can no longer delay making cost savings . the cuts , together with the total or partial disposal of six sites , are intended to save five billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- by 2010 and pull the company out of a crisis caused by delays to the a380 superjumbo program , seen as critical to airbus ' bid to catch up with us rival boeing . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus reports massive losses as franco-german tensions rise airbus parent company eads had more bad news for its sick aviation subsidiary when the first operating loss in its history was announced .

the federal court of justice in karlsruhe ruled that images are a clear anti-nazi message and are not a crime . the verdict overruled a heavily criticized decision by a lower court in stuttgart which had fined mail-order retailer jürgen kamm 3,600 euros -lrb- $ 4,750 -rrb- for " selling unconstitutional symbols .

in other designs , a figure throws a swastika in a trash can . the karlsruhe court found that kamm had committed no crime in selling the items because they " clearly and unambiguously " carried an anti-nazi message . thirty-two-year-old kamm has said that he holds left-wing political views .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.03.2007 " the potential is there for mitigating climate change " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have debated forgoing holidays to combat global warming the european union has ratified an ambitious pact to reduce greenhouse gases .
now , the british government is pushing for its own legally binding targets to reduce emissions even more .
is germany ready for the same ? prime minister tony blair called a draft climate change bill in the uk " revolutionary . "
if it is passed , it would impose legally binding targets to reduce co2 emissions by 60 percent by 2050 . in the past few weeks , german politicians have come up with all sorts of suggestions for trying to reduce emissions and protect the environment - everything from staying home on vacation rather than flying to faraway places to banning " stand-by " modes on electric appliances . dw-world.de spoke with stefan thomas at the wuppertal institute for climate , environment and energy . chancellor angela merkel played a major role in the eu 's agreement last week to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
yet britain has now taken it a step further and proposed a new law that would set legally binding limits on greenhouse gases .
could germany still be doing more ? bildunterschrift : stefan thomas of the wuppertal institute in their treaty , the christian democrats and social democrats in germany 's ruling coalition have set out a political target of limiting co2 emissions by 30 percent in germany without condition , and more if the eu commits itself to the same .
so it 's a similar target to the one in great britain , at least for 2020 .
also , the german parliament has adopted a long-term target of a 60-80 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions , so things are similar in both countries . for me , the question is whether it is really a step forward to have legally binding commitments on the part of the government , or if it is n't more important to look at what the governments are actually doing to reach those targets . what do you see the german government doing ? it has developed good policies on renewable energies for the production of electricity ; it has also developed policies on renewable energies for the production of heat and cooling , and more importantly , also for energy efficiency in the heating sector .
it could do more on energy efficiency regarding electricity end use . german green party parliamentary leader renate künast has said the " stand-by mode " in many appliances should be done away with .
what do you think ? things need to be done wherever possible to conserve energy .
where stand-by mode is need for certain appliances , it should be reduced to using one kilowatt per hour or less .
technology exists for that and it would also be more cost-effective .
it is expected that the european commission will present a proposal for a limit to stand-by energy consumption within the next one or two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hole in the ozone layer over the antarctic has grown over the past few years is responsibility merely being pushed onto the " little guy " ?
what about big factories which may be very inefficient ? we must all do our share .
the producers of goods must do what they can to reduce energy consumption ; there must be inroads in the construction sector to improve energy efficiency in homes and office buildings and energy-consuming industries must do everything they can to conserve energy .
they can also save a lot of money in the process .
people in the residential sector and in private households , of course , must also do something .
i see the role of the government in setting the right framework and providing incentives . you said the technology exists for improving efficiency in the stand-by mode of appliances .
why is n't that being translated into the creation of new products and appliances ? a lot has been achieved already .
stand-by consumption among televisions and vcrs is much lower than it was five or 10 years ago , but as long as there is no enforcement or performance standards , and no legal requirements to provide consumption figures in stand-by modes or even when appliances are being used , there is not enough incentive for manufacturers to optimize all their products .
maximum stand-by power requirements could be made legally binding , making stand-by modes in new products limited to one kilowatt .
also , mandatory labels should be introduced informing consumers about the television they intend to buy actually consumes in energy ; such labels already exist for refrigerators and washing machines . bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and european commission head barroso at the eu summit on the climate and energy this month along a different vein , german politicians have called for reducing speed limits on german highways to help reduce co2 emissions .
does that make sense ?
yes .
one study shows that the direct effect of imposing speed limits would be a reduction of two percent of co2 emissions in the transport sector .
but , since the german car industry is so important in germany , restricting speeds would send a signal to both sides of the market - to the buyers and the manufacturers - that there is not much use in building bigger and heavier cars with stronger motors . of course , speed limits would have the added effect of making roads safer as fewer accidents would occur . are we still thinking too small in terms of climate change and environmental protection ? it 's hard for a lot of people to know where to start .
i think we are making progress in many countries , but a lot still needs to be done .
the buildings in most european countries must be reviewed .
of course , there 's an incentive now with high energy prices to improve the energy efficiency of buildings .
education and financial incentives for builders and consumers are also essential to encourage people to take the initiative and apply alternatives that could be more energy efficient , such as insulating their homes , or replacing water heaters with condensing or solar systems . the potential is there for mitigating climate change .
energy efficiency can reduce consumption by about half by the middle of this century .
more than half of the remaining energy needs could be provided by renewable energies .
both energy efficiency improvements and renewable energies need investments initially , but they then save energy .
and so , if we balance the higher initials investments with the savings that come later , the net extra costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions are quite minimal . louisa schaefer interviewed stefan thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany skeptical about environmental speed limits german politicians scoffed at the idea that speed limits on the country 's autobahns would prevent global warming .
yet the recent european interest in climate change has the german auto industry worried about its image .

it could do more on energy efficiency regarding electricity end use . german green party parliamentary leader renate künast has said the " stand-by mode " in many appliances should be done away with .
what do you think ? things need to be done wherever possible to conserve energy .
where stand-by mode is need for certain appliances , it should be reduced to using one kilowatt per hour or less .
technology exists for that and it would also be more cost-effective .
it is expected that the european commission will present a proposal for a limit to stand-by energy consumption within the next one or two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hole in the ozone layer over the antarctic has grown over the past few years is responsibility merely being pushed onto the " little guy " ?
what about big factories which may be very inefficient ? we must all do our share .
the producers of goods must do what they can to reduce energy consumption ; there must be inroads in the construction sector to improve energy efficiency in homes and office buildings and energy-consuming industries must do everything they can to conserve energy .
they can also save a lot of money in the process .
people in the residential sector and in private households , of course , must also do something .
i see the role of the government in setting the right framework and providing incentives . you said the technology exists for improving efficiency in the stand-by mode of appliances .
why is n't that being translated into the creation of new products and appliances ? a lot has been achieved already .
stand-by consumption among televisions and vcrs is much lower than it was five or 10 years ago , but as long as there is no enforcement or performance standards , and no legal requirements to provide consumption figures in stand-by modes or even when appliances are being used , there is not enough incentive for manufacturers to optimize all their products .
maximum stand-by power requirements could be made legally binding , making stand-by modes in new products limited to one kilowatt .
also , mandatory labels should be introduced informing consumers about the television they intend to buy actually consumes in energy ; such labels already exist for refrigerators and washing machines . bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and european commission head barroso at the eu summit on the climate and energy this month along a different vein , german politicians have called for reducing speed limits on german highways to help reduce co2 emissions .
does that make sense ?
yes .
one study shows that the direct effect of imposing speed limits would be a reduction of two percent of co2 emissions in the transport sector .
but , since the german car industry is so important in germany , restricting speeds would send a signal to both sides of the market - to the buyers and the manufacturers - that there is not much use in building bigger and heavier cars with stronger motors . of course , speed limits would have the added effect of making roads safer as fewer accidents would occur . are we still thinking too small in terms of climate change and environmental protection ? it 's hard for a lot of people to know where to start .
i think we are making progress in many countries , but a lot still needs to be done .
the buildings in most european countries must be reviewed .
of course , there 's an incentive now with high energy prices to improve the energy efficiency of buildings .
education and financial incentives for builders and consumers are also essential to encourage people to take the initiative and apply alternatives that could be more energy efficient , such as insulating their homes , or replacing water heaters with condensing or solar systems . the potential is there for mitigating climate change .
energy efficiency can reduce consumption by about half by the middle of this century .
more than half of the remaining energy needs could be provided by renewable energies .
both energy efficiency improvements and renewable energies need investments initially , but they then save energy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.03.2007 " the potential is there for mitigating climate change " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have debated forgoing holidays to combat global warming the european union has ratified an ambitious pact to reduce greenhouse gases .
now , the british government is pushing for its own legally binding targets to reduce emissions even more .
is germany ready for the same ? prime minister tony blair called a draft climate change bill in the uk " revolutionary . "
if it is passed , it would impose legally binding targets to reduce co2 emissions by 60 percent by 2050 . in the past few weeks , german politicians have come up with all sorts of suggestions for trying to reduce emissions and protect the environment - everything from staying home on vacation rather than flying to faraway places to banning " stand-by " modes on electric appliances . dw-world.de spoke with stefan thomas at the wuppertal institute for climate , environment and energy . chancellor angela merkel played a major role in the eu 's agreement last week to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
yet britain has now taken it a step further and proposed a new law that would set legally binding limits on greenhouse gases .
could germany still be doing more ? bildunterschrift : stefan thomas of the wuppertal institute in their treaty , the christian democrats and social democrats in germany 's ruling coalition have set out a political target of limiting co2 emissions by 30 percent in germany without condition , and more if the eu commits itself to the same .
so it 's a similar target to the one in great britain , at least for 2020 .
also , the german parliament has adopted a long-term target of a 60-80 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions , so things are similar in both countries . for me , the question is whether it is really a step forward to have legally binding commitments on the part of the government , or if it is n't more important to look at what the governments are actually doing to reach those targets . what do you see the german government doing ? it has developed good policies on renewable energies for the production of electricity ; it has also developed policies on renewable energies for the production of heat and cooling , and more importantly , also for energy efficiency in the heating sector .
it could do more on energy efficiency regarding electricity end use . german green party parliamentary leader renate künast has said the " stand-by mode " in many appliances should be done away with .
what do you think ? things need to be done wherever possible to conserve energy .
where stand-by mode is need for certain appliances , it should be reduced to using one kilowatt per hour or less .
technology exists for that and it would also be more cost-effective .
it is expected that the european commission will present a proposal for a limit to stand-by energy consumption within the next one or two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hole in the ozone layer over the antarctic has grown over the past few years is responsibility merely being pushed onto the " little guy " ?
what about big factories which may be very inefficient ? we must all do our share .
the producers of goods must do what they can to reduce energy consumption ; there must be inroads in the construction sector to improve energy efficiency in homes and office buildings and energy-consuming industries must do everything they can to conserve energy .
they can also save a lot of money in the process .
people in the residential sector and in private households , of course , must also do something .
i see the role of the government in setting the right framework and providing incentives . you said the technology exists for improving efficiency in the stand-by mode of appliances .
why is n't that being translated into the creation of new products and appliances ? a lot has been achieved already .
stand-by consumption among televisions and vcrs is much lower than it was five or 10 years ago , but as long as there is no enforcement or performance standards , and no legal requirements to provide consumption figures in stand-by modes or even when appliances are being used , there is not enough incentive for manufacturers to optimize all their products .
maximum stand-by power requirements could be made legally binding , making stand-by modes in new products limited to one kilowatt .
also , mandatory labels should be introduced informing consumers about the television they intend to buy actually consumes in energy ; such labels already exist for refrigerators and washing machines . bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and european commission head barroso at the eu summit on the climate and energy this month along a different vein , german politicians have called for reducing speed limits on german highways to help reduce co2 emissions .
does that make sense ?
yes .
one study shows that the direct effect of imposing speed limits would be a reduction of two percent of co2 emissions in the transport sector .
but , since the german car industry is so important in germany , restricting speeds would send a signal to both sides of the market - to the buyers and the manufacturers - that there is not much use in building bigger and heavier cars with stronger motors . of course , speed limits would have the added effect of making roads safer as fewer accidents would occur . are we still thinking too small in terms of climate change and environmental protection ? it 's hard for a lot of people to know where to start .
i think we are making progress in many countries , but a lot still needs to be done .
the buildings in most european countries must be reviewed .
of course , there 's an incentive now with high energy prices to improve the energy efficiency of buildings .
education and financial incentives for builders and consumers are also essential to encourage people to take the initiative and apply alternatives that could be more energy efficient , such as insulating their homes , or replacing water heaters with condensing or solar systems . the potential is there for mitigating climate change .
energy efficiency can reduce consumption by about half by the middle of this century .
more than half of the remaining energy needs could be provided by renewable energies .
both energy efficiency improvements and renewable energies need investments initially , but they then save energy .
and so , if we balance the higher initials investments with the savings that come later , the net extra costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions are quite minimal . louisa schaefer interviewed stefan thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany skeptical about environmental speed limits german politicians scoffed at the idea that speed limits on the country 's autobahns would prevent global warming .
yet the recent european interest in climate change has the german auto industry worried about its image .

" if there is not a significant intensification of climate protection , by the year 2100 the total costs caused by climate change could be nearly 3,000 billion euros , " said claudia kemfert , the institute 's environment expert . the report takes into account costs from the direct effects of climate problems including floods , droughts , forest fires and major storms as well as indirect consequences such as increased energy costs and measures to protect dikes and water protection walls . energy revolution needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current energy production methods would have to change if the temperature rises " we require nothing less than an energy revolution , " kemfert added .

he was referring to the threats posed by climate change and international terrorism . call for cooperation " the list of future tasks is long , but one thing is clear - we will only be able to face them if we work together , " steinmeier said .
" the era of nation states is over , at least to the extent that none of our countries can solve these problems on its own . " he also called on the two blocs , which are home to about one-sixth of the world 's population , to help kick-start stalled world trade organization talks . " together however we have a huge pool of resources at our disposal , " steinmeier said .
" some 500 million people live in the eu today , 560 million in the asean countries .
that is over one billion citizens . " the final nuremberg declaration , which is to be signed on the second and final day of the talks that are held every two years , was also expected to make references to human rights and democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : briefing the media : steinmeier -lrb- r . -rrb- and his indonesian counterpart , hassan wirayuda along with the us , the 27-country eu has long criticized asean member myanmar on its rights record . the gathering in the southern german city marks a milestone as the partners are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the establishment of their relations . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said ahead of the meeting that relations between the two regions were " ready to shift up a gear . " free trade discussions although a free trade deal between the eu and asean is not officially on the agenda in nuremberg , the issue is likely to be raised . the eu executive , the european commission , expects to receive a negotiating mandate from member states for a free trade agreement with asean in the next few months . eu efforts to broker a deal were given fresh impetus when asean nations agreed at a summit in the philippines in january to create a single market of their members by 2015 . myanmar problem yet it remains unclear how the eu can achieve the delicate balancing act of establishing freer trade links while maintaining its strong stance on myanmar . steinmeier will personally express the european concerns to myanmar 's foreign minister u nyan win , diplomats said . but his message is likely to fall on deaf ears as myanmar has repeatedly refused to implement reforms demanded by its bigger asean neighbors and continues to keep pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi under house arrest . thailand meanwhile is expected to use the meeting to inform the eu how it has emerged from a military coup last september . asean comprises brunei , cambodia , indonesia , laos , malaysia , myanmar , the philippines , singapore , thailand and vietnam . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-india summit to foster economic ties the seventh eu-india economic summit will open on friday in finnish capital helsinki .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.03.2007 " i try to be an example of an ' ok ' american " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanning different worlds leaves the author in " the discomfort zone " jonathan franzen is an american author whose 2001 book , " the corrections , " was a bestseller on both sides of the atlantic .
franzen was recently in germany promoting his autobiographical memoir , " the discomfort zone . " jonathan franzen 's new memoir groups six chapters with subjects ranging from his childhood love for " peanuts " comics , to the time he spent studying german literature as a fulbright scholar in berlin , to his current obsession with bird watching .
franzen spoke to dw-world.de shortly before he read to a sell-out crowd at the cologne opera house , as part of this week 's litcologne international literary festival .
dw-world.de : jonathan franzen , how do you explain the success of your writing in europe , considering that your subjects and themes are so essentially american ?
my impression is that europeans in general are much more generous about reading american literature than americans are about reading foreign literature .
some of that may have to do with what entertainment mavens we americans are .
some of the more abstract and philosophically preoccupied european fiction does n't translate so well back the other direction . but i think a lot of it has to do with our being , for better or worse , the one superpower .
and even if you are the enemy of the us - and i can understand why in the last six years you might have been an enemy - it still helps to know that enemy . otherwise , i can say , i 've got great publishers in europe . with bush in the white house and the war in iraq , america 's stock is down right now in europe .
as a result it seems that the balance between admiring and deriding american culture is tipping toward the negative .
what does this mean for an american writer ? the irony of the plummeting of american stock , under cheney and bush , is that europe - each time i come over here - looks more and more like america .
so there is a certain psychological necessity to finding something to hate .
in a way , bush and cheney have given the europeans a great gift - they 've made it morally defensible to dislike the country . i think expats and american writers alike have something verging on a national responsibility to remind europeans that bush didn ’ t win the first election , and he barely won the second one - it was , in its own way , stolen .
and that less than a third of the american population thinks he 's doing a good job .
that 's what i would hope to do as an american writer , to try and be an example of an ok - which is to say , self-critical - american . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franzen : " bush and cheney have made it morally defensible to dislike the us " when you say europe and america are more and more alike , what are you referring to ? i mean the shopping centers .
i got on a train in berlin yesterday , and it was like getting on a plane at the pittsburgh airport : the train station as shopping mall . it just does n't feel like bahnhof zoo .
if you look hard enough , you can still find the imbiss -lrb- snack bar -rrb- , but you have to go by the clothing stores , and the electronics stores , and the banks .
always the banks . can you tell me about the title of your new " personal history , " " the discomfort zone ? " i grew up in the middle of a battlefield in my own family , with very different personalities that were warring with each other .
and i grew up in the middle of a country that was , at the time , very divided between an older generation and a rebellious youth movement generation .
and i 've gone on to inhabit an intensely polarized country - the red-blue , conservative / less-conservative division of the country .
and as a writer i have tried to bridge an almost unbridgeable american gap between the populist and the seriously literary . and in all of these instances , i have felt sympathy for both sides .
and i think just setting yourself up as someone who has affection for both europe and america , and wants to defend one to the other , all of these are themselves recipes for discomfort . and then of course there are the many psychopathologies that i live with as well , that toss off their own discomforts . there is a chapter in " the discomfort zone " called " the foreign language . "
on the surface it appears to be about your learning german and reading german literature . but if you look closer , the chapter is really all about , well , sex , and self-discovery .
did german literature really play such a big role in your personal development ? absolutely , yes .
one of the reasons i studied german was that it was a ticket to europe , a way for my parents to approve of my coming over here by myself , without their surveillance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's annual international literature festival has been on since 2001 and my already-existing interest in being a writer was made much , much worse by my exposure to modern german literature - modern prose in particular - in that it made writing seem not only like a fun job and something i could do to get some attention and entertain people , but like a religion almost .
something that could give meaning to my life , and something that could be part of an effort to really transform myself , and to become the person i needed to be in order to escape from my parents and move on in life . so all of that was really bound up in those exciting years , of 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 .
and i feel fortunate that it was germany , just because i continue to have the highest respect for german literature . a significant theme in " the discomfort zone " is your obsession with your current hobby , bird watching . have you been bird watching during your book tour in germany ? i spent a wonderful eight hours in a field northeast of berlin .
we saw 45 different species of birds , six or seven of them new to me .
it was the real highlight of this trip !
although it 's also nice to do the public presentations and meet readers . at the end of your book , you seem to have grown more comfortable with yourself - not least thanks to the enjoyment you find in bird watching .
would you say you have reached a " comfort zone " after all ? i don ’ t actually feel as if i 'm in a much more easeful place .
even to be out in nature looking at birds , it brings me great joy but it also is really , minute by minute , full of great sadness over the terrible future in store for so many species on the planet , as we change the climate and destroy more and more habitat . so it 's maybe not as exquisite an embarrassment ; it 's turned into something more like a weird mixture of joy and great sadness .
but i would still call it discomfort . but in your book , you talk about coming into your apartment in new york and being grateful that you had at last become the person you always wanted to be … right ? actually , i talk about coming into my apartment and not recognizing the person who lives there - that it feels like i 'm in somebody else 's apartment . whoops .
guess i got that wrong . sorry to disappoint you .
no , that was yet another moment of discomfort . are you working on another novel ?
if so , is it harder to do considering the huge success of " the corrections ? "
winning the national book award is a hard act to follow . i am writing a novel - and it would be hard even if i hadn ’ t had the success with " the corrections . "
it 's always hard , but it 's not like i don ’ t have a lot of confidence now .
yet the more time that goes on , the more stuff you 've used up , so ... no , the the pressure does n't bother me so much .
it 's there , but there is always some sort of pressure like that . there 's always something to complain about as a writer .

and i think just setting yourself up as someone who has affection for both europe and america , and wants to defend one to the other , all of these are themselves recipes for discomfort . and then of course there are the many psychopathologies that i live with as well , that toss off their own discomforts . there is a chapter in " the discomfort zone " called " the foreign language . "
on the surface it appears to be about your learning german and reading german literature . but if you look closer , the chapter is really all about , well , sex , and self-discovery .
did german literature really play such a big role in your personal development ? absolutely , yes .
one of the reasons i studied german was that it was a ticket to europe , a way for my parents to approve of my coming over here by myself , without their surveillance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's annual international literature festival has been on since 2001 and my already-existing interest in being a writer was made much , much worse by my exposure to modern german literature - modern prose in particular - in that it made writing seem not only like a fun job and something i could do to get some attention and entertain people , but like a religion almost .
something that could give meaning to my life , and something that could be part of an effort to really transform myself , and to become the person i needed to be in order to escape from my parents and move on in life . so all of that was really bound up in those exciting years , of 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 .
and i feel fortunate that it was germany , just because i continue to have the highest respect for german literature . a significant theme in " the discomfort zone " is your obsession with your current hobby , bird watching . have you been bird watching during your book tour in germany ? i spent a wonderful eight hours in a field northeast of berlin .
we saw 45 different species of birds , six or seven of them new to me .
it was the real highlight of this trip !
although it 's also nice to do the public presentations and meet readers . at the end of your book , you seem to have grown more comfortable with yourself - not least thanks to the enjoyment you find in bird watching .
would you say you have reached a " comfort zone " after all ? i don ’ t actually feel as if i 'm in a much more easeful place .
even to be out in nature looking at birds , it brings me great joy but it also is really , minute by minute , full of great sadness over the terrible future in store for so many species on the planet , as we change the climate and destroy more and more habitat . so it 's maybe not as exquisite an embarrassment ; it 's turned into something more like a weird mixture of joy and great sadness .
but i would still call it discomfort . but in your book , you talk about coming into your apartment in new york and being grateful that you had at last become the person you always wanted to be … right ? actually , i talk about coming into my apartment and not recognizing the person who lives there - that it feels like i 'm in somebody else 's apartment . whoops .
guess i got that wrong . sorry to disappoint you .
no , that was yet another moment of discomfort . are you working on another novel ?
if so , is it harder to do considering the huge success of " the corrections ? "
winning the national book award is a hard act to follow . i am writing a novel - and it would be hard even if i hadn ’ t had the success with " the corrections . "
it 's always hard , but it 's not like i don ’ t have a lot of confidence now .

franzen was recently in germany promoting his autobiographical memoir , " the discomfort zone . " jonathan franzen 's new memoir groups six chapters with subjects ranging from his childhood love for " peanuts " comics , to the time he spent studying german literature as a fulbright scholar in berlin , to his current obsession with bird watching .
franzen spoke to dw-world.de shortly before he read to a sell-out crowd at the cologne opera house , as part of this week 's litcologne international literary festival .
dw-world.de : jonathan franzen , how do you explain the success of your writing in europe , considering that your subjects and themes are so essentially american ?
my impression is that europeans in general are much more generous about reading american literature than americans are about reading foreign literature .
some of that may have to do with what entertainment mavens we americans are .
some of the more abstract and philosophically preoccupied european fiction does n't translate so well back the other direction . but i think a lot of it has to do with our being , for better or worse , the one superpower .
and even if you are the enemy of the us - and i can understand why in the last six years you might have been an enemy - it still helps to know that enemy . otherwise , i can say , i 've got great publishers in europe . with bush in the white house and the war in iraq , america 's stock is down right now in europe .
as a result it seems that the balance between admiring and deriding american culture is tipping toward the negative .
what does this mean for an american writer ? the irony of the plummeting of american stock , under cheney and bush , is that europe - each time i come over here - looks more and more like america .
so there is a certain psychological necessity to finding something to hate .
in a way , bush and cheney have given the europeans a great gift - they 've made it morally defensible to dislike the country . i think expats and american writers alike have something verging on a national responsibility to remind europeans that bush didn ’ t win the first election , and he barely won the second one - it was , in its own way , stolen .
and that less than a third of the american population thinks he 's doing a good job .
that 's what i would hope to do as an american writer , to try and be an example of an ok - which is to say , self-critical - american . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franzen : " bush and cheney have made it morally defensible to dislike the us " when you say europe and america are more and more alike , what are you referring to ? i mean the shopping centers .
i got on a train in berlin yesterday , and it was like getting on a plane at the pittsburgh airport : the train station as shopping mall . it just does n't feel like bahnhof zoo .
if you look hard enough , you can still find the imbiss -lrb- snack bar -rrb- , but you have to go by the clothing stores , and the electronics stores , and the banks .
always the banks . can you tell me about the title of your new " personal history , " " the discomfort zone ? " i grew up in the middle of a battlefield in my own family , with very different personalities that were warring with each other .
and i grew up in the middle of a country that was , at the time , very divided between an older generation and a rebellious youth movement generation .
and i 've gone on to inhabit an intensely polarized country - the red-blue , conservative / less-conservative division of the country .
and as a writer i have tried to bridge an almost unbridgeable american gap between the populist and the seriously literary . and in all of these instances , i have felt sympathy for both sides .

that 's what i would hope to do as an american writer , to try and be an example of an ok - which is to say , self-critical - american . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franzen : " bush and cheney have made it morally defensible to dislike the us " when you say europe and america are more and more alike , what are you referring to ? i mean the shopping centers .
i got on a train in berlin yesterday , and it was like getting on a plane at the pittsburgh airport : the train station as shopping mall . it just does n't feel like bahnhof zoo .
if you look hard enough , you can still find the imbiss -lrb- snack bar -rrb- , but you have to go by the clothing stores , and the electronics stores , and the banks .
always the banks . can you tell me about the title of your new " personal history , " " the discomfort zone ? " i grew up in the middle of a battlefield in my own family , with very different personalities that were warring with each other .
and i grew up in the middle of a country that was , at the time , very divided between an older generation and a rebellious youth movement generation .
and i 've gone on to inhabit an intensely polarized country - the red-blue , conservative / less-conservative division of the country .
and as a writer i have tried to bridge an almost unbridgeable american gap between the populist and the seriously literary . and in all of these instances , i have felt sympathy for both sides .
and i think just setting yourself up as someone who has affection for both europe and america , and wants to defend one to the other , all of these are themselves recipes for discomfort . and then of course there are the many psychopathologies that i live with as well , that toss off their own discomforts . there is a chapter in " the discomfort zone " called " the foreign language . "
on the surface it appears to be about your learning german and reading german literature . but if you look closer , the chapter is really all about , well , sex , and self-discovery .
did german literature really play such a big role in your personal development ? absolutely , yes .
one of the reasons i studied german was that it was a ticket to europe , a way for my parents to approve of my coming over here by myself , without their surveillance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's annual international literature festival has been on since 2001 and my already-existing interest in being a writer was made much , much worse by my exposure to modern german literature - modern prose in particular - in that it made writing seem not only like a fun job and something i could do to get some attention and entertain people , but like a religion almost .
something that could give meaning to my life , and something that could be part of an effort to really transform myself , and to become the person i needed to be in order to escape from my parents and move on in life . so all of that was really bound up in those exciting years , of 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 .
and i feel fortunate that it was germany , just because i continue to have the highest respect for german literature . a significant theme in " the discomfort zone " is your obsession with your current hobby , bird watching . have you been bird watching during your book tour in germany ? i spent a wonderful eight hours in a field northeast of berlin .
we saw 45 different species of birds , six or seven of them new to me .
it was the real highlight of this trip !
although it 's also nice to do the public presentations and meet readers . at the end of your book , you seem to have grown more comfortable with yourself - not least thanks to the enjoyment you find in bird watching .
would you say you have reached a " comfort zone " after all ? i don ’ t actually feel as if i 'm in a much more easeful place .
even to be out in nature looking at birds , it brings me great joy but it also is really , minute by minute , full of great sadness over the terrible future in store for so many species on the planet , as we change the climate and destroy more and more habitat . so it 's maybe not as exquisite an embarrassment ; it 's turned into something more like a weird mixture of joy and great sadness .
but i would still call it discomfort . but in your book , you talk about coming into your apartment in new york and being grateful that you had at last become the person you always wanted to be … right ? actually , i talk about coming into my apartment and not recognizing the person who lives there - that it feels like i 'm in somebody else 's apartment . whoops .
guess i got that wrong . sorry to disappoint you .
no , that was yet another moment of discomfort . are you working on another novel ?
if so , is it harder to do considering the huge success of " the corrections ? "
winning the national book award is a hard act to follow . i am writing a novel - and it would be hard even if i hadn ’ t had the success with " the corrections . "
it 's always hard , but it 's not like i don ’ t have a lot of confidence now .
yet the more time that goes on , the more stuff you 've used up , so ... no , the the pressure does n't bother me so much .
it 's there , but there is always some sort of pressure like that . there 's always something to complain about as a writer .
but this is n't a very good time for me to complain - i have a lot to be grateful for . jennifer abramsohn interviewed jonathan franzen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book tips : dw-world.de 's pick of top german books in english are you a book worm ?

he was referring to the threats posed by climate change and international terrorism . call for cooperation " the list of future tasks is long , but one thing is clear - we will only be able to face them if we work together , " steinmeier said .
" the era of nation states is over , at least to the extent that none of our countries can solve these problems on its own . " he also called on the two blocs , which are home to about one-sixth of the world 's population , to help kick-start stalled world trade organization talks . " together however we have a huge pool of resources at our disposal , " steinmeier said .
" some 500 million people live in the eu today , 560 million in the asean countries .
that is over one billion citizens . " the final nuremberg declaration , which is to be signed on the second and final day of the talks that are held every two years , was also expected to make references to human rights and democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : briefing the media : steinmeier -lrb- r . -rrb- and his indonesian counterpart , hassan wirayuda along with the us , the 27-country eu has long criticized asean member myanmar on its rights record . the gathering in the southern german city marks a milestone as the partners are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the establishment of their relations . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said ahead of the meeting that relations between the two regions were " ready to shift up a gear . " free trade discussions although a free trade deal between the eu and asean is not officially on the agenda in nuremberg , the issue is likely to be raised . the eu executive , the european commission , expects to receive a negotiating mandate from member states for a free trade agreement with asean in the next few months . eu efforts to broker a deal were given fresh impetus when asean nations agreed at a summit in the philippines in january to create a single market of their members by 2015 . myanmar problem yet it remains unclear how the eu can achieve the delicate balancing act of establishing freer trade links while maintaining its strong stance on myanmar . steinmeier will personally express the european concerns to myanmar 's foreign minister u nyan win , diplomats said . but his message is likely to fall on deaf ears as myanmar has repeatedly refused to implement reforms demanded by its bigger asean neighbors and continues to keep pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi under house arrest . thailand meanwhile is expected to use the meeting to inform the eu how it has emerged from a military coup last september . asean comprises brunei , cambodia , indonesia , laos , malaysia , myanmar , the philippines , singapore , thailand and vietnam . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-india summit to foster economic ties the seventh eu-india economic summit will open on friday in finnish capital helsinki .

" if there is not a significant intensification of climate protection , by the year 2100 the total costs caused by climate change could be nearly 3,000 billion euros , " said claudia kemfert , the institute 's environment expert . the report takes into account costs from the direct effects of climate problems including floods , droughts , forest fires and major storms as well as indirect consequences such as increased energy costs and measures to protect dikes and water protection walls . energy revolution needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current energy production methods would have to change if the temperature rises " we require nothing less than an energy revolution , " kemfert added .
" the costs of climate protection are clearly lower than the costs of climate change . " nearly all industrial sectors would be affected by the change , especially the finance industry and existing companies , she said .
the institute calculated that the average german household would face annual extra costs of about 250 euros for heat and electricity . higher temperatures would also have major effects on the landscape .
an increase of 1 degree celsius would leave 60 percent of german ski areas without snow . malaria headed to europe ? kempfert , however , said she did not expect the temperature change to stay under 2.5 degrees celsius , and that measures would need to be taken to keep the increase to below 4.5 degrees celsius and prevent higher rates of diseases that currently only affect tropical and subtropical regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising temperatures would send german skiers farther in search of snow kemfert said economic losses can be expected even if there is a reduction in greenhouse gases , which are though to play a large role in global warming .
the eu 's new goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent before 2020 " will not stop climate change , " she added . climate change can only be held in check if emissions are cut and renewable energy use is increased in the united states and expanding economies , such as china and india , otherwise it is " very probably that climate change speeds up , " kemfert said . other forecasts other german institutions have presented similar , or worse , predictions of the effects of global warming . germany 's max planck institute estimated that climate change would cost german about 27 billion euros a year by 2050 .
the kiel institute for the world economy said higher temperatures could mean a 12 percent drop in productivity , equal to a 10 billion euro drop in germany 's gross domestic product . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the potential is there for mitigating climate change " the european union has ratified an ambitious pact to reduce greenhouse gases .

pensioners in germany are being offered the kind of senior discount that could make some turn their nose up at a half-price dinner : a rebate at the local brothel . in cologne , germany , some practitioners of the world 's oldest profession may soon be attracting the world 's oldest customers . the pascha – a 120-room behemoth of a bordello in cologne , germany – is no stranger to creative marketing . according to its web site , the establishment offers four themed rooms -lrb- " the darkroom , " " the hayloft " , " the doctor 's office " and " the car room " -rrb- , a phone-sex hotline , and in-house pizza delivery .
also new : the " first floor express - 30-minute orgasm guaranteed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pascha made headlines last summer with a racy ad during the world cup despite the fact that the pascha is " so busy it frequently crosses the 30,000-visitor-per month mark , " according to manager armin lobscheid , there was room for improvement .
in a move to boost afternoon traffic , he followed the lead of movie theaters and low-price restaurants , and instituted cut-rate admission for people over 66 years of age . now , every day between 12 and 5 pm , spunky seniors who are willing to be carded -lrb- proof of age required -rrb- can get 50 percent off services rendered . the discount for a " normal session " works out to be 25 euros -lrb- $ 33 -rrb- . " we do n't earn as much money , but we 're establishing ourselves across a broader range of age groups , " a spokesman for lobscheid told the reuters news agency . after testing the water with reductions for senior citizens once a week , the pascha decided earlier this month to make the offer a daily one .

he was referring to the threats posed by climate change and international terrorism . call for cooperation " the list of future tasks is long , but one thing is clear - we will only be able to face them if we work together , " steinmeier said .
" the era of nation states is over , at least to the extent that none of our countries can solve these problems on its own . " he also called on the two blocs , which are home to about one-sixth of the world 's population , to help kick-start stalled world trade organization talks . " together however we have a huge pool of resources at our disposal , " steinmeier said .
" some 500 million people live in the eu today , 560 million in the asean countries .
that is over one billion citizens . " the final nuremberg declaration , which is to be signed on the second and final day of the talks that are held every two years , was also expected to make references to human rights and democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : briefing the media : steinmeier -lrb- r . -rrb- and his indonesian counterpart , hassan wirayuda along with the us , the 27-country eu has long criticized asean member myanmar on its rights record . the gathering in the southern german city marks a milestone as the partners are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the establishment of their relations . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said ahead of the meeting that relations between the two regions were " ready to shift up a gear . " free trade discussions although a free trade deal between the eu and asean is not officially on the agenda in nuremberg , the issue is likely to be raised . the eu executive , the european commission , expects to receive a negotiating mandate from member states for a free trade agreement with asean in the next few months . eu efforts to broker a deal were given fresh impetus when asean nations agreed at a summit in the philippines in january to create a single market of their members by 2015 . myanmar problem yet it remains unclear how the eu can achieve the delicate balancing act of establishing freer trade links while maintaining its strong stance on myanmar . steinmeier will personally express the european concerns to myanmar 's foreign minister u nyan win , diplomats said . but his message is likely to fall on deaf ears as myanmar has repeatedly refused to implement reforms demanded by its bigger asean neighbors and continues to keep pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi under house arrest . thailand meanwhile is expected to use the meeting to inform the eu how it has emerged from a military coup last september . asean comprises brunei , cambodia , indonesia , laos , malaysia , myanmar , the philippines , singapore , thailand and vietnam . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-india summit to foster economic ties the seventh eu-india economic summit will open on friday in finnish capital helsinki .

he was referring to the threats posed by climate change and international terrorism . call for cooperation " the list of future tasks is long , but one thing is clear - we will only be able to face them if we work together , " steinmeier said .
" the era of nation states is over , at least to the extent that none of our countries can solve these problems on its own . " he also called on the two blocs , which are home to about one-sixth of the world 's population , to help kick-start stalled world trade organization talks . " together however we have a huge pool of resources at our disposal , " steinmeier said .
" some 500 million people live in the eu today , 560 million in the asean countries .
that is over one billion citizens . " the final nuremberg declaration , which is to be signed on the second and final day of the talks that are held every two years , was also expected to make references to human rights and democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : briefing the media : steinmeier -lrb- r . -rrb- and his indonesian counterpart , hassan wirayuda along with the us , the 27-country eu has long criticized asean member myanmar on its rights record . the gathering in the southern german city marks a milestone as the partners are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the establishment of their relations . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said ahead of the meeting that relations between the two regions were " ready to shift up a gear . " free trade discussions although a free trade deal between the eu and asean is not officially on the agenda in nuremberg , the issue is likely to be raised . the eu executive , the european commission , expects to receive a negotiating mandate from member states for a free trade agreement with asean in the next few months . eu efforts to broker a deal were given fresh impetus when asean nations agreed at a summit in the philippines in january to create a single market of their members by 2015 . myanmar problem yet it remains unclear how the eu can achieve the delicate balancing act of establishing freer trade links while maintaining its strong stance on myanmar . steinmeier will personally express the european concerns to myanmar 's foreign minister u nyan win , diplomats said . but his message is likely to fall on deaf ears as myanmar has repeatedly refused to implement reforms demanded by its bigger asean neighbors and continues to keep pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi under house arrest . thailand meanwhile is expected to use the meeting to inform the eu how it has emerged from a military coup last september . asean comprises brunei , cambodia , indonesia , laos , malaysia , myanmar , the philippines , singapore , thailand and vietnam . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-india summit to foster economic ties the seventh eu-india economic summit will open on friday in finnish capital helsinki .

for almost 1,000 years it has protected us from invasion , from becoming part of napoleon or hitler 's europe .
responsibility for the sea has grown piecemeal over many years in the words of the 17th century jurist , lord coventry : " the dominion of the sea , as it is an ancient and undoubted right of the crown of england , so it is the best security of the land - the wooden walls -lsb- the country 's sea fleet -rsb- are the best walls of this kingdom . "
angry seas , lashing at the rocks from the lizard to peterhead , have helped form the jagged rocks and sandy inlets that in turn provide habitats for british sealife .
turquoise inland waters and dark green oceans have provided a wealth of food - from crabs , mussels and other shellfish inland , to deep sea fish that were once the staples of a fish and chip supper .
and the seas have lifted our spirits - whether it was looking back along the majestic sweep of the gower from a clifftop walk on a sparkling summer 's day , or a walk along the prom with an ice cream and a " kiss me quick " hat in blackpool or skegness .
but in return , we have treated our seas with something more akin to contempt than respect .
we have over-exploited her fragile resources , at one time spewing raw sewage into those turquoise inland waters , and allowing a host of overlapping interests to be responsible for the planning of the sea-bed .
and now , increasingly , the sea is a battleground once again - not this time repelling invading forces , but between renewable energy companies , dredging firms , conservationists and fishermen .
' clear system ' a marine bill , to create a single regulatory authority for all aspects of inland waters , was a government manifesto commitment in 2005 , and the apparent delay in formulating legislation had been criticised by business and environmental groups alike , all of whom had been calling for years for a clear system for deciding who gets priority on the ocean floor .
responsibility for coastal waters has grown up , piecemeal , over hundreds of years .
the queen has had a prerogative right to the bounty of inland waters , and that right is now managed by the crown estate .
it is the crown estate which owns virtually the entire seabed out to the 12 nautical mile territorial limit , including the rights to explore and utilise the natural resources of the uk continental shelf -lrb- excluding oil , gas and coal -rrb- .
the cabinet now needs to show its environmental agenda extends to our seas melissa moore marine conservation society more recently the energy act 2004 vested rights to the crown estate to licence the generation of renewable energy on the continental shelf within the renewable energy zone out to 200 nautical miles - although it should be pointed out that the revenues no longer go to the queen .
" if you want to apply to build an offshore wind farm , at present the system is hugely complicated , " says sharon thompson from the royal society for the protection of birds , who have had a keen interest in the white paper because of the host of british birdlife that depends on the sea .
" not only do you have to lease land from the crown estates , you also have to get a license from the dti , and then defra have to do an environmental impact assessment .
" what this white paper is proposing looks pretty positive to us - to have one organisation responsible for planning , licensing , fisheries and enforcement . "
' marine law ' " in the same way that the climate change bill is the first legislation of its kind in the world , so the marine bill would give the uk the first co-ordinated marine law in the world . " says the environment minister , ben bradshaw .
there are calls in scotland for its own marine bill " all the historic regulatory authorities will be merged into one regulatory body , which will have powers of planning and protection .
" it will provide a simplified and strategic approach to deciding what goes where in the sea .
it will also simplify the process of getting offshore windfarms agreed . "
there appears to be some question , however , about how far out to sea this proposed bill will cover .
beyond our inshore , 12 nautical mile limit there are european laws that cover britain 's seas - for example , the common fisheries policy - and it 's unclear at present how this new marine bill might fit into it .
special protection the government is taking the opportunity of the marine bill to create eight new areas of special protection that ministers are required to protect under the eu habitats directive , as they are of european importance .
but melissa moore , senior policy officer at the marine conservation society , says the key part of the white paper is the government 's intention to also introduce highly-protected designated areas of national importance , which sometimes do not get european protection .
for example scottish sea lochs - there are lots of similar habitats in scandinavia , so they are not of european importance , but not many in britain .
there should also , she says , be a category of highly-protected marine reserves - areas of the sea where all damaging or potentially damaging activities are excluded .
at present , she says , the uk falls far behind international action on this issue with only one tiny area -lrb- at lundy island - 3.3 sq km -rrb- covering 0.002 % of our inshore waters fully protected .
but she is keen to see the government getting a move on in translating this policy white paper into legislative action .
" we are pleased that we are one step closer to a marine bill for our oft-neglected seas , " she said .
" the cabinet now needs to show its environmental agenda extends to our seas and allocate a slot for the marine bill in the next parliamentary session . "
ministers admit that this could be one of the most tricky issues .
the first thing we would want to do is get rid of the current cluttered governance of scotland 's seas richard lochhead snp marine policy is a highly devolved issue , and , with scottish fishermen expressing alarm at some of what they see as the extreme environmental parts of the proposed bill , government sources say the scottish elections in may could put paid to the bill seeing the light of the westminster day this year .
" we 're in favour of streamlining marine legislation , but would prefer to do it from edinburgh . " says richard lochhead , the snp shadow minister for environmental , rural and energy matters .
" we have nearly two-thirds of the uk 's coastline , a quarter of europe 's seas , and two-thirds of the uk fishing industry , but we find that the government in london has more say than we do . "
" we would be asking for far more devolved powers .
the first thing we would want to do is get rid of the current cluttered governance of scotland 's seas .
there are 85 pieces of legislation .
" but our marine bill would not necessarily have the same emphasis as any proposed london legislation .
we want a scottish marine bill that 's tailored to scotland 's needs .
" our fishing industry is 20 times more important to our economy than the uk 's , so that would be reflected in the bill . "
it appears everyone wants a change from the current , cluttered status quo .
but the solution could be as complex as the seas themselves .

for almost 1,000 years it has protected us from invasion , from becoming part of napoleon or hitler 's europe .
responsibility for the sea has grown piecemeal over many years in the words of the 17th century jurist , lord coventry : " the dominion of the sea , as it is an ancient and undoubted right of the crown of england , so it is the best security of the land - the wooden walls -lsb- the country 's sea fleet -rsb- are the best walls of this kingdom . "
angry seas , lashing at the rocks from the lizard to peterhead , have helped form the jagged rocks and sandy inlets that in turn provide habitats for british sealife .
turquoise inland waters and dark green oceans have provided a wealth of food - from crabs , mussels and other shellfish inland , to deep sea fish that were once the staples of a fish and chip supper .
and the seas have lifted our spirits - whether it was looking back along the majestic sweep of the gower from a clifftop walk on a sparkling summer 's day , or a walk along the prom with an ice cream and a " kiss me quick " hat in blackpool or skegness .
but in return , we have treated our seas with something more akin to contempt than respect .
we have over-exploited her fragile resources , at one time spewing raw sewage into those turquoise inland waters , and allowing a host of overlapping interests to be responsible for the planning of the sea-bed .
and now , increasingly , the sea is a battleground once again - not this time repelling invading forces , but between renewable energy companies , dredging firms , conservationists and fishermen .
' clear system ' a marine bill , to create a single regulatory authority for all aspects of inland waters , was a government manifesto commitment in 2005 , and the apparent delay in formulating legislation had been criticised by business and environmental groups alike , all of whom had been calling for years for a clear system for deciding who gets priority on the ocean floor .
responsibility for coastal waters has grown up , piecemeal , over hundreds of years .
the queen has had a prerogative right to the bounty of inland waters , and that right is now managed by the crown estate .
it is the crown estate which owns virtually the entire seabed out to the 12 nautical mile territorial limit , including the rights to explore and utilise the natural resources of the uk continental shelf -lrb- excluding oil , gas and coal -rrb- .
the cabinet now needs to show its environmental agenda extends to our seas melissa moore marine conservation society more recently the energy act 2004 vested rights to the crown estate to licence the generation of renewable energy on the continental shelf within the renewable energy zone out to 200 nautical miles - although it should be pointed out that the revenues no longer go to the queen .
" if you want to apply to build an offshore wind farm , at present the system is hugely complicated , " says sharon thompson from the royal society for the protection of birds , who have had a keen interest in the white paper because of the host of british birdlife that depends on the sea .
" not only do you have to lease land from the crown estates , you also have to get a license from the dti , and then defra have to do an environmental impact assessment .
" what this white paper is proposing looks pretty positive to us - to have one organisation responsible for planning , licensing , fisheries and enforcement . "
' marine law ' " in the same way that the climate change bill is the first legislation of its kind in the world , so the marine bill would give the uk the first co-ordinated marine law in the world . " says the environment minister , ben bradshaw .
there are calls in scotland for its own marine bill " all the historic regulatory authorities will be merged into one regulatory body , which will have powers of planning and protection .
" it will provide a simplified and strategic approach to deciding what goes where in the sea .
it will also simplify the process of getting offshore windfarms agreed . "
there appears to be some question , however , about how far out to sea this proposed bill will cover .
beyond our inshore , 12 nautical mile limit there are european laws that cover britain 's seas - for example , the common fisheries policy - and it 's unclear at present how this new marine bill might fit into it .

"
angry seas , lashing at the rocks from the lizard to peterhead , have helped form the jagged rocks and sandy inlets that in turn provide habitats for british sealife .
turquoise inland waters and dark green oceans have provided a wealth of food - from crabs , mussels and other shellfish inland , to deep sea fish that were once the staples of a fish and chip supper .
and the seas have lifted our spirits - whether it was looking back along the majestic sweep of the gower from a clifftop walk on a sparkling summer 's day , or a walk along the prom with an ice cream and a " kiss me quick " hat in blackpool or skegness .
but in return , we have treated our seas with something more akin to contempt than respect .
we have over-exploited her fragile resources , at one time spewing raw sewage into those turquoise inland waters , and allowing a host of overlapping interests to be responsible for the planning of the sea-bed .
and now , increasingly , the sea is a battleground once again - not this time repelling invading forces , but between renewable energy companies , dredging firms , conservationists and fishermen .

the work and pensions select committee welcomed the decision to scrap the csa , but warned of a return of the problems it was set up to solve 14 years ago .
encouraging parents to make voluntary contributions was nothing more than " an impossible dream , " the committee said .
the department for work and pensions said those needing help would be backed up by a tough body with more powers .
a spokesman for the dwp said while parents would be encouraged to make their own arrangements , anyone needing help would have this support .
ministers want to abolish the csa because they say it has failed hundreds of thousands of families .
but the committee 's report warned that the proposed child maintenance and enforcement commission -lrb- c-mec -rrb- may not be able to deliver the help single parents need to get fair maintenance from absent partners .
' get things right ' committee chairman terry rooney said : " thousands of non-resident parents , parents with care and - most importantly - children , have suffered over the last 14 years because of the failure of the csa .
it is right to wind it up .
" but we must get things right this time .
for too long , some non-resident parents have been able to get away without paying maintenance for their children .
" we hope that the move towards private agreements and the focus on enforcement will prove to be effective , but the government has yet to show how it will make this system work . "
he said resources should be made available to create a " state of the art advice service " .
' lacking detail ' in its report child support reform , the committee also expressed concern over plans in the government white paper to transfer existing csa cases to the c-mec .
conservative family welfare spokeswoman maria miller said the report underlined " a worrying lack of detail in the government 's thinking " .
this new system of child support should be properly scrutinised so that previous mistakes are not repeated , she said .
and david laws , the liberal democrat work and pension spokesman , said : " urgent action is needed now to create a single coherent system . "
john baker from the campaign group families need fathers warned c-mec could make the same basic mistake as the csa .
he told bbc radio five live : " the premise is that when parents separate there is one parent who has all the care and all the sacrifice and of course all the joy .
the other parent is excluded or marginalised but has financial responsibilities .
" and i think it 's this polarisation of the two parents is the strategic , fundamental error that was wrong with the csa and i 'm afraid that c-mec is at risk of going down the same path . "

the work and pensions select committee welcomed the decision to scrap the csa , but warned of a return of the problems it was set up to solve 14 years ago .
encouraging parents to make voluntary contributions was nothing more than " an impossible dream , " the committee said .
the department for work and pensions said those needing help would be backed up by a tough body with more powers .
a spokesman for the dwp said while parents would be encouraged to make their own arrangements , anyone needing help would have this support .
ministers want to abolish the csa because they say it has failed hundreds of thousands of families .
but the committee 's report warned that the proposed child maintenance and enforcement commission -lrb- c-mec -rrb- may not be able to deliver the help single parents need to get fair maintenance from absent partners .
' get things right ' committee chairman terry rooney said : " thousands of non-resident parents , parents with care and - most importantly - children , have suffered over the last 14 years because of the failure of the csa .
it is right to wind it up .
" but we must get things right this time .
for too long , some non-resident parents have been able to get away without paying maintenance for their children .
" we hope that the move towards private agreements and the focus on enforcement will prove to be effective , but the government has yet to show how it will make this system work . "
he said resources should be made available to create a " state of the art advice service " .
' lacking detail ' in its report child support reform , the committee also expressed concern over plans in the government white paper to transfer existing csa cases to the c-mec .
conservative family welfare spokeswoman maria miller said the report underlined " a worrying lack of detail in the government 's thinking " .
this new system of child support should be properly scrutinised so that previous mistakes are not repeated , she said .
and david laws , the liberal democrat work and pension spokesman , said : " urgent action is needed now to create a single coherent system . "
john baker from the campaign group families need fathers warned c-mec could make the same basic mistake as the csa .
he told bbc radio five live : " the premise is that when parents separate there is one parent who has all the care and all the sacrifice and of course all the joy .
the other parent is excluded or marginalised but has financial responsibilities .

but the committee 's report warned that the proposed child maintenance and enforcement commission -lrb- c-mec -rrb- may not be able to deliver the help single parents need to get fair maintenance from absent partners .
' get things right ' committee chairman terry rooney said : " thousands of non-resident parents , parents with care and - most importantly - children , have suffered over the last 14 years because of the failure of the csa .
it is right to wind it up .
" but we must get things right this time .
for too long , some non-resident parents have been able to get away without paying maintenance for their children .
" we hope that the move towards private agreements and the focus on enforcement will prove to be effective , but the government has yet to show how it will make this system work . "
he said resources should be made available to create a " state of the art advice service " .
' lacking detail ' in its report child support reform , the committee also expressed concern over plans in the government white paper to transfer existing csa cases to the c-mec .
conservative family welfare spokeswoman maria miller said the report underlined " a worrying lack of detail in the government 's thinking " .
this new system of child support should be properly scrutinised so that previous mistakes are not repeated , she said .
and david laws , the liberal democrat work and pension spokesman , said : " urgent action is needed now to create a single coherent system . "
john baker from the campaign group families need fathers warned c-mec could make the same basic mistake as the csa .
he told bbc radio five live : " the premise is that when parents separate there is one parent who has all the care and all the sacrifice and of course all the joy .
the other parent is excluded or marginalised but has financial responsibilities .
" and i think it 's this polarisation of the two parents is the strategic , fundamental error that was wrong with the csa and i 'm afraid that c-mec is at risk of going down the same path . "

he is , by his own admission , " flash , combative and arrogant " , dines at the ivy , prefers nightclubs to pubs and enjoys the limelight .
the iranian-born officer is just emerging from a media storm whipped up by the serialisation in a newspaper of his controversial autobiography , not one of us .
in it , the chief superintendent lays into a handful of metropolitan police officers who he believes were hell-bent on destroying his reputation and career .
the book centres on the two-year , multi-million-pound corruption investigation , operation helios , launched against him in 1999 .
mr dizaei was publicly accused of being involved in drugs , having contact with prostitutes , spying for iran and corruption . "
i do n't regret writing the book ...
i needed to tell my version of events " ali dizaei he says the allegations , including some such as accepting a free calendar , proved to be completely and ridiculously unfounded .
he has accepted in some areas his conduct fell " far below the standards expected of a police officer " - such as when he threatened to ruin the reputation of a former girlfriend and her family .
he also made a false report about damage to his bmw car in september 2000 - for which he eventually stood trial .
mr dizaei , 44 , said he lied about where he had left the car because he did not want his boss to know he had attended a black police association -lrb- bpa -rrb- meeting .
he was cleared with perverting the course of justice and misconduct in public office at the old bailey in 2003 .
" the book was my opportunity to say i 'm not ' the cocaine-snorting petty criminal spying for iran ' they portrayed me to be , " says mr dizaei .
the bbc news website has learned his publishers are in talks with eight film companies interested in buying the rights to the book .
" most are looking to do a docu-drama , " said rebecca grey , from mr dizaei 's publisher 's serpent 's tail .
cowboy boots the foreboding whistle from the good , the bad and the ugly suddenly peels out and interrupts our conversation .
" sorry , " says mr dizaei , as he answers his mobile phone .
the theme song from the clint eastwood spaghetti western classic is a reminder of his penchant for the flamboyant .
but gone are the sunglasses , designer belt or cowboy boots , he was wont to wear with his uniform - which once riled his more conservative colleagues . "
i 'm very happy in my job .
i wo n't internalise this bitterness and let it affect my job " ali dizaei proudly wearing his metropolitan police uniform , mr dizaei speaks of his passion for the job and his determination to continue his fight for a more diverse police force .
he says he was disappointed by his failure to win promotion to the rank of commander last week and accepts the book may have been a factor .
" i ca n't rule out bad timing , " he says .
" but i 'm waiting for my formal feedback to understand the decision .
" my performance as an individual leading a borough was assessed by my supervisor as exceptional for two successive years . "
hounslow in west london , where he is borough commander , has seen crime fall by 6.1 % and detection rates rise to 21.6 % in the last year , meeting the met 's annual targets .
" i do n't regret writing the book , " he says .
" one 's beliefs and values should occasionally supersede one 's career aspirations .
i needed to tell my version of events . "
' not bitter ' while mr dizaei says the feedback for the book has been on the whole positive , with many emails lauding his courage , it is by no means unanimous .
an asian detective sergeant based at scotland yard told the bbc news website : " internally , in the -lsb- met -rsb- , ali dizaei is perceived to be very unprofessional and only out to make money . "
mr dizaei says he intends to use the proceeds from the book to set up a university scholarship programme for deprived young people with the black police association -lrb- bpa -rrb- .
he will also be keeping some of the earnings in reserve to pay for his own costs and possible future libel action in relation to media reports of his case .
apart from bringing closure to a difficult chapter of his life , mr dizaei , who also acts as a legal advisor for the bpa , hopes the book will " invigorate " the met 's diversity programme .
" the force has made huge inroads but it still does n't reflect the society we serve , " he says .
" diversity is not a beauty contest , it 's an operational imperative .
in a few years half of london will look like me or close enough . "
in not one of us , mr dizaei writes of his desire to see all those who put him through his ordeal held to account .
" not every one has paid , " he says .
" many of them have been promoted .
but i 'm not bitter and twisted .
" i 'm very happy in my job .
i wo n't internalise this bitterness and let it affect my job .
if i did , it would be a victory for my enemies . "

he is , by his own admission , " flash , combative and arrogant " , dines at the ivy , prefers nightclubs to pubs and enjoys the limelight .
the iranian-born officer is just emerging from a media storm whipped up by the serialisation in a newspaper of his controversial autobiography , not one of us .
in it , the chief superintendent lays into a handful of metropolitan police officers who he believes were hell-bent on destroying his reputation and career .
the book centres on the two-year , multi-million-pound corruption investigation , operation helios , launched against him in 1999 .
mr dizaei was publicly accused of being involved in drugs , having contact with prostitutes , spying for iran and corruption .
i do n't regret writing the book ...
i needed to tell my version of events ali dizaei he says the allegations , including some such as accepting a free calendar , proved to be completely and ridiculously unfounded .
he has accepted in some areas his conduct fell " far below the standards expected of a police officer " - such as when he threatened to ruin the reputation of a former girlfriend and her family .
he also made a false report about damage to his bmw car in september 2000 - for which he eventually stood trial .
mr dizaei , 44 , said he lied about where he had left the car because he did not want his boss to know he had attended a black police association -lrb- bpa -rrb- meeting .
he was cleared with perverting the course of justice and misconduct in public office at the old bailey in 2003 .
" the book was my opportunity to say i 'm not ' the cocaine-snorting petty criminal spying for iran ' they portrayed me to be , " says mr dizaei .
the bbc news website has learned his publishers are in talks with eight film companies interested in buying the rights to the book .
" most are looking to do a docu-drama , " said rebecca grey , from mr dizaei 's publisher 's serpent 's tail .
cowboy boots the foreboding whistle from the good , the bad and the ugly suddenly peels out and interrupts our conversation .
" sorry , " says mr dizaei , as he answers his mobile phone .
the theme song from the clint eastwood spaghetti western classic is a reminder of his penchant for the flamboyant .
but gone are the sunglasses , designer belt or cowboy boots , he was wont to wear with his uniform - which once riled his more conservative colleagues .
i 'm very happy in my job .
i wo n't internalise this bitterness and let it affect my job ali dizaei proudly wearing his metropolitan police uniform , mr dizaei speaks of his passion for the job and his determination to continue his fight for a more diverse police force .
he says he was disappointed by his failure to win promotion to the rank of commander last week and accepts the book may have been a factor .
" i ca n't rule out bad timing , " he says .
" but i 'm waiting for my formal feedback to understand the decision .
" my performance as an individual leading a borough was assessed by my supervisor as exceptional for two successive years . "
hounslow in west london , where he is borough commander , has seen crime fall by 6.1 % and detection rates rise to 21.6 % in the last year , meeting the met 's annual targets .
" i do n't regret writing the book , " he says .
" one 's beliefs and values should occasionally supersede one 's career aspirations .
i needed to tell my version of events . "
' not bitter ' while mr dizaei says the feedback for the book has been on the whole positive , with many emails lauding his courage , it is by no means unanimous .
an asian detective sergeant based at scotland yard told the bbc news website : " internally , in the -lsb- met -rsb- , ali dizaei is perceived to be very unprofessional and only out to make money . "
mr dizaei says he intends to use the proceeds from the book to set up a university scholarship programme for deprived young people with the black police association -lrb- bpa -rrb- .
he will also be keeping some of the earnings in reserve to pay for his own costs and possible future libel action in relation to media reports of his case .
apart from bringing closure to a difficult chapter of his life , mr dizaei , who also acts as a legal advisor for the bpa , hopes the book will " invigorate " the met 's diversity programme .
" the force has made huge inroads but it still does n't reflect the society we serve , " he says .
" diversity is not a beauty contest , it 's an operational imperative .
in a few years half of london will look like me or close enough . "
in not one of us , mr dizaei writes of his desire to see all those who put him through his ordeal held to account .
" not every one has paid , " he says .
" many of them have been promoted .
but i 'm not bitter and twisted .
" i 'm very happy in my job .
i wo n't internalise this bitterness and let it affect my job .
if i did , it would be a victory for my enemies . "

" i do n't regret writing the book , " he says .
" one 's beliefs and values should occasionally supersede one 's career aspirations .
i needed to tell my version of events . "
' not bitter ' while mr dizaei says the feedback for the book has been on the whole positive , with many emails lauding his courage , it is by no means unanimous .
an asian detective sergeant based at scotland yard told the bbc news website : " internally , in the -lsb- met -rsb- , ali dizaei is perceived to be very unprofessional and only out to make money . "
mr dizaei says he intends to use the proceeds from the book to set up a university scholarship programme for deprived young people with the black police association -lrb- bpa -rrb- .
he will also be keeping some of the earnings in reserve to pay for his own costs and possible future libel action in relation to media reports of his case .
apart from bringing closure to a difficult chapter of his life , mr dizaei , who also acts as a legal advisor for the bpa , hopes the book will " invigorate " the met 's diversity programme .
" the force has made huge inroads but it still does n't reflect the society we serve , " he says .
" diversity is not a beauty contest , it 's an operational imperative .
in a few years half of london will look like me or close enough . "
in not one of us , mr dizaei writes of his desire to see all those who put him through his ordeal held to account .

he is , by his own admission , " flash , combative and arrogant " , dines at the ivy , prefers nightclubs to pubs and enjoys the limelight .
the iranian-born officer is just emerging from a media storm whipped up by the serialisation in a newspaper of his controversial autobiography , not one of us .
in it , the chief superintendent lays into a handful of metropolitan police officers who he believes were hell-bent on destroying his reputation and career .
the book centres on the two-year , multi-million-pound corruption investigation , operation helios , launched against him in 1999 .
mr dizaei was publicly accused of being involved in drugs , having contact with prostitutes , spying for iran and corruption .
i do n't regret writing the book ...
i needed to tell my version of events ali dizaei he says the allegations , including some such as accepting a free calendar , proved to be completely and ridiculously unfounded .
he has accepted in some areas his conduct fell " far below the standards expected of a police officer " - such as when he threatened to ruin the reputation of a former girlfriend and her family .
he also made a false report about damage to his bmw car in september 2000 - for which he eventually stood trial .
mr dizaei , 44 , said he lied about where he had left the car because he did not want his boss to know he had attended a black police association -lrb- bpa -rrb- meeting .
he was cleared with perverting the course of justice and misconduct in public office at the old bailey in 2003 .
" the book was my opportunity to say i 'm not ' the cocaine-snorting petty criminal spying for iran ' they portrayed me to be , " says mr dizaei .
the bbc news website has learned his publishers are in talks with eight film companies interested in buying the rights to the book .

cowboy boots the foreboding whistle from the good , the bad and the ugly suddenly peels out and interrupts our conversation .

the theme song from the clint eastwood spaghetti western classic is a reminder of his penchant for the flamboyant .

he is , by his own admission , " flash , combative and arrogant " , dines at the ivy , prefers nightclubs to pubs and enjoys the limelight .
the iranian-born officer is just emerging from a media storm whipped up by the serialisation in a newspaper of his controversial autobiography , not one of us .
in it , the chief superintendent lays into a handful of metropolitan police officers who he believes were hell-bent on destroying his reputation and career .
the book centres on the two-year , multi-million-pound corruption investigation , operation helios , launched against him in 1999 .
mr dizaei was publicly accused of being involved in drugs , having contact with prostitutes , spying for iran and corruption .
i do n't regret writing the book ...
i needed to tell my version of events ali dizaei he says the allegations , including some such as accepting a free calendar , proved to be completely and ridiculously unfounded .
he has accepted in some areas his conduct fell " far below the standards expected of a police officer " - such as when he threatened to ruin the reputation of a former girlfriend and her family .
he also made a false report about damage to his bmw car in september 2000 - for which he eventually stood trial .
mr dizaei , 44 , said he lied about where he had left the car because he did not want his boss to know he had attended a black police association -lrb- bpa -rrb- meeting .
he was cleared with perverting the course of justice and misconduct in public office at the old bailey in 2003 .
" the book was my opportunity to say i 'm not ' the cocaine-snorting petty criminal spying for iran ' they portrayed me to be , " says mr dizaei .
the bbc news website has learned his publishers are in talks with eight film companies interested in buying the rights to the book .
" most are looking to do a docu-drama , " said rebecca grey , from mr dizaei 's publisher 's serpent 's tail .
cowboy boots the foreboding whistle from the good , the bad and the ugly suddenly peels out and interrupts our conversation .
" sorry , " says mr dizaei , as he answers his mobile phone .
the theme song from the clint eastwood spaghetti western classic is a reminder of his penchant for the flamboyant .
but gone are the sunglasses , designer belt or cowboy boots , he was wont to wear with his uniform - which once riled his more conservative colleagues .
i 'm very happy in my job .
i wo n't internalise this bitterness and let it affect my job ali dizaei proudly wearing his metropolitan police uniform , mr dizaei speaks of his passion for the job and his determination to continue his fight for a more diverse police force .
he says he was disappointed by his failure to win promotion to the rank of commander last week and accepts the book may have been a factor .
" i ca n't rule out bad timing , " he says .
" but i 'm waiting for my formal feedback to understand the decision .
" my performance as an individual leading a borough was assessed by my supervisor as exceptional for two successive years . "
hounslow in west london , where he is borough commander , has seen crime fall by 6.1 % and detection rates rise to 21.6 % in the last year , meeting the met 's annual targets .
" i do n't regret writing the book , " he says .
" one 's beliefs and values should occasionally supersede one 's career aspirations .
i needed to tell my version of events . "
' not bitter ' while mr dizaei says the feedback for the book has been on the whole positive , with many emails lauding his courage , it is by no means unanimous .
an asian detective sergeant based at scotland yard told the bbc news website : " internally , in the -lsb- met -rsb- , ali dizaei is perceived to be very unprofessional and only out to make money . "
mr dizaei says he intends to use the proceeds from the book to set up a university scholarship programme for deprived young people with the black police association -lrb- bpa -rrb- .
he will also be keeping some of the earnings in reserve to pay for his own costs and possible future libel action in relation to media reports of his case .
apart from bringing closure to a difficult chapter of his life , mr dizaei , who also acts as a legal advisor for the bpa , hopes the book will " invigorate " the met 's diversity programme .
" the force has made huge inroads but it still does n't reflect the society we serve , " he says .
" diversity is not a beauty contest , it 's an operational imperative .
in a few years half of london will look like me or close enough . "
in not one of us , mr dizaei writes of his desire to see all those who put him through his ordeal held to account .
" not every one has paid , " he says .
" many of them have been promoted .
but i 'm not bitter and twisted .
" i 'm very happy in my job .
i wo n't internalise this bitterness and let it affect my job .
if i did , it would be a victory for my enemies . "

plans to auction off the airspace required for hdtv to work on the freeview platform means viewers would not have access to the technology .
the campaign - dubbed hdforall - wants spectrum ring-fenced for digital terrestrial freeview viewers .
ofcom argues that it can not specify what spectrum is used for .
viewers of paid-for satellite and cable services already have access to hdtv but for freeview viewers more bandwidth is required .
ring-fenced spectrum " we could have a situation where the rest of the world is watching the olympics in hd while people in the uk ca n't " adrian northover-smith , sony according to ofcom 's figures more than one in four of the uk 's television sets are now connected to a freeview device .
uptake of the digital platform has been crucial to government plans to switch off the analogue signal by 2012 .
when this happens , it will free up spectrum that could be used to bring hdtv to the freeview platform .
the auction process proposed by ofcom means crucial hd airspace could be sold off to the highest bidder , such as mobile companies , leaving freeview viewers with no access to the technology , say campaigners .
members of the hdforall campaign - which includes industry heavyweights such as the bbc , itv , channel 4 , sony , samsung and the dixons retail group - want ofcom to ring-fence up to one third of the spectrum for digital terrestrial tv viewers .
they are concerned that the uk will become a two-tier tv nation , with those prepared to pay having access to better quality tv pictures .
" we could have a situation where the rest of the world is watching the olympics in hd while people in the uk ca n't .
the uk was leading the world in digital tv but there is the possibility of becoming second-class tv citizens , " said adrian northover-smith , digital development manager at sony .
benefit of society " if we were to allocate it for specific uses it would stop it being used for other purposes " ofcom spokesman for the bbc , the arguments for making hd universally available are obvious .
" high definition is already a consumer reality , and it 's one that really adds value for audiences .
it 's a technological advance we think can and should be available as far as possible to all viewers , whether they watch tv through cable , satellite or an aerial , and whether they choose pay or free-to-air television , " said a bbc spokesperson .
" without some intervention to allocate additional spectrum it is very unlikely that sufficient hd channels could be launched to ensure that freeview keeps pace with changing consumer expectations , " she added .
ofcom told the bbc news website that there will be enough spectrum for " up to five hd channels " on freeview .
this is disputed by hdforall .
" this is a wonderfully mischievous line from ofcom .
no-one has been able to figure out how that is possible .
while there is potential for two or three channels , five simply does n't fit the available spectrum , " said a spokesman for hdforall .
ofcom maintains that the public is best served by spectrum being made available on the open market .
" our objective is to maximise the benefit of spectrum to society , " said an ofcom spokesperson .
" if we were to allocate it for specific uses it would stop it being used for other purposes .
we do not think we are in a position to make those decisions , " he added .
ofcom 's research conducted for its digital dividend review , which outlines its proposals for selling off spectrum. found that people were n't particularly interested in hd .
" we did our own research and found that this simply is n't the case .
in fact consumer demand for hd is growing at a colossal rate , " said danny churchill , technology development consultant for the dixons group .
one of the findings of the dixons research was that there was actually greater consumer awareness about hdtv -lrb- 90 % -rrb- than digital switchover -lrb- 80 % -rrb- .
consumer confusion it is predicted that five million hd-ready tv sets will be sold in 2007 .
however research commissioned by digital uk , the group charged with overseeing the digital switchover , has revealed that many britons remain confused by the technology .
the survey asked more than 1,000 adults what equipment they would need to receive hd tv .
only 23 % knew that they would require both a hd-ready tv and a set-top box .
the majority either gave the wrong answer or said they did not know .
more than one-third -lrb- 37 % -rrb- believed that they were already watching hdtv .
with only an estimated 250,000 hd boxes on the market , this is clearly not the case .
if the numbers were extrapolated to the whole population , it would mean around 1.5m households mistakenly believing they are watching hdtv already .
some 18 % of those surveyed said they already had hd-ready tv sets .
extrapolated this would represent some 4.5m sets , but only 2.4m hd-ready tv sets were sold in 2006 .
ofcom is keen to point out that the debate about the future of spectrum is not over .
its proposals , which have caused heated debate since they were published at the end of last year , is open to public consultation until 20 march .
ofcom is due to report back its findings in the summer .

plans to auction off the airspace required for hdtv to work on the freeview platform means viewers would not have access to the technology .
the campaign - dubbed hdforall - wants spectrum ring-fenced for digital terrestrial freeview viewers .
ofcom argues that it can not specify what spectrum is used for .
viewers of paid-for satellite and cable services already have access to hdtv but for freeview viewers more bandwidth is required .
ring-fenced spectrum we could have a situation where the rest of the world is watching the olympics in hd while people in the uk ca n't adrian northover-smith , sony according to ofcom 's figures more than one in four of the uk 's television sets are now connected to a freeview device .
uptake of the digital platform has been crucial to government plans to switch off the analogue signal by 2012 .
when this happens , it will free up spectrum that could be used to bring hdtv to the freeview platform .
the auction process proposed by ofcom means crucial hd airspace could be sold off to the highest bidder , such as mobile companies , leaving freeview viewers with no access to the technology , say campaigners .
members of the hdforall campaign - which includes industry heavyweights such as the bbc , itv , channel 4 , sony , samsung and the dixons retail group - want ofcom to ring-fence up to one third of the spectrum for digital terrestrial tv viewers .
they are concerned that the uk will become a two-tier tv nation , with those prepared to pay having access to better quality tv pictures .
" we could have a situation where the rest of the world is watching the olympics in hd while people in the uk ca n't .
the uk was leading the world in digital tv but there is the possibility of becoming second-class tv citizens , " said adrian northover-smith , digital development manager at sony .
benefit of society if we were to allocate it for specific uses it would stop it being used for other purposes ofcom spokesman for the bbc , the arguments for making hd universally available are obvious .
" high definition is already a consumer reality , and it 's one that really adds value for audiences .
it 's a technological advance we think can and should be available as far as possible to all viewers , whether they watch tv through cable , satellite or an aerial , and whether they choose pay or free-to-air television , " said a bbc spokesperson .
" without some intervention to allocate additional spectrum it is very unlikely that sufficient hd channels could be launched to ensure that freeview keeps pace with changing consumer expectations , " she added .
ofcom told the bbc news website that there will be enough spectrum for " up to five hd channels " on freeview .
this is disputed by hdforall .
" this is a wonderfully mischievous line from ofcom .
no-one has been able to figure out how that is possible .
while there is potential for two or three channels , five simply does n't fit the available spectrum , " said a spokesman for hdforall .
ofcom maintains that the public is best served by spectrum being made available on the open market .
" our objective is to maximise the benefit of spectrum to society , " said an ofcom spokesperson .
" if we were to allocate it for specific uses it would stop it being used for other purposes .
we do not think we are in a position to make those decisions , " he added .
ofcom 's research conducted for its digital dividend review , which outlines its proposals for selling off spectrum. found that people were n't particularly interested in hd .
" we did our own research and found that this simply is n't the case .
in fact consumer demand for hd is growing at a colossal rate , " said danny churchill , technology development consultant for the dixons group .
one of the findings of the dixons research was that there was actually greater consumer awareness about hdtv -lrb- 90 % -rrb- than digital switchover -lrb- 80 % -rrb- .
consumer confusion it is predicted that five million hd-ready tv sets will be sold in 2007 .
however research commissioned by digital uk , the group charged with overseeing the digital switchover , has revealed that many britons remain confused by the technology .
the survey asked more than 1,000 adults what equipment they would need to receive hd tv .
only 23 % knew that they would require both a hd-ready tv and a set-top box .
the majority either gave the wrong answer or said they did not know .
more than one-third -lrb- 37 % -rrb- believed that they were already watching hdtv .
with only an estimated 250,000 hd boxes on the market , this is clearly not the case .

members of the hdforall campaign - which includes industry heavyweights such as the bbc , itv , channel 4 , sony , samsung and the dixons retail group - want ofcom to ring-fence up to one third of the spectrum for digital terrestrial tv viewers .
they are concerned that the uk will become a two-tier tv nation , with those prepared to pay having access to better quality tv pictures .
" we could have a situation where the rest of the world is watching the olympics in hd while people in the uk ca n't .
the uk was leading the world in digital tv but there is the possibility of becoming second-class tv citizens , " said adrian northover-smith , digital development manager at sony .
benefit of society if we were to allocate it for specific uses it would stop it being used for other purposes ofcom spokesman for the bbc , the arguments for making hd universally available are obvious .
" high definition is already a consumer reality , and it 's one that really adds value for audiences .
it 's a technological advance we think can and should be available as far as possible to all viewers , whether they watch tv through cable , satellite or an aerial , and whether they choose pay or free-to-air television , " said a bbc spokesperson .
" without some intervention to allocate additional spectrum it is very unlikely that sufficient hd channels could be launched to ensure that freeview keeps pace with changing consumer expectations , " she added .
ofcom told the bbc news website that there will be enough spectrum for " up to five hd channels " on freeview .
this is disputed by hdforall .
" this is a wonderfully mischievous line from ofcom .
no-one has been able to figure out how that is possible .
while there is potential for two or three channels , five simply does n't fit the available spectrum , " said a spokesman for hdforall .
ofcom maintains that the public is best served by spectrum being made available on the open market .
" our objective is to maximise the benefit of spectrum to society , " said an ofcom spokesperson .
" if we were to allocate it for specific uses it would stop it being used for other purposes .
we do not think we are in a position to make those decisions , " he added .
ofcom 's research conducted for its digital dividend review , which outlines its proposals for selling off spectrum. found that people were n't particularly interested in hd .
" we did our own research and found that this simply is n't the case .
in fact consumer demand for hd is growing at a colossal rate , " said danny churchill , technology development consultant for the dixons group .
one of the findings of the dixons research was that there was actually greater consumer awareness about hdtv -lrb- 90 % -rrb- than digital switchover -lrb- 80 % -rrb- .
consumer confusion it is predicted that five million hd-ready tv sets will be sold in 2007 .
however research commissioned by digital uk , the group charged with overseeing the digital switchover , has revealed that many britons remain confused by the technology .
the survey asked more than 1,000 adults what equipment they would need to receive hd tv .
only 23 % knew that they would require both a hd-ready tv and a set-top box .
the majority either gave the wrong answer or said they did not know .
more than one-third -lrb- 37 % -rrb- believed that they were already watching hdtv .
with only an estimated 250,000 hd boxes on the market , this is clearly not the case .
if the numbers were extrapolated to the whole population , it would mean around 1.5m households mistakenly believing they are watching hdtv already .
some 18 % of those surveyed said they already had hd-ready tv sets .
extrapolated this would represent some 4.5m sets , but only 2.4m hd-ready tv sets were sold in 2006 .
ofcom is keen to point out that the debate about the future of spectrum is not over .
its proposals , which have caused heated debate since they were published at the end of last year , is open to public consultation until 20 march .
ofcom is due to report back its findings in the summer .

chris ruane spent most of wednesday wrestling with his conscience .
his conscience won and he resigned from the government during the middle of bbc wales today .
he has impeccable timing .
mr ruane has been a serial loyalist , to his boss and to the government during his 10 years as an mp .
until last night , he had never voted against the government .
he was offered the option of " discovering a sick granny " that would have allowed him to absent himself from last night 's votes and keep his job but he decided instead to vote with his conscience against the upgrading of britain 's nuclear weapons .
it was another difficult day for tony blair .
with 95 labour mps voting against the government , he was forced to rely on conservative votes to deliver his defence policy .
the prime minister 's day also took in a meeting with a group of mountain rescue volunteers .
he was sympathetic , and apparently surprised to discover how these teams rely largely on volunteers who often have to buy their own kit .
it is up to chief constables to decide how much funding local mountain rescue teams get , if any , and the aim of yesterday 's meeting , organised by dai havard and lord inglewood , was to press the case for more central government funding .
several other mps took part in a photocall .
for some reason the volunteers were asked to leave one of their props - a massive stretcher on wheels - outside downing street .
wheeling the stretcher up to the door of number 10 would have generated nice tv pictures for us , although it would perhaps not have been the image of mr blair 's government he would have liked to convey yesterday .
i was about to interview a member of the central beacons mountain rescue team when a north wales mp tried to barge in with a request to be interviewed before the volunteer .
" i 'm very busy , " explained the said politician .
the volunteer got on wales ' most-watched television news programme .

chris ruane spent most of wednesday wrestling with his conscience .
his conscience won and he resigned from the government during the middle of bbc wales today .
he has impeccable timing .
mr ruane has been a serial loyalist , to his boss and to the government during his 10 years as an mp .
until last night , he had never voted against the government .
he was offered the option of " discovering a sick granny " that would have allowed him to absent himself from last night 's votes and keep his job but he decided instead to vote with his conscience against the upgrading of britain 's nuclear weapons .
it was another difficult day for tony blair .
with 95 labour mps voting against the government , he was forced to rely on conservative votes to deliver his defence policy .
the prime minister 's day also took in a meeting with a group of mountain rescue volunteers .
he was sympathetic , and apparently surprised to discover how these teams rely largely on volunteers who often have to buy their own kit .
it is up to chief constables to decide how much funding local mountain rescue teams get , if any , and the aim of yesterday 's meeting , organised by dai havard and lord inglewood , was to press the case for more central government funding .
several other mps took part in a photocall .
for some reason the volunteers were asked to leave one of their props - a massive stretcher on wheels - outside downing street .
wheeling the stretcher up to the door of number 10 would have generated nice tv pictures for us , although it would perhaps not have been the image of mr blair 's government he would have liked to convey yesterday .
i was about to interview a member of the central beacons mountain rescue team when a north wales mp tried to barge in with a request to be interviewed before the volunteer .
" i 'm very busy , " explained the said politician .
the volunteer got on wales ' most-watched television news programme .
the mp did n't .
