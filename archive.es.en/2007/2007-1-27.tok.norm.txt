" i believe we can get a breakthrough on the big numbers in agriculture and industrial goods in the next month or so , " the european trade commissioner told the financial times newspaper .
" the agricultural consultations between the eu and the us are through the worst .
we are approaching the endgame in that regard . " about 30 trade ministers will get together to discuss the doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks which was suspended last july because of differences between the european union , the united states and emerging countries . hopes of an agreement in the snowy swiss mountains have been played down but some such as german chancellor angela merkel whose country holds the rotating g-8 and eu presidencies remain hopeful that major progress in the five-year-old round of talks could be made shortly . " the chance for success is undoubtedly there , " she told reporters .
" i think that all the players have to be ready to exhibit a bit more flexibility . " bridging differences more than 60 chief executives and chairmen have stepped up the pressure on trade chiefs by issuing a joint statement urging leaders in rich and poor nations to bridge their differences within weeks . bildunterschrift : almost 3,000 people from 90 countries are in davos " we are united in our concern that failure to restart the doha round discussions immediately and conclude them within the next six months will seriously damage the global community , " said an endorsed statement from the international business council , issued at the davos meeting . the doha round was suspended by wto director-general pascal lamy in july following five years of acrimonious meetings . the round , which aims to break down trade barriers for the benefit of developing countries , is blocked because of differences between the eu and the united states on farm issues , and discord between rich and poor countries about trade in industrial products and services . " agriculture is holding up everything " one wto official told reporters .
" when that gets done , other dominoes have to fall into place fairly quickly . " us pessimistic us trade representative susan schwab appeared to be more pessimistic about a breakthrough than mandelson . " i do n't think we 're looking at a breakthrough in the near term , " the senior us trade official told afp .
" but i think we 're making some progress and some of the key players really are engaging - brazil , the eu , the united states and other countries - and that makes me cautiously optimistic that we are laying the groundwork for a breakthrough . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is optimistic over the talks the major players in the trade talks - schwab , mandelson and emerging country representatives indian industry minister kamal nath and brazilian foreign minister celso amorim - were all in davos for the world economic forum as of friday . " at the moment , we are not even on the road so we have to get back on it again and make a map for the future so that we start to reengage the wto again , " nath told dw-radio . roadblocks from congress some believe the most that can be hoped for at the saturday meeting is that the wto 's lamy relaunches formal negotiations , making the talks active again . lamy has said he is also looking for a signal from leading nations of their readiness to begin again . even if a final agreement were reached , it would require political approval and would likely face opposition in the current climate , analysts say . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel commits eu to mid-east peace in davos talks with abbas german chancellor angela merkel confirmed the eu 's commitment to middle east peace in talks with palestinian president mahmoud abbas in davos thursday .

" i believe we can get a breakthrough on the big numbers in agriculture and industrial goods in the next month or so , " the european trade commissioner told the financial times newspaper .
" the agricultural consultations between the eu and the us are through the worst .
we are approaching the endgame in that regard . " about 30 trade ministers will get together to discuss the doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks which was suspended last july because of differences between the european union , the united states and emerging countries . hopes of an agreement in the snowy swiss mountains have been played down but some such as german chancellor angela merkel whose country holds the rotating g-8 and eu presidencies remain hopeful that major progress in the five-year-old round of talks could be made shortly . " the chance for success is undoubtedly there , " she told reporters .
" i think that all the players have to be ready to exhibit a bit more flexibility .

" bridging differences more than 60 chief executives and chairmen have stepped up the pressure on trade chiefs by issuing a joint statement urging leaders in rich and poor nations to bridge their differences within weeks . bildunterschrift : almost 3,000 people from 90 countries are in davos " we are united in our concern that failure to restart the doha round discussions immediately and conclude them within the next six months will seriously damage the global community , " said an endorsed statement from the international business council , issued at the davos meeting . the doha round was suspended by wto director-general pascal lamy in july following five years of acrimonious meetings . the round , which aims to break down trade barriers for the benefit of developing countries , is blocked because of differences between the eu and the united states on farm issues , and discord between rich and poor countries about trade in industrial products and services . " agriculture is holding up everything " one wto official told reporters .
" when that gets done , other dominoes have to fall into place fairly quickly . " us pessimistic us trade representative susan schwab appeared to be more pessimistic about a breakthrough than mandelson . " i do n't think we 're looking at a breakthrough in the near term , " the senior us trade official told afp .
" but i think we 're making some progress and some of the key players really are engaging - brazil , the eu , the united states and other countries - and that makes me cautiously optimistic that we are laying the groundwork for a breakthrough . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is optimistic over the talks the major players in the trade talks - schwab , mandelson and emerging country representatives indian industry minister kamal nath and brazilian foreign minister celso amorim - were all in davos for the world economic forum as of friday . " at the moment , we are not even on the road so we have to get back on it again and make a map for the future so that we start to reengage the wto again , " nath told dw-radio . roadblocks from congress some believe the most that can be hoped for at the saturday meeting is that the wto 's lamy relaunches formal negotiations , making the talks active again . lamy has said he is also looking for a signal from leading nations of their readiness to begin again . even if a final agreement were reached , it would require political approval and would likely face opposition in the current climate , analysts say . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel commits eu to mid-east peace in davos talks with abbas german chancellor angela merkel confirmed the eu 's commitment to middle east peace in talks with palestinian president mahmoud abbas in davos thursday .

" they expressed a strong wish for a quick resumption of full scale activity in geneva , " the ministry , which hosted the gathering with world trade organization chief pascal lamy , said in a statement . " the clear signal for the resumption of full scale negotiations in geneva got strong support from political leaders and the business community gathered in davos , " the statement added . the meeting of the select group of wto members on the sidelines of the world economic forum was aimed at finding a way forward for the five-year-old talks which broke down in acrimony last july . " we must tell the world that the doha round is not dead , " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson told journalists . director general lamy suspended the negotiations at wto headquarters in geneva in the summer because of the persistent deadlock between the european union , the united states and developing countries over trade tariffs . decisions in the wto must be taken with the approval of all 150 members . american offer needed to avoid repeat collapse lamy said he did not expect the negotiations to take the same course that led to their breakdown in 2006 and highlighted " clear " signs of commitment . " we 'll need a new american offer on agricultural subsidies , a new one from the eu in agricultural tariffs and new indo-brazilian offer on industrial goods and services , " the wto chief said after the meeting . mandelson called on all those involved to show flexibility in the coming months and raised the prospect of a " no loopholes " concession to cut eu import tariffs for farm produce . lamy signaled that an offer from the united states was on the horizon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lula said his country was ready to give ground in recent days , key countries including india and the united states had played down hopes of an immediate breakthrough , although they hinted at some progress in informal bilateral meetings in recent weeks . brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva , an influential member of the g20 group of developing countries in the wto , said during an appearance at the forum that brazil was willing to make concessions . however , he was only ready to persuade the g20 to accept a deal if the eu and united states bridged their gap over farm subsidies and tariffs first . eu singing from different song sheets on agriculture in the european union , the french government in particular has insisted that the eu should not make any new offer to reduce import tariffs on farm products , a key bone of contention with the united states and developing nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson wants a cohesive eu stance mandelson said saturday that the eu was ready to improve its offer on agriculture " in the right circumstances " , to move closer to the demands of the g20 .
he suggested others needed to offer concessions on industrial goods and services . " every key player will need to show new commitments and new flexibilities including on nama -lrb- non agricultural market access -rrb- and services , " he added . the eu has been asking emerging economies in particular for better offers in those areas in return for freer access to the union 's huge consumer market for their imported farm produce . " we are ready to do this in a way that demonstrably gives new market access to all exporters and all products .
no loopholes , " said mandelson . doha talks needed to avoid economic crisis the round of negotiations launched by the wto members in the qatari capital doha in 2001 aims to reduce down trade barriers for the benefit of poor countries . it has been riven with cross-cutting disagreements about the extent of cuts in farm subsidies and import tariffs , largely holding up faltering attempts to break down barriers to industrial and services trade . european central bank chief jean claude trichet said here saturday that any failure to complete the doha round would jeopardize the world economy . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stalled wto talks expected to move forward at davos at the world economic forum at davos , many are eagerly awaiting signals of a revival of the doha round of world trade organization trade talks that were stalled last year .

" they expressed a strong wish for a quick resumption of full scale activity in geneva , " the ministry , which hosted the gathering with world trade organization chief pascal lamy , said in a statement . " the clear signal for the resumption of full scale negotiations in geneva got strong support from political leaders and the business community gathered in davos , " the statement added . the meeting of the select group of wto members on the sidelines of the world economic forum was aimed at finding a way forward for the five-year-old talks which broke down in acrimony last july . " we must tell the world that the doha round is not dead , " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson told journalists . director general lamy suspended the negotiations at wto headquarters in geneva in the summer because of the persistent deadlock between the european union , the united states and developing countries over trade tariffs . decisions in the wto must be taken with the approval of all 150 members . american offer needed to avoid repeat collapse lamy said he did not expect the negotiations to take the same course that led to their breakdown in 2006 and highlighted " clear " signs of commitment . " we 'll need a new american offer on agricultural subsidies , a new one from the eu in agricultural tariffs and new indo-brazilian offer on industrial goods and services , " the wto chief said after the meeting . mandelson called on all those involved to show flexibility in the coming months and raised the prospect of a " no loopholes " concession to cut eu import tariffs for farm produce . lamy signaled that an offer from the united states was on the horizon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lula said his country was ready to give ground in recent days , key countries including india and the united states had played down hopes of an immediate breakthrough , although they hinted at some progress in informal bilateral meetings in recent weeks . brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva , an influential member of the g20 group of developing countries in the wto , said during an appearance at the forum that brazil was willing to make concessions . however , he was only ready to persuade the g20 to accept a deal if the eu and united states bridged their gap over farm subsidies and tariffs first . eu singing from different song sheets on agriculture in the european union , the french government in particular has insisted that the eu should not make any new offer to reduce import tariffs on farm products , a key bone of contention with the united states and developing nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson wants a cohesive eu stance mandelson said saturday that the eu was ready to improve its offer on agriculture " in the right circumstances " , to move closer to the demands of the g20 .
he suggested others needed to offer concessions on industrial goods and services . " every key player will need to show new commitments and new flexibilities including on nama -lrb- non agricultural market access -rrb- and services , " he added . the eu has been asking emerging economies in particular for better offers in those areas in return for freer access to the union 's huge consumer market for their imported farm produce . " we are ready to do this in a way that demonstrably gives new market access to all exporters and all products .
no loopholes , " said mandelson . doha talks needed to avoid economic crisis the round of negotiations launched by the wto members in the qatari capital doha in 2001 aims to reduce down trade barriers for the benefit of poor countries . it has been riven with cross-cutting disagreements about the extent of cuts in farm subsidies and import tariffs , largely holding up faltering attempts to break down barriers to industrial and services trade . european central bank chief jean claude trichet said here saturday that any failure to complete the doha round would jeopardize the world economy . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stalled wto talks expected to move forward at davos at the world economic forum at davos , many are eagerly awaiting signals of a revival of the doha round of world trade organization trade talks that were stalled last year .

" pulitzbrücke was the former railway station used during world war ii for the deportation of berlin 's jews to concentration camps . chancellor angela merkel urged " all courageous democrats " to fight the rise of the far-right and anti-semitism in modern germany as the country remembered the victims of the holocaust . a few supporters of the extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- demonstrated outside a meeting of merkel 's conservative christian democrats in frankfurt an der oder on the polish border where the chancellor was speaking .
" the npd must be fought by all courageous democrats , and i thank all those who commit themselves to this , " merkel told delegates inside . the npd demonstrators were met by a larger number of counter-protesters . among other holocaust memorial activities set to take place around germany , the government of the state of saxony anhalt was holding a ceremony in salzwedel .
the main ceremony in mecklenburg-western pomerania was set for the town of malchow . the prime minister of brandenburg state , matthias platzeck of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , is to attend a ceremony at the sachsenhausen memorial site near oranienburg . holocaust memorial day will also feature saturday afternoon in soccer league announcements and in reports by club magazines . never forget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marking the holocaust should serve as a lesson meanwhile in brussels , the president of the european parliament , hans-gert pöttering , said , " we must never forget this abominable and tremendously painful side of this continent 's history . ' the crimes committed by the nazis must be remembered by future generations as a warning against a genocide which should never be repeated , " he said . pöttering , the newly-elected parliamentary president , added : " on this day , we remember the millions of victims of the holocaust , the murder of six million jews as well as roma , poles , russians and people of other nationalities . continuing the fight against intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe still struggles with its painful and shameful past " the holocaust memorial day is a day on which we most sharply condemn intolerance and animosity towards other religions and races and every form of anti-semitism , " he said . the highest measure of political conduct for the european union is the respect of every person 's dignity and human rights throughout the world , pöttering added . german jews start campaign germany 's jewish community launched a campaign of full-page newspaper advertisements saturday to stress the importance of the holocaust memorial day and to attack efforts by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad to deny it . the advertisements by the central council of german jews warned against the threat emanating from ahmadinejad , who has stirred controversy with remarks referring to the holocaust as a " legend . " ahmadinejad had " many times denied the systematic disfranchisement , deportation and factory-scale annihilation of millions of european jews , " the advertisement said . it said that the nuclear program pursued by ahmadinejad and his regime of mullahs posed a " threat not only to the middle east but the entire world " and demanded that the german government should make no compromises with iran regarding the issue of atomic weapons . holocaust memorial day was established in 1996 by former german president roman herzog as a day of remembrance for the victims of national socialism .

an extension of the passenger data exchange deal between the eu and the us seems likely . during a visit to berlin on friday , us homeland security secretary michael chertoff and his host , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , discussed the impact of a deal struck between the us and the european last year which gives american law enforcement agencies easier access to air passenger data . the agreement applies only until july 2007 and a long-term accord will have to be hammered out soon .
the two men also debated the need to harmonize data protection standards .
european fears of insufficient us standard had been high in the run-up to the signing of the agreement on the delivery of passenger data by european airlines . schäuble said his talks with chertoff centered on ways of intensifying the exchange of security-relevant data between germany and the united states .
he called that a top priority in the fight against organized crime and international terrorism . schäuble and chertoff were agreed that present-day threats made it necessary to focus even more on crime prevention .
the us homeland security chief had just come from the world economic forum at davos , switzerland , where he also talked about the security dangers of the 21st century . us chief praises efforts so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeland security secretary michael chertoff chertoff spoke about the potential ability of even a single individual or small group to use technology with the sort of destruction that would have been unthinkable a century ago .
he said in berlin that " you can ’ t put that genie back in the bottle once a nuclear bomb or another weapon of mass destruction gets into the hands of a terrorist . " chertoff praised the usefulness of the data deal between the united states and the european union struck in october of last year .
it allows us security agencies to get hold of and analyze data of european air passengers headed for the us . airlines have to make available passengers ’ addresses , telephone numbers , credit card details , e-mails and other information to help identify suspicious travelers at the earliest possible stage .
information that may point to passengers ’ religious denominations must not be passed on in line with european data protection and anti-discrimination standards . germany , which currently holds the eu presidency , has the responsibility to extend the current deal past july of this year and turn that the agreement into a longer-term accord , schäuble said . schäuble predicts greater security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister wolfgang schäuble " of course , the european union has in interest in reaching a long-term agreement , " he said .
" the americans hope that such an accord can be coupled with an even more efficient use of the data made available .
this is something that we can live with .
we do not need more data input , but a more efficient analysis of what ’ s available already .
citizens should have no objections to that , because everyone should have an interest in enjoying greater security during passenger flights . " both germany and the united states agree that data protection standards must not be sacrificed in the fight against cross-border terrorism .
there are however different views on just how strict relevant regulations should be . a german-us working group is to look into ways of harmonizing national data protection laws . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european union and us reach air passenger data deal eu and us negotiators have reached a deal on providing information about airline passengers traveling to the united states .
diplomats said the agreement came after marathon talks that began late thursday .
-lrb- 06.10.2006 -rrb- eu , us still divided over passenger data deal as deadline passes eu and us officials were hoping sunday to avoid a legal vacuum threatening to disrupt transatlantic travel after failing to reach agreement on the transfer of airline passenger data before a court deadline passed .

an extension of the passenger data exchange deal between the eu and the us seems likely . during a visit to berlin on friday , us homeland security secretary michael chertoff and his host , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , discussed the impact of a deal struck between the us and the european last year which gives american law enforcement agencies easier access to air passenger data . the agreement applies only until july 2007 and a long-term accord will have to be hammered out soon .
the two men also debated the need to harmonize data protection standards .
european fears of insufficient us standard had been high in the run-up to the signing of the agreement on the delivery of passenger data by european airlines . schäuble said his talks with chertoff centered on ways of intensifying the exchange of security-relevant data between germany and the united states .
he called that a top priority in the fight against organized crime and international terrorism . schäuble and chertoff were agreed that present-day threats made it necessary to focus even more on crime prevention .

england manager hope powell brought on a strong forward line made up of arsenal 's rachel yankey and leeds united 's eniola aluko , who sat on the bench for their first game against china . while yankey , aluko and midfielder karen carney had shots on goal it was the americans who went ahead after forward heather o 'reilly headed home midfielder natasha kai 's right flank cross in the 16th minute . right back alexandra scott dashed into the box to poke in the equalizer at the far post on 48 minutes , after yankey fed a clinical low center from the left . after the break england conjured up several sharp forays down the flanks but the us defense held out for a point .

" i believe we can get a breakthrough on the big numbers in agriculture and industrial goods in the next month or so , " the european trade commissioner told the financial times newspaper .
" the agricultural consultations between the eu and the us are through the worst .
we are approaching the endgame in that regard . " about 30 trade ministers will get together to discuss the doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks which was suspended last july because of differences between the european union , the united states and emerging countries . hopes of an agreement in the snowy swiss mountains have been played down but some such as german chancellor angela merkel whose country holds the rotating g-8 and eu presidencies remain hopeful that major progress in the five-year-old round of talks could be made shortly . " the chance for success is undoubtedly there , " she told reporters .
" i think that all the players have to be ready to exhibit a bit more flexibility . " bridging differences more than 60 chief executives and chairmen have stepped up the pressure on trade chiefs by issuing a joint statement urging leaders in rich and poor nations to bridge their differences within weeks . bildunterschrift : almost 3,000 people from 90 countries are in davos " we are united in our concern that failure to restart the doha round discussions immediately and conclude them within the next six months will seriously damage the global community , " said an endorsed statement from the international business council , issued at the davos meeting . the doha round was suspended by wto director-general pascal lamy in july following five years of acrimonious meetings . the round , which aims to break down trade barriers for the benefit of developing countries , is blocked because of differences between the eu and the united states on farm issues , and discord between rich and poor countries about trade in industrial products and services . " agriculture is holding up everything " one wto official told reporters .
" when that gets done , other dominoes have to fall into place fairly quickly . " us pessimistic us trade representative susan schwab appeared to be more pessimistic about a breakthrough than mandelson . " i do n't think we 're looking at a breakthrough in the near term , " the senior us trade official told afp .
" but i think we 're making some progress and some of the key players really are engaging - brazil , the eu , the united states and other countries - and that makes me cautiously optimistic that we are laying the groundwork for a breakthrough . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is optimistic over the talks the major players in the trade talks - schwab , mandelson and emerging country representatives indian industry minister kamal nath and brazilian foreign minister celso amorim - were all in davos for the world economic forum as of friday .

" they expressed a strong wish for a quick resumption of full scale activity in geneva , " the ministry , which hosted the gathering with world trade organization chief pascal lamy , said in a statement . " the clear signal for the resumption of full scale negotiations in geneva got strong support from political leaders and the business community gathered in davos , " the statement added . the meeting of the select group of wto members on the sidelines of the world economic forum was aimed at finding a way forward for the five-year-old talks which broke down in acrimony last july . " we must tell the world that the doha round is not dead , " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson told journalists . director general lamy suspended the negotiations at wto headquarters in geneva in the summer because of the persistent deadlock between the european union , the united states and developing countries over trade tariffs . decisions in the wto must be taken with the approval of all 150 members . american offer needed to avoid repeat collapse lamy said he did not expect the negotiations to take the same course that led to their breakdown in 2006 and highlighted " clear " signs of commitment . " we 'll need a new american offer on agricultural subsidies , a new one from the eu in agricultural tariffs and new indo-brazilian offer on industrial goods and services , " the wto chief said after the meeting . mandelson called on all those involved to show flexibility in the coming months and raised the prospect of a " no loopholes " concession to cut eu import tariffs for farm produce . lamy signaled that an offer from the united states was on the horizon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lula said his country was ready to give ground in recent days , key countries including india and the united states had played down hopes of an immediate breakthrough , although they hinted at some progress in informal bilateral meetings in recent weeks . brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva , an influential member of the g20 group of developing countries in the wto , said during an appearance at the forum that brazil was willing to make concessions . however , he was only ready to persuade the g20 to accept a deal if the eu and united states bridged their gap over farm subsidies and tariffs first . eu singing from different song sheets on agriculture in the european union , the french government in particular has insisted that the eu should not make any new offer to reduce import tariffs on farm products , a key bone of contention with the united states and developing nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson wants a cohesive eu stance mandelson said saturday that the eu was ready to improve its offer on agriculture " in the right circumstances " , to move closer to the demands of the g20 .
he suggested others needed to offer concessions on industrial goods and services . " every key player will need to show new commitments and new flexibilities including on nama -lrb- non agricultural market access -rrb- and services , " he added . the eu has been asking emerging economies in particular for better offers in those areas in return for freer access to the union 's huge consumer market for their imported farm produce . " we are ready to do this in a way that demonstrably gives new market access to all exporters and all products .
no loopholes , " said mandelson . doha talks needed to avoid economic crisis the round of negotiations launched by the wto members in the qatari capital doha in 2001 aims to reduce down trade barriers for the benefit of poor countries . it has been riven with cross-cutting disagreements about the extent of cuts in farm subsidies and import tariffs , largely holding up faltering attempts to break down barriers to industrial and services trade . european central bank chief jean claude trichet said here saturday that any failure to complete the doha round would jeopardize the world economy . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stalled wto talks expected to move forward at davos at the world economic forum at davos , many are eagerly awaiting signals of a revival of the doha round of world trade organization trade talks that were stalled last year .

" i believe we can get a breakthrough on the big numbers in agriculture and industrial goods in the next month or so , " the european trade commissioner told the financial times newspaper .
" the agricultural consultations between the eu and the us are through the worst .
we are approaching the endgame in that regard . " about 30 trade ministers will get together to discuss the doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks which was suspended last july because of differences between the european union , the united states and emerging countries . hopes of an agreement in the snowy swiss mountains have been played down but some such as german chancellor angela merkel whose country holds the rotating g-8 and eu presidencies remain hopeful that major progress in the five-year-old round of talks could be made shortly . " the chance for success is undoubtedly there , " she told reporters .
" i think that all the players have to be ready to exhibit a bit more flexibility . " bridging differences more than 60 chief executives and chairmen have stepped up the pressure on trade chiefs by issuing a joint statement urging leaders in rich and poor nations to bridge their differences within weeks . bildunterschrift : almost 3,000 people from 90 countries are in davos " we are united in our concern that failure to restart the doha round discussions immediately and conclude them within the next six months will seriously damage the global community , " said an endorsed statement from the international business council , issued at the davos meeting . the doha round was suspended by wto director-general pascal lamy in july following five years of acrimonious meetings . the round , which aims to break down trade barriers for the benefit of developing countries , is blocked because of differences between the eu and the united states on farm issues , and discord between rich and poor countries about trade in industrial products and services . " agriculture is holding up everything " one wto official told reporters .

it was the second blank for germany 's world cup holders . the hosts came out fighting against the world number two in the opening exchanges and then held firm as germany , with six changes from the side that drew 0-0 against the united states , got into their stride . germany missed a good chance six minutes into the second half when fatmire bajramaj wasted midfielder conny pohlers ' pinpoint low cross from the right . han wenxia denied pohlers another goal-bound drive in the 61st minute when she blocked the close shot inside the box with her legs . chances go begging for both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany were left to chase the game against the hosts china then went close to breaking the deadlock in the 67th minute when forward liu sa picked up a fine lobbed pass but facing the outrushing stephanie ullrich had her shot parried out . in other action sunday england drew 1-1 with the united states .
england manager hope powell brought on a strong forward line made up of arsenal 's rachel yankey and leeds united 's eniola aluko , who sat on the bench for their first game against china . while yankey , aluko and midfielder karen carney had shots on goal it was the americans who went ahead after forward heather o 'reilly headed home midfielder natasha kai 's right flank cross in the 16th minute . right back alexandra scott dashed into the box to poke in the equalizer at the far post on 48 minutes , after yankey fed a clinical low center from the left . after the break england conjured up several sharp forays down the flanks but the us defense held out for a point .
no goals in clash with united states in the first round of the tournament , germany were held to a 0-0 by fierce rivals the united states in the opening game on friday .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's keeper rottenberg was a rare success neither team made much of an impact and the star players at the end of the goalless draw were probably goalkeepers silke rottenberg and hope solo , although neither the german or the american had any real saves to make .
america 's new hope gets first cap the game 's most notable event came with the inclusion of national player of the year lauren cheney in the us side .
the 19-year-old ucla graduate made her debut in the absence of fellow strikers kristine lilly and abby wambach , who are home resting .
american coach greg ryan is searching for a third striker for the world cup and cheney is a candidate , as are natasha kai , heather o 'reilly and lindsay tarpley , all who featured during the game with germany .

an extension of the passenger data exchange deal between the eu and the us seems likely . during a visit to berlin on friday , us homeland security secretary michael chertoff and his host , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , discussed the impact of a deal struck between the us and the european last year which gives american law enforcement agencies easier access to air passenger data . the agreement applies only until july 2007 and a long-term accord will have to be hammered out soon .
the two men also debated the need to harmonize data protection standards .
european fears of insufficient us standard had been high in the run-up to the signing of the agreement on the delivery of passenger data by european airlines . schäuble said his talks with chertoff centered on ways of intensifying the exchange of security-relevant data between germany and the united states .
he called that a top priority in the fight against organized crime and international terrorism . schäuble and chertoff were agreed that present-day threats made it necessary to focus even more on crime prevention .
the us homeland security chief had just come from the world economic forum at davos , switzerland , where he also talked about the security dangers of the 21st century . us chief praises efforts so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeland security secretary michael chertoff chertoff spoke about the potential ability of even a single individual or small group to use technology with the sort of destruction that would have been unthinkable a century ago .
he said in berlin that " you can ’ t put that genie back in the bottle once a nuclear bomb or another weapon of mass destruction gets into the hands of a terrorist . " chertoff praised the usefulness of the data deal between the united states and the european union struck in october of last year .
it allows us security agencies to get hold of and analyze data of european air passengers headed for the us . airlines have to make available passengers ’ addresses , telephone numbers , credit card details , e-mails and other information to help identify suspicious travelers at the earliest possible stage .
information that may point to passengers ’ religious denominations must not be passed on in line with european data protection and anti-discrimination standards . germany , which currently holds the eu presidency , has the responsibility to extend the current deal past july of this year and turn that the agreement into a longer-term accord , schäuble said . schäuble predicts greater security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister wolfgang schäuble " of course , the european union has in interest in reaching a long-term agreement , " he said .
" the americans hope that such an accord can be coupled with an even more efficient use of the data made available .
this is something that we can live with .
we do not need more data input , but a more efficient analysis of what ’ s available already .
citizens should have no objections to that , because everyone should have an interest in enjoying greater security during passenger flights . " both germany and the united states agree that data protection standards must not be sacrificed in the fight against cross-border terrorism .
there are however different views on just how strict relevant regulations should be . a german-us working group is to look into ways of harmonizing national data protection laws . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european union and us reach air passenger data deal eu and us negotiators have reached a deal on providing information about airline passengers traveling to the united states .

the charter has been on ice since french and dutch voters rejected it in 2005 referendums . the german eu presidency wants to salvage the substance of the treaty as it stands now , but faces strong opposition from the czech republic , and also poland and britain .

" " discussions today did not cover our reservations or the problems , we rather sought out what unites us and what unites european countries , " topolanek added . the document should " bind together and not separate , " topolanek said .
" it should clearly define which competencies the eu has and which fall to the national states , " he said . merkel warned that europe would only be successful when all are pushing in the same direction . president admits views are " kilometers " apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president klaus is at odds with merkel over the charter after meeting with klaus , who also has a reputation as a euro-skeptic , merkel said there was a " common will to forge ahead .

but he admitted that he was impressed with merkel 's knowledge of the region 's history , when she used a comparison to the hussite movement of the 15th century to try to win the leader over to the constitution . merkel , the daughter of a protestant minister , said the czech leader was fighting against the moribund constitution as tenaciously as the bohemian hussite movement , which fought " over every millimeter " of theological territory against dominant roman catholicism of the middle ages . klaus was impressed .

" i believe we can get a breakthrough on the big numbers in agriculture and industrial goods in the next month or so , " the european trade commissioner told the financial times newspaper .
" the agricultural consultations between the eu and the us are through the worst .
we are approaching the endgame in that regard . " about 30 trade ministers will get together to discuss the doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks which was suspended last july because of differences between the european union , the united states and emerging countries . hopes of an agreement in the snowy swiss mountains have been played down but some such as german chancellor angela merkel whose country holds the rotating g-8 and eu presidencies remain hopeful that major progress in the five-year-old round of talks could be made shortly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 27.01.2007 germany needs smarter investment to play catch up with us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany trails the us and asia in biotechnology each year , some of germany 's brightest minds in science and technology move abroad .
but as once-futuristic industries emerge as real moneymakers , germans have more to worry about than losing their talent to the us . when news broke late last year that discount super market chain penny markt was selling genetically-modified rice , german consumers sounded the alarm . german officials responded by saying they will use their six month presidency of the european union to take a look at the rules concerning biotech research and development in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 60 percent of corn in the us is genetically modified but while europeans are wringing their hands over those developments , 90 percent of soybeans grown in the u.s. are now genetically modified , as is 60 percent of corn . it ’ s no surprise then that germany trails far behind the united states in bio-engineering and biotechnology .
but the problem is , that in the next century , it ’ s industries just like biotech that will be driving the world ’ s economy . so how is germany planning to keep up ? knowing where to invest is key peter strüven , senior vice president of the boston consulting group in germany , has just finished an annual study of how germany can thrive in the development of ‘ future technologies . ’ " first of all , if we look at the size of germany , and the resources we have , we are doing enormously well , " said strüven .
" in many areas we are the market leader world wide . " strüven found that germany doesn ’ t have the resources the us and japan do , so the country simply can ’ t try to invest in everything .
he suggests germany will do best when it stops throwing good money at areas where there 's no point competing . the consulting firm ernst and young says the us biotech industry employs 200,000 workers and spent more than 15 billion euros on research and development last year alone . compared to that , germany ’ s 2006 investment in biotech was expected to be less than 150 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has fallen behind in biotechnology and a may report from the european association for bio-industries in brussels says many of europe 's 2,000 biotech companies need much more money if they ’ re going to be able to grow . but strüven said it ’ s better for germany to cut its losses in a field where it isn ’ t booming , and to move on .
just like it did , when it stopped trying to compete with asia in digital and consumer electronics . " we will not gain in consumer electronics and we would not suggest to do that . we were so far behind in consumer electronics that it wasn ’ t worth it to compete , " said strüven .
" what we are suggesting is that we focus on the existing industries where we have an advantage , like automotive or mechanical future technologies . " germany ’ s innovative car business , for example , can help it lead the way in other fields such as robotics or eco-technology or larger-scale engineering . " see , you have the first order technologies like cars and aerospace .
and then you have the supporting technologies that help those main products go , " said strüven .
" those supporting technologies are the ones that foster innovation . " getting the brightest to stay another problem for germany is to keep its brightest minds from flooding to the us where better opportunities beckon .
american science magazine recently reported that every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves germany for the united states . " the job market here is tight .
there are not a lot of jobs .
one thought of mine was to go visit the us and work there , " said malta , a first-year student at berlin 's technical university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's best brains usually opt to go abroad once they 've finished studying malta and his friend halit said they are worried that germany is too focused on the here-and-now and say the country doesn ’ t invest enough in future industries like nano-technology . nano-technology will revolutionize the way buildings and building materials are constructed , halit said .
he added he wants to work where the best , most futuristic and most lucrative work is being done . " the united states has more potential , in the economic view .
so job prospects in the states may be better at this time , " he said .
" on the other hand we want to enjoy the american way of living . " focusing on germany 's strengths boston consulting group ’ s peter strüven said that ’ s exactly why germany needs to take its limited resources and focus investment on things that will help germany keep , and attract , the smartest people . " we will be able to stop that , if we focus more and are able to improve the conditions under which our researchers can work here , " strüven said .
" if we can provide them with similar and comparable positions , they will stay .
they do n't want to leave because they do n't like germany . " strüven acknowledged that germany may not have the famed silicon valley of california or the sparkling new skyscrapers of shanghai . but he says german cities and german technology both have their own claims to fame .
and investors need to focus on those . ethan lindsey -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : germany plans to boost funding for it sector german chancellor angela merkel is expected to announce monday at the country 's first it summit that her government plans to fund the sector with 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 billion -rrb- over three years , according to a report .

an extension of the passenger data exchange deal between the eu and the us seems likely . during a visit to berlin on friday , us homeland security secretary michael chertoff and his host , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , discussed the impact of a deal struck between the us and the european last year which gives american law enforcement agencies easier access to air passenger data . the agreement applies only until july 2007 and a long-term accord will have to be hammered out soon .
the two men also debated the need to harmonize data protection standards .
european fears of insufficient us standard had been high in the run-up to the signing of the agreement on the delivery of passenger data by european airlines . schäuble said his talks with chertoff centered on ways of intensifying the exchange of security-relevant data between germany and the united states .
he called that a top priority in the fight against organized crime and international terrorism . schäuble and chertoff were agreed that present-day threats made it necessary to focus even more on crime prevention .
the us homeland security chief had just come from the world economic forum at davos , switzerland , where he also talked about the security dangers of the 21st century . us chief praises efforts so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeland security secretary michael chertoff chertoff spoke about the potential ability of even a single individual or small group to use technology with the sort of destruction that would have been unthinkable a century ago .
he said in berlin that " you can ’ t put that genie back in the bottle once a nuclear bomb or another weapon of mass destruction gets into the hands of a terrorist . " chertoff praised the usefulness of the data deal between the united states and the european union struck in october of last year .
it allows us security agencies to get hold of and analyze data of european air passengers headed for the us . airlines have to make available passengers ’ addresses , telephone numbers , credit card details , e-mails and other information to help identify suspicious travelers at the earliest possible stage .
information that may point to passengers ’ religious denominations must not be passed on in line with european data protection and anti-discrimination standards . germany , which currently holds the eu presidency , has the responsibility to extend the current deal past july of this year and turn that the agreement into a longer-term accord , schäuble said . schäuble predicts greater security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister wolfgang schäuble " of course , the european union has in interest in reaching a long-term agreement , " he said .
" the americans hope that such an accord can be coupled with an even more efficient use of the data made available .
this is something that we can live with .
we do not need more data input , but a more efficient analysis of what ’ s available already .
citizens should have no objections to that , because everyone should have an interest in enjoying greater security during passenger flights . " both germany and the united states agree that data protection standards must not be sacrificed in the fight against cross-border terrorism .

" they expressed a strong wish for a quick resumption of full scale activity in geneva , " the ministry , which hosted the gathering with world trade organization chief pascal lamy , said in a statement . " the clear signal for the resumption of full scale negotiations in geneva got strong support from political leaders and the business community gathered in davos , " the statement added . the meeting of the select group of wto members on the sidelines of the world economic forum was aimed at finding a way forward for the five-year-old talks which broke down in acrimony last july . " we must tell the world that the doha round is not dead , " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson told journalists . director general lamy suspended the negotiations at wto headquarters in geneva in the summer because of the persistent deadlock between the european union , the united states and developing countries over trade tariffs . decisions in the wto must be taken with the approval of all 150 members . american offer needed to avoid repeat collapse lamy said he did not expect the negotiations to take the same course that led to their breakdown in 2006 and highlighted " clear " signs of commitment . " we 'll need a new american offer on agricultural subsidies , a new one from the eu in agricultural tariffs and new indo-brazilian offer on industrial goods and services , " the wto chief said after the meeting . mandelson called on all those involved to show flexibility in the coming months and raised the prospect of a " no loopholes " concession to cut eu import tariffs for farm produce . lamy signaled that an offer from the united states was on the horizon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lula said his country was ready to give ground in recent days , key countries including india and the united states had played down hopes of an immediate breakthrough , although they hinted at some progress in informal bilateral meetings in recent weeks . brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva , an influential member of the g20 group of developing countries in the wto , said during an appearance at the forum that brazil was willing to make concessions . however , he was only ready to persuade the g20 to accept a deal if the eu and united states bridged their gap over farm subsidies and tariffs first . eu singing from different song sheets on agriculture in the european union , the french government in particular has insisted that the eu should not make any new offer to reduce import tariffs on farm products , a key bone of contention with the united states and developing nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson wants a cohesive eu stance mandelson said saturday that the eu was ready to improve its offer on agriculture " in the right circumstances " , to move closer to the demands of the g20 .
he suggested others needed to offer concessions on industrial goods and services . " every key player will need to show new commitments and new flexibilities including on nama -lrb- non agricultural market access -rrb- and services , " he added . the eu has been asking emerging economies in particular for better offers in those areas in return for freer access to the union 's huge consumer market for their imported farm produce . " we are ready to do this in a way that demonstrably gives new market access to all exporters and all products .
no loopholes , " said mandelson . doha talks needed to avoid economic crisis the round of negotiations launched by the wto members in the qatari capital doha in 2001 aims to reduce down trade barriers for the benefit of poor countries . it has been riven with cross-cutting disagreements about the extent of cuts in farm subsidies and import tariffs , largely holding up faltering attempts to break down barriers to industrial and services trade . european central bank chief jean claude trichet said here saturday that any failure to complete the doha round would jeopardize the world economy . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stalled wto talks expected to move forward at davos at the world economic forum at davos , many are eagerly awaiting signals of a revival of the doha round of world trade organization trade talks that were stalled last year .

the charter has been on ice since french and dutch voters rejected it in 2005 referendums . the german eu presidency wants to salvage the substance of the treaty as it stands now , but faces strong opposition from the czech republic , and also poland and britain .
all feel the reform is unnecessary , cumbersome and expensive . merkel , putting the best face on the talks , emerged from talks with toploanek on the vexed issue , saying he had " interesting " ideas . topolanek , who has gone on record as dismissing the constitution as a " pile of crap " , had produced " a very interesting framework for future detailed discussion , " merkel said after the prague meeting . czech pm calls for complete rewrite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just a little , but a lot : topolanek wants major changes topolanek put a finer point on it , complimenting merkel 's " courage " to take up the political challenge but warning that a total rewrite was needed for many passages of the document .
he said it would be a mistake to simply try to reduce the scope of the document . " i salute the german approach with regard to the discussion , " the rightwing leader said , adding that their talks centered on the " relaunch of the debate about the eu 's institutional framework " had been " short but intense . " " discussions today did not cover our reservations or the problems , we rather sought out what unites us and what unites european countries , " topolanek added . the document should " bind together and not separate , " topolanek said .
" it should clearly define which competencies the eu has and which fall to the national states , " he said . merkel warned that europe would only be successful when all are pushing in the same direction . president admits views are " kilometers " apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president klaus is at odds with merkel over the charter after meeting with klaus , who also has a reputation as a euro-skeptic , merkel said there was a " common will to forge ahead . " klaus was more reserved .
" it would be wrong to say we shared the same opinion , " he emphasized .
but he admitted that he was impressed with merkel 's knowledge of the region 's history , when she used a comparison to the hussite movement of the 15th century to try to win the leader over to the constitution . merkel , the daughter of a protestant minister , said the czech leader was fighting against the moribund constitution as tenaciously as the bohemian hussite movement , which fought " over every millimeter " of theological territory against dominant roman catholicism of the middle ages . klaus was impressed .
the conservative leader complimented merkel on her excellent knowledge of history , but added that his opposition against a european constitution involved " not just millimeters , but kilometers .

the charter has been on ice since french and dutch voters rejected it in 2005 referendums . the german eu presidency wants to salvage the substance of the treaty as it stands now , but faces strong opposition from the czech republic , and also poland and britain .
all feel the reform is unnecessary , cumbersome and expensive . merkel , putting the best face on the talks , emerged from talks with toploanek on the vexed issue , saying he had " interesting " ideas . topolanek , who has gone on record as dismissing the constitution as a " pile of crap " , had produced " a very interesting framework for future detailed discussion , " merkel said after the prague meeting . czech pm calls for complete rewrite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just a little , but a lot : topolanek wants major changes topolanek put a finer point on it , complimenting merkel 's " courage " to take up the political challenge but warning that a total rewrite was needed for many passages of the document .
he said it would be a mistake to simply try to reduce the scope of the document . " i salute the german approach with regard to the discussion , " the rightwing leader said , adding that their talks centered on the " relaunch of the debate about the eu 's institutional framework " had been " short but intense . " " discussions today did not cover our reservations or the problems , we rather sought out what unites us and what unites european countries , " topolanek added . the document should " bind together and not separate , " topolanek said .
" it should clearly define which competencies the eu has and which fall to the national states , " he said . merkel warned that europe would only be successful when all are pushing in the same direction . president admits views are " kilometers " apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president klaus is at odds with merkel over the charter after meeting with klaus , who also has a reputation as a euro-skeptic , merkel said there was a " common will to forge ahead . " klaus was more reserved .
" it would be wrong to say we shared the same opinion , " he emphasized .
but he admitted that he was impressed with merkel 's knowledge of the region 's history , when she used a comparison to the hussite movement of the 15th century to try to win the leader over to the constitution . merkel , the daughter of a protestant minister , said the czech leader was fighting against the moribund constitution as tenaciously as the bohemian hussite movement , which fought " over every millimeter " of theological territory against dominant roman catholicism of the middle ages . klaus was impressed .
the conservative leader complimented merkel on her excellent knowledge of history , but added that his opposition against a european constitution involved " not just millimeters , but kilometers .

the charter has been on ice since french and dutch voters rejected it in 2005 referendums . the german eu presidency wants to salvage the substance of the treaty as it stands now , but faces strong opposition from the czech republic , and also poland and britain .
all feel the reform is unnecessary , cumbersome and expensive . merkel , putting the best face on the talks , emerged from talks with toploanek on the vexed issue , saying he had " interesting " ideas . topolanek , who has gone on record as dismissing the constitution as a " pile of crap " , had produced " a very interesting framework for future detailed discussion , " merkel said after the prague meeting . czech pm calls for complete rewrite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just a little , but a lot : topolanek wants major changes topolanek put a finer point on it , complimenting merkel 's " courage " to take up the political challenge but warning that a total rewrite was needed for many passages of the document .
he said it would be a mistake to simply try to reduce the scope of the document . " i salute the german approach with regard to the discussion , " the rightwing leader said , adding that their talks centered on the " relaunch of the debate about the eu 's institutional framework " had been " short but intense . " " discussions today did not cover our reservations or the problems , we rather sought out what unites us and what unites european countries , " topolanek added . the document should " bind together and not separate , " topolanek said .
" it should clearly define which competencies the eu has and which fall to the national states , " he said . merkel warned that europe would only be successful when all are pushing in the same direction . president admits views are " kilometers " apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president klaus is at odds with merkel over the charter after meeting with klaus , who also has a reputation as a euro-skeptic , merkel said there was a " common will to forge ahead . " klaus was more reserved .
" it would be wrong to say we shared the same opinion , " he emphasized .
but he admitted that he was impressed with merkel 's knowledge of the region 's history , when she used a comparison to the hussite movement of the 15th century to try to win the leader over to the constitution . merkel , the daughter of a protestant minister , said the czech leader was fighting against the moribund constitution as tenaciously as the bohemian hussite movement , which fought " over every millimeter " of theological territory against dominant roman catholicism of the middle ages . klaus was impressed .
the conservative leader complimented merkel on her excellent knowledge of history , but added that his opposition against a european constitution involved " not just millimeters , but kilometers .

the charter has been on ice since french and dutch voters rejected it in 2005 referendums . the german eu presidency wants to salvage the substance of the treaty as it stands now , but faces strong opposition from the czech republic , and also poland and britain .
all feel the reform is unnecessary , cumbersome and expensive . merkel , putting the best face on the talks , emerged from talks with toploanek on the vexed issue , saying he had " interesting " ideas . topolanek , who has gone on record as dismissing the constitution as a " pile of crap " , had produced " a very interesting framework for future detailed discussion , " merkel said after the prague meeting . czech pm calls for complete rewrite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just a little , but a lot : topolanek wants major changes topolanek put a finer point on it , complimenting merkel 's " courage " to take up the political challenge but warning that a total rewrite was needed for many passages of the document .
he said it would be a mistake to simply try to reduce the scope of the document . " i salute the german approach with regard to the discussion , " the rightwing leader said , adding that their talks centered on the " relaunch of the debate about the eu 's institutional framework " had been " short but intense . " " discussions today did not cover our reservations or the problems , we rather sought out what unites us and what unites european countries , " topolanek added . the document should " bind together and not separate , " topolanek said .
" it should clearly define which competencies the eu has and which fall to the national states , " he said . merkel warned that europe would only be successful when all are pushing in the same direction . president admits views are " kilometers " apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president klaus is at odds with merkel over the charter after meeting with klaus , who also has a reputation as a euro-skeptic , merkel said there was a " common will to forge ahead . " klaus was more reserved .
" it would be wrong to say we shared the same opinion , " he emphasized .
but he admitted that he was impressed with merkel 's knowledge of the region 's history , when she used a comparison to the hussite movement of the 15th century to try to win the leader over to the constitution . merkel , the daughter of a protestant minister , said the czech leader was fighting against the moribund constitution as tenaciously as the bohemian hussite movement , which fought " over every millimeter " of theological territory against dominant roman catholicism of the middle ages . klaus was impressed .
the conservative leader complimented merkel on her excellent knowledge of history , but added that his opposition against a european constitution involved " not just millimeters , but kilometers .

it would be okay if money was involved or the players were expendable - but it 's not and they are n't . the management at bayern munich have consistently said that they are not a selling club .
with crucial months ahead , in which the reigning bundesliga champions will battle to retain their domestic title and face a tough two-leg champions league tie with real madrid , the bayern hierarchy have made it clear that their players are going nowhere . publicly , the bavarian giants are showing a united front .
but behind the scenes , and increasingly in the pages of the sporting press - much to the dismay of the club - a number of players are reported to be casting eyes away from the allianz arena to pastures new at a time when there are major trophies still to play for . midfielder ali karimi looks set to be the first to actually pack his bags after it was revealed that the 28-year-old iranian international has all but sealed a return to former club al ahli dubai before the end of the january transfer window on tuesday . karimi out by february ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali karimi 's happy days at bayern could be over karimi , who arrived on a free transfer from al ahli in 2005 , has been told that when his contract with bayern runs out at the end of the season , it wo n't be renewed .
karimi was expected to become an integral part of the bayern midfield after the departures of thorsten frings and michael ballack but sporadic performances have since eroded the faith the club had placed in him . next on a plane out of germany will be another midfielder , hasan salihamidzic .
the 30-year-old bosnian has signed a four year deal with italian side juventus and will leave on a free transfer at the end of the season when his contract runs out . " the entire package is right , " said salihamidzic , who joined bayern in 1998 from bundesliga rivals sv hamburg .
" i can go abroad once again at 30 and experience something totally new . " bosnian star heading for turin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juventus-bound : hasan salihamidzic salihamidzic , who retired from international soccer last august , has made nearly 300 bundesliga appearances for hamburg and bayern .
he won the 2001 champions league with bayern as well as six league titles and four german cups . with two central players heading for the exit without any fees coming into the club , bayern face having to sell players to finance any purchases in the close season .
the sale of one player that could start the recuperation could be that of prize-possession owen hargreaves , yet another midfielder looking to leave bavaria . hargreaves has been at the center of a bitter transfer wrangle between bayern and english premiership leaders manchester united since his impressive displays with england at the world cup .
the player himself angered his employers by actively and very publicly pursuing a move to old trafford while still under contract .
bayern responded by rebuking hargreaves and slapping a 30-million euro price on his head . hargreaves a red devil by this summer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : owen hargreaves looks destined for manchester united were hoping to capture hargreaves at the start of the season but after coming up against the stone wall that is club manager oli hoeness , the premiership club were said to be prepared to wait until january to make another move .
in the meantime , hargreaves broke a leg in september and the deal looked dead . now , with the midfielder back in training and bayern relenting to a certain extent to the constant pressure from manchester , it looks as though a fit hargreaves could be heading to england in the summer . if hoeness and bayern manage to get their asking price for hargreaves , it would give their transfer kitty a much-needed boost .
but having the funds is not the whole problem .
given the choice of where to go , players looking for a move favour spain 's la liga , the english premiership and italy 's serie a over the bundesliga .
this could see bayern miss out on the man they have ear-marked for the dominant role in their midfield . bayern dream of ribery , robben bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern want franck ribery .
he may have other ideas marseille 's french international franck ribery , another who came out of the world cup with his reputation greatly enhanced , is high on munich 's wish-list .
but with real madrid , arsenal and juventus having made their admiration known , ribery has the pick of top european clubs to choose from .
rumors also suggest that he could stay where he is . bayern have also allegedly offered owen hargreaves to english champions chelsea in the hope of getting dutch winger arjen robben in exchange but prising the 21-year-old flyer away from stamford bridge looks even less likely to happen than the ribery transfer . with a number of players leaving , sebastian deisler and mehmet scholl retiring and only alemmania aachen striker jan schlaudruff confirmed as coming in during the summer , bayern will rapidly have to become a buying club to offset the departures they assure everybody wo n't be happening . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga clubs miss out in international player market german soccer clubs have reported mixed results in attempts to recruit foreign talent for the upcoming 2006-2007 season .

with crucial months ahead , in which the reigning bundesliga champions will battle to retain their domestic title and face a tough two-leg champions league tie with real madrid , the bayern hierarchy have made it clear that their players are going nowhere . publicly , the bavarian giants are showing a united front .
but behind the scenes , and increasingly in the pages of the sporting press - much to the dismay of the club - a number of players are reported to be casting eyes away from the allianz arena to pastures new at a time when there are major trophies still to play for . midfielder ali karimi looks set to be the first to actually pack his bags after it was revealed that the 28-year-old iranian international has all but sealed a return to former club al ahli dubai before the end of the january transfer window on tuesday . karimi out by february ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali karimi 's happy days at bayern could be over karimi , who arrived on a free transfer from al ahli in 2005 , has been told that when his contract with bayern runs out at the end of the season , it wo n't be renewed .
karimi was expected to become an integral part of the bayern midfield after the departures of thorsten frings and michael ballack but sporadic performances have since eroded the faith the club had placed in him . next on a plane out of germany will be another midfielder , hasan salihamidzic .
the 30-year-old bosnian has signed a four year deal with italian side juventus and will leave on a free transfer at the end of the season when his contract runs out . " the entire package is right , " said salihamidzic , who joined bayern in 1998 from bundesliga rivals sv hamburg .
" i can go abroad once again at 30 and experience something totally new . " bosnian star heading for turin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juventus-bound : hasan salihamidzic salihamidzic , who retired from international soccer last august , has made nearly 300 bundesliga appearances for hamburg and bayern .
he won the 2001 champions league with bayern as well as six league titles and four german cups . with two central players heading for the exit without any fees coming into the club , bayern face having to sell players to finance any purchases in the close season .
the sale of one player that could start the recuperation could be that of prize-possession owen hargreaves , yet another midfielder looking to leave bavaria . hargreaves has been at the center of a bitter transfer wrangle between bayern and english premiership leaders manchester united since his impressive displays with england at the world cup .
the player himself angered his employers by actively and very publicly pursuing a move to old trafford while still under contract .
bayern responded by rebuking hargreaves and slapping a 30-million euro price on his head . hargreaves a red devil by this summer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : owen hargreaves looks destined for manchester united were hoping to capture hargreaves at the start of the season but after coming up against the stone wall that is club manager oli hoeness , the premiership club were said to be prepared to wait until january to make another move .
in the meantime , hargreaves broke a leg in september and the deal looked dead . now , with the midfielder back in training and bayern relenting to a certain extent to the constant pressure from manchester , it looks as though a fit hargreaves could be heading to england in the summer . if hoeness and bayern manage to get their asking price for hargreaves , it would give their transfer kitty a much-needed boost .
but having the funds is not the whole problem .
given the choice of where to go , players looking for a move favour spain 's la liga , the english premiership and italy 's serie a over the bundesliga .
this could see bayern miss out on the man they have ear-marked for the dominant role in their midfield . bayern dream of ribery , robben bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern want franck ribery .
he may have other ideas marseille 's french international franck ribery , another who came out of the world cup with his reputation greatly enhanced , is high on munich 's wish-list .
but with real madrid , arsenal and juventus having made their admiration known , ribery has the pick of top european clubs to choose from .
rumors also suggest that he could stay where he is . bayern have also allegedly offered owen hargreaves to english champions chelsea in the hope of getting dutch winger arjen robben in exchange but prising the 21-year-old flyer away from stamford bridge looks even less likely to happen than the ribery transfer . with a number of players leaving , sebastian deisler and mehmet scholl retiring and only alemmania aachen striker jan schlaudruff confirmed as coming in during the summer , bayern will rapidly have to become a buying club to offset the departures they assure everybody wo n't be happening . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga clubs miss out in international player market german soccer clubs have reported mixed results in attempts to recruit foreign talent for the upcoming 2006-2007 season .

no loopholes , " said mandelson . doha talks needed to avoid economic crisis the round of negotiations launched by the wto members in the qatari capital doha in 2001 aims to reduce down trade barriers for the benefit of poor countries . it has been riven with cross-cutting disagreements about the extent of cuts in farm subsidies and import tariffs , largely holding up faltering attempts to break down barriers to industrial and services trade . european central bank chief jean claude trichet said here saturday that any failure to complete the doha round would jeopardize the world economy . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stalled wto talks expected to move forward at davos at the world economic forum at davos , many are eagerly awaiting signals of a revival of the doha round of world trade organization trade talks that were stalled last year .

the charter has been on ice since french and dutch voters rejected it in 2005 referendums . the german eu presidency wants to salvage the substance of the treaty as it stands now , but faces strong opposition from the czech republic , and also poland and britain .
all feel the reform is unnecessary , cumbersome and expensive . merkel , putting the best face on the talks , emerged from talks with toploanek on the vexed issue , saying he had " interesting " ideas . topolanek , who has gone on record as dismissing the constitution as a " pile of crap " , had produced " a very interesting framework for future detailed discussion , " merkel said after the prague meeting . czech pm calls for complete rewrite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just a little , but a lot : topolanek wants major changes topolanek put a finer point on it , complimenting merkel 's " courage " to take up the political challenge but warning that a total rewrite was needed for many passages of the document .
he said it would be a mistake to simply try to reduce the scope of the document . " i salute the german approach with regard to the discussion , " the rightwing leader said , adding that their talks centered on the " relaunch of the debate about the eu 's institutional framework " had been " short but intense . " " discussions today did not cover our reservations or the problems , we rather sought out what unites us and what unites european countries , " topolanek added . the document should " bind together and not separate , " topolanek said .
" it should clearly define which competencies the eu has and which fall to the national states , " he said . merkel warned that europe would only be successful when all are pushing in the same direction . president admits views are " kilometers " apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president klaus is at odds with merkel over the charter after meeting with klaus , who also has a reputation as a euro-skeptic , merkel said there was a " common will to forge ahead . " klaus was more reserved .
" it would be wrong to say we shared the same opinion , " he emphasized .
but he admitted that he was impressed with merkel 's knowledge of the region 's history , when she used a comparison to the hussite movement of the 15th century to try to win the leader over to the constitution . merkel , the daughter of a protestant minister , said the czech leader was fighting against the moribund constitution as tenaciously as the bohemian hussite movement , which fought " over every millimeter " of theological territory against dominant roman catholicism of the middle ages . klaus was impressed .
the conservative leader complimented merkel on her excellent knowledge of history , but added that his opposition against a european constitution involved " not just millimeters , but kilometers .

they appear to curtail the freedom of randomly chosen parts of society , such as people with freckles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague 's wenceslas square " people with blonde hair are not permitted to enter cinemas , " reads one in the city 's central wenceslas square .

" of course they are in czech and not in german as they would have been in those days , " he said .
" but the form , the shape , the letters , the typeface , the colours - we just tried to stay as authentic as possible . " the posters are black with the " rules , " such as " left-handed people are forbidden to drive motor vehicles and within fourteen days have to give up their driving licence " written on them in yellow . at the bottom of the poster follows a little explainer . " does it seem absurd to you ? " it reads .
" the prohibition on motor vehicles was applied in the whole protectorate of bohemia and moravia for jewish people during the war . " a per sonal touch binar , who approached the museum with the idea for the campaign , said young czechs today are largely ignorant of the horrors of the past .
but is this true ? " i do n't think so , " said matej , a student at prague 's jewish secondary school .
" people in prague are interested in this issue ; they are trying to know more about our history , the history of the jews .
and also roma - the roma had the same holocaust like jews , the same repression . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone is meant to be able to identify with the posters he added that the style of the poster also worked in his opinion . " these posters are addressing normal people , " he said .
" when you look at the poster and you see something about bald people , blonde people - they are among us .
it touches us personally . " the new campaign has been timed to coincide with holocaust memorial day on jan .

" does it seem absurd to you ? " it reads .
" the prohibition on motor vehicles was applied in the whole protectorate of bohemia and moravia for jewish people during the war . " a per sonal touch binar , who approached the museum with the idea for the campaign , said young czechs today are largely ignorant of the horrors of the past .
but is this true ? " i do n't think so , " said matej , a student at prague 's jewish secondary school .

an extension of the passenger data exchange deal between the eu and the us seems likely . during a visit to berlin on friday , us homeland security secretary michael chertoff and his host , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , discussed the impact of a deal struck between the us and the european last year which gives american law enforcement agencies easier access to air passenger data . the agreement applies only until july 2007 and a long-term accord will have to be hammered out soon .

it allows us security agencies to get hold of and analyze data of european air passengers headed for the us . airlines have to make available passengers ’ addresses , telephone numbers , credit card details , e-mails and other information to help identify suspicious travelers at the earliest possible stage .

" the americans hope that such an accord can be coupled with an even more efficient use of the data made available .
this is something that we can live with .
we do not need more data input , but a more efficient analysis of what ’ s available already .
citizens should have no objections to that , because everyone should have an interest in enjoying greater security during passenger flights . " both germany and the united states agree that data protection standards must not be sacrificed in the fight against cross-border terrorism .

an extension of the passenger data exchange deal between the eu and the us seems likely . during a visit to berlin on friday , us homeland security secretary michael chertoff and his host , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , discussed the impact of a deal struck between the us and the european last year which gives american law enforcement agencies easier access to air passenger data . the agreement applies only until july 2007 and a long-term accord will have to be hammered out soon .
the two men also debated the need to harmonize data protection standards .
european fears of insufficient us standard had been high in the run-up to the signing of the agreement on the delivery of passenger data by european airlines . schäuble said his talks with chertoff centered on ways of intensifying the exchange of security-relevant data between germany and the united states .
he called that a top priority in the fight against organized crime and international terrorism . schäuble and chertoff were agreed that present-day threats made it necessary to focus even more on crime prevention .
the us homeland security chief had just come from the world economic forum at davos , switzerland , where he also talked about the security dangers of the 21st century . us chief praises efforts so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeland security secretary michael chertoff chertoff spoke about the potential ability of even a single individual or small group to use technology with the sort of destruction that would have been unthinkable a century ago .
he said in berlin that " you can ’ t put that genie back in the bottle once a nuclear bomb or another weapon of mass destruction gets into the hands of a terrorist . " chertoff praised the usefulness of the data deal between the united states and the european union struck in october of last year .
it allows us security agencies to get hold of and analyze data of european air passengers headed for the us . airlines have to make available passengers ’ addresses , telephone numbers , credit card details , e-mails and other information to help identify suspicious travelers at the earliest possible stage .
information that may point to passengers ’ religious denominations must not be passed on in line with european data protection and anti-discrimination standards . germany , which currently holds the eu presidency , has the responsibility to extend the current deal past july of this year and turn that the agreement into a longer-term accord , schäuble said . schäuble predicts greater security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister wolfgang schäuble " of course , the european union has in interest in reaching a long-term agreement , " he said .
" the americans hope that such an accord can be coupled with an even more efficient use of the data made available .
this is something that we can live with .
we do not need more data input , but a more efficient analysis of what ’ s available already .
citizens should have no objections to that , because everyone should have an interest in enjoying greater security during passenger flights . " both germany and the united states agree that data protection standards must not be sacrificed in the fight against cross-border terrorism .
there are however different views on just how strict relevant regulations should be . a german-us working group is to look into ways of harmonizing national data protection laws . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european union and us reach air passenger data deal eu and us negotiators have reached a deal on providing information about airline passengers traveling to the united states .
diplomats said the agreement came after marathon talks that began late thursday .
-lrb- 06.10.2006 -rrb- eu , us still divided over passenger data deal as deadline passes eu and us officials were hoping sunday to avoid a legal vacuum threatening to disrupt transatlantic travel after failing to reach agreement on the transfer of airline passenger data before a court deadline passed .
-lrb- 01.10.2006 -rrb- air passenger data transfers to us illegal , eu court rules the european union 's decision two years ago to allow transfers of airline passenger data to the united states was illegal , the eu 's top court ruled tuesday .
the us said the data was needed to fight terrorism .

the charter has been on ice since french and dutch voters rejected it in 2005 referendums . the german eu presidency wants to salvage the substance of the treaty as it stands now , but faces strong opposition from the czech republic , and also poland and britain .
all feel the reform is unnecessary , cumbersome and expensive . merkel , putting the best face on the talks , emerged from talks with toploanek on the vexed issue , saying he had " interesting " ideas . topolanek , who has gone on record as dismissing the constitution as a " pile of crap " , had produced " a very interesting framework for future detailed discussion , " merkel said after the prague meeting . czech pm calls for complete rewrite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just a little , but a lot : topolanek wants major changes topolanek put a finer point on it , complimenting merkel 's " courage " to take up the political challenge but warning that a total rewrite was needed for many passages of the document .
he said it would be a mistake to simply try to reduce the scope of the document .

" " discussions today did not cover our reservations or the problems , we rather sought out what unites us and what unites european countries , " topolanek added . the document should " bind together and not separate , " topolanek said .
" it should clearly define which competencies the eu has and which fall to the national states , " he said . merkel warned that europe would only be successful when all are pushing in the same direction . president admits views are " kilometers " apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president klaus is at odds with merkel over the charter after meeting with klaus , who also has a reputation as a euro-skeptic , merkel said there was a " common will to forge ahead .

but he admitted that he was impressed with merkel 's knowledge of the region 's history , when she used a comparison to the hussite movement of the 15th century to try to win the leader over to the constitution . merkel , the daughter of a protestant minister , said the czech leader was fighting against the moribund constitution as tenaciously as the bohemian hussite movement , which fought " over every millimeter " of theological territory against dominant roman catholicism of the middle ages . klaus was impressed .

" they expressed a strong wish for a quick resumption of full scale activity in geneva , " the ministry , which hosted the gathering with world trade organization chief pascal lamy , said in a statement . " the clear signal for the resumption of full scale negotiations in geneva got strong support from political leaders and the business community gathered in davos , " the statement added . the meeting of the select group of wto members on the sidelines of the world economic forum was aimed at finding a way forward for the five-year-old talks which broke down in acrimony last july . " we must tell the world that the doha round is not dead , " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson told journalists . director general lamy suspended the negotiations at wto headquarters in geneva in the summer because of the persistent deadlock between the european union , the united states and developing countries over trade tariffs . decisions in the wto must be taken with the approval of all 150 members . american offer needed to avoid repeat collapse lamy said he did not expect the negotiations to take the same course that led to their breakdown in 2006 and highlighted " clear " signs of commitment . " we 'll need a new american offer on agricultural subsidies , a new one from the eu in agricultural tariffs and new indo-brazilian offer on industrial goods and services , " the wto chief said after the meeting . mandelson called on all those involved to show flexibility in the coming months and raised the prospect of a " no loopholes " concession to cut eu import tariffs for farm produce . lamy signaled that an offer from the united states was on the horizon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lula said his country was ready to give ground in recent days , key countries including india and the united states had played down hopes of an immediate breakthrough , although they hinted at some progress in informal bilateral meetings in recent weeks . brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva , an influential member of the g20 group of developing countries in the wto , said during an appearance at the forum that brazil was willing to make concessions . however , he was only ready to persuade the g20 to accept a deal if the eu and united states bridged their gap over farm subsidies and tariffs first . eu singing from different song sheets on agriculture in the european union , the french government in particular has insisted that the eu should not make any new offer to reduce import tariffs on farm products , a key bone of contention with the united states and developing nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson wants a cohesive eu stance mandelson said saturday that the eu was ready to improve its offer on agriculture " in the right circumstances " , to move closer to the demands of the g20 .
he suggested others needed to offer concessions on industrial goods and services . " every key player will need to show new commitments and new flexibilities including on nama -lrb- non agricultural market access -rrb- and services , " he added . the eu has been asking emerging economies in particular for better offers in those areas in return for freer access to the union 's huge consumer market for their imported farm produce . " we are ready to do this in a way that demonstrably gives new market access to all exporters and all products .
no loopholes , " said mandelson . doha talks needed to avoid economic crisis the round of negotiations launched by the wto members in the qatari capital doha in 2001 aims to reduce down trade barriers for the benefit of poor countries . it has been riven with cross-cutting disagreements about the extent of cuts in farm subsidies and import tariffs , largely holding up faltering attempts to break down barriers to industrial and services trade . european central bank chief jean claude trichet said here saturday that any failure to complete the doha round would jeopardize the world economy . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stalled wto talks expected to move forward at davos at the world economic forum at davos , many are eagerly awaiting signals of a revival of the doha round of world trade organization trade talks that were stalled last year .

" they expressed a strong wish for a quick resumption of full scale activity in geneva , " the ministry , which hosted the gathering with world trade organization chief pascal lamy , said in a statement . " the clear signal for the resumption of full scale negotiations in geneva got strong support from political leaders and the business community gathered in davos , " the statement added . the meeting of the select group of wto members on the sidelines of the world economic forum was aimed at finding a way forward for the five-year-old talks which broke down in acrimony last july . " we must tell the world that the doha round is not dead , " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson told journalists . director general lamy suspended the negotiations at wto headquarters in geneva in the summer because of the persistent deadlock between the european union , the united states and developing countries over trade tariffs . decisions in the wto must be taken with the approval of all 150 members . american offer needed to avoid repeat collapse lamy said he did not expect the negotiations to take the same course that led to their breakdown in 2006 and highlighted " clear " signs of commitment . " we 'll need a new american offer on agricultural subsidies , a new one from the eu in agricultural tariffs and new indo-brazilian offer on industrial goods and services , " the wto chief said after the meeting . mandelson called on all those involved to show flexibility in the coming months and raised the prospect of a " no loopholes " concession to cut eu import tariffs for farm produce . lamy signaled that an offer from the united states was on the horizon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lula said his country was ready to give ground in recent days , key countries including india and the united states had played down hopes of an immediate breakthrough , although they hinted at some progress in informal bilateral meetings in recent weeks . brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva , an influential member of the g20 group of developing countries in the wto , said during an appearance at the forum that brazil was willing to make concessions . however , he was only ready to persuade the g20 to accept a deal if the eu and united states bridged their gap over farm subsidies and tariffs first . eu singing from different song sheets on agriculture in the european union , the french government in particular has insisted that the eu should not make any new offer to reduce import tariffs on farm products , a key bone of contention with the united states and developing nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson wants a cohesive eu stance mandelson said saturday that the eu was ready to improve its offer on agriculture " in the right circumstances " , to move closer to the demands of the g20 .
he suggested others needed to offer concessions on industrial goods and services . " every key player will need to show new commitments and new flexibilities including on nama -lrb- non agricultural market access -rrb- and services , " he added . the eu has been asking emerging economies in particular for better offers in those areas in return for freer access to the union 's huge consumer market for their imported farm produce . " we are ready to do this in a way that demonstrably gives new market access to all exporters and all products .
no loopholes , " said mandelson . doha talks needed to avoid economic crisis the round of negotiations launched by the wto members in the qatari capital doha in 2001 aims to reduce down trade barriers for the benefit of poor countries . it has been riven with cross-cutting disagreements about the extent of cuts in farm subsidies and import tariffs , largely holding up faltering attempts to break down barriers to industrial and services trade . european central bank chief jean claude trichet said here saturday that any failure to complete the doha round would jeopardize the world economy . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stalled wto talks expected to move forward at davos at the world economic forum at davos , many are eagerly awaiting signals of a revival of the doha round of world trade organization trade talks that were stalled last year .

but as once-futuristic industries emerge as real moneymakers , germans have more to worry about than losing their talent to the us . when news broke late last year that discount super market chain penny markt was selling genetically-modified rice , german consumers sounded the alarm . german officials responded by saying they will use their six month presidency of the european union to take a look at the rules concerning biotech research and development in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 60 percent of corn in the us is genetically modified but while europeans are wringing their hands over those developments , 90 percent of soybeans grown in the u.s. are now genetically modified , as is 60 percent of corn . it ’ s no surprise then that germany trails far behind the united states in bio-engineering and biotechnology .
but the problem is , that in the next century , it ’ s industries just like biotech that will be driving the world ’ s economy . so how is germany planning to keep up ? knowing where to invest is key peter strüven , senior vice president of the boston consulting group in germany , has just finished an annual study of how germany can thrive in the development of ‘ future technologies . ’ " first of all , if we look at the size of germany , and the resources we have , we are doing enormously well , " said strüven .
" in many areas we are the market leader world wide . " strüven found that germany doesn ’ t have the resources the us and japan do , so the country simply can ’ t try to invest in everything .
he suggests germany will do best when it stops throwing good money at areas where there 's no point competing . the consulting firm ernst and young says the us biotech industry employs 200,000 workers and spent more than 15 billion euros on research and development last year alone . compared to that , germany ’ s 2006 investment in biotech was expected to be less than 150 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has fallen behind in biotechnology and a may report from the european association for bio-industries in brussels says many of europe 's 2,000 biotech companies need much more money if they ’ re going to be able to grow . but strüven said it ’ s better for germany to cut its losses in a field where it isn ’ t booming , and to move on .
just like it did , when it stopped trying to compete with asia in digital and consumer electronics . " we will not gain in consumer electronics and we would not suggest to do that . we were so far behind in consumer electronics that it wasn ’ t worth it to compete , " said strüven .
" what we are suggesting is that we focus on the existing industries where we have an advantage , like automotive or mechanical future technologies . " germany ’ s innovative car business , for example , can help it lead the way in other fields such as robotics or eco-technology or larger-scale engineering . " see , you have the first order technologies like cars and aerospace .
and then you have the supporting technologies that help those main products go , " said strüven .
" those supporting technologies are the ones that foster innovation . " getting the brightest to stay another problem for germany is to keep its brightest minds from flooding to the us where better opportunities beckon .
american science magazine recently reported that every seventh person with a doctorate in science leaves germany for the united states . " the job market here is tight .
there are not a lot of jobs .
one thought of mine was to go visit the us and work there , " said malta , a first-year student at berlin 's technical university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's best brains usually opt to go abroad once they 've finished studying malta and his friend halit said they are worried that germany is too focused on the here-and-now and say the country doesn ’ t invest enough in future industries like nano-technology . nano-technology will revolutionize the way buildings and building materials are constructed , halit said .
he added he wants to work where the best , most futuristic and most lucrative work is being done . " the united states has more potential , in the economic view .
so job prospects in the states may be better at this time , " he said .
" on the other hand we want to enjoy the american way of living . " focusing on germany 's strengths boston consulting group ’ s peter strüven said that ’ s exactly why germany needs to take its limited resources and focus investment on things that will help germany keep , and attract , the smartest people . " we will be able to stop that , if we focus more and are able to improve the conditions under which our researchers can work here , " strüven said .
" if we can provide them with similar and comparable positions , they will stay .
they do n't want to leave because they do n't like germany . " strüven acknowledged that germany may not have the famed silicon valley of california or the sparkling new skyscrapers of shanghai . but he says german cities and german technology both have their own claims to fame .
and investors need to focus on those . ethan lindsey -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : germany plans to boost funding for it sector german chancellor angela merkel is expected to announce monday at the country 's first it summit that her government plans to fund the sector with 1.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 billion -rrb- over three years , according to a report .

the charter has been on ice since french and dutch voters rejected it in 2005 referendums . the german eu presidency wants to salvage the substance of the treaty as it stands now , but faces strong opposition from the czech republic , and also poland and britain .
all feel the reform is unnecessary , cumbersome and expensive . merkel , putting the best face on the talks , emerged from talks with toploanek on the vexed issue , saying he had " interesting " ideas . topolanek , who has gone on record as dismissing the constitution as a " pile of crap " , had produced " a very interesting framework for future detailed discussion , " merkel said after the prague meeting . czech pm calls for complete rewrite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just a little , but a lot : topolanek wants major changes topolanek put a finer point on it , complimenting merkel 's " courage " to take up the political challenge but warning that a total rewrite was needed for many passages of the document .
he said it would be a mistake to simply try to reduce the scope of the document . " i salute the german approach with regard to the discussion , " the rightwing leader said , adding that their talks centered on the " relaunch of the debate about the eu 's institutional framework " had been " short but intense . " " discussions today did not cover our reservations or the problems , we rather sought out what unites us and what unites european countries , " topolanek added . the document should " bind together and not separate , " topolanek said .
" it should clearly define which competencies the eu has and which fall to the national states , " he said . merkel warned that europe would only be successful when all are pushing in the same direction . president admits views are " kilometers " apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president klaus is at odds with merkel over the charter after meeting with klaus , who also has a reputation as a euro-skeptic , merkel said there was a " common will to forge ahead . " klaus was more reserved .
" it would be wrong to say we shared the same opinion , " he emphasized .
but he admitted that he was impressed with merkel 's knowledge of the region 's history , when she used a comparison to the hussite movement of the 15th century to try to win the leader over to the constitution . merkel , the daughter of a protestant minister , said the czech leader was fighting against the moribund constitution as tenaciously as the bohemian hussite movement , which fought " over every millimeter " of theological territory against dominant roman catholicism of the middle ages . klaus was impressed .
the conservative leader complimented merkel on her excellent knowledge of history , but added that his opposition against a european constitution involved " not just millimeters , but kilometers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 27.01.2007 eu , us move closer to permanent deal of passenger data großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu passengers are likely to have their data passed to the us past the july deadline german interior minister wolfgang schäuble and us homeland security secretary michael chertoff met in berlin friday .
an extension of the passenger data exchange deal between the eu and the us seems likely . during a visit to berlin on friday , us homeland security secretary michael chertoff and his host , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , discussed the impact of a deal struck between the us and the european last year which gives american law enforcement agencies easier access to air passenger data . the agreement applies only until july 2007 and a long-term accord will have to be hammered out soon .
the two men also debated the need to harmonize data protection standards .
european fears of insufficient us standard had been high in the run-up to the signing of the agreement on the delivery of passenger data by european airlines . schäuble said his talks with chertoff centered on ways of intensifying the exchange of security-relevant data between germany and the united states .
he called that a top priority in the fight against organized crime and international terrorism . schäuble and chertoff were agreed that present-day threats made it necessary to focus even more on crime prevention .
the us homeland security chief had just come from the world economic forum at davos , switzerland , where he also talked about the security dangers of the 21st century . us chief praises efforts so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeland security secretary michael chertoff chertoff spoke about the potential ability of even a single individual or small group to use technology with the sort of destruction that would have been unthinkable a century ago .
he said in berlin that " you can ’ t put that genie back in the bottle once a nuclear bomb or another weapon of mass destruction gets into the hands of a terrorist . " chertoff praised the usefulness of the data deal between the united states and the european union struck in october of last year .
it allows us security agencies to get hold of and analyze data of european air passengers headed for the us . airlines have to make available passengers ’ addresses , telephone numbers , credit card details , e-mails and other information to help identify suspicious travelers at the earliest possible stage .
information that may point to passengers ’ religious denominations must not be passed on in line with european data protection and anti-discrimination standards . germany , which currently holds the eu presidency , has the responsibility to extend the current deal past july of this year and turn that the agreement into a longer-term accord , schäuble said . schäuble predicts greater security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister wolfgang schäuble " of course , the european union has in interest in reaching a long-term agreement , " he said .
" the americans hope that such an accord can be coupled with an even more efficient use of the data made available .
this is something that we can live with .
we do not need more data input , but a more efficient analysis of what ’ s available already .
citizens should have no objections to that , because everyone should have an interest in enjoying greater security during passenger flights . " both germany and the united states agree that data protection standards must not be sacrificed in the fight against cross-border terrorism .
there are however different views on just how strict relevant regulations should be . a german-us working group is to look into ways of harmonizing national data protection laws . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european union and us reach air passenger data deal eu and us negotiators have reached a deal on providing information about airline passengers traveling to the united states .
diplomats said the agreement came after marathon talks that began late thursday .
-lrb- 06.10.2006 -rrb- eu , us still divided over passenger data deal as deadline passes eu and us officials were hoping sunday to avoid a legal vacuum threatening to disrupt transatlantic travel after failing to reach agreement on the transfer of airline passenger data before a court deadline passed .

an extension of the passenger data exchange deal between the eu and the us seems likely . during a visit to berlin on friday , us homeland security secretary michael chertoff and his host , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , discussed the impact of a deal struck between the us and the european last year which gives american law enforcement agencies easier access to air passenger data . the agreement applies only until july 2007 and a long-term accord will have to be hammered out soon .

" the americans hope that such an accord can be coupled with an even more efficient use of the data made available .

an extension of the passenger data exchange deal between the eu and the us seems likely . during a visit to berlin on friday , us homeland security secretary michael chertoff and his host , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , discussed the impact of a deal struck between the us and the european last year which gives american law enforcement agencies easier access to air passenger data . the agreement applies only until july 2007 and a long-term accord will have to be hammered out soon .
the two men also debated the need to harmonize data protection standards .
european fears of insufficient us standard had been high in the run-up to the signing of the agreement on the delivery of passenger data by european airlines . schäuble said his talks with chertoff centered on ways of intensifying the exchange of security-relevant data between germany and the united states .
he called that a top priority in the fight against organized crime and international terrorism . schäuble and chertoff were agreed that present-day threats made it necessary to focus even more on crime prevention .
the us homeland security chief had just come from the world economic forum at davos , switzerland , where he also talked about the security dangers of the 21st century . us chief praises efforts so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeland security secretary michael chertoff chertoff spoke about the potential ability of even a single individual or small group to use technology with the sort of destruction that would have been unthinkable a century ago .
he said in berlin that " you can ’ t put that genie back in the bottle once a nuclear bomb or another weapon of mass destruction gets into the hands of a terrorist . " chertoff praised the usefulness of the data deal between the united states and the european union struck in october of last year .
it allows us security agencies to get hold of and analyze data of european air passengers headed for the us . airlines have to make available passengers ’ addresses , telephone numbers , credit card details , e-mails and other information to help identify suspicious travelers at the earliest possible stage .
information that may point to passengers ’ religious denominations must not be passed on in line with european data protection and anti-discrimination standards . germany , which currently holds the eu presidency , has the responsibility to extend the current deal past july of this year and turn that the agreement into a longer-term accord , schäuble said . schäuble predicts greater security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister wolfgang schäuble " of course , the european union has in interest in reaching a long-term agreement , " he said .
" the americans hope that such an accord can be coupled with an even more efficient use of the data made available .
this is something that we can live with .
we do not need more data input , but a more efficient analysis of what ’ s available already .
citizens should have no objections to that , because everyone should have an interest in enjoying greater security during passenger flights . " both germany and the united states agree that data protection standards must not be sacrificed in the fight against cross-border terrorism .
there are however different views on just how strict relevant regulations should be . a german-us working group is to look into ways of harmonizing national data protection laws . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european union and us reach air passenger data deal eu and us negotiators have reached a deal on providing information about airline passengers traveling to the united states .
diplomats said the agreement came after marathon talks that began late thursday .
-lrb- 06.10.2006 -rrb- eu , us still divided over passenger data deal as deadline passes eu and us officials were hoping sunday to avoid a legal vacuum threatening to disrupt transatlantic travel after failing to reach agreement on the transfer of airline passenger data before a court deadline passed .
-lrb- 01.10.2006 -rrb- air passenger data transfers to us illegal , eu court rules the european union 's decision two years ago to allow transfers of airline passenger data to the united states was illegal , the eu 's top court ruled tuesday .

" i believe we can get a breakthrough on the big numbers in agriculture and industrial goods in the next month or so , " the european trade commissioner told the financial times newspaper .
" the agricultural consultations between the eu and the us are through the worst .
we are approaching the endgame in that regard . " about 30 trade ministers will get together to discuss the doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks which was suspended last july because of differences between the european union , the united states and emerging countries . hopes of an agreement in the snowy swiss mountains have been played down but some such as german chancellor angela merkel whose country holds the rotating g-8 and eu presidencies remain hopeful that major progress in the five-year-old round of talks could be made shortly . " the chance for success is undoubtedly there , " she told reporters .
" i think that all the players have to be ready to exhibit a bit more flexibility . " bridging differences more than 60 chief executives and chairmen have stepped up the pressure on trade chiefs by issuing a joint statement urging leaders in rich and poor nations to bridge their differences within weeks . bildunterschrift : almost 3,000 people from 90 countries are in davos " we are united in our concern that failure to restart the doha round discussions immediately and conclude them within the next six months will seriously damage the global community , " said an endorsed statement from the international business council , issued at the davos meeting . the doha round was suspended by wto director-general pascal lamy in july following five years of acrimonious meetings . the round , which aims to break down trade barriers for the benefit of developing countries , is blocked because of differences between the eu and the united states on farm issues , and discord between rich and poor countries about trade in industrial products and services . " agriculture is holding up everything " one wto official told reporters .
" when that gets done , other dominoes have to fall into place fairly quickly . " us pessimistic us trade representative susan schwab appeared to be more pessimistic about a breakthrough than mandelson . " i do n't think we 're looking at a breakthrough in the near term , " the senior us trade official told afp .
" but i think we 're making some progress and some of the key players really are engaging - brazil , the eu , the united states and other countries - and that makes me cautiously optimistic that we are laying the groundwork for a breakthrough . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is optimistic over the talks the major players in the trade talks - schwab , mandelson and emerging country representatives indian industry minister kamal nath and brazilian foreign minister celso amorim - were all in davos for the world economic forum as of friday . " at the moment , we are not even on the road so we have to get back on it again and make a map for the future so that we start to reengage the wto again , " nath told dw-radio . roadblocks from congress some believe the most that can be hoped for at the saturday meeting is that the wto 's lamy relaunches formal negotiations , making the talks active again . lamy has said he is also looking for a signal from leading nations of their readiness to begin again . even if a final agreement were reached , it would require political approval and would likely face opposition in the current climate , analysts say . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel commits eu to mid-east peace in davos talks with abbas german chancellor angela merkel confirmed the eu 's commitment to middle east peace in talks with palestinian president mahmoud abbas in davos thursday .

" i believe we can get a breakthrough on the big numbers in agriculture and industrial goods in the next month or so , " the european trade commissioner told the financial times newspaper .
" the agricultural consultations between the eu and the us are through the worst .
we are approaching the endgame in that regard . " about 30 trade ministers will get together to discuss the doha round of world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- talks which was suspended last july because of differences between the european union , the united states and emerging countries . hopes of an agreement in the snowy swiss mountains have been played down but some such as german chancellor angela merkel whose country holds the rotating g-8 and eu presidencies remain hopeful that major progress in the five-year-old round of talks could be made shortly . " the chance for success is undoubtedly there , " she told reporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 27.01.2007 merkel makes little headway in charter talks with czech leaders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech prime minister topolanek is still not convinced , despite merkel 's best efforts despite efforts by german chancellor angela merkel friday , czech leaders were still not convinced to support the new , currently moribund european constitution . czech prime minister mirek topolanek insisted to reporters that " the document must be more understandable for people , " and said the czech republic would not stand for a quick-fix solution at the cost of quality . czech president vaclav klaus advocated " smaller steps " in the direction of a constitution , and said the current draft was still " kilometers " away from what the czech republic would accept . merkel 's visit to prague was within the framework of the german eu presidency 's desire to rescue the constitution .
the charter has been on ice since french and dutch voters rejected it in 2005 referendums . the german eu presidency wants to salvage the substance of the treaty as it stands now , but faces strong opposition from the czech republic , and also poland and britain .
all feel the reform is unnecessary , cumbersome and expensive . merkel , putting the best face on the talks , emerged from talks with toploanek on the vexed issue , saying he had " interesting " ideas . topolanek , who has gone on record as dismissing the constitution as a " pile of crap " , had produced " a very interesting framework for future detailed discussion , " merkel said after the prague meeting . czech pm calls for complete rewrite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just a little , but a lot : topolanek wants major changes topolanek put a finer point on it , complimenting merkel 's " courage " to take up the political challenge but warning that a total rewrite was needed for many passages of the document .
he said it would be a mistake to simply try to reduce the scope of the document . " i salute the german approach with regard to the discussion , " the rightwing leader said , adding that their talks centered on the " relaunch of the debate about the eu 's institutional framework " had been " short but intense . " " discussions today did not cover our reservations or the problems , we rather sought out what unites us and what unites european countries , " topolanek added . the document should " bind together and not separate , " topolanek said .
" it should clearly define which competencies the eu has and which fall to the national states , " he said . merkel warned that europe would only be successful when all are pushing in the same direction . president admits views are " kilometers " apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president klaus is at odds with merkel over the charter after meeting with klaus , who also has a reputation as a euro-skeptic , merkel said there was a " common will to forge ahead . " klaus was more reserved .

but as once-futuristic industries emerge as real moneymakers , germans have more to worry about than losing their talent to the us . when news broke late last year that discount super market chain penny markt was selling genetically-modified rice , german consumers sounded the alarm . german officials responded by saying they will use their six month presidency of the european union to take a look at the rules concerning biotech research and development in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 60 percent of corn in the us is genetically modified but while europeans are wringing their hands over those developments , 90 percent of soybeans grown in the u.s. are now genetically modified , as is 60 percent of corn . it ’ s no surprise then that germany trails far behind the united states in bio-engineering and biotechnology .

" pulitzbrücke was the former railway station used during world war ii for the deportation of berlin 's jews to concentration camps . chancellor angela merkel urged " all courageous democrats " to fight the rise of the far-right and anti-semitism in modern germany as the country remembered the victims of the holocaust . a few supporters of the extremist national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- demonstrated outside a meeting of merkel 's conservative christian democrats in frankfurt an der oder on the polish border where the chancellor was speaking .
" the npd must be fought by all courageous democrats , and i thank all those who commit themselves to this , " merkel told delegates inside . the npd demonstrators were met by a larger number of counter-protesters . among other holocaust memorial activities set to take place around germany , the government of the state of saxony anhalt was holding a ceremony in salzwedel .
the main ceremony in mecklenburg-western pomerania was set for the town of malchow . the prime minister of brandenburg state , matthias platzeck of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , is to attend a ceremony at the sachsenhausen memorial site near oranienburg . holocaust memorial day will also feature saturday afternoon in soccer league announcements and in reports by club magazines . never forget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marking the holocaust should serve as a lesson meanwhile in brussels , the president of the european parliament , hans-gert pöttering , said , " we must never forget this abominable and tremendously painful side of this continent 's history . ' the crimes committed by the nazis must be remembered by future generations as a warning against a genocide which should never be repeated , " he said . pöttering , the newly-elected parliamentary president , added : " on this day , we remember the millions of victims of the holocaust , the murder of six million jews as well as roma , poles , russians and people of other nationalities . continuing the fight against intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe still struggles with its painful and shameful past " the holocaust memorial day is a day on which we most sharply condemn intolerance and animosity towards other religions and races and every form of anti-semitism , " he said . the highest measure of political conduct for the european union is the respect of every person 's dignity and human rights throughout the world , pöttering added . german jews start campaign germany 's jewish community launched a campaign of full-page newspaper advertisements saturday to stress the importance of the holocaust memorial day and to attack efforts by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad to deny it . the advertisements by the central council of german jews warned against the threat emanating from ahmadinejad , who has stirred controversy with remarks referring to the holocaust as a " legend . " ahmadinejad had " many times denied the systematic disfranchisement , deportation and factory-scale annihilation of millions of european jews , " the advertisement said . it said that the nuclear program pursued by ahmadinejad and his regime of mullahs posed a " threat not only to the middle east but the entire world " and demanded that the german government should make no compromises with iran regarding the issue of atomic weapons . holocaust memorial day was established in 1996 by former german president roman herzog as a day of remembrance for the victims of national socialism .

it was the second blank for germany 's world cup holders . the hosts came out fighting against the world number two in the opening exchanges and then held firm as germany , with six changes from the side that drew 0-0 against the united states , got into their stride . germany missed a good chance six minutes into the second half when fatmire bajramaj wasted midfielder conny pohlers ' pinpoint low cross from the right . han wenxia denied pohlers another goal-bound drive in the 61st minute when she blocked the close shot inside the box with her legs . chances go begging for both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany were left to chase the game against the hosts china then went close to breaking the deadlock in the 67th minute when forward liu sa picked up a fine lobbed pass but facing the outrushing stephanie ullrich had her shot parried out . in other action sunday england drew 1-1 with the united states .
england manager hope powell brought on a strong forward line made up of arsenal 's rachel yankey and leeds united 's eniola aluko , who sat on the bench for their first game against china . while yankey , aluko and midfielder karen carney had shots on goal it was the americans who went ahead after forward heather o 'reilly headed home midfielder natasha kai 's right flank cross in the 16th minute . right back alexandra scott dashed into the box to poke in the equalizer at the far post on 48 minutes , after yankey fed a clinical low center from the left . after the break england conjured up several sharp forays down the flanks but the us defense held out for a point .
no goals in clash with united states in the first round of the tournament , germany were held to a 0-0 by fierce rivals the united states in the opening game on friday .
the world 's number one ladies team put out a young team , as did their world number two opponents , in the clash in the 80,000-seat guangdong olympic stadium .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's keeper rottenberg was a rare success neither team made much of an impact and the star players at the end of the goalless draw were probably goalkeepers silke rottenberg and hope solo , although neither the german or the american had any real saves to make .
america 's new hope gets first cap the game 's most notable event came with the inclusion of national player of the year lauren cheney in the us side .
the 19-year-old ucla graduate made her debut in the absence of fellow strikers kristine lilly and abby wambach , who are home resting .
american coach greg ryan is searching for a third striker for the world cup and cheney is a candidate , as are natasha kai , heather o 'reilly and lindsay tarpley , all who featured during the game with germany .

thousands of people are expected to spend an hour this weekend taking part in a national survey of garden birds .
the big garden bird watch , organised every year by the rspb , aims to find out which species are the most common visitors to uk gardens .
last year , a record-breaking 470,000 people took part the survey and counted eight million birds in 270,000 gardens .
since the event began in 1979 , the number of starlings counted has dropped by 72 % , the charity said .
prioritise conservation efforts the number of house sparrows counted has also fallen by 52 % .
however , the greenfinch and wren have both seen their numbers increase over the past 27 years by 67 % and 140 % respectively .
the blackbird was the most widespread of species noted last year - recorded in 94 % of all gardens .
the scheme originally began as an activity for children who were members of the young ornithologists club .
participants are asked to send the results to the royal society for the protection of birds , who use the information to record patterns in bird numbers and prioritise conservation efforts .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- chips push through nano-barrier bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- saturday , 27 january 2007 , 05:45 gmt chips push through nano-barrier the next milestone in the relentless pursuit of smaller , higher performance microchips has been unveiled .
chip-maker intel has announced that it will start producing processors using transistors with features just 45 nanometres -lrb- billionth of a metre -rrb- wide .
shrinking the technology that underpins the basic building blocks of chips will make them faster and more efficient .
computer giant ibm has also signalled its intention to start production of microchips using the technology .
" big blue " , which developed the technology with partners toshiba , sony and amd , intends to incorporate the transistors into its chips in 2008 .
intel said it would start commercial fabrication of processors at three factories later this year .
critical leaks the development means the industry axiom that underpins the development of all microchips , known as moore 's law , remains intact .
the proposition , articulated by intel co-founder gordon moore in 1965 , states that the number of transistors on a chip could double every 24 months . "
after more than 10 years of effort , we now have a way forward " tze-chiang chen , ibm the new intel processors , codenamed penryn , will pack more than four hundred million transistors into a chip half the size of a postage stamp .
like current processors , they will come in dual-core and quad-core versions , meaning they will have two or four separate processors on each chip .
the company has not said how fast the new devices will run .
the production of 45nm technology has been the goal of chip manufacturers ever since they conquered the 65nm barrier .
45nm refers to the smallest feature of the transistor used to make up the chip .
a transistor is a basic electronic switch .
every chip needs a certain number of them , and the more there are and the faster they can switch , the more calculations chips can do .
for nearly half a century , chip manufacturers have managed to keep up with moore 's law , shrinking transistor size and packing more and more of them on to chips .
however , past 65nm the silicon used to manufacture critical switch element , known as gate dielectrics , no longer performs as it does at larger scales .
as a result , currents passing through the transistors leak and reduce the effectiveness of the chip .
to prevent this , researchers have had to develop new materials to contain the current at such small scales based on the metal hafnium .
the silicon substitutes are known as high-k materials .
high-k refers to their greater ability to store electrical charge compared with silicon .
same ' tools ' the new materials ' development and integration into working components was described by gordon moore as " the biggest change in transistor technology " since the late 1960s .
the first working chips to incorporate 45nm devices were demonstrated last year by intel , but they have never been incorporated into commercial products .
dr tze-chiang chen , vice president of science and technology at ibm research , said : " until now , the chip industry was facing a major roadblock in terms of how far we could push current technology .

chip-maker intel has announced that it will start producing processors using transistors with features just 45 nanometres -lrb- billionth of a metre -rrb- wide .
shrinking the technology that underpins the basic building blocks of chips will make them faster and more efficient .
computer giant ibm has also signalled its intention to start production of microchips using the technology .
" big blue " , which developed the technology with partners toshiba , sony and amd , intends to incorporate the transistors into its chips in 2008 .
intel said it would start commercial fabrication of processors at three factories later this year .
critical leaks the development means the industry axiom that underpins the development of all microchips , known as moore 's law , remains intact .
the proposition , articulated by intel co-founder gordon moore in 1965 , states that the number of transistors on a chip could double every 24 months .
after more than 10 years of effort , we now have a way forward tze-chiang chen , ibm the new intel processors , codenamed penryn , will pack more than four hundred million transistors into a chip half the size of a postage stamp .
like current processors , they will come in dual-core and quad-core versions , meaning they will have two or four separate processors on each chip .
the company has not said how fast the new devices will run .
the production of 45nm technology has been the goal of chip manufacturers ever since they conquered the 65nm barrier .
45nm refers to the smallest feature of the transistor used to make up the chip .
a transistor is a basic electronic switch .
every chip needs a certain number of them , and the more there are and the faster they can switch , the more calculations chips can do .
for nearly half a century , chip manufacturers have managed to keep up with moore 's law , shrinking transistor size and packing more and more of them on to chips .
however , past 65nm the silicon used to manufacture critical switch element , known as gate dielectrics , no longer performs as it does at larger scales .
as a result , currents passing through the transistors leak and reduce the effectiveness of the chip .
to prevent this , researchers have had to develop new materials to contain the current at such small scales based on the metal hafnium .
the silicon substitutes are known as high-k materials .
high-k refers to their greater ability to store electrical charge compared with silicon .
same ' tools ' the new materials ' development and integration into working components was described by gordon moore as " the biggest change in transistor technology " since the late 1960s .
the first working chips to incorporate 45nm devices were demonstrated last year by intel , but they have never been incorporated into commercial products .
dr tze-chiang chen , vice president of science and technology at ibm research , said : " until now , the chip industry was facing a major roadblock in terms of how far we could push current technology .
" after more than 10 years of effort , we now have a way forward . "

chip-maker intel has announced that it will start producing processors using transistors with features just 45 nanometres -lrb- billionth of a metre -rrb- wide .
shrinking the technology that underpins the basic building blocks of chips will make them faster and more efficient .
computer giant ibm has also signalled its intention to start production of microchips using the technology .
" big blue " , which developed the technology with partners toshiba , sony and amd , intends to incorporate the transistors into its chips in 2008 .
intel said it would start commercial fabrication of processors at three factories later this year .
critical leaks the development means the industry axiom that underpins the development of all microchips , known as moore 's law , remains intact .
the proposition , articulated by intel co-founder gordon moore in 1965 , states that the number of transistors on a chip could double every 24 months .
after more than 10 years of effort , we now have a way forward tze-chiang chen , ibm the new intel processors , codenamed penryn , will pack more than four hundred million transistors into a chip half the size of a postage stamp .
like current processors , they will come in dual-core and quad-core versions , meaning they will have two or four separate processors on each chip .
the company has not said how fast the new devices will run .
the production of 45nm technology has been the goal of chip manufacturers ever since they conquered the 65nm barrier .
45nm refers to the smallest feature of the transistor used to make up the chip .
a transistor is a basic electronic switch .
every chip needs a certain number of them , and the more there are and the faster they can switch , the more calculations chips can do .
for nearly half a century , chip manufacturers have managed to keep up with moore 's law , shrinking transistor size and packing more and more of them on to chips .
however , past 65nm the silicon used to manufacture critical switch element , known as gate dielectrics , no longer performs as it does at larger scales .
as a result , currents passing through the transistors leak and reduce the effectiveness of the chip .
to prevent this , researchers have had to develop new materials to contain the current at such small scales based on the metal hafnium .
the silicon substitutes are known as high-k materials .
high-k refers to their greater ability to store electrical charge compared with silicon .
same ' tools ' the new materials ' development and integration into working components was described by gordon moore as " the biggest change in transistor technology " since the late 1960s .
the first working chips to incorporate 45nm devices were demonstrated last year by intel , but they have never been incorporated into commercial products .
dr tze-chiang chen , vice president of science and technology at ibm research , said : " until now , the chip industry was facing a major roadblock in terms of how far we could push current technology .
" after more than 10 years of effort , we now have a way forward . "
the exact recipes for the different high-k materials used by intel and ibm have not been disclosed , but importantly both firms have said that they could be incorporated into current production technology with minimal effort .

juan carlos ortiz is the second head of the company to resign since mr morales nationalised bolivia 's gas industry .
the country has the second-largest natural gas reserves in south america after venezuela .
mr ortiz , who was appointed in august 2006 , said he had disagreed with the government about the company 's future .
price rise " i have my own vision and what i 've done is defend it when i believe i 'm right , " mr ortiz said in a news conference .
the company 's last head - jorge alvarado - also resigned , over corruption allegations .
mr morales began nationalising bolivia 's energy industry in may 2006 after winning an election campaign pledging to increase state control of natural resources .
mr ortiz was believed to have been given the task of smoothing relations with the country 's largest customer for natural gas - brazil .
mr morales wanted to increase the cost per cubic metre of natural gas from $ 4 -lrb- £ 2 , 3 euros -rrb- to $ 5 -lrb- £ 2.5 , 3.8 euros -rrb- .
last week he said that bolivia " can no longer continue subsidising natural gas to brazil " .

they will visit independence hall , where the declaration of independence was adopted and the us constitution drafted , and see the liberty bell .
prince charles will also accept an award for his environmental work , but has been criticised by some campaigners for flying to accept it in person .
the couple travelled from london on a scheduled british airways flight .
the flight on friday was delayed by an hour and , as the boeing 777 waited on the tarmac , the captain told passengers : " we seem to have been caught up in rush hour traffic at heathrow . "
but the flight made good time and prince charles and camilla arrived in philadelphia , where temperatures were -6c , five minutes early .
during their visit to the city , the couple will be shown one of 2,700 murals which resulted from an anti-graffiti drive and bid to revitalise rundown areas which began in the 1980s .

they will visit independence hall , where the declaration of independence was adopted and the us constitution drafted , and see the liberty bell .
prince charles will also accept an award for his environmental work , but has been criticised by some campaigners for flying to accept it in person .
the couple travelled from london on a scheduled british airways flight .
the flight on friday was delayed by an hour and , as the boeing 777 waited on the tarmac , the captain told passengers : " we seem to have been caught up in rush hour traffic at heathrow . "
but the flight made good time and prince charles and camilla arrived in philadelphia , where temperatures were -6c , five minutes early .
during their visit to the city , the couple will be shown one of 2,700 murals which resulted from an anti-graffiti drive and bid to revitalise rundown areas which began in the 1980s .
in new york on sunday they will visit the harlem children 's zone , which helps disadvantaged children .
global award that evening the prince is set to collect the 10th anniversary global environmental citizen award .
prince charles has been awarded the prize by the centre for health and global environment at harvard medical school for " his outstanding work towards protecting the environment " .
actress meryl streep and previous winner al gore , the former us vice- president , will present the award .
however , prince charles has been criticised by some green campaigners for deciding to fly to the us to collect the award .
environmental campaigners plane stupid , which campaign against aircraft carbon emissions , accused the prince of " green hypocrisy " .
meanwhile , environment secretary david miliband has suggested prince charles should receive the prize via video-link up rather than make the 7,000 mile round-trip .
the royal couple normally fly by a private charter plane and the decision to use a scheduled flight follows an announcement by clarence house last month to make the royal household 's travel more eco-friendly .
aides said scheduled flights would be used when security permitted it .
in the summer , aides to the prince are set to publish details of his carbon footprint in his annual accounts , as well as set a target to substantially reduces the carbon emissions of his office and household .
clarence house was unable to confirm the last time prince charles used a commercial flight for an official royal visit .

she said she was told that it sounded like he had flu .

he later died in hospital from toxic shock .
kerry robertson gave evidence at the fatal accident inquiry ms robertson was one of the people to give evidence at a lengthy joint fatal accident inquiry in aberdeen , which also examined the death of aberdeen teenager shomi miah .
the 17-year-old had been told by nurse advisers to take paracetamol for flu-like symptoms , but later died from meningitis .
sheriff james tierney said the system had failed mr wiseman and ms miah by not identifying their life-threatening conditions .
ms robertson told bbc scotland : " money 's not important although it 's going to help the kids .
" it 's just the fact that we have n't had an acknowledgement from nhs 24 to say that they were in the right or the wrong and we 've had no apologies .

a risk management company has calculated that a similar event in the bristol channel could cost £ 13bn .
experts on freak weather and tsunamis hold a forum in newport on saturday .
high tides and storms or a tsunami are theories for causing the deaths of up to 2,000 people on 30 january 1607 .
it is estimated 200 square miles -lrb- 520 sq km -rrb- of land in south wales and south west england were covered by water .
1607 flood facts the flood reached a speed of 30mph and a height of 25ft it swept up to four miles inland in north devon , pembrokeshire , glamorgan , monmouthshire , cardiff and somerset .
in low-lying somerset levels , it reached 14 miles inland in 2002 , experts from bath and australia , proposed the tsunami explanation over the idea that the flood was caused by a freak high tide dr claire souch , director of model management at risk management solutions -lrb- rms -rrb- and a co-author of the report claims that an " exceptional event " on the scale of the 1607 flood , with a storm surge of nine metres , could overwhelm existing flood defences .
more than 80 % of the total losses from the same event today would occur in the cities of bristol , cardiff and gloucester , with the remaining losses along the south-western coast of wales and around barnstaple in devon .
dr souch said : " we 've run a variety of simulations of a storm surge coming up the bristol channel today and in the worst case scenario the flood heights would be so high , they would over-top existing defences and cause flooding over an extremely large area .
' wall of water ' " this could lead to damage totalling as much as £ 13bn. which would indeed make it the costliest disaster in the uk . "
dr souch said it had to be made " very clear " that the chance of a repeat was small , with a probability of it being an event which could take place on average every 500 to 1,000 years .
" it 's not something we can expect over the next few years but it could happen - and it last happened 400 years ago " .
timewatch used computer graphics to recreate what the wave could have looked like one theory was that a tsunami caused the flood , based on accounts from the time and also geological research of mud deposits and boulders found in south wales .
but dr souch believes it was caused by an exceptional set of circumstances .
" that theory has been around for a while , but there 's been a lot of other scientific research which has now effectively disproved that theory .
" the work done by the proudman oceanographic laboratory -lsb- in liverpool -rsb- has shown it was really a combination of a very high spring tide and almost at exactly the same time a storm system coming in off the atlantic , driving the waves ahead of it and pushing up this wall of water , which can be funnelled up the estuary . "
eyewitness accounts of the 1607 disaster told of " huge and mighty hills of water " and only receding 10 days later .
extreme tidal forces are estimated to occur about every 4.5 years and are next expected on 20 march 2007 .
the forum is being held at the university of newport , caerleon .

a risk management company has calculated that a similar event in the bristol channel could cost £ 13bn .
experts on freak weather and tsunamis hold a forum in newport on saturday .
high tides and storms or a tsunami are theories for causing the deaths of up to 2,000 people on 30 january 1607 .
it is estimated 200 square miles -lrb- 520 sq km -rrb- of land in south wales and south west england were covered by water .
1607 flood facts the flood reached a speed of 30mph and a height of 25ft it swept up to four miles inland in north devon , pembrokeshire , glamorgan , monmouthshire , cardiff and somerset .
in low-lying somerset levels , it reached 14 miles inland in 2002 , experts from bath and australia , proposed the tsunami explanation over the idea that the flood was caused by a freak high tide dr claire souch , director of model management at risk management solutions -lrb- rms -rrb- and a co-author of the report claims that an " exceptional event " on the scale of the 1607 flood , with a storm surge of nine metres , could overwhelm existing flood defences .
more than 80 % of the total losses from the same event today would occur in the cities of bristol , cardiff and gloucester , with the remaining losses along the south-western coast of wales and around barnstaple in devon .
dr souch said : " we 've run a variety of simulations of a storm surge coming up the bristol channel today and in the worst case scenario the flood heights would be so high , they would over-top existing defences and cause flooding over an extremely large area .
' wall of water ' " this could lead to damage totalling as much as £ 13bn. which would indeed make it the costliest disaster in the uk . "
dr souch said it had to be made " very clear " that the chance of a repeat was small , with a probability of it being an event which could take place on average every 500 to 1,000 years .
" it 's not something we can expect over the next few years but it could happen - and it last happened 400 years ago " .
timewatch used computer graphics to recreate what the wave could have looked like one theory was that a tsunami caused the flood , based on accounts from the time and also geological research of mud deposits and boulders found in south wales .
but dr souch believes it was caused by an exceptional set of circumstances .
" that theory has been around for a while , but there 's been a lot of other scientific research which has now effectively disproved that theory .
" the work done by the proudman oceanographic laboratory -lsb- in liverpool -rsb- has shown it was really a combination of a very high spring tide and almost at exactly the same time a storm system coming in off the atlantic , driving the waves ahead of it and pushing up this wall of water , which can be funnelled up the estuary . "
eyewitness accounts of the 1607 disaster told of " huge and mighty hills of water " and only receding 10 days later .
extreme tidal forces are estimated to occur about every 4.5 years and are next expected on 20 march 2007 .
the forum is being held at the university of newport , caerleon .

from tolstoy to dostoevsky , russia 's long love-affair with gambling is well documented in the country 's greatest works of literature .

those who want to gamble will have to invest a lot of time , effort and money to reach one of the new las vegas-style gambling zones .
mr boettcher is able of course to apply for a new licence to operate in those zones .

it seems the exponential growth in casinos and arcades has been matched by a similar growth in the number of gambling addicts across russia .
reliable figures are difficult to come by and do vary significantly .

he uses a mixture of cajoling and therapy to help those who can no longer control their urge to drink alcohol , take drugs or gamble .
he is convinced the number of gambling addicts has shot up in recent years .

the benevolent mr boettcher looks set to become a victim of the ever-lurking uncertainty that makes doing business in russia so risky .
spurred on by the kremlin , the russian parliament has passed a law which will force all casinos and fruit-machine arcades to close down over the next two years .
instead gambling is to be confined within four special zones in different parts of the country , all outside the cities .
the government is very deliberately aiming to separate the population from the casinos .
those who want to gamble will have to invest a lot of time , effort and money to reach one of the new las vegas-style gambling zones .
mr boettcher is able of course to apply for a new licence to operate in those zones .

he has now got his eye on india .
growing addiction problem the russian government says there are very good reasons for imposing such tough new regulations .
it seems the exponential growth in casinos and arcades has been matched by a similar growth in the number of gambling addicts across russia .
reliable figures are difficult to come by and do vary significantly .
but one man who has seen the problem at first hand is father anatoly berestov , an orthodox priest who runs an addiction clinic in a 16th-century church hall in moscow .
he uses a mixture of cajoling and therapy to help those who can no longer control their urge to drink alcohol , take drugs or gamble .
he is convinced the number of gambling addicts has shot up in recent years .
many are businessmen with families who lose everything .
" i 've seen many suicides , " he told me .
but he is also particularly worried about the spread of this addiction into the villages where , he says , the elderly are now throwing away their pensions .

from tolstoy to dostoevsky , russia 's long love-affair with gambling is well documented in the country 's greatest works of literature .
so it should not come as a great surprise that it is once again boom-time for the gambling industry here , after being banned for most of the last century by the communists .
