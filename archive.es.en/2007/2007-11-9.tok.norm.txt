program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : europe without borders - 15 years of the schengen zone eu opens internal borders to long-stay visa holders , sparking security fears checkpoint-free europe confounds germany 's skeptics 15 years of visa-free travel in europe europe 's unity with swiss in libya visa row tested by business links european union -pipe- 09.11.2007 opinion : visa-free travel creates more fences for eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on dec .
21 , border controls between eight european countries will cease .
malta will follow suit a short while later .
dw 's klaus dahmann is critical of the decision by eu interior ministers to expand the schengen zone . this early european christmas present has received little by way of media coverage in germany , although the implications for european union citizens are almost as far-reaching as those attached to the major eu expansion three years ago .
the deep gash that the iron curtain once scored right across the continent has already grown over , and with border controls about to be dropped , the physical scar will become invisible . the move , which will bring the newer eu countries into line with their western contemporaries , will also ease cross-border travel for citizens of older schengen countries .
germans will only have to show their passports to one of their neighbors : the swiss .
bildunterschrift : but to what extent is a relaxing of border controls and an expansion of the schengen zone a positive thing ?
the answer is : it 's good if you 're on the inside , but not so good if you are not .
barriers to russia , ukraine and serbia are getting higher and security measures are getting tighter .
bridges along the border between slovenia and croatia have been torn down , and there is no doubt that ljubljana is feeling an element of schadenfreude towards its non-schengen neighbor . in rolling its open-border system further eastwards , the eu is also opening up new and shorter crime routes .
regardless of the number of fences and security installations , and despite europe-wide visa data collection , europol and national police authorities will have fences of their own to climb if they are to take on the new challenges coming their way . the accusations of corruption currently facing the czech embassy in vietnam are a case in point .
before the czech republic has even become an official member of the schengen clan , german intelligence services pinpointed an increasing number of vietnamese citizens entering the country .
the allegations have not been proven , but they go to show that more embassies will have to implement tougher visa regulations in the future . yet even then , schengen will never manage to dispel the fear of certain european countries becoming a hot bet of economic refugees .
there is still a long way to go to solve integration problems within the union , and eu member states are far from reaching a consensus on how many immigrants they should allow into their respective territories . to the outside world , therefore , european politicians continue to sell higher external fences as the solution .
and rather than admit to their own citizens that the new schengen agreement will mean more workers from poland , slovakia or hungary seeking their fortune in the richer countries of western europe , they have opted to keep this celebration quiet . klaus dahmann is a correspondent for deutsche welle -lrb- tkw -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 in germany and the uk . marcus eckstein is the editor for the mobile phone section of connect magazine in stuttgart . dw-world.de : the apple iphone is being released with much fanfare .
will the demand in germany be as big as it was in the us ? markus eckstein : there is a strong apple fan base here that will be going to the t-mobile shop along with the guys we call the " leading edge , " people who need to always have the newest phone with the most features .
but the euphoria that surrounded the release of the iphone in the us is not happening here since it has been all over the internet for months . germans are traditionally more skeptical when it comes to gadgets .
there will be people who once they see the phone being used in real life decide that they want one .
i think there will be strong demand for the phone . one of the biggest criticisms of the iphone in the us is the slow speed of the network it uses and the high cost of the service .
will this also be the case for t-mobile ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-online has exclusive rights to sell the iphone in germany t-mobile has a lot of wifi hotspots and their edge network -lsb- mobile internet service -rsb- is quite good .
but i think a lot of people will be hesitant to buy the phone because of the high cost of the t-mobile contract . will there be a lot of people buying the iphone in order to " unlock " it and use it on other mobile networks ? i think the situation is different in germany .
in the us you can buy the phone before you sign any contract .
here you do not get the phone until you sign a contract .
plus the phone is only being sold at t-mobile stores .
if you want to try and unlock the phone , you are better off trying to find a us version on ebay . will the device live up to expectations ? if you compare the iphone to other phones then i would say yes .
what is really new and different is the user interface - especially the large touch screen .
the user-friendly interface of the phone opens up a lot of new features - browsing the internet or watching youtube videos - for a broader audience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german comedian ruth moschner presents the iphone in many ways it is really an american product .
there are some functions that europeans are used to that the iphone does not have like being able to design a ringtone for groups of contacts like your family so you know when they are calling or sending out a contact via bluetooth or sms .
these are things that many consumers here are used to . is the iphone , and its user-friendly interface , going to influence others in the mobile phone industry to change their products ? this is really the first time that a newcomer has come into the market with such a hit product that is getting so much attention . you can already see the first signs that things are changing .
for example , nokia just announced that they are going to be changing their user system next year .
like apple , they do not usually announce changes like this so far in advance . interview : ole tangen jr . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , 2008 the german parliament has given the go ahead to a law that will allow telephone and internet data to be stored for up to six months despite fierce criticism from the opposition and privacy advocates . the legislation approved friday , nov .
9 , also permits the telephone conversations of lawyers , journalists and doctors to be bugged under certain circumstances .
the decision not to exclude these professions from the law has sparked an outcry from those who rely on being able to speak to their clients or contacts confidentially .
members of parliament , religious clerics and state prosecutors have been provided exceptions to the law .
politicians from the opposition free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the greens and the left party have said they will mount legal challenges to the statute .
the marburger bund doctors ' association has also announced they would have its legality examined .
there have also been protests from journalists ' and publishing associations .
powers subject to judicial permission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police powers to conduct telephone surveillance will be extended under the law , police and german intelligence agencies must receive a court 's permission and show a strong suspicion of illegal activity in order to examine the data held by telephone companies .
the information will allow authorities to determine when and with whom their suspects had telephone , fax or e-mail contact .
police and others with access to the information will also be able to pinpoint where mobile phone calls took place .
the content of the communications will not , however , be provided to investigators .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said friday that criticism of the law had been exaggerated and stressed that it was not " paving the way towards a surveillance state . "
she added that the law would enable the authorities to combat crime and terrorism effectively .
the minister said the law implemented an eu directive in a " minimal fashion . "
but the german commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , said parts of the law exceeded european requirements by failing to exclude less serious crimes .
" a sad day for democracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu directive behind the german law was prompted by the madrid train bombings fdp expert jörg van essen said the legislation " placed citizens under general suspicion . "
he said he wants to appeal to the german constitutional court .
jan korte from the left party called the law one of the biggest attacks on press freedom and said that abuse was bound to occur .
the greens described it as a " black day for civil rights " and a " sad day for democracy . "
siegfried kauder , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , countered the criticism , saying that the law found the right balance between data protection and the need to fight crime .
he said it , in fact , represented an improvement in the legal position of journalists .
the justice minister said the eu directive was a reaction to the terrorist attacks on madrid in march 2004 in which 191 people died .
the perpetrators were tracked down using mobile telephone data .
some 366 parliamentarians voted in favor of the law , while 156 voted against .
there were two abstentions . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision not to exclude these professions from the law has sparked an outcry from those who rely on being able to speak to their clients or contacts confidentially .

politicians from the opposition free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the greens and the left party have said they will mount legal challenges to the statute .

1 , 2008 the german parliament has given the go ahead to a law that will allow telephone and internet data to be stored for up to six months despite fierce criticism from the opposition and privacy advocates . the legislation approved friday , nov .
9 , also permits the telephone conversations of lawyers , journalists and doctors to be bugged under certain circumstances .
the decision not to exclude these professions from the law has sparked an outcry from those who rely on being able to speak to their clients or contacts confidentially .
members of parliament , religious clerics and state prosecutors have been provided exceptions to the law .
politicians from the opposition free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the greens and the left party have said they will mount legal challenges to the statute .
the marburger bund doctors ' association has also announced they would have its legality examined .
there have also been protests from journalists ' and publishing associations .
powers subject to judicial permission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police powers to conduct telephone surveillance will be extended under the law , police and german intelligence agencies must receive a court 's permission and show a strong suspicion of illegal activity in order to examine the data held by telephone companies .
the information will allow authorities to determine when and with whom their suspects had telephone , fax or e-mail contact .
police and others with access to the information will also be able to pinpoint where mobile phone calls took place .
the content of the communications will not , however , be provided to investigators .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said friday that criticism of the law had been exaggerated and stressed that it was not " paving the way towards a surveillance state . "
she added that the law would enable the authorities to combat crime and terrorism effectively .
the minister said the law implemented an eu directive in a " minimal fashion . "
but the german commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , said parts of the law exceeded european requirements by failing to exclude less serious crimes .
" a sad day for democracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu directive behind the german law was prompted by the madrid train bombings fdp expert jörg van essen said the legislation " placed citizens under general suspicion . "
he said he wants to appeal to the german constitutional court .
jan korte from the left party called the law one of the biggest attacks on press freedom and said that abuse was bound to occur .
the greens described it as a " black day for civil rights " and a " sad day for democracy . "
siegfried kauder , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , countered the criticism , saying that the law found the right balance between data protection and the need to fight crime .
he said it , in fact , represented an improvement in the legal position of journalists .
the justice minister said the eu directive was a reaction to the terrorist attacks on madrid in march 2004 in which 191 people died .
the perpetrators were tracked down using mobile telephone data .
some 366 parliamentarians voted in favor of the law , while 156 voted against .
there were two abstentions . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : europe without borders - 15 years of the schengen zone eu opens internal borders to long-stay visa holders , sparking security fears checkpoint-free europe confounds germany 's skeptics 15 years of visa-free travel in europe europe 's unity with swiss in libya visa row tested by business links european union -pipe- 09.11.2007 opinion : visa-free travel creates more fences for eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on dec .
21 , border controls between eight european countries will cease .
malta will follow suit a short while later .
dw 's klaus dahmann is critical of the decision by eu interior ministers to expand the schengen zone . this early european christmas present has received little by way of media coverage in germany , although the implications for european union citizens are almost as far-reaching as those attached to the major eu expansion three years ago .
the deep gash that the iron curtain once scored right across the continent has already grown over , and with border controls about to be dropped , the physical scar will become invisible . the move , which will bring the newer eu countries into line with their western contemporaries , will also ease cross-border travel for citizens of older schengen countries .
germans will only have to show their passports to one of their neighbors : the swiss .
bildunterschrift : but to what extent is a relaxing of border controls and an expansion of the schengen zone a positive thing ?
the answer is : it 's good if you 're on the inside , but not so good if you are not .
barriers to russia , ukraine and serbia are getting higher and security measures are getting tighter .
bridges along the border between slovenia and croatia have been torn down , and there is no doubt that ljubljana is feeling an element of schadenfreude towards its non-schengen neighbor . in rolling its open-border system further eastwards , the eu is also opening up new and shorter crime routes .
regardless of the number of fences and security installations , and despite europe-wide visa data collection , europol and national police authorities will have fences of their own to climb if they are to take on the new challenges coming their way . the accusations of corruption currently facing the czech embassy in vietnam are a case in point .
before the czech republic has even become an official member of the schengen clan , german intelligence services pinpointed an increasing number of vietnamese citizens entering the country .
the allegations have not been proven , but they go to show that more embassies will have to implement tougher visa regulations in the future . yet even then , schengen will never manage to dispel the fear of certain european countries becoming a hot bet of economic refugees .
there is still a long way to go to solve integration problems within the union , and eu member states are far from reaching a consensus on how many immigrants they should allow into their respective territories . to the outside world , therefore , european politicians continue to sell higher external fences as the solution .
and rather than admit to their own citizens that the new schengen agreement will mean more workers from poland , slovakia or hungary seeking their fortune in the richer countries of western europe , they have opted to keep this celebration quiet . klaus dahmann is a correspondent for deutsche welle -lrb- tkw -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us wants germany to support tougher sanctions on iran and merkel has made all the right noises to suggest that bush will get what he wants .
how far that support goes , time will tell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants german troops in action in afghanistan there is considerable concern in washington over the way some nato countries , particularly germany , are not pulling their weight in afghanistan , which is seen as a make-or-break test for nato .
if nato fails in afghanistan at least partly because german forces and others have failed to assume their share of the responsibility for the fighting through " caveats " - restrictive rules of engagement and absence from the battlefield - washington is much less likely in future to look to nato for joint operations and will resume its strategy of forming " coalitions of the willing , " something which germany does n't like .
washington wants germany and other countries to get involved in the dirty work of fighting the taliban .
this is very unlikely to happen , something merkel will again reiterate . although german politicians tend to think it was a major achievement to extend the stay of german forces in afghanistan , given the hostility of german public opinion , this is not the way germany 's commitment to afghanistan is seen in washington , where it is regarded as feeble and nit-picking . what is the us view of chancellor merkel ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tactile bush has a very different approach from merkel 's in america , the incident most remembered in the recent history of german-american relations is probably the moment at the st. petersburg g8 summit when bush gave merkel a surprise , high-speed backrub .
a video of the incident was widely circulated , to general merriment .
merkel was clearly horrified by the physical contact , just as she dislikes sarkozy 's constant hugging and kissing . bush and merkel express respect for each other , but their temperaments are completely different .
merkel likes quiet diplomacy , compromise and consensus - bush is driven by conviction and a sense of mission , which makes him much less likely to accept compromise easily . bush sees it as helpful that merkel is less pro-russian and less anti-american than her predecessor gerhard schröder , whom bush detested , and he is pleased that she is more inclined than schröder to understand the threats posed by international terrorism . is the working relationship between president bush and chancellor merkel a balanced one ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel claimed victory at the g8 , but bush was the winner , dale said i would not say that it is balanced , although chancellor merkel would probably say it is .
it seems that merkel , like many others , underestimates bush .
at the g8 heiligendamm summit , merkel claimed a diplomatic triumph in bringing bush on board on climate change , without apparently realizing that bush had run rings round her .
bush got virtually everything he wanted in heiligendamm . in exchange for agreeing to some vague global goal of reducing emissions , bush won on the following points : the goal would not be mandatory ; actions to try to counter climate change should not prevent strong economic growth ; technology is a large part of the answer ; and big emerging nations like china and india must be included in any post-kyoto agreement . bush , in fact , drove a stake through the heart of the whole kyoto approach right under merkel 's nose - and she did n't seem to notice . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 . reginald dale is a trans-atlantic relations expert and a senior fellow at the center for strategic and international studies in washington . dw-world.de : what does the united states expect in terms of support and action from chancellor angela merkel 's germany on topics such as iran , afghanistan and the middle east ? reginald dale : germany is seen as less supportive than france on iraq and iran , but the bush administration is pleased that merkel agreed with the us that the time was ripe to launch a new middle east initiative - even if it is unlikely to get very far .
the us wants germany to support tougher sanctions on iran and merkel has made all the right noises to suggest that bush will get what he wants .
how far that support goes , time will tell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants german troops in action in afghanistan there is considerable concern in washington over the way some nato countries , particularly germany , are not pulling their weight in afghanistan , which is seen as a make-or-break test for nato .
if nato fails in afghanistan at least partly because german forces and others have failed to assume their share of the responsibility for the fighting through " caveats " - restrictive rules of engagement and absence from the battlefield - washington is much less likely in future to look to nato for joint operations and will resume its strategy of forming " coalitions of the willing , " something which germany does n't like .
washington wants germany and other countries to get involved in the dirty work of fighting the taliban .
this is very unlikely to happen , something merkel will again reiterate . although german politicians tend to think it was a major achievement to extend the stay of german forces in afghanistan , given the hostility of german public opinion , this is not the way germany 's commitment to afghanistan is seen in washington , where it is regarded as feeble and nit-picking . what is the us view of chancellor merkel ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tactile bush has a very different approach from merkel 's in america , the incident most remembered in the recent history of german-american relations is probably the moment at the st. petersburg g8 summit when bush gave merkel a surprise , high-speed backrub .
a video of the incident was widely circulated , to general merriment .
merkel was clearly horrified by the physical contact , just as she dislikes sarkozy 's constant hugging and kissing . bush and merkel express respect for each other , but their temperaments are completely different .
merkel likes quiet diplomacy , compromise and consensus - bush is driven by conviction and a sense of mission , which makes him much less likely to accept compromise easily . bush sees it as helpful that merkel is less pro-russian and less anti-american than her predecessor gerhard schröder , whom bush detested , and he is pleased that she is more inclined than schröder to understand the threats posed by international terrorism . is the working relationship between president bush and chancellor merkel a balanced one ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel claimed victory at the g8 , but bush was the winner , dale said i would not say that it is balanced , although chancellor merkel would probably say it is .
it seems that merkel , like many others , underestimates bush .
at the g8 heiligendamm summit , merkel claimed a diplomatic triumph in bringing bush on board on climate change , without apparently realizing that bush had run rings round her .
bush got virtually everything he wanted in heiligendamm . in exchange for agreeing to some vague global goal of reducing emissions , bush won on the following points : the goal would not be mandatory ; actions to try to counter climate change should not prevent strong economic growth ; technology is a large part of the answer ; and big emerging nations like china and india must be included in any post-kyoto agreement . bush , in fact , drove a stake through the heart of the whole kyoto approach right under merkel 's nose - and she did n't seem to notice . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . dw 's nina werkhäuser thinks germany 's participation in operation enduring freedom is not making the world a safer place .
how can she honestly believe withdrawing from oef , or any of the other operations , will make the world a safer place ?
she can not , based on reality and the need to maintain waging the war on terror wherever it is .
accept it or not , there is a war in the world that was started with attacks on the united states , even prior to september 11 .
and it is time to stop blaming the united states for the war 's existence .
further , the time is overdue to stop acting as if this war is of no concern to germany and the rest of europe .
why not ask yourself , how close to your house must the war come before you think it is time to be involved ? - mark wald , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has nearly 3,000 troops serving under different mandates in afghanistan from the onset i believed that invading iraq was wrong and respected germany 's resolve in not becoming embroiled in that conflict .
however , even though the us has mishandled the situation in afghanistan , oef is a legitimate effort to contain terrorism .
the germans , at least from media reports , appear to have been complaining about their role there from day one .
while i truly do not think germany should have to continue to thank the us forever for the berlin airlift or for our troops playing a role in germany 's defense , i am somewhat chagrined as a veteran who served in germany that the germans are looking for a free ride .
if germany does not want a role in defending the free world , then it should give up its military , plant flowers , and let whoever walk over it . - rudy rau , us the writer demands germany gets out of all commitments to fight against terrorism .
though not stated outright , that is the crux of her argument .
germany is one of the group of eight highly industrialized countries and has certain moral obligations to lesser nations .
what does the writer wants to happen ?
a germany not involved in any worrisome projects ?
isolation is not the answer .
germany , or for that matter any nation , has got to strike a balance . - benedict aloysius , australia by all means germany should withdraw from the war on terrorism !

both leaders have said they want to keep nuclear weapons out of tehran 's hands . " the international community must pursue its goal of preventing iran from having nuclear arms with firmness , " merkel said in an interview this week with the daily berliner zeitung .
" this is a process we should take step by step . " bush has also pointed to germany to take on an important role in nuclear negotiations with tehran . differences over dealing with iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both leaders want to keep nuclear weapons out of iran " we definitely need germany 's help on issues like iran , " president bush told german broadcaster rtl this week .
" germany is a crucial country in terms of building coalitions to deal with the threats we face . " but while merkel has stated a preference for giving the united nations a lead role in dealing with iran , bush has ratcheted up his rhetoric by saying that allowing tehran nuclear weapons could end in world war iii and that action needed to be taken quickly . disagreement over what step to take next will make reaching a us-german position difficult , according to thomas greven , a senior research fellow at the german institute for international relations in berlin .

" it is quite true to say that angela merkel has brought the us and germany back to a calm professional relationship , " she said .
" and for this president , personal relationships are very important . " merkel is also said to have a strong regard for the president and the american people . " i think the affection and regard that merkel has for the us is genuine , " stelzenmüller said . for his part , bush has repeatedly expressed admiration for the german leader who grew up in communist east germany and went on to lead one of the world 's biggest democracies and europe 's largest economy . the texas white house bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel also hosted bush to an informal german barbecue in 2006 the invitation to the ranch in crawford , texas - where bush famously said he saw into the " soul " of russian president vladimir putin - is a signal that bush values good relations with germany , greven said . but he added that there was little hope of closing the gaps in the differences of opinion on germany 's desire for a permanent seat at the un security council , which bush does not support , and merkel 's refusal to send german troops to afghanistan 's war-torn south .

21 , border controls between eight european countries will cease .
malta will follow suit a short while later .
dw 's klaus dahmann is critical of the decision by eu interior ministers to expand the schengen zone . this early european christmas present has received little by way of media coverage in germany , although the implications for european union citizens are almost as far-reaching as those attached to the major eu expansion three years ago .
the deep gash that the iron curtain once scored right across the continent has already grown over , and with border controls about to be dropped , the physical scar will become invisible . the move , which will bring the newer eu countries into line with their western contemporaries , will also ease cross-border travel for citizens of older schengen countries .
germans will only have to show their passports to one of their neighbors : the swiss .
bildunterschrift : but to what extent is a relaxing of border controls and an expansion of the schengen zone a positive thing ?
the answer is : it 's good if you 're on the inside , but not so good if you are not .
barriers to russia , ukraine and serbia are getting higher and security measures are getting tighter .
bridges along the border between slovenia and croatia have been torn down , and there is no doubt that ljubljana is feeling an element of schadenfreude towards its non-schengen neighbor . in rolling its open-border system further eastwards , the eu is also opening up new and shorter crime routes .
regardless of the number of fences and security installations , and despite europe-wide visa data collection , europol and national police authorities will have fences of their own to climb if they are to take on the new challenges coming their way . the accusations of corruption currently facing the czech embassy in vietnam are a case in point .
before the czech republic has even become an official member of the schengen clan , german intelligence services pinpointed an increasing number of vietnamese citizens entering the country .
the allegations have not been proven , but they go to show that more embassies will have to implement tougher visa regulations in the future . yet even then , schengen will never manage to dispel the fear of certain european countries becoming a hot bet of economic refugees .
there is still a long way to go to solve integration problems within the union , and eu member states are far from reaching a consensus on how many immigrants they should allow into their respective territories . to the outside world , therefore , european politicians continue to sell higher external fences as the solution .
and rather than admit to their own citizens that the new schengen agreement will mean more workers from poland , slovakia or hungary seeking their fortune in the richer countries of western europe , they have opted to keep this celebration quiet . klaus dahmann is a correspondent for deutsche welle -lrb- tkw -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is a view echoed by many big names in the german game . rummenigge 's comments follow a week of german clubs in european competition , with not one of the six clubs in action able to score a victory . he said the bundesliga could no longer compete financially with the top leagues in spain , england or italy . " we have to be clear that we no longer have a chance internationally , " he told the daily stuttgarter nachrichten on friday , nov .
9 .
" there is n't a manager or coach in the world who can compensate for this competitive disadvantage . " in the champions league , bundesliga champions vfl stuttgart are now out of contention after four successive defeats .
stuttgart will not even have the consolation of dropping into the uefa cup as third-placed finishers in their group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen 's campaign ended with defeat to lazio meanwhile werder bremen , who were beaten 2-1 by lazio on tuesday , are bottom of their group and schalke 04 , who drew 0-0 at home to chelsea , are third in their group . in uefa cup group matches thursday , bayern munich were held to a 2-2 draw at home to bolton wanderers , while nuremberg were beaten 2-0 at home by everton and bayer leverkusen went down 2-1 at spartak moscow .
the other german side in europe , sv hamburg , were without a game . rummenigge criticizes bayern 's uefa display rummenigge also publicly criticized bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld 's tactics after the draw with bolton , who sit just one place off the bottom of the english premier league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge says german teams are no longer competitive the bayern official lashed out at hitzfeld for replacing key players such as franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger for the final half hour with bayern leading 2-1 , which allowed bolton to grab a late equalizer . " i 'm really annoyed , " rummenigge had told journalists after the draw .
" it would have been very easy to win this one and advance .
the spectators have a right to see the best team play .
football is not mathematics .
you ca n't calculate everything . " hitzfeld said he did not want to directly comment on rummenigge 's remarks , but explained that he had wanted to rest ribery and schweinsteiger ahead of the bundesliga match at vfb stuttgart on saturday . " i hope i know the basic math of soccer , and i try to apply that , " said hitzfeld , who studied mathematics at university .
" i believe that i found the right mixture so that we can win in stuttgart , " hitzfeld also said , he wanted to rotate some of the players to prevent injuries . " it was a reasonable decision , " he added .
" we need to get back on track at stuttgart after two league draws . " hitzfeld added that he was not worried about rummenigge 's attack . " i 'm used to stormy weather , " he said .
" you should n't let yourself be influenced by such petty issues . " funding adding to lack of german competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke matched moneybags chelsea in the score only rummenigge 's tirade against bundesliga teams continued with a complaint that the german representatives in the champions league were " not sufficiently competitive " against their rivals from other major european leagues who were earning vastly more from television broadcast sales . the 52-year-old former international called for a new distribution of tv earnings in the bundesliga , saying a team like vfb stuttgart had to be treated differently from clubs such as energie cottbus or vfl bochum . " either we decide on individual marketing , or the key to distribution has to be aligned to the status and merit of the respective clubs , " he said . finance was now the key in international soccer , enabling top clubs to invest in quality players . " the bundesliga is buying only quantity on the transfer market .
one can see the result of this in the champions league , " rummenigge added . soccer statesmen weigh in on bundesliga malaise rummenigge is not alone in his concern over the comparative quality of the bundesliga .
germany national team coach joachim löw said earlier in the week that he was also alarmed at the poor showing of the three champions league representatives who have managed a total of just seven points from 12 matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi löw fears young players will lack international experience " that 's an extremely disappointing international performance , " löw told german sport news agency sid .
" there 's no way we can be happy about that .
it is no help for players like mario gomez and thomas hitzlsperger or young talents like serdar tasci and sami khedira if they do n't get international exposure . " the voices of concern also included former west germany coach and captain franz beckenbauer as well as ex-captains lothar matthäus and oliver kahn . " the results are alarming , " matthäus told premiere tv .
" you need heart , passion , engagement and an identification with your club in soccer .
you do n't see that at some of these clubs . " kahn said : " the bundesliga might look like a top product from the outside , with lovely packaging , but this great wrapping is n't worth a thing .
we 've got to show that we 've got the goods on the inside too . " in uefa 's five-year ratings , the bundesliga is sixth behind the leagues in spain , england , italy , france and romania . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 . reginald dale is a trans-atlantic relations expert and a senior fellow at the center for strategic and international studies in washington . dw-world.de : what does the united states expect in terms of support and action from chancellor angela merkel 's germany on topics such as iran , afghanistan and the middle east ? reginald dale : germany is seen as less supportive than france on iraq and iran , but the bush administration is pleased that merkel agreed with the us that the time was ripe to launch a new middle east initiative - even if it is unlikely to get very far .
the us wants germany to support tougher sanctions on iran and merkel has made all the right noises to suggest that bush will get what he wants .
how far that support goes , time will tell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants german troops in action in afghanistan there is considerable concern in washington over the way some nato countries , particularly germany , are not pulling their weight in afghanistan , which is seen as a make-or-break test for nato .
if nato fails in afghanistan at least partly because german forces and others have failed to assume their share of the responsibility for the fighting through " caveats " - restrictive rules of engagement and absence from the battlefield - washington is much less likely in future to look to nato for joint operations and will resume its strategy of forming " coalitions of the willing , " something which germany does n't like .
washington wants germany and other countries to get involved in the dirty work of fighting the taliban .
this is very unlikely to happen , something merkel will again reiterate . although german politicians tend to think it was a major achievement to extend the stay of german forces in afghanistan , given the hostility of german public opinion , this is not the way germany 's commitment to afghanistan is seen in washington , where it is regarded as feeble and nit-picking . what is the us view of chancellor merkel ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tactile bush has a very different approach from merkel 's in america , the incident most remembered in the recent history of german-american relations is probably the moment at the st. petersburg g8 summit when bush gave merkel a surprise , high-speed backrub .
a video of the incident was widely circulated , to general merriment .
merkel was clearly horrified by the physical contact , just as she dislikes sarkozy 's constant hugging and kissing . bush and merkel express respect for each other , but their temperaments are completely different .
merkel likes quiet diplomacy , compromise and consensus - bush is driven by conviction and a sense of mission , which makes him much less likely to accept compromise easily . bush sees it as helpful that merkel is less pro-russian and less anti-american than her predecessor gerhard schröder , whom bush detested , and he is pleased that she is more inclined than schröder to understand the threats posed by international terrorism . is the working relationship between president bush and chancellor merkel a balanced one ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel claimed victory at the g8 , but bush was the winner , dale said i would not say that it is balanced , although chancellor merkel would probably say it is .
it seems that merkel , like many others , underestimates bush .
at the g8 heiligendamm summit , merkel claimed a diplomatic triumph in bringing bush on board on climate change , without apparently realizing that bush had run rings round her .
bush got virtually everything he wanted in heiligendamm . in exchange for agreeing to some vague global goal of reducing emissions , bush won on the following points : the goal would not be mandatory ; actions to try to counter climate change should not prevent strong economic growth ; technology is a large part of the answer ; and big emerging nations like china and india must be included in any post-kyoto agreement . bush , in fact , drove a stake through the heart of the whole kyoto approach right under merkel 's nose - and she did n't seem to notice . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 . reginald dale is a trans-atlantic relations expert and a senior fellow at the center for strategic and international studies in washington . dw-world.de : what does the united states expect in terms of support and action from chancellor angela merkel 's germany on topics such as iran , afghanistan and the middle east ? reginald dale : germany is seen as less supportive than france on iraq and iran , but the bush administration is pleased that merkel agreed with the us that the time was ripe to launch a new middle east initiative - even if it is unlikely to get very far .
the us wants germany to support tougher sanctions on iran and merkel has made all the right noises to suggest that bush will get what he wants .
how far that support goes , time will tell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants german troops in action in afghanistan there is considerable concern in washington over the way some nato countries , particularly germany , are not pulling their weight in afghanistan , which is seen as a make-or-break test for nato .
if nato fails in afghanistan at least partly because german forces and others have failed to assume their share of the responsibility for the fighting through " caveats " - restrictive rules of engagement and absence from the battlefield - washington is much less likely in future to look to nato for joint operations and will resume its strategy of forming " coalitions of the willing , " something which germany does n't like .
washington wants germany and other countries to get involved in the dirty work of fighting the taliban .
this is very unlikely to happen , something merkel will again reiterate . although german politicians tend to think it was a major achievement to extend the stay of german forces in afghanistan , given the hostility of german public opinion , this is not the way germany 's commitment to afghanistan is seen in washington , where it is regarded as feeble and nit-picking . what is the us view of chancellor merkel ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tactile bush has a very different approach from merkel 's in america , the incident most remembered in the recent history of german-american relations is probably the moment at the st. petersburg g8 summit when bush gave merkel a surprise , high-speed backrub .
a video of the incident was widely circulated , to general merriment .
merkel was clearly horrified by the physical contact , just as she dislikes sarkozy 's constant hugging and kissing . bush and merkel express respect for each other , but their temperaments are completely different .
merkel likes quiet diplomacy , compromise and consensus - bush is driven by conviction and a sense of mission , which makes him much less likely to accept compromise easily . bush sees it as helpful that merkel is less pro-russian and less anti-american than her predecessor gerhard schröder , whom bush detested , and he is pleased that she is more inclined than schröder to understand the threats posed by international terrorism . is the working relationship between president bush and chancellor merkel a balanced one ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel claimed victory at the g8 , but bush was the winner , dale said i would not say that it is balanced , although chancellor merkel would probably say it is .
it seems that merkel , like many others , underestimates bush .
at the g8 heiligendamm summit , merkel claimed a diplomatic triumph in bringing bush on board on climate change , without apparently realizing that bush had run rings round her .
bush got virtually everything he wanted in heiligendamm . in exchange for agreeing to some vague global goal of reducing emissions , bush won on the following points : the goal would not be mandatory ; actions to try to counter climate change should not prevent strong economic growth ; technology is a large part of the answer ; and big emerging nations like china and india must be included in any post-kyoto agreement . bush , in fact , drove a stake through the heart of the whole kyoto approach right under merkel 's nose - and she did n't seem to notice . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 . reginald dale is a trans-atlantic relations expert and a senior fellow at the center for strategic and international studies in washington . dw-world.de : what does the united states expect in terms of support and action from chancellor angela merkel 's germany on topics such as iran , afghanistan and the middle east ? reginald dale : germany is seen as less supportive than france on iraq and iran , but the bush administration is pleased that merkel agreed with the us that the time was ripe to launch a new middle east initiative - even if it is unlikely to get very far .
the us wants germany to support tougher sanctions on iran and merkel has made all the right noises to suggest that bush will get what he wants .
how far that support goes , time will tell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants german troops in action in afghanistan there is considerable concern in washington over the way some nato countries , particularly germany , are not pulling their weight in afghanistan , which is seen as a make-or-break test for nato .
if nato fails in afghanistan at least partly because german forces and others have failed to assume their share of the responsibility for the fighting through " caveats " - restrictive rules of engagement and absence from the battlefield - washington is much less likely in future to look to nato for joint operations and will resume its strategy of forming " coalitions of the willing , " something which germany does n't like .
washington wants germany and other countries to get involved in the dirty work of fighting the taliban .
this is very unlikely to happen , something merkel will again reiterate . although german politicians tend to think it was a major achievement to extend the stay of german forces in afghanistan , given the hostility of german public opinion , this is not the way germany 's commitment to afghanistan is seen in washington , where it is regarded as feeble and nit-picking . what is the us view of chancellor merkel ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tactile bush has a very different approach from merkel 's in america , the incident most remembered in the recent history of german-american relations is probably the moment at the st. petersburg g8 summit when bush gave merkel a surprise , high-speed backrub .
a video of the incident was widely circulated , to general merriment .
merkel was clearly horrified by the physical contact , just as she dislikes sarkozy 's constant hugging and kissing . bush and merkel express respect for each other , but their temperaments are completely different .
merkel likes quiet diplomacy , compromise and consensus - bush is driven by conviction and a sense of mission , which makes him much less likely to accept compromise easily . bush sees it as helpful that merkel is less pro-russian and less anti-american than her predecessor gerhard schröder , whom bush detested , and he is pleased that she is more inclined than schröder to understand the threats posed by international terrorism . is the working relationship between president bush and chancellor merkel a balanced one ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel claimed victory at the g8 , but bush was the winner , dale said i would not say that it is balanced , although chancellor merkel would probably say it is .
it seems that merkel , like many others , underestimates bush .
at the g8 heiligendamm summit , merkel claimed a diplomatic triumph in bringing bush on board on climate change , without apparently realizing that bush had run rings round her .
bush got virtually everything he wanted in heiligendamm . in exchange for agreeing to some vague global goal of reducing emissions , bush won on the following points : the goal would not be mandatory ; actions to try to counter climate change should not prevent strong economic growth ; technology is a large part of the answer ; and big emerging nations like china and india must be included in any post-kyoto agreement . bush , in fact , drove a stake through the heart of the whole kyoto approach right under merkel 's nose - and she did n't seem to notice . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is a view echoed by many big names in the german game . rummenigge 's comments follow a week of german clubs in european competition , with not one of the six clubs in action able to score a victory . he said the bundesliga could no longer compete financially with the top leagues in spain , england or italy . " we have to be clear that we no longer have a chance internationally , " he told the daily stuttgarter nachrichten on friday , nov .
9 .
" there is n't a manager or coach in the world who can compensate for this competitive disadvantage . " in the champions league , bundesliga champions vfl stuttgart are now out of contention after four successive defeats .
stuttgart will not even have the consolation of dropping into the uefa cup as third-placed finishers in their group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen 's campaign ended with defeat to lazio meanwhile werder bremen , who were beaten 2-1 by lazio on tuesday , are bottom of their group and schalke 04 , who drew 0-0 at home to chelsea , are third in their group . in uefa cup group matches thursday , bayern munich were held to a 2-2 draw at home to bolton wanderers , while nuremberg were beaten 2-0 at home by everton and bayer leverkusen went down 2-1 at spartak moscow .
the other german side in europe , sv hamburg , were without a game . rummenigge criticizes bayern 's uefa display rummenigge also publicly criticized bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld 's tactics after the draw with bolton , who sit just one place off the bottom of the english premier league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge says german teams are no longer competitive the bayern official lashed out at hitzfeld for replacing key players such as franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger for the final half hour with bayern leading 2-1 , which allowed bolton to grab a late equalizer . " i 'm really annoyed , " rummenigge had told journalists after the draw .
" it would have been very easy to win this one and advance .
the spectators have a right to see the best team play .
football is not mathematics .
you ca n't calculate everything . " hitzfeld said he did not want to directly comment on rummenigge 's remarks , but explained that he had wanted to rest ribery and schweinsteiger ahead of the bundesliga match at vfb stuttgart on saturday . " i hope i know the basic math of soccer , and i try to apply that , " said hitzfeld , who studied mathematics at university .
" i believe that i found the right mixture so that we can win in stuttgart , " hitzfeld also said , he wanted to rotate some of the players to prevent injuries . " it was a reasonable decision , " he added .
" we need to get back on track at stuttgart after two league draws . " hitzfeld added that he was not worried about rummenigge 's attack . " i 'm used to stormy weather , " he said .
" you should n't let yourself be influenced by such petty issues . " funding adding to lack of german competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke matched moneybags chelsea in the score only rummenigge 's tirade against bundesliga teams continued with a complaint that the german representatives in the champions league were " not sufficiently competitive " against their rivals from other major european leagues who were earning vastly more from television broadcast sales . the 52-year-old former international called for a new distribution of tv earnings in the bundesliga , saying a team like vfb stuttgart had to be treated differently from clubs such as energie cottbus or vfl bochum . " either we decide on individual marketing , or the key to distribution has to be aligned to the status and merit of the respective clubs , " he said . finance was now the key in international soccer , enabling top clubs to invest in quality players . " the bundesliga is buying only quantity on the transfer market .
one can see the result of this in the champions league , " rummenigge added . soccer statesmen weigh in on bundesliga malaise rummenigge is not alone in his concern over the comparative quality of the bundesliga .
germany national team coach joachim löw said earlier in the week that he was also alarmed at the poor showing of the three champions league representatives who have managed a total of just seven points from 12 matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi löw fears young players will lack international experience " that 's an extremely disappointing international performance , " löw told german sport news agency sid .
" there 's no way we can be happy about that .
it is no help for players like mario gomez and thomas hitzlsperger or young talents like serdar tasci and sami khedira if they do n't get international exposure . " the voices of concern also included former west germany coach and captain franz beckenbauer as well as ex-captains lothar matthäus and oliver kahn . " the results are alarming , " matthäus told premiere tv .
" you need heart , passion , engagement and an identification with your club in soccer .
you do n't see that at some of these clubs . " kahn said : " the bundesliga might look like a top product from the outside , with lovely packaging , but this great wrapping is n't worth a thing .
we 've got to show that we 've got the goods on the inside too .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . dw 's nina werkhäuser thinks germany 's participation in operation enduring freedom is not making the world a safer place .
how can she honestly believe withdrawing from oef , or any of the other operations , will make the world a safer place ?
she can not , based on reality and the need to maintain waging the war on terror wherever it is .
accept it or not , there is a war in the world that was started with attacks on the united states , even prior to september 11 .
and it is time to stop blaming the united states for the war 's existence .
further , the time is overdue to stop acting as if this war is of no concern to germany and the rest of europe .
why not ask yourself , how close to your house must the war come before you think it is time to be involved ? - mark wald , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has nearly 3,000 troops serving under different mandates in afghanistan from the onset i believed that invading iraq was wrong and respected germany 's resolve in not becoming embroiled in that conflict .
however , even though the us has mishandled the situation in afghanistan , oef is a legitimate effort to contain terrorism .
the germans , at least from media reports , appear to have been complaining about their role there from day one .
while i truly do not think germany should have to continue to thank the us forever for the berlin airlift or for our troops playing a role in germany 's defense , i am somewhat chagrined as a veteran who served in germany that the germans are looking for a free ride .
if germany does not want a role in defending the free world , then it should give up its military , plant flowers , and let whoever walk over it . - rudy rau , us the writer demands germany gets out of all commitments to fight against terrorism .
though not stated outright , that is the crux of her argument .
germany is one of the group of eight highly industrialized countries and has certain moral obligations to lesser nations .
what does the writer wants to happen ?
a germany not involved in any worrisome projects ?
isolation is not the answer .
germany , or for that matter any nation , has got to strike a balance . - benedict aloysius , australia by all means germany should withdraw from the war on terrorism !
after all , other braver nations will do the dirty work necessary to enable germany , inc. to continue to flood the world with mercedes and bmws , while sanctimoniously criticizing the world 's appetite for oil ! - alfred lindner , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany is a crucial country in terms of building coalitions to deal with the threats we face . " but while merkel has stated a preference for giving the united nations a lead role in dealing with iran , bush has ratcheted up his rhetoric by saying that allowing tehran nuclear weapons could end in world war iii and that action needed to be taken quickly . disagreement over what step to take next will make reaching a us-german position difficult , according to thomas greven , a senior research fellow at the german institute for international relations in berlin .

however , despite the majority vote in favor of the " memorial to the freedom and unity of germany , " there were still many voices calling for a second monument in leipzig , the site of the demonstrations that marked the beginning of the end for communist rule in east germany .
former mayor of leipzig and current minister of transport wolfgang tiefensee , backed by saxony state premier georg milbradt , led the calls for the city to be included , but the motion was denied .
eastern states no nearer to being self-sufficient tiefensee , the federal representative for the states from the former east , injected a dose of reality into proceedings by presenting his annual findings on the progress of the eastern regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee said the east 's positives should be focused on he told the bundestag that the eastern states were still far from being self-supporting , pointing out that his report focused on the divisions between east and west .
" we always talk only about the differences , " tiefensee said , adding that it would be more productive to highlight positive developments , which he said included eastern economic growth between 10 and 11 percent and a reduction of short-term unemployment .
but tiefensee added that long-term unemployment in the east was still a big problem and he urged the government to consider additional measures to the solidarity pact agreement that sends taxpayers ' money to the east , such as the continuation of the capital investment bonus beyond its current deadline of 2009 .
critics complain of western bias the location of the " memorial to the freedom and unity of germany " has been cited by some critics as just another example of how weighted the idea of unification towards the west has become .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig remembers the demos which led to unification luc jochimsen , cultural spokeswoman for the left party said earlier this week that the monument focuses on unification and ignores more important aspects of the 1989 revolution .
" we think berlin is the wrong place .
we think its focus should be on leipzig , not berlin , and on oct .
9 , not nov .
9 , " she said , referring to the start of the leipzig demonstrations in 1989 .
many germans still have mixed feelings about reunification , making the debate over the new monument even more complicated .
klaus-peter schöppner of the emnid polling institute told reuters this week that the majority of germans still think of the former communist east as a " second-class germany , " while a recent survey showed that one out of five germans would like to have the berlin wall back . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , border controls between eight european countries will cease .
malta will follow suit a short while later .
dw 's klaus dahmann is critical of the decision by eu interior ministers to expand the schengen zone . this early european christmas present has received little by way of media coverage in germany , although the implications for european union citizens are almost as far-reaching as those attached to the major eu expansion three years ago .
the deep gash that the iron curtain once scored right across the continent has already grown over , and with border controls about to be dropped , the physical scar will become invisible . the move , which will bring the newer eu countries into line with their western contemporaries , will also ease cross-border travel for citizens of older schengen countries .
germans will only have to show their passports to one of their neighbors : the swiss .
bildunterschrift : but to what extent is a relaxing of border controls and an expansion of the schengen zone a positive thing ?
the answer is : it 's good if you 're on the inside , but not so good if you are not .
barriers to russia , ukraine and serbia are getting higher and security measures are getting tighter .
bridges along the border between slovenia and croatia have been torn down , and there is no doubt that ljubljana is feeling an element of schadenfreude towards its non-schengen neighbor . in rolling its open-border system further eastwards , the eu is also opening up new and shorter crime routes .
regardless of the number of fences and security installations , and despite europe-wide visa data collection , europol and national police authorities will have fences of their own to climb if they are to take on the new challenges coming their way . the accusations of corruption currently facing the czech embassy in vietnam are a case in point .
before the czech republic has even become an official member of the schengen clan , german intelligence services pinpointed an increasing number of vietnamese citizens entering the country .
the allegations have not been proven , but they go to show that more embassies will have to implement tougher visa regulations in the future . yet even then , schengen will never manage to dispel the fear of certain european countries becoming a hot bet of economic refugees .
there is still a long way to go to solve integration problems within the union , and eu member states are far from reaching a consensus on how many immigrants they should allow into their respective territories . to the outside world , therefore , european politicians continue to sell higher external fences as the solution .
and rather than admit to their own citizens that the new schengen agreement will mean more workers from poland , slovakia or hungary seeking their fortune in the richer countries of western europe , they have opted to keep this celebration quiet . klaus dahmann is a correspondent for deutsche welle -lrb- tkw -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is a view echoed by many big names in the german game . rummenigge 's comments follow a week of german clubs in european competition , with not one of the six clubs in action able to score a victory . he said the bundesliga could no longer compete financially with the top leagues in spain , england or italy . " we have to be clear that we no longer have a chance internationally , " he told the daily stuttgarter nachrichten on friday , nov .
9 .
" there is n't a manager or coach in the world who can compensate for this competitive disadvantage . " in the champions league , bundesliga champions vfl stuttgart are now out of contention after four successive defeats .
stuttgart will not even have the consolation of dropping into the uefa cup as third-placed finishers in their group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen 's campaign ended with defeat to lazio meanwhile werder bremen , who were beaten 2-1 by lazio on tuesday , are bottom of their group and schalke 04 , who drew 0-0 at home to chelsea , are third in their group . in uefa cup group matches thursday , bayern munich were held to a 2-2 draw at home to bolton wanderers , while nuremberg were beaten 2-0 at home by everton and bayer leverkusen went down 2-1 at spartak moscow .
the other german side in europe , sv hamburg , were without a game . rummenigge criticizes bayern 's uefa display rummenigge also publicly criticized bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld 's tactics after the draw with bolton , who sit just one place off the bottom of the english premier league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge says german teams are no longer competitive the bayern official lashed out at hitzfeld for replacing key players such as franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger for the final half hour with bayern leading 2-1 , which allowed bolton to grab a late equalizer . " i 'm really annoyed , " rummenigge had told journalists after the draw .
" it would have been very easy to win this one and advance .
the spectators have a right to see the best team play .
football is not mathematics .
you ca n't calculate everything . " hitzfeld said he did not want to directly comment on rummenigge 's remarks , but explained that he had wanted to rest ribery and schweinsteiger ahead of the bundesliga match at vfb stuttgart on saturday . " i hope i know the basic math of soccer , and i try to apply that , " said hitzfeld , who studied mathematics at university .
" i believe that i found the right mixture so that we can win in stuttgart , " hitzfeld also said , he wanted to rotate some of the players to prevent injuries . " it was a reasonable decision , " he added .
" we need to get back on track at stuttgart after two league draws . " hitzfeld added that he was not worried about rummenigge 's attack . " i 'm used to stormy weather , " he said .
" you should n't let yourself be influenced by such petty issues . " funding adding to lack of german competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke matched moneybags chelsea in the score only rummenigge 's tirade against bundesliga teams continued with a complaint that the german representatives in the champions league were " not sufficiently competitive " against their rivals from other major european leagues who were earning vastly more from television broadcast sales . the 52-year-old former international called for a new distribution of tv earnings in the bundesliga , saying a team like vfb stuttgart had to be treated differently from clubs such as energie cottbus or vfl bochum . " either we decide on individual marketing , or the key to distribution has to be aligned to the status and merit of the respective clubs , " he said . finance was now the key in international soccer , enabling top clubs to invest in quality players . " the bundesliga is buying only quantity on the transfer market .
one can see the result of this in the champions league , " rummenigge added . soccer statesmen weigh in on bundesliga malaise rummenigge is not alone in his concern over the comparative quality of the bundesliga .
germany national team coach joachim löw said earlier in the week that he was also alarmed at the poor showing of the three champions league representatives who have managed a total of just seven points from 12 matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi löw fears young players will lack international experience " that 's an extremely disappointing international performance , " löw told german sport news agency sid .
" there 's no way we can be happy about that .
it is no help for players like mario gomez and thomas hitzlsperger or young talents like serdar tasci and sami khedira if they do n't get international exposure . " the voices of concern also included former west germany coach and captain franz beckenbauer as well as ex-captains lothar matthäus and oliver kahn . " the results are alarming , " matthäus told premiere tv .
" you need heart , passion , engagement and an identification with your club in soccer .
you do n't see that at some of these clubs . " kahn said : " the bundesliga might look like a top product from the outside , with lovely packaging , but this great wrapping is n't worth a thing .
we 've got to show that we 've got the goods on the inside too . " in uefa 's five-year ratings , the bundesliga is sixth behind the leagues in spain , england , italy , france and romania . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is a view echoed by many big names in the german game . rummenigge 's comments follow a week of german clubs in european competition , with not one of the six clubs in action able to score a victory . he said the bundesliga could no longer compete financially with the top leagues in spain , england or italy . " we have to be clear that we no longer have a chance internationally , " he told the daily stuttgarter nachrichten on friday , nov .
9 .
" there is n't a manager or coach in the world who can compensate for this competitive disadvantage . " in the champions league , bundesliga champions vfl stuttgart are now out of contention after four successive defeats .
stuttgart will not even have the consolation of dropping into the uefa cup as third-placed finishers in their group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen 's campaign ended with defeat to lazio meanwhile werder bremen , who were beaten 2-1 by lazio on tuesday , are bottom of their group and schalke 04 , who drew 0-0 at home to chelsea , are third in their group . in uefa cup group matches thursday , bayern munich were held to a 2-2 draw at home to bolton wanderers , while nuremberg were beaten 2-0 at home by everton and bayer leverkusen went down 2-1 at spartak moscow .
the other german side in europe , sv hamburg , were without a game . rummenigge criticizes bayern 's uefa display rummenigge also publicly criticized bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld 's tactics after the draw with bolton , who sit just one place off the bottom of the english premier league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge says german teams are no longer competitive the bayern official lashed out at hitzfeld for replacing key players such as franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger for the final half hour with bayern leading 2-1 , which allowed bolton to grab a late equalizer . " i 'm really annoyed , " rummenigge had told journalists after the draw .
" it would have been very easy to win this one and advance .
the spectators have a right to see the best team play .
football is not mathematics .
you ca n't calculate everything . " hitzfeld said he did not want to directly comment on rummenigge 's remarks , but explained that he had wanted to rest ribery and schweinsteiger ahead of the bundesliga match at vfb stuttgart on saturday . " i hope i know the basic math of soccer , and i try to apply that , " said hitzfeld , who studied mathematics at university .
" i believe that i found the right mixture so that we can win in stuttgart , " hitzfeld also said , he wanted to rotate some of the players to prevent injuries . " it was a reasonable decision , " he added .
" we need to get back on track at stuttgart after two league draws . " hitzfeld added that he was not worried about rummenigge 's attack . " i 'm used to stormy weather , " he said .
" you should n't let yourself be influenced by such petty issues . " funding adding to lack of german competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke matched moneybags chelsea in the score only rummenigge 's tirade against bundesliga teams continued with a complaint that the german representatives in the champions league were " not sufficiently competitive " against their rivals from other major european leagues who were earning vastly more from television broadcast sales . the 52-year-old former international called for a new distribution of tv earnings in the bundesliga , saying a team like vfb stuttgart had to be treated differently from clubs such as energie cottbus or vfl bochum . " either we decide on individual marketing , or the key to distribution has to be aligned to the status and merit of the respective clubs , " he said . finance was now the key in international soccer , enabling top clubs to invest in quality players . " the bundesliga is buying only quantity on the transfer market .
one can see the result of this in the champions league , " rummenigge added . soccer statesmen weigh in on bundesliga malaise rummenigge is not alone in his concern over the comparative quality of the bundesliga .
germany national team coach joachim löw said earlier in the week that he was also alarmed at the poor showing of the three champions league representatives who have managed a total of just seven points from 12 matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi löw fears young players will lack international experience " that 's an extremely disappointing international performance , " löw told german sport news agency sid .
" there 's no way we can be happy about that .
it is no help for players like mario gomez and thomas hitzlsperger or young talents like serdar tasci and sami khedira if they do n't get international exposure . " the voices of concern also included former west germany coach and captain franz beckenbauer as well as ex-captains lothar matthäus and oliver kahn . " the results are alarming , " matthäus told premiere tv .
" you need heart , passion , engagement and an identification with your club in soccer .
you do n't see that at some of these clubs . " kahn said : " the bundesliga might look like a top product from the outside , with lovely packaging , but this great wrapping is n't worth a thing .
we 've got to show that we 've got the goods on the inside too . " in uefa 's five-year ratings , the bundesliga is sixth behind the leagues in spain , england , italy , france and romania . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : europe without borders - 15 years of the schengen zone eu opens internal borders to long-stay visa holders , sparking security fears checkpoint-free europe confounds germany 's skeptics 15 years of visa-free travel in europe europe 's unity with swiss in libya visa row tested by business links european union -pipe- 09.11.2007 opinion : visa-free travel creates more fences for eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on dec .
21 , border controls between eight european countries will cease .
malta will follow suit a short while later .
dw 's klaus dahmann is critical of the decision by eu interior ministers to expand the schengen zone . this early european christmas present has received little by way of media coverage in germany , although the implications for european union citizens are almost as far-reaching as those attached to the major eu expansion three years ago .
the deep gash that the iron curtain once scored right across the continent has already grown over , and with border controls about to be dropped , the physical scar will become invisible . the move , which will bring the newer eu countries into line with their western contemporaries , will also ease cross-border travel for citizens of older schengen countries .
germans will only have to show their passports to one of their neighbors : the swiss .
bildunterschrift : but to what extent is a relaxing of border controls and an expansion of the schengen zone a positive thing ?
the answer is : it 's good if you 're on the inside , but not so good if you are not .
barriers to russia , ukraine and serbia are getting higher and security measures are getting tighter .
bridges along the border between slovenia and croatia have been torn down , and there is no doubt that ljubljana is feeling an element of schadenfreude towards its non-schengen neighbor . in rolling its open-border system further eastwards , the eu is also opening up new and shorter crime routes .
regardless of the number of fences and security installations , and despite europe-wide visa data collection , europol and national police authorities will have fences of their own to climb if they are to take on the new challenges coming their way . the accusations of corruption currently facing the czech embassy in vietnam are a case in point .
before the czech republic has even become an official member of the schengen clan , german intelligence services pinpointed an increasing number of vietnamese citizens entering the country .
the allegations have not been proven , but they go to show that more embassies will have to implement tougher visa regulations in the future . yet even then , schengen will never manage to dispel the fear of certain european countries becoming a hot bet of economic refugees .
there is still a long way to go to solve integration problems within the union , and eu member states are far from reaching a consensus on how many immigrants they should allow into their respective territories . to the outside world , therefore , european politicians continue to sell higher external fences as the solution .
and rather than admit to their own citizens that the new schengen agreement will mean more workers from poland , slovakia or hungary seeking their fortune in the richer countries of western europe , they have opted to keep this celebration quiet . klaus dahmann is a correspondent for deutsche welle -lrb- tkw -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is a view echoed by many big names in the german game . rummenigge 's comments follow a week of german clubs in european competition , with not one of the six clubs in action able to score a victory . he said the bundesliga could no longer compete financially with the top leagues in spain , england or italy . " we have to be clear that we no longer have a chance internationally , " he told the daily stuttgarter nachrichten on friday , nov .
9 .
" there is n't a manager or coach in the world who can compensate for this competitive disadvantage . " in the champions league , bundesliga champions vfl stuttgart are now out of contention after four successive defeats .
stuttgart will not even have the consolation of dropping into the uefa cup as third-placed finishers in their group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen 's campaign ended with defeat to lazio meanwhile werder bremen , who were beaten 2-1 by lazio on tuesday , are bottom of their group and schalke 04 , who drew 0-0 at home to chelsea , are third in their group . in uefa cup group matches thursday , bayern munich were held to a 2-2 draw at home to bolton wanderers , while nuremberg were beaten 2-0 at home by everton and bayer leverkusen went down 2-1 at spartak moscow .
the other german side in europe , sv hamburg , were without a game . rummenigge criticizes bayern 's uefa display rummenigge also publicly criticized bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld 's tactics after the draw with bolton , who sit just one place off the bottom of the english premier league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge says german teams are no longer competitive the bayern official lashed out at hitzfeld for replacing key players such as franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger for the final half hour with bayern leading 2-1 , which allowed bolton to grab a late equalizer . " i 'm really annoyed , " rummenigge had told journalists after the draw .
" it would have been very easy to win this one and advance .
the spectators have a right to see the best team play .
football is not mathematics .
you ca n't calculate everything . " hitzfeld said he did not want to directly comment on rummenigge 's remarks , but explained that he had wanted to rest ribery and schweinsteiger ahead of the bundesliga match at vfb stuttgart on saturday . " i hope i know the basic math of soccer , and i try to apply that , " said hitzfeld , who studied mathematics at university .
" i believe that i found the right mixture so that we can win in stuttgart , " hitzfeld also said , he wanted to rotate some of the players to prevent injuries . " it was a reasonable decision , " he added .
" we need to get back on track at stuttgart after two league draws . " hitzfeld added that he was not worried about rummenigge 's attack . " i 'm used to stormy weather , " he said .
" you should n't let yourself be influenced by such petty issues . " funding adding to lack of german competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke matched moneybags chelsea in the score only rummenigge 's tirade against bundesliga teams continued with a complaint that the german representatives in the champions league were " not sufficiently competitive " against their rivals from other major european leagues who were earning vastly more from television broadcast sales . the 52-year-old former international called for a new distribution of tv earnings in the bundesliga , saying a team like vfb stuttgart had to be treated differently from clubs such as energie cottbus or vfl bochum . " either we decide on individual marketing , or the key to distribution has to be aligned to the status and merit of the respective clubs , " he said . finance was now the key in international soccer , enabling top clubs to invest in quality players . " the bundesliga is buying only quantity on the transfer market .
one can see the result of this in the champions league , " rummenigge added . soccer statesmen weigh in on bundesliga malaise rummenigge is not alone in his concern over the comparative quality of the bundesliga .
germany national team coach joachim löw said earlier in the week that he was also alarmed at the poor showing of the three champions league representatives who have managed a total of just seven points from 12 matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi löw fears young players will lack international experience " that 's an extremely disappointing international performance , " löw told german sport news agency sid .
" there 's no way we can be happy about that .
it is no help for players like mario gomez and thomas hitzlsperger or young talents like serdar tasci and sami khedira if they do n't get international exposure . " the voices of concern also included former west germany coach and captain franz beckenbauer as well as ex-captains lothar matthäus and oliver kahn . " the results are alarming , " matthäus told premiere tv .
" you need heart , passion , engagement and an identification with your club in soccer .
you do n't see that at some of these clubs . " kahn said : " the bundesliga might look like a top product from the outside , with lovely packaging , but this great wrapping is n't worth a thing .
we 've got to show that we 've got the goods on the inside too . " in uefa 's five-year ratings , the bundesliga is sixth behind the leagues in spain , england , italy , france and romania . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 . reginald dale is a trans-atlantic relations expert and a senior fellow at the center for strategic and international studies in washington . dw-world.de : what does the united states expect in terms of support and action from chancellor angela merkel 's germany on topics such as iran , afghanistan and the middle east ? reginald dale : germany is seen as less supportive than france on iraq and iran , but the bush administration is pleased that merkel agreed with the us that the time was ripe to launch a new middle east initiative - even if it is unlikely to get very far .
the us wants germany to support tougher sanctions on iran and merkel has made all the right noises to suggest that bush will get what he wants .
how far that support goes , time will tell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants german troops in action in afghanistan there is considerable concern in washington over the way some nato countries , particularly germany , are not pulling their weight in afghanistan , which is seen as a make-or-break test for nato .
if nato fails in afghanistan at least partly because german forces and others have failed to assume their share of the responsibility for the fighting through " caveats " - restrictive rules of engagement and absence from the battlefield - washington is much less likely in future to look to nato for joint operations and will resume its strategy of forming " coalitions of the willing , " something which germany does n't like .
washington wants germany and other countries to get involved in the dirty work of fighting the taliban .
this is very unlikely to happen , something merkel will again reiterate . although german politicians tend to think it was a major achievement to extend the stay of german forces in afghanistan , given the hostility of german public opinion , this is not the way germany 's commitment to afghanistan is seen in washington , where it is regarded as feeble and nit-picking . what is the us view of chancellor merkel ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tactile bush has a very different approach from merkel 's in america , the incident most remembered in the recent history of german-american relations is probably the moment at the st. petersburg g8 summit when bush gave merkel a surprise , high-speed backrub .
a video of the incident was widely circulated , to general merriment .
merkel was clearly horrified by the physical contact , just as she dislikes sarkozy 's constant hugging and kissing . bush and merkel express respect for each other , but their temperaments are completely different .
merkel likes quiet diplomacy , compromise and consensus - bush is driven by conviction and a sense of mission , which makes him much less likely to accept compromise easily . bush sees it as helpful that merkel is less pro-russian and less anti-american than her predecessor gerhard schröder , whom bush detested , and he is pleased that she is more inclined than schröder to understand the threats posed by international terrorism . is the working relationship between president bush and chancellor merkel a balanced one ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel claimed victory at the g8 , but bush was the winner , dale said i would not say that it is balanced , although chancellor merkel would probably say it is .
it seems that merkel , like many others , underestimates bush .
at the g8 heiligendamm summit , merkel claimed a diplomatic triumph in bringing bush on board on climate change , without apparently realizing that bush had run rings round her .
bush got virtually everything he wanted in heiligendamm . in exchange for agreeing to some vague global goal of reducing emissions , bush won on the following points : the goal would not be mandatory ; actions to try to counter climate change should not prevent strong economic growth ; technology is a large part of the answer ; and big emerging nations like china and india must be included in any post-kyoto agreement . bush , in fact , drove a stake through the heart of the whole kyoto approach right under merkel 's nose - and she did n't seem to notice . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de telecommunications -pipe- 09.11.2007 apple iphone missing features europeans expect , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple fans and the " leading edge " of german consumers bought the iphone on the first day marcus eckstein from the german telecommunications magazine " connect " spoke to dw-world.de about the apple iphone , which went on sale on friday , nov .
9 in germany and the uk . marcus eckstein is the editor for the mobile phone section of connect magazine in stuttgart . dw-world.de : the apple iphone is being released with much fanfare .
will the demand in germany be as big as it was in the us ? markus eckstein : there is a strong apple fan base here that will be going to the t-mobile shop along with the guys we call the " leading edge , " people who need to always have the newest phone with the most features .
but the euphoria that surrounded the release of the iphone in the us is not happening here since it has been all over the internet for months . germans are traditionally more skeptical when it comes to gadgets .
there will be people who once they see the phone being used in real life decide that they want one .
i think there will be strong demand for the phone . one of the biggest criticisms of the iphone in the us is the slow speed of the network it uses and the high cost of the service .
will this also be the case for t-mobile ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-online has exclusive rights to sell the iphone in germany t-mobile has a lot of wifi hotspots and their edge network -lsb- mobile internet service -rsb- is quite good .
but i think a lot of people will be hesitant to buy the phone because of the high cost of the t-mobile contract . will there be a lot of people buying the iphone in order to " unlock " it and use it on other mobile networks ? i think the situation is different in germany .
in the us you can buy the phone before you sign any contract .
here you do not get the phone until you sign a contract .
plus the phone is only being sold at t-mobile stores .
if you want to try and unlock the phone , you are better off trying to find a us version on ebay . will the device live up to expectations ? if you compare the iphone to other phones then i would say yes .
what is really new and different is the user interface - especially the large touch screen .
the user-friendly interface of the phone opens up a lot of new features - browsing the internet or watching youtube videos - for a broader audience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german comedian ruth moschner presents the iphone in many ways it is really an american product .
there are some functions that europeans are used to that the iphone does not have like being able to design a ringtone for groups of contacts like your family so you know when they are calling or sending out a contact via bluetooth or sms .
these are things that many consumers here are used to . is the iphone , and its user-friendly interface , going to influence others in the mobile phone industry to change their products ? this is really the first time that a newcomer has come into the market with such a hit product that is getting so much attention . you can already see the first signs that things are changing .
for example , nokia just announced that they are going to be changing their user system next year .
like apple , they do not usually announce changes like this so far in advance . interview : ole tangen jr . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 in germany and the uk . marcus eckstein is the editor for the mobile phone section of connect magazine in stuttgart . dw-world.de : the apple iphone is being released with much fanfare .
will the demand in germany be as big as it was in the us ? markus eckstein : there is a strong apple fan base here that will be going to the t-mobile shop along with the guys we call the " leading edge , " people who need to always have the newest phone with the most features .
but the euphoria that surrounded the release of the iphone in the us is not happening here since it has been all over the internet for months . germans are traditionally more skeptical when it comes to gadgets .
there will be people who once they see the phone being used in real life decide that they want one .
i think there will be strong demand for the phone . one of the biggest criticisms of the iphone in the us is the slow speed of the network it uses and the high cost of the service .
will this also be the case for t-mobile ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-online has exclusive rights to sell the iphone in germany t-mobile has a lot of wifi hotspots and their edge network -lsb- mobile internet service -rsb- is quite good .
but i think a lot of people will be hesitant to buy the phone because of the high cost of the t-mobile contract . will there be a lot of people buying the iphone in order to " unlock " it and use it on other mobile networks ? i think the situation is different in germany .
in the us you can buy the phone before you sign any contract .
here you do not get the phone until you sign a contract .
plus the phone is only being sold at t-mobile stores .
if you want to try and unlock the phone , you are better off trying to find a us version on ebay . will the device live up to expectations ? if you compare the iphone to other phones then i would say yes .
what is really new and different is the user interface - especially the large touch screen .
the user-friendly interface of the phone opens up a lot of new features - browsing the internet or watching youtube videos - for a broader audience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german comedian ruth moschner presents the iphone in many ways it is really an american product .
there are some functions that europeans are used to that the iphone does not have like being able to design a ringtone for groups of contacts like your family so you know when they are calling or sending out a contact via bluetooth or sms .
these are things that many consumers here are used to . is the iphone , and its user-friendly interface , going to influence others in the mobile phone industry to change their products ? this is really the first time that a newcomer has come into the market with such a hit product that is getting so much attention . you can already see the first signs that things are changing .
for example , nokia just announced that they are going to be changing their user system next year .
like apple , they do not usually announce changes like this so far in advance . interview : ole tangen jr . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is a view echoed by many big names in the german game . rummenigge 's comments follow a week of german clubs in european competition , with not one of the six clubs in action able to score a victory . he said the bundesliga could no longer compete financially with the top leagues in spain , england or italy . " we have to be clear that we no longer have a chance internationally , " he told the daily stuttgarter nachrichten on friday , nov .
9 .
" there is n't a manager or coach in the world who can compensate for this competitive disadvantage . " in the champions league , bundesliga champions vfl stuttgart are now out of contention after four successive defeats .
stuttgart will not even have the consolation of dropping into the uefa cup as third-placed finishers in their group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen 's campaign ended with defeat to lazio meanwhile werder bremen , who were beaten 2-1 by lazio on tuesday , are bottom of their group and schalke 04 , who drew 0-0 at home to chelsea , are third in their group . in uefa cup group matches thursday , bayern munich were held to a 2-2 draw at home to bolton wanderers , while nuremberg were beaten 2-0 at home by everton and bayer leverkusen went down 2-1 at spartak moscow .
the other german side in europe , sv hamburg , were without a game . rummenigge criticizes bayern 's uefa display rummenigge also publicly criticized bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld 's tactics after the draw with bolton , who sit just one place off the bottom of the english premier league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge says german teams are no longer competitive the bayern official lashed out at hitzfeld for replacing key players such as franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger for the final half hour with bayern leading 2-1 , which allowed bolton to grab a late equalizer . " i 'm really annoyed , " rummenigge had told journalists after the draw .
" it would have been very easy to win this one and advance .
the spectators have a right to see the best team play .
football is not mathematics .
you ca n't calculate everything . " hitzfeld said he did not want to directly comment on rummenigge 's remarks , but explained that he had wanted to rest ribery and schweinsteiger ahead of the bundesliga match at vfb stuttgart on saturday . " i hope i know the basic math of soccer , and i try to apply that , " said hitzfeld , who studied mathematics at university .
" i believe that i found the right mixture so that we can win in stuttgart , " hitzfeld also said , he wanted to rotate some of the players to prevent injuries . " it was a reasonable decision , " he added .
" we need to get back on track at stuttgart after two league draws . " hitzfeld added that he was not worried about rummenigge 's attack . " i 'm used to stormy weather , " he said .
" you should n't let yourself be influenced by such petty issues . " funding adding to lack of german competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke matched moneybags chelsea in the score only rummenigge 's tirade against bundesliga teams continued with a complaint that the german representatives in the champions league were " not sufficiently competitive " against their rivals from other major european leagues who were earning vastly more from television broadcast sales . the 52-year-old former international called for a new distribution of tv earnings in the bundesliga , saying a team like vfb stuttgart had to be treated differently from clubs such as energie cottbus or vfl bochum . " either we decide on individual marketing , or the key to distribution has to be aligned to the status and merit of the respective clubs , " he said . finance was now the key in international soccer , enabling top clubs to invest in quality players . " the bundesliga is buying only quantity on the transfer market .
one can see the result of this in the champions league , " rummenigge added . soccer statesmen weigh in on bundesliga malaise rummenigge is not alone in his concern over the comparative quality of the bundesliga .
germany national team coach joachim löw said earlier in the week that he was also alarmed at the poor showing of the three champions league representatives who have managed a total of just seven points from 12 matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi löw fears young players will lack international experience " that 's an extremely disappointing international performance , " löw told german sport news agency sid .
" there 's no way we can be happy about that .
it is no help for players like mario gomez and thomas hitzlsperger or young talents like serdar tasci and sami khedira if they do n't get international exposure . " the voices of concern also included former west germany coach and captain franz beckenbauer as well as ex-captains lothar matthäus and oliver kahn . " the results are alarming , " matthäus told premiere tv .
" you need heart , passion , engagement and an identification with your club in soccer .
you do n't see that at some of these clubs . " kahn said : " the bundesliga might look like a top product from the outside , with lovely packaging , but this great wrapping is n't worth a thing .
we 've got to show that we 've got the goods on the inside too . " in uefa 's five-year ratings , the bundesliga is sixth behind the leagues in spain , england , italy , france and romania . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , 2008 the german parliament has given the go ahead to a law that will allow telephone and internet data to be stored for up to six months despite fierce criticism from the opposition and privacy advocates . the legislation approved friday , nov .
9 , also permits the telephone conversations of lawyers , journalists and doctors to be bugged under certain circumstances .
the decision not to exclude these professions from the law has sparked an outcry from those who rely on being able to speak to their clients or contacts confidentially .
members of parliament , religious clerics and state prosecutors have been provided exceptions to the law .
politicians from the opposition free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the greens and the left party have said they will mount legal challenges to the statute .
the marburger bund doctors ' association has also announced they would have its legality examined .
there have also been protests from journalists ' and publishing associations .
powers subject to judicial permission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police powers to conduct telephone surveillance will be extended under the law , police and german intelligence agencies must receive a court 's permission and show a strong suspicion of illegal activity in order to examine the data held by telephone companies .
the information will allow authorities to determine when and with whom their suspects had telephone , fax or e-mail contact .
police and others with access to the information will also be able to pinpoint where mobile phone calls took place .
the content of the communications will not , however , be provided to investigators .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said friday that criticism of the law had been exaggerated and stressed that it was not " paving the way towards a surveillance state . "
she added that the law would enable the authorities to combat crime and terrorism effectively .
the minister said the law implemented an eu directive in a " minimal fashion . "
but the german commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , said parts of the law exceeded european requirements by failing to exclude less serious crimes .
" a sad day for democracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu directive behind the german law was prompted by the madrid train bombings fdp expert jörg van essen said the legislation " placed citizens under general suspicion . "
he said he wants to appeal to the german constitutional court .
jan korte from the left party called the law one of the biggest attacks on press freedom and said that abuse was bound to occur .
the greens described it as a " black day for civil rights " and a " sad day for democracy . "
siegfried kauder , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , countered the criticism , saying that the law found the right balance between data protection and the need to fight crime .
he said it , in fact , represented an improvement in the legal position of journalists .
the justice minister said the eu directive was a reaction to the terrorist attacks on madrid in march 2004 in which 191 people died .
the perpetrators were tracked down using mobile telephone data .
some 366 parliamentarians voted in favor of the law , while 156 voted against .
there were two abstentions . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . dw 's nina werkhäuser thinks germany 's participation in operation enduring freedom is not making the world a safer place .
how can she honestly believe withdrawing from oef , or any of the other operations , will make the world a safer place ?
she can not , based on reality and the need to maintain waging the war on terror wherever it is .
accept it or not , there is a war in the world that was started with attacks on the united states , even prior to september 11 .
and it is time to stop blaming the united states for the war 's existence .
further , the time is overdue to stop acting as if this war is of no concern to germany and the rest of europe .
why not ask yourself , how close to your house must the war come before you think it is time to be involved ? - mark wald , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has nearly 3,000 troops serving under different mandates in afghanistan from the onset i believed that invading iraq was wrong and respected germany 's resolve in not becoming embroiled in that conflict .
however , even though the us has mishandled the situation in afghanistan , oef is a legitimate effort to contain terrorism .
the germans , at least from media reports , appear to have been complaining about their role there from day one .
while i truly do not think germany should have to continue to thank the us forever for the berlin airlift or for our troops playing a role in germany 's defense , i am somewhat chagrined as a veteran who served in germany that the germans are looking for a free ride .
if germany does not want a role in defending the free world , then it should give up its military , plant flowers , and let whoever walk over it . - rudy rau , us the writer demands germany gets out of all commitments to fight against terrorism .
though not stated outright , that is the crux of her argument .
germany is one of the group of eight highly industrialized countries and has certain moral obligations to lesser nations .
what does the writer wants to happen ?
a germany not involved in any worrisome projects ?
isolation is not the answer .
germany , or for that matter any nation , has got to strike a balance . - benedict aloysius , australia by all means germany should withdraw from the war on terrorism !
after all , other braver nations will do the dirty work necessary to enable germany , inc. to continue to flood the world with mercedes and bmws , while sanctimoniously criticizing the world 's appetite for oil ! - alfred lindner , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 . november in germany rarely offers the kind of nights which inspire people to stand around outside for hours on end .
last night , however was different .
from the early hours of the evening , iphone fans took their places outside a t-mobile shop in cologne , and began the business of waiting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rain was not enough to drive the iphone fans away t-mobile , which has the exclusive contract to sell the new iphone in germany , supplied the waiting crowds with hot drinks , pretzels and blankets .
but there was no real need , as the state-of-the-art phone was all the enticement the shoppers needed to stick it out in the cold . " we are apple fans and i think the phone is the best in the world , " one man told the reuters news agency . but philipp humm , managing director of t-mobile and telekom sales director , who also put in an appearance at the cologne store , said he was expecting the new iphone to be a hit right across the board .
" it is a cult cell phone , " he said " not only for apple fans , but for everyone . "
he said the sales of over one million phones in the us since its launch earlier this year suggested that it would be big business in germany too . high price not too high ? the phone , which comes with a price tag of 399 euros -lrb- $ 585 -rrb- , and which binds its users into a two-year contract at a monthly cost of between 49 and 89 euros , was no deterrent for the cologne crowd .

1 , 2008 the german parliament has given the go ahead to a law that will allow telephone and internet data to be stored for up to six months despite fierce criticism from the opposition and privacy advocates . the legislation approved friday , nov .
9 , also permits the telephone conversations of lawyers , journalists and doctors to be bugged under certain circumstances .
the decision not to exclude these professions from the law has sparked an outcry from those who rely on being able to speak to their clients or contacts confidentially .
members of parliament , religious clerics and state prosecutors have been provided exceptions to the law .
politicians from the opposition free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the greens and the left party have said they will mount legal challenges to the statute .
the marburger bund doctors ' association has also announced they would have its legality examined .
there have also been protests from journalists ' and publishing associations .
powers subject to judicial permission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police powers to conduct telephone surveillance will be extended under the law , police and german intelligence agencies must receive a court 's permission and show a strong suspicion of illegal activity in order to examine the data held by telephone companies .
the information will allow authorities to determine when and with whom their suspects had telephone , fax or e-mail contact .
police and others with access to the information will also be able to pinpoint where mobile phone calls took place .
the content of the communications will not , however , be provided to investigators .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said friday that criticism of the law had been exaggerated and stressed that it was not " paving the way towards a surveillance state . "
she added that the law would enable the authorities to combat crime and terrorism effectively .
the minister said the law implemented an eu directive in a " minimal fashion . "
but the german commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , said parts of the law exceeded european requirements by failing to exclude less serious crimes .
" a sad day for democracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu directive behind the german law was prompted by the madrid train bombings fdp expert jörg van essen said the legislation " placed citizens under general suspicion . "
he said he wants to appeal to the german constitutional court .
jan korte from the left party called the law one of the biggest attacks on press freedom and said that abuse was bound to occur .
the greens described it as a " black day for civil rights " and a " sad day for democracy . "
siegfried kauder , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , countered the criticism , saying that the law found the right balance between data protection and the need to fight crime .
he said it , in fact , represented an improvement in the legal position of journalists .
the justice minister said the eu directive was a reaction to the terrorist attacks on madrid in march 2004 in which 191 people died .
the perpetrators were tracked down using mobile telephone data .
some 366 parliamentarians voted in favor of the law , while 156 voted against .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 09.11.2007 bundestag approves controversial surveillance measures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hotly disputed law will go into operation on jan .
1 , 2008 the german parliament has given the go ahead to a law that will allow telephone and internet data to be stored for up to six months despite fierce criticism from the opposition and privacy advocates . the legislation approved friday , nov .
9 , also permits the telephone conversations of lawyers , journalists and doctors to be bugged under certain circumstances .
the decision not to exclude these professions from the law has sparked an outcry from those who rely on being able to speak to their clients or contacts confidentially .
members of parliament , religious clerics and state prosecutors have been provided exceptions to the law .
politicians from the opposition free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the greens and the left party have said they will mount legal challenges to the statute .
the marburger bund doctors ' association has also announced they would have its legality examined .
there have also been protests from journalists ' and publishing associations .
powers subject to judicial permission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police powers to conduct telephone surveillance will be extended under the law , police and german intelligence agencies must receive a court 's permission and show a strong suspicion of illegal activity in order to examine the data held by telephone companies .
the information will allow authorities to determine when and with whom their suspects had telephone , fax or e-mail contact .
police and others with access to the information will also be able to pinpoint where mobile phone calls took place .
the content of the communications will not , however , be provided to investigators .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said friday that criticism of the law had been exaggerated and stressed that it was not " paving the way towards a surveillance state . "
she added that the law would enable the authorities to combat crime and terrorism effectively .
the minister said the law implemented an eu directive in a " minimal fashion . "
but the german commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , said parts of the law exceeded european requirements by failing to exclude less serious crimes .
" a sad day for democracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu directive behind the german law was prompted by the madrid train bombings fdp expert jörg van essen said the legislation " placed citizens under general suspicion . "
he said he wants to appeal to the german constitutional court .
jan korte from the left party called the law one of the biggest attacks on press freedom and said that abuse was bound to occur .
the greens described it as a " black day for civil rights " and a " sad day for democracy . "
siegfried kauder , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , countered the criticism , saying that the law found the right balance between data protection and the need to fight crime .
he said it , in fact , represented an improvement in the legal position of journalists .
the justice minister said the eu directive was a reaction to the terrorist attacks on madrid in march 2004 in which 191 people died .
the perpetrators were tracked down using mobile telephone data .
some 366 parliamentarians voted in favor of the law , while 156 voted against .
there were two abstentions . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de telecommunications -pipe- 09.11.2007 apple iphone missing features europeans expect , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple fans and the " leading edge " of german consumers bought the iphone on the first day marcus eckstein from the german telecommunications magazine " connect " spoke to dw-world.de about the apple iphone , which went on sale on friday , nov .
9 in germany and the uk . marcus eckstein is the editor for the mobile phone section of connect magazine in stuttgart . dw-world.de : the apple iphone is being released with much fanfare .
will the demand in germany be as big as it was in the us ? markus eckstein : there is a strong apple fan base here that will be going to the t-mobile shop along with the guys we call the " leading edge , " people who need to always have the newest phone with the most features .
but the euphoria that surrounded the release of the iphone in the us is not happening here since it has been all over the internet for months . germans are traditionally more skeptical when it comes to gadgets .
there will be people who once they see the phone being used in real life decide that they want one .
i think there will be strong demand for the phone . one of the biggest criticisms of the iphone in the us is the slow speed of the network it uses and the high cost of the service .
will this also be the case for t-mobile ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-online has exclusive rights to sell the iphone in germany t-mobile has a lot of wifi hotspots and their edge network -lsb- mobile internet service -rsb- is quite good .
but i think a lot of people will be hesitant to buy the phone because of the high cost of the t-mobile contract . will there be a lot of people buying the iphone in order to " unlock " it and use it on other mobile networks ? i think the situation is different in germany .
in the us you can buy the phone before you sign any contract .
here you do not get the phone until you sign a contract .
plus the phone is only being sold at t-mobile stores .
if you want to try and unlock the phone , you are better off trying to find a us version on ebay . will the device live up to expectations ? if you compare the iphone to other phones then i would say yes .
what is really new and different is the user interface - especially the large touch screen .
the user-friendly interface of the phone opens up a lot of new features - browsing the internet or watching youtube videos - for a broader audience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german comedian ruth moschner presents the iphone in many ways it is really an american product .
there are some functions that europeans are used to that the iphone does not have like being able to design a ringtone for groups of contacts like your family so you know when they are calling or sending out a contact via bluetooth or sms .
these are things that many consumers here are used to . is the iphone , and its user-friendly interface , going to influence others in the mobile phone industry to change their products ? this is really the first time that a newcomer has come into the market with such a hit product that is getting so much attention . you can already see the first signs that things are changing .
for example , nokia just announced that they are going to be changing their user system next year .
like apple , they do not usually announce changes like this so far in advance . interview : ole tangen jr . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's klaus dahmann is critical of the decision by eu interior ministers to expand the schengen zone . this early european christmas present has received little by way of media coverage in germany , although the implications for european union citizens are almost as far-reaching as those attached to the major eu expansion three years ago .
the deep gash that the iron curtain once scored right across the continent has already grown over , and with border controls about to be dropped , the physical scar will become invisible . the move , which will bring the newer eu countries into line with their western contemporaries , will also ease cross-border travel for citizens of older schengen countries .
germans will only have to show their passports to one of their neighbors : the swiss .
bildunterschrift : but to what extent is a relaxing of border controls and an expansion of the schengen zone a positive thing ?
the answer is : it 's good if you 're on the inside , but not so good if you are not .
barriers to russia , ukraine and serbia are getting higher and security measures are getting tighter .
bridges along the border between slovenia and croatia have been torn down , and there is no doubt that ljubljana is feeling an element of schadenfreude towards its non-schengen neighbor . in rolling its open-border system further eastwards , the eu is also opening up new and shorter crime routes .
regardless of the number of fences and security installations , and despite europe-wide visa data collection , europol and national police authorities will have fences of their own to climb if they are to take on the new challenges coming their way . the accusations of corruption currently facing the czech embassy in vietnam are a case in point .
before the czech republic has even become an official member of the schengen clan , german intelligence services pinpointed an increasing number of vietnamese citizens entering the country .
the allegations have not been proven , but they go to show that more embassies will have to implement tougher visa regulations in the future . yet even then , schengen will never manage to dispel the fear of certain european countries becoming a hot bet of economic refugees .
there is still a long way to go to solve integration problems within the union , and eu member states are far from reaching a consensus on how many immigrants they should allow into their respective territories . to the outside world , therefore , european politicians continue to sell higher external fences as the solution .
and rather than admit to their own citizens that the new schengen agreement will mean more workers from poland , slovakia or hungary seeking their fortune in the richer countries of western europe , they have opted to keep this celebration quiet . klaus dahmann is a correspondent for deutsche welle -lrb- tkw -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is a view echoed by many big names in the german game . rummenigge 's comments follow a week of german clubs in european competition , with not one of the six clubs in action able to score a victory . he said the bundesliga could no longer compete financially with the top leagues in spain , england or italy . " we have to be clear that we no longer have a chance internationally , " he told the daily stuttgarter nachrichten on friday , nov .
9 .
" there is n't a manager or coach in the world who can compensate for this competitive disadvantage . " in the champions league , bundesliga champions vfl stuttgart are now out of contention after four successive defeats .
stuttgart will not even have the consolation of dropping into the uefa cup as third-placed finishers in their group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen 's campaign ended with defeat to lazio meanwhile werder bremen , who were beaten 2-1 by lazio on tuesday , are bottom of their group and schalke 04 , who drew 0-0 at home to chelsea , are third in their group . in uefa cup group matches thursday , bayern munich were held to a 2-2 draw at home to bolton wanderers , while nuremberg were beaten 2-0 at home by everton and bayer leverkusen went down 2-1 at spartak moscow .
the other german side in europe , sv hamburg , were without a game . rummenigge criticizes bayern 's uefa display rummenigge also publicly criticized bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld 's tactics after the draw with bolton , who sit just one place off the bottom of the english premier league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge says german teams are no longer competitive the bayern official lashed out at hitzfeld for replacing key players such as franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger for the final half hour with bayern leading 2-1 , which allowed bolton to grab a late equalizer . " i 'm really annoyed , " rummenigge had told journalists after the draw .
" it would have been very easy to win this one and advance .
the spectators have a right to see the best team play .
football is not mathematics .
you ca n't calculate everything . " hitzfeld said he did not want to directly comment on rummenigge 's remarks , but explained that he had wanted to rest ribery and schweinsteiger ahead of the bundesliga match at vfb stuttgart on saturday . " i hope i know the basic math of soccer , and i try to apply that , " said hitzfeld , who studied mathematics at university .
" i believe that i found the right mixture so that we can win in stuttgart , " hitzfeld also said , he wanted to rotate some of the players to prevent injuries . " it was a reasonable decision , " he added .
" we need to get back on track at stuttgart after two league draws . " hitzfeld added that he was not worried about rummenigge 's attack . " i 'm used to stormy weather , " he said .
" you should n't let yourself be influenced by such petty issues . " funding adding to lack of german competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke matched moneybags chelsea in the score only rummenigge 's tirade against bundesliga teams continued with a complaint that the german representatives in the champions league were " not sufficiently competitive " against their rivals from other major european leagues who were earning vastly more from television broadcast sales . the 52-year-old former international called for a new distribution of tv earnings in the bundesliga , saying a team like vfb stuttgart had to be treated differently from clubs such as energie cottbus or vfl bochum . " either we decide on individual marketing , or the key to distribution has to be aligned to the status and merit of the respective clubs , " he said . finance was now the key in international soccer , enabling top clubs to invest in quality players . " the bundesliga is buying only quantity on the transfer market .
one can see the result of this in the champions league , " rummenigge added . soccer statesmen weigh in on bundesliga malaise rummenigge is not alone in his concern over the comparative quality of the bundesliga .
germany national team coach joachim löw said earlier in the week that he was also alarmed at the poor showing of the three champions league representatives who have managed a total of just seven points from 12 matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi löw fears young players will lack international experience " that 's an extremely disappointing international performance , " löw told german sport news agency sid .
" there 's no way we can be happy about that .
it is no help for players like mario gomez and thomas hitzlsperger or young talents like serdar tasci and sami khedira if they do n't get international exposure . " the voices of concern also included former west germany coach and captain franz beckenbauer as well as ex-captains lothar matthäus and oliver kahn . " the results are alarming , " matthäus told premiere tv .
" you need heart , passion , engagement and an identification with your club in soccer .
you do n't see that at some of these clubs . " kahn said : " the bundesliga might look like a top product from the outside , with lovely packaging , but this great wrapping is n't worth a thing .
we 've got to show that we 've got the goods on the inside too . " in uefa 's five-year ratings , the bundesliga is sixth behind the leagues in spain , england , italy , france and romania . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , despite the majority vote in favor of the " memorial to the freedom and unity of germany , " there were still many voices calling for a second monument in leipzig , the site of the demonstrations that marked the beginning of the end for communist rule in east germany .
former mayor of leipzig and current minister of transport wolfgang tiefensee , backed by saxony state premier georg milbradt , led the calls for the city to be included , but the motion was denied .
eastern states no nearer to being self-sufficient tiefensee , the federal representative for the states from the former east , injected a dose of reality into proceedings by presenting his annual findings on the progress of the eastern regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee said the east 's positives should be focused on he told the bundestag that the eastern states were still far from being self-supporting , pointing out that his report focused on the divisions between east and west .
" we always talk only about the differences , " tiefensee said , adding that it would be more productive to highlight positive developments , which he said included eastern economic growth between 10 and 11 percent and a reduction of short-term unemployment .
but tiefensee added that long-term unemployment in the east was still a big problem and he urged the government to consider additional measures to the solidarity pact agreement that sends taxpayers ' money to the east , such as the continuation of the capital investment bonus beyond its current deadline of 2009 .
critics complain of western bias the location of the " memorial to the freedom and unity of germany " has been cited by some critics as just another example of how weighted the idea of unification towards the west has become .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig remembers the demos which led to unification luc jochimsen , cultural spokeswoman for the left party said earlier this week that the monument focuses on unification and ignores more important aspects of the 1989 revolution .
" we think berlin is the wrong place .
we think its focus should be on leipzig , not berlin , and on oct .
9 , not nov .
9 , " she said , referring to the start of the leipzig demonstrations in 1989 .
many germans still have mixed feelings about reunification , making the debate over the new monument even more complicated .
klaus-peter schöppner of the emnid polling institute told reuters this week that the majority of germans still think of the former communist east as a " second-class germany , " while a recent survey showed that one out of five germans would like to have the berlin wall back . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is a view echoed by many big names in the german game . rummenigge 's comments follow a week of german clubs in european competition , with not one of the six clubs in action able to score a victory . he said the bundesliga could no longer compete financially with the top leagues in spain , england or italy . " we have to be clear that we no longer have a chance internationally , " he told the daily stuttgarter nachrichten on friday , nov .
9 .
" there is n't a manager or coach in the world who can compensate for this competitive disadvantage . " in the champions league , bundesliga champions vfl stuttgart are now out of contention after four successive defeats .
stuttgart will not even have the consolation of dropping into the uefa cup as third-placed finishers in their group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen 's campaign ended with defeat to lazio meanwhile werder bremen , who were beaten 2-1 by lazio on tuesday , are bottom of their group and schalke 04 , who drew 0-0 at home to chelsea , are third in their group . in uefa cup group matches thursday , bayern munich were held to a 2-2 draw at home to bolton wanderers , while nuremberg were beaten 2-0 at home by everton and bayer leverkusen went down 2-1 at spartak moscow .
the other german side in europe , sv hamburg , were without a game . rummenigge criticizes bayern 's uefa display rummenigge also publicly criticized bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld 's tactics after the draw with bolton , who sit just one place off the bottom of the english premier league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge says german teams are no longer competitive the bayern official lashed out at hitzfeld for replacing key players such as franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger for the final half hour with bayern leading 2-1 , which allowed bolton to grab a late equalizer . " i 'm really annoyed , " rummenigge had told journalists after the draw .
" it would have been very easy to win this one and advance .
the spectators have a right to see the best team play .
football is not mathematics .
you ca n't calculate everything . " hitzfeld said he did not want to directly comment on rummenigge 's remarks , but explained that he had wanted to rest ribery and schweinsteiger ahead of the bundesliga match at vfb stuttgart on saturday . " i hope i know the basic math of soccer , and i try to apply that , " said hitzfeld , who studied mathematics at university .
" i believe that i found the right mixture so that we can win in stuttgart , " hitzfeld also said , he wanted to rotate some of the players to prevent injuries . " it was a reasonable decision , " he added .
" we need to get back on track at stuttgart after two league draws . " hitzfeld added that he was not worried about rummenigge 's attack . " i 'm used to stormy weather , " he said .
" you should n't let yourself be influenced by such petty issues . " funding adding to lack of german competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke matched moneybags chelsea in the score only rummenigge 's tirade against bundesliga teams continued with a complaint that the german representatives in the champions league were " not sufficiently competitive " against their rivals from other major european leagues who were earning vastly more from television broadcast sales . the 52-year-old former international called for a new distribution of tv earnings in the bundesliga , saying a team like vfb stuttgart had to be treated differently from clubs such as energie cottbus or vfl bochum . " either we decide on individual marketing , or the key to distribution has to be aligned to the status and merit of the respective clubs , " he said . finance was now the key in international soccer , enabling top clubs to invest in quality players . " the bundesliga is buying only quantity on the transfer market .
one can see the result of this in the champions league , " rummenigge added . soccer statesmen weigh in on bundesliga malaise rummenigge is not alone in his concern over the comparative quality of the bundesliga .
germany national team coach joachim löw said earlier in the week that he was also alarmed at the poor showing of the three champions league representatives who have managed a total of just seven points from 12 matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi löw fears young players will lack international experience " that 's an extremely disappointing international performance , " löw told german sport news agency sid .
" there 's no way we can be happy about that .
it is no help for players like mario gomez and thomas hitzlsperger or young talents like serdar tasci and sami khedira if they do n't get international exposure . " the voices of concern also included former west germany coach and captain franz beckenbauer as well as ex-captains lothar matthäus and oliver kahn . " the results are alarming , " matthäus told premiere tv .
" you need heart , passion , engagement and an identification with your club in soccer .
you do n't see that at some of these clubs . " kahn said : " the bundesliga might look like a top product from the outside , with lovely packaging , but this great wrapping is n't worth a thing .
we 've got to show that we 've got the goods on the inside too . " in uefa 's five-year ratings , the bundesliga is sixth behind the leagues in spain , england , italy , france and romania . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us wants germany to support tougher sanctions on iran and merkel has made all the right noises to suggest that bush will get what he wants .
how far that support goes , time will tell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants german troops in action in afghanistan there is considerable concern in washington over the way some nato countries , particularly germany , are not pulling their weight in afghanistan , which is seen as a make-or-break test for nato .
if nato fails in afghanistan at least partly because german forces and others have failed to assume their share of the responsibility for the fighting through " caveats " - restrictive rules of engagement and absence from the battlefield - washington is much less likely in future to look to nato for joint operations and will resume its strategy of forming " coalitions of the willing , " something which germany does n't like .
washington wants germany and other countries to get involved in the dirty work of fighting the taliban .
this is very unlikely to happen , something merkel will again reiterate . although german politicians tend to think it was a major achievement to extend the stay of german forces in afghanistan , given the hostility of german public opinion , this is not the way germany 's commitment to afghanistan is seen in washington , where it is regarded as feeble and nit-picking . what is the us view of chancellor merkel ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tactile bush has a very different approach from merkel 's in america , the incident most remembered in the recent history of german-american relations is probably the moment at the st. petersburg g8 summit when bush gave merkel a surprise , high-speed backrub .
a video of the incident was widely circulated , to general merriment .
merkel was clearly horrified by the physical contact , just as she dislikes sarkozy 's constant hugging and kissing . bush and merkel express respect for each other , but their temperaments are completely different .
merkel likes quiet diplomacy , compromise and consensus - bush is driven by conviction and a sense of mission , which makes him much less likely to accept compromise easily . bush sees it as helpful that merkel is less pro-russian and less anti-american than her predecessor gerhard schröder , whom bush detested , and he is pleased that she is more inclined than schröder to understand the threats posed by international terrorism . is the working relationship between president bush and chancellor merkel a balanced one ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel claimed victory at the g8 , but bush was the winner , dale said i would not say that it is balanced , although chancellor merkel would probably say it is .
it seems that merkel , like many others , underestimates bush .
at the g8 heiligendamm summit , merkel claimed a diplomatic triumph in bringing bush on board on climate change , without apparently realizing that bush had run rings round her .
bush got virtually everything he wanted in heiligendamm . in exchange for agreeing to some vague global goal of reducing emissions , bush won on the following points : the goal would not be mandatory ; actions to try to counter climate change should not prevent strong economic growth ; technology is a large part of the answer ; and big emerging nations like china and india must be included in any post-kyoto agreement . bush , in fact , drove a stake through the heart of the whole kyoto approach right under merkel 's nose - and she did n't seem to notice . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 . reginald dale is a trans-atlantic relations expert and a senior fellow at the center for strategic and international studies in washington . dw-world.de : what does the united states expect in terms of support and action from chancellor angela merkel 's germany on topics such as iran , afghanistan and the middle east ? reginald dale : germany is seen as less supportive than france on iraq and iran , but the bush administration is pleased that merkel agreed with the us that the time was ripe to launch a new middle east initiative - even if it is unlikely to get very far .
the us wants germany to support tougher sanctions on iran and merkel has made all the right noises to suggest that bush will get what he wants .
how far that support goes , time will tell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants german troops in action in afghanistan there is considerable concern in washington over the way some nato countries , particularly germany , are not pulling their weight in afghanistan , which is seen as a make-or-break test for nato .
if nato fails in afghanistan at least partly because german forces and others have failed to assume their share of the responsibility for the fighting through " caveats " - restrictive rules of engagement and absence from the battlefield - washington is much less likely in future to look to nato for joint operations and will resume its strategy of forming " coalitions of the willing , " something which germany does n't like .
washington wants germany and other countries to get involved in the dirty work of fighting the taliban .
this is very unlikely to happen , something merkel will again reiterate . although german politicians tend to think it was a major achievement to extend the stay of german forces in afghanistan , given the hostility of german public opinion , this is not the way germany 's commitment to afghanistan is seen in washington , where it is regarded as feeble and nit-picking . what is the us view of chancellor merkel ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tactile bush has a very different approach from merkel 's in america , the incident most remembered in the recent history of german-american relations is probably the moment at the st. petersburg g8 summit when bush gave merkel a surprise , high-speed backrub .
a video of the incident was widely circulated , to general merriment .
merkel was clearly horrified by the physical contact , just as she dislikes sarkozy 's constant hugging and kissing . bush and merkel express respect for each other , but their temperaments are completely different .
merkel likes quiet diplomacy , compromise and consensus - bush is driven by conviction and a sense of mission , which makes him much less likely to accept compromise easily . bush sees it as helpful that merkel is less pro-russian and less anti-american than her predecessor gerhard schröder , whom bush detested , and he is pleased that she is more inclined than schröder to understand the threats posed by international terrorism . is the working relationship between president bush and chancellor merkel a balanced one ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel claimed victory at the g8 , but bush was the winner , dale said i would not say that it is balanced , although chancellor merkel would probably say it is .
it seems that merkel , like many others , underestimates bush .
at the g8 heiligendamm summit , merkel claimed a diplomatic triumph in bringing bush on board on climate change , without apparently realizing that bush had run rings round her .
bush got virtually everything he wanted in heiligendamm . in exchange for agreeing to some vague global goal of reducing emissions , bush won on the following points : the goal would not be mandatory ; actions to try to counter climate change should not prevent strong economic growth ; technology is a large part of the answer ; and big emerging nations like china and india must be included in any post-kyoto agreement . bush , in fact , drove a stake through the heart of the whole kyoto approach right under merkel 's nose - and she did n't seem to notice . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , 2008 the german parliament has given the go ahead to a law that will allow telephone and internet data to be stored for up to six months despite fierce criticism from the opposition and privacy advocates . the legislation approved friday , nov .
9 , also permits the telephone conversations of lawyers , journalists and doctors to be bugged under certain circumstances .
the decision not to exclude these professions from the law has sparked an outcry from those who rely on being able to speak to their clients or contacts confidentially .
members of parliament , religious clerics and state prosecutors have been provided exceptions to the law .
politicians from the opposition free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the greens and the left party have said they will mount legal challenges to the statute .
the marburger bund doctors ' association has also announced they would have its legality examined .
there have also been protests from journalists ' and publishing associations .
powers subject to judicial permission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police powers to conduct telephone surveillance will be extended under the law , police and german intelligence agencies must receive a court 's permission and show a strong suspicion of illegal activity in order to examine the data held by telephone companies .
the information will allow authorities to determine when and with whom their suspects had telephone , fax or e-mail contact .
police and others with access to the information will also be able to pinpoint where mobile phone calls took place .

it is a view echoed by many big names in the german game . rummenigge 's comments follow a week of german clubs in european competition , with not one of the six clubs in action able to score a victory . he said the bundesliga could no longer compete financially with the top leagues in spain , england or italy . " we have to be clear that we no longer have a chance internationally , " he told the daily stuttgarter nachrichten on friday , nov .
9 .
" there is n't a manager or coach in the world who can compensate for this competitive disadvantage . " in the champions league , bundesliga champions vfl stuttgart are now out of contention after four successive defeats .
stuttgart will not even have the consolation of dropping into the uefa cup as third-placed finishers in their group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen 's campaign ended with defeat to lazio meanwhile werder bremen , who were beaten 2-1 by lazio on tuesday , are bottom of their group and schalke 04 , who drew 0-0 at home to chelsea , are third in their group . in uefa cup group matches thursday , bayern munich were held to a 2-2 draw at home to bolton wanderers , while nuremberg were beaten 2-0 at home by everton and bayer leverkusen went down 2-1 at spartak moscow .
the other german side in europe , sv hamburg , were without a game . rummenigge criticizes bayern 's uefa display rummenigge also publicly criticized bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld 's tactics after the draw with bolton , who sit just one place off the bottom of the english premier league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge says german teams are no longer competitive the bayern official lashed out at hitzfeld for replacing key players such as franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger for the final half hour with bayern leading 2-1 , which allowed bolton to grab a late equalizer . " i 'm really annoyed , " rummenigge had told journalists after the draw .
" it would have been very easy to win this one and advance .
the spectators have a right to see the best team play .
football is not mathematics .
you ca n't calculate everything . " hitzfeld said he did not want to directly comment on rummenigge 's remarks , but explained that he had wanted to rest ribery and schweinsteiger ahead of the bundesliga match at vfb stuttgart on saturday . " i hope i know the basic math of soccer , and i try to apply that , " said hitzfeld , who studied mathematics at university .
" i believe that i found the right mixture so that we can win in stuttgart , " hitzfeld also said , he wanted to rotate some of the players to prevent injuries . " it was a reasonable decision , " he added .
" we need to get back on track at stuttgart after two league draws . " hitzfeld added that he was not worried about rummenigge 's attack . " i 'm used to stormy weather , " he said .
" you should n't let yourself be influenced by such petty issues . " funding adding to lack of german competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke matched moneybags chelsea in the score only rummenigge 's tirade against bundesliga teams continued with a complaint that the german representatives in the champions league were " not sufficiently competitive " against their rivals from other major european leagues who were earning vastly more from television broadcast sales . the 52-year-old former international called for a new distribution of tv earnings in the bundesliga , saying a team like vfb stuttgart had to be treated differently from clubs such as energie cottbus or vfl bochum . " either we decide on individual marketing , or the key to distribution has to be aligned to the status and merit of the respective clubs , " he said . finance was now the key in international soccer , enabling top clubs to invest in quality players . " the bundesliga is buying only quantity on the transfer market .
one can see the result of this in the champions league , " rummenigge added . soccer statesmen weigh in on bundesliga malaise rummenigge is not alone in his concern over the comparative quality of the bundesliga .
germany national team coach joachim löw said earlier in the week that he was also alarmed at the poor showing of the three champions league representatives who have managed a total of just seven points from 12 matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi löw fears young players will lack international experience " that 's an extremely disappointing international performance , " löw told german sport news agency sid .
" there 's no way we can be happy about that .
it is no help for players like mario gomez and thomas hitzlsperger or young talents like serdar tasci and sami khedira if they do n't get international exposure . " the voices of concern also included former west germany coach and captain franz beckenbauer as well as ex-captains lothar matthäus and oliver kahn . " the results are alarming , " matthäus told premiere tv .
" you need heart , passion , engagement and an identification with your club in soccer .
you do n't see that at some of these clubs . " kahn said : " the bundesliga might look like a top product from the outside , with lovely packaging , but this great wrapping is n't worth a thing .
we 've got to show that we 've got the goods on the inside too . " in uefa 's five-year ratings , the bundesliga is sixth behind the leagues in spain , england , italy , france and romania . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us wants germany to support tougher sanctions on iran and merkel has made all the right noises to suggest that bush will get what he wants .

washington wants germany and other countries to get involved in the dirty work of fighting the taliban .
this is very unlikely to happen , something merkel will again reiterate . although german politicians tend to think it was a major achievement to extend the stay of german forces in afghanistan , given the hostility of german public opinion , this is not the way germany 's commitment to afghanistan is seen in washington , where it is regarded as feeble and nit-picking . what is the us view of chancellor merkel ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tactile bush has a very different approach from merkel 's in america , the incident most remembered in the recent history of german-american relations is probably the moment at the st. petersburg g8 summit when bush gave merkel a surprise , high-speed backrub .

merkel was clearly horrified by the physical contact , just as she dislikes sarkozy 's constant hugging and kissing . bush and merkel express respect for each other , but their temperaments are completely different .
merkel likes quiet diplomacy , compromise and consensus - bush is driven by conviction and a sense of mission , which makes him much less likely to accept compromise easily . bush sees it as helpful that merkel is less pro-russian and less anti-american than her predecessor gerhard schröder , whom bush detested , and he is pleased that she is more inclined than schröder to understand the threats posed by international terrorism . is the working relationship between president bush and chancellor merkel a balanced one ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel claimed victory at the g8 , but bush was the winner , dale said i would not say that it is balanced , although chancellor merkel would probably say it is .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 09.11.2007 bundestag approves controversial surveillance measures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hotly disputed law will go into operation on jan .
1 , 2008 the german parliament has given the go ahead to a law that will allow telephone and internet data to be stored for up to six months despite fierce criticism from the opposition and privacy advocates . the legislation approved friday , nov .
9 , also permits the telephone conversations of lawyers , journalists and doctors to be bugged under certain circumstances .
the decision not to exclude these professions from the law has sparked an outcry from those who rely on being able to speak to their clients or contacts confidentially .
members of parliament , religious clerics and state prosecutors have been provided exceptions to the law .
politicians from the opposition free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the greens and the left party have said they will mount legal challenges to the statute .
the marburger bund doctors ' association has also announced they would have its legality examined .
there have also been protests from journalists ' and publishing associations .
powers subject to judicial permission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police powers to conduct telephone surveillance will be extended under the law , police and german intelligence agencies must receive a court 's permission and show a strong suspicion of illegal activity in order to examine the data held by telephone companies .
the information will allow authorities to determine when and with whom their suspects had telephone , fax or e-mail contact .
police and others with access to the information will also be able to pinpoint where mobile phone calls took place .
the content of the communications will not , however , be provided to investigators .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said friday that criticism of the law had been exaggerated and stressed that it was not " paving the way towards a surveillance state . "
she added that the law would enable the authorities to combat crime and terrorism effectively .
the minister said the law implemented an eu directive in a " minimal fashion . "
but the german commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , said parts of the law exceeded european requirements by failing to exclude less serious crimes .
" a sad day for democracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu directive behind the german law was prompted by the madrid train bombings fdp expert jörg van essen said the legislation " placed citizens under general suspicion . "
he said he wants to appeal to the german constitutional court .
jan korte from the left party called the law one of the biggest attacks on press freedom and said that abuse was bound to occur .
the greens described it as a " black day for civil rights " and a " sad day for democracy . "
siegfried kauder , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , countered the criticism , saying that the law found the right balance between data protection and the need to fight crime .
he said it , in fact , represented an improvement in the legal position of journalists .
the justice minister said the eu directive was a reaction to the terrorist attacks on madrid in march 2004 in which 191 people died .
the perpetrators were tracked down using mobile telephone data .
some 366 parliamentarians voted in favor of the law , while 156 voted against .
there were two abstentions . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he added that germany would re-examine its arms exports to pakistan and would also restrict economic assistance to projects which solely benefit the population . us also concerned the united states also expressed its concern over the political situation in pakistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistani police are in force on the country 's streets " we remain concerned about the continued state of emergency and curtailment of basic freedoms , and urge pakistan 's authorities to quickly return to constitutional order and democratic norms , " said national security council spokesman gordon johndroe .
" it is crucial for pakistan 's future that moderate political forces work together to bring pakistan back on the path to democracy . " despite the state of emergency and crackdown on the opposition , the us has not decided to cut the hundreds of millions of dollars worth of aid it pays to pakistan , which is a key supporter of the united states ' anti-terror activities in the middle east .

" all means will be used to control the protests , " he said . musharraf has pledged legislative elections - originally slated for january - by february 15 and to resign as army chief as soon as the supreme court validates his oct .

9 . reginald dale is a trans-atlantic relations expert and a senior fellow at the center for strategic and international studies in washington . dw-world.de : what does the united states expect in terms of support and action from chancellor angela merkel 's germany on topics such as iran , afghanistan and the middle east ? reginald dale : germany is seen as less supportive than france on iraq and iran , but the bush administration is pleased that merkel agreed with the us that the time was ripe to launch a new middle east initiative - even if it is unlikely to get very far .
the us wants germany to support tougher sanctions on iran and merkel has made all the right noises to suggest that bush will get what he wants .
how far that support goes , time will tell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants german troops in action in afghanistan there is considerable concern in washington over the way some nato countries , particularly germany , are not pulling their weight in afghanistan , which is seen as a make-or-break test for nato .
if nato fails in afghanistan at least partly because german forces and others have failed to assume their share of the responsibility for the fighting through " caveats " - restrictive rules of engagement and absence from the battlefield - washington is much less likely in future to look to nato for joint operations and will resume its strategy of forming " coalitions of the willing , " something which germany does n't like .
washington wants germany and other countries to get involved in the dirty work of fighting the taliban .
this is very unlikely to happen , something merkel will again reiterate . although german politicians tend to think it was a major achievement to extend the stay of german forces in afghanistan , given the hostility of german public opinion , this is not the way germany 's commitment to afghanistan is seen in washington , where it is regarded as feeble and nit-picking . what is the us view of chancellor merkel ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tactile bush has a very different approach from merkel 's in america , the incident most remembered in the recent history of german-american relations is probably the moment at the st. petersburg g8 summit when bush gave merkel a surprise , high-speed backrub .
a video of the incident was widely circulated , to general merriment .
merkel was clearly horrified by the physical contact , just as she dislikes sarkozy 's constant hugging and kissing . bush and merkel express respect for each other , but their temperaments are completely different .
merkel likes quiet diplomacy , compromise and consensus - bush is driven by conviction and a sense of mission , which makes him much less likely to accept compromise easily . bush sees it as helpful that merkel is less pro-russian and less anti-american than her predecessor gerhard schröder , whom bush detested , and he is pleased that she is more inclined than schröder to understand the threats posed by international terrorism . is the working relationship between president bush and chancellor merkel a balanced one ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel claimed victory at the g8 , but bush was the winner , dale said i would not say that it is balanced , although chancellor merkel would probably say it is .
it seems that merkel , like many others , underestimates bush .
at the g8 heiligendamm summit , merkel claimed a diplomatic triumph in bringing bush on board on climate change , without apparently realizing that bush had run rings round her .
bush got virtually everything he wanted in heiligendamm . in exchange for agreeing to some vague global goal of reducing emissions , bush won on the following points : the goal would not be mandatory ; actions to try to counter climate change should not prevent strong economic growth ; technology is a large part of the answer ; and big emerging nations like china and india must be included in any post-kyoto agreement . bush , in fact , drove a stake through the heart of the whole kyoto approach right under merkel 's nose - and she did n't seem to notice . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both leaders have said they want to keep nuclear weapons out of tehran 's hands . " the international community must pursue its goal of preventing iran from having nuclear arms with firmness , " merkel said in an interview this week with the daily berliner zeitung .
" this is a process we should take step by step . " bush has also pointed to germany to take on an important role in nuclear negotiations with tehran . differences over dealing with iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both leaders want to keep nuclear weapons out of iran " we definitely need germany 's help on issues like iran , " president bush told german broadcaster rtl this week .
" germany is a crucial country in terms of building coalitions to deal with the threats we face . " but while merkel has stated a preference for giving the united nations a lead role in dealing with iran , bush has ratcheted up his rhetoric by saying that allowing tehran nuclear weapons could end in world war iii and that action needed to be taken quickly . disagreement over what step to take next will make reaching a us-german position difficult , according to thomas greven , a senior research fellow at the german institute for international relations in berlin .

" it is quite true to say that angela merkel has brought the us and germany back to a calm professional relationship , " she said .
" and for this president , personal relationships are very important . " merkel is also said to have a strong regard for the president and the american people . " i think the affection and regard that merkel has for the us is genuine , " stelzenmüller said . for his part , bush has repeatedly expressed admiration for the german leader who grew up in communist east germany and went on to lead one of the world 's biggest democracies and europe 's largest economy . the texas white house bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel also hosted bush to an informal german barbecue in 2006 the invitation to the ranch in crawford , texas - where bush famously said he saw into the " soul " of russian president vladimir putin - is a signal that bush values good relations with germany , greven said . but he added that there was little hope of closing the gaps in the differences of opinion on germany 's desire for a permanent seat at the un security council , which bush does not support , and merkel 's refusal to send german troops to afghanistan 's war-torn south .

21 , border controls between eight european countries will cease .
malta will follow suit a short while later .
dw 's klaus dahmann is critical of the decision by eu interior ministers to expand the schengen zone . this early european christmas present has received little by way of media coverage in germany , although the implications for european union citizens are almost as far-reaching as those attached to the major eu expansion three years ago .
the deep gash that the iron curtain once scored right across the continent has already grown over , and with border controls about to be dropped , the physical scar will become invisible . the move , which will bring the newer eu countries into line with their western contemporaries , will also ease cross-border travel for citizens of older schengen countries .
germans will only have to show their passports to one of their neighbors : the swiss .
bildunterschrift : but to what extent is a relaxing of border controls and an expansion of the schengen zone a positive thing ?
the answer is : it 's good if you 're on the inside , but not so good if you are not .
barriers to russia , ukraine and serbia are getting higher and security measures are getting tighter .
bridges along the border between slovenia and croatia have been torn down , and there is no doubt that ljubljana is feeling an element of schadenfreude towards its non-schengen neighbor . in rolling its open-border system further eastwards , the eu is also opening up new and shorter crime routes .
regardless of the number of fences and security installations , and despite europe-wide visa data collection , europol and national police authorities will have fences of their own to climb if they are to take on the new challenges coming their way . the accusations of corruption currently facing the czech embassy in vietnam are a case in point .
before the czech republic has even become an official member of the schengen clan , german intelligence services pinpointed an increasing number of vietnamese citizens entering the country .
the allegations have not been proven , but they go to show that more embassies will have to implement tougher visa regulations in the future . yet even then , schengen will never manage to dispel the fear of certain european countries becoming a hot bet of economic refugees .
there is still a long way to go to solve integration problems within the union , and eu member states are far from reaching a consensus on how many immigrants they should allow into their respective territories . to the outside world , therefore , european politicians continue to sell higher external fences as the solution .
and rather than admit to their own citizens that the new schengen agreement will mean more workers from poland , slovakia or hungary seeking their fortune in the richer countries of western europe , they have opted to keep this celebration quiet . klaus dahmann is a correspondent for deutsche welle -lrb- tkw -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 in germany and the uk . marcus eckstein is the editor for the mobile phone section of connect magazine in stuttgart . dw-world.de : the apple iphone is being released with much fanfare .
will the demand in germany be as big as it was in the us ? markus eckstein : there is a strong apple fan base here that will be going to the t-mobile shop along with the guys we call the " leading edge , " people who need to always have the newest phone with the most features .
but the euphoria that surrounded the release of the iphone in the us is not happening here since it has been all over the internet for months . germans are traditionally more skeptical when it comes to gadgets .
there will be people who once they see the phone being used in real life decide that they want one .

plus the phone is only being sold at t-mobile stores .
if you want to try and unlock the phone , you are better off trying to find a us version on ebay . will the device live up to expectations ? if you compare the iphone to other phones then i would say yes .
what is really new and different is the user interface - especially the large touch screen .
the user-friendly interface of the phone opens up a lot of new features - browsing the internet or watching youtube videos - for a broader audience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german comedian ruth moschner presents the iphone in many ways it is really an american product .

9 in germany and the uk . marcus eckstein is the editor for the mobile phone section of connect magazine in stuttgart . dw-world.de : the apple iphone is being released with much fanfare .
will the demand in germany be as big as it was in the us ? markus eckstein : there is a strong apple fan base here that will be going to the t-mobile shop along with the guys we call the " leading edge , " people who need to always have the newest phone with the most features .
but the euphoria that surrounded the release of the iphone in the us is not happening here since it has been all over the internet for months . germans are traditionally more skeptical when it comes to gadgets .
there will be people who once they see the phone being used in real life decide that they want one .
i think there will be strong demand for the phone . one of the biggest criticisms of the iphone in the us is the slow speed of the network it uses and the high cost of the service .
will this also be the case for t-mobile ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-online has exclusive rights to sell the iphone in germany t-mobile has a lot of wifi hotspots and their edge network -lsb- mobile internet service -rsb- is quite good .

in the us you can buy the phone before you sign any contract .
here you do not get the phone until you sign a contract .
plus the phone is only being sold at t-mobile stores .
if you want to try and unlock the phone , you are better off trying to find a us version on ebay . will the device live up to expectations ? if you compare the iphone to other phones then i would say yes .
what is really new and different is the user interface - especially the large touch screen .
the user-friendly interface of the phone opens up a lot of new features - browsing the internet or watching youtube videos - for a broader audience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german comedian ruth moschner presents the iphone in many ways it is really an american product .
there are some functions that europeans are used to that the iphone does not have like being able to design a ringtone for groups of contacts like your family so you know when they are calling or sending out a contact via bluetooth or sms .
these are things that many consumers here are used to . is the iphone , and its user-friendly interface , going to influence others in the mobile phone industry to change their products ? this is really the first time that a newcomer has come into the market with such a hit product that is getting so much attention . you can already see the first signs that things are changing .

it is a view echoed by many big names in the german game . rummenigge 's comments follow a week of german clubs in european competition , with not one of the six clubs in action able to score a victory . he said the bundesliga could no longer compete financially with the top leagues in spain , england or italy . " we have to be clear that we no longer have a chance internationally , " he told the daily stuttgarter nachrichten on friday , nov .
9 .
" there is n't a manager or coach in the world who can compensate for this competitive disadvantage . " in the champions league , bundesliga champions vfl stuttgart are now out of contention after four successive defeats .
stuttgart will not even have the consolation of dropping into the uefa cup as third-placed finishers in their group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen 's campaign ended with defeat to lazio meanwhile werder bremen , who were beaten 2-1 by lazio on tuesday , are bottom of their group and schalke 04 , who drew 0-0 at home to chelsea , are third in their group . in uefa cup group matches thursday , bayern munich were held to a 2-2 draw at home to bolton wanderers , while nuremberg were beaten 2-0 at home by everton and bayer leverkusen went down 2-1 at spartak moscow .
the other german side in europe , sv hamburg , were without a game . rummenigge criticizes bayern 's uefa display rummenigge also publicly criticized bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld 's tactics after the draw with bolton , who sit just one place off the bottom of the english premier league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge says german teams are no longer competitive the bayern official lashed out at hitzfeld for replacing key players such as franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger for the final half hour with bayern leading 2-1 , which allowed bolton to grab a late equalizer . " i 'm really annoyed , " rummenigge had told journalists after the draw .
" it would have been very easy to win this one and advance .
the spectators have a right to see the best team play .
football is not mathematics .
you ca n't calculate everything . " hitzfeld said he did not want to directly comment on rummenigge 's remarks , but explained that he had wanted to rest ribery and schweinsteiger ahead of the bundesliga match at vfb stuttgart on saturday . " i hope i know the basic math of soccer , and i try to apply that , " said hitzfeld , who studied mathematics at university .
" i believe that i found the right mixture so that we can win in stuttgart , " hitzfeld also said , he wanted to rotate some of the players to prevent injuries . " it was a reasonable decision , " he added .
" we need to get back on track at stuttgart after two league draws . " hitzfeld added that he was not worried about rummenigge 's attack . " i 'm used to stormy weather , " he said .
" you should n't let yourself be influenced by such petty issues . " funding adding to lack of german competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke matched moneybags chelsea in the score only rummenigge 's tirade against bundesliga teams continued with a complaint that the german representatives in the champions league were " not sufficiently competitive " against their rivals from other major european leagues who were earning vastly more from television broadcast sales . the 52-year-old former international called for a new distribution of tv earnings in the bundesliga , saying a team like vfb stuttgart had to be treated differently from clubs such as energie cottbus or vfl bochum . " either we decide on individual marketing , or the key to distribution has to be aligned to the status and merit of the respective clubs , " he said . finance was now the key in international soccer , enabling top clubs to invest in quality players . " the bundesliga is buying only quantity on the transfer market .
one can see the result of this in the champions league , " rummenigge added . soccer statesmen weigh in on bundesliga malaise rummenigge is not alone in his concern over the comparative quality of the bundesliga .
germany national team coach joachim löw said earlier in the week that he was also alarmed at the poor showing of the three champions league representatives who have managed a total of just seven points from 12 matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi löw fears young players will lack international experience " that 's an extremely disappointing international performance , " löw told german sport news agency sid .
" there 's no way we can be happy about that .
it is no help for players like mario gomez and thomas hitzlsperger or young talents like serdar tasci and sami khedira if they do n't get international exposure . " the voices of concern also included former west germany coach and captain franz beckenbauer as well as ex-captains lothar matthäus and oliver kahn . " the results are alarming , " matthäus told premiere tv .
" you need heart , passion , engagement and an identification with your club in soccer .
you do n't see that at some of these clubs . " kahn said : " the bundesliga might look like a top product from the outside , with lovely packaging , but this great wrapping is n't worth a thing .
we 've got to show that we 've got the goods on the inside too . " in uefa 's five-year ratings , the bundesliga is sixth behind the leagues in spain , england , italy , france and romania . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is a view echoed by many big names in the german game . rummenigge 's comments follow a week of german clubs in european competition , with not one of the six clubs in action able to score a victory . he said the bundesliga could no longer compete financially with the top leagues in spain , england or italy . " we have to be clear that we no longer have a chance internationally , " he told the daily stuttgarter nachrichten on friday , nov .
9 .
" there is n't a manager or coach in the world who can compensate for this competitive disadvantage . " in the champions league , bundesliga champions vfl stuttgart are now out of contention after four successive defeats .
stuttgart will not even have the consolation of dropping into the uefa cup as third-placed finishers in their group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen 's campaign ended with defeat to lazio meanwhile werder bremen , who were beaten 2-1 by lazio on tuesday , are bottom of their group and schalke 04 , who drew 0-0 at home to chelsea , are third in their group . in uefa cup group matches thursday , bayern munich were held to a 2-2 draw at home to bolton wanderers , while nuremberg were beaten 2-0 at home by everton and bayer leverkusen went down 2-1 at spartak moscow .
the other german side in europe , sv hamburg , were without a game . rummenigge criticizes bayern 's uefa display rummenigge also publicly criticized bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld 's tactics after the draw with bolton , who sit just one place off the bottom of the english premier league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge says german teams are no longer competitive the bayern official lashed out at hitzfeld for replacing key players such as franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger for the final half hour with bayern leading 2-1 , which allowed bolton to grab a late equalizer . " i 'm really annoyed , " rummenigge had told journalists after the draw .
" it would have been very easy to win this one and advance .
the spectators have a right to see the best team play .
football is not mathematics .
you ca n't calculate everything . " hitzfeld said he did not want to directly comment on rummenigge 's remarks , but explained that he had wanted to rest ribery and schweinsteiger ahead of the bundesliga match at vfb stuttgart on saturday . " i hope i know the basic math of soccer , and i try to apply that , " said hitzfeld , who studied mathematics at university .
" i believe that i found the right mixture so that we can win in stuttgart , " hitzfeld also said , he wanted to rotate some of the players to prevent injuries . " it was a reasonable decision , " he added .
" we need to get back on track at stuttgart after two league draws . " hitzfeld added that he was not worried about rummenigge 's attack . " i 'm used to stormy weather , " he said .
" you should n't let yourself be influenced by such petty issues . " funding adding to lack of german competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke matched moneybags chelsea in the score only rummenigge 's tirade against bundesliga teams continued with a complaint that the german representatives in the champions league were " not sufficiently competitive " against their rivals from other major european leagues who were earning vastly more from television broadcast sales . the 52-year-old former international called for a new distribution of tv earnings in the bundesliga , saying a team like vfb stuttgart had to be treated differently from clubs such as energie cottbus or vfl bochum . " either we decide on individual marketing , or the key to distribution has to be aligned to the status and merit of the respective clubs , " he said . finance was now the key in international soccer , enabling top clubs to invest in quality players . " the bundesliga is buying only quantity on the transfer market .
one can see the result of this in the champions league , " rummenigge added . soccer statesmen weigh in on bundesliga malaise rummenigge is not alone in his concern over the comparative quality of the bundesliga .
germany national team coach joachim löw said earlier in the week that he was also alarmed at the poor showing of the three champions league representatives who have managed a total of just seven points from 12 matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi löw fears young players will lack international experience " that 's an extremely disappointing international performance , " löw told german sport news agency sid .
" there 's no way we can be happy about that .
it is no help for players like mario gomez and thomas hitzlsperger or young talents like serdar tasci and sami khedira if they do n't get international exposure . " the voices of concern also included former west germany coach and captain franz beckenbauer as well as ex-captains lothar matthäus and oliver kahn . " the results are alarming , " matthäus told premiere tv .
" you need heart , passion , engagement and an identification with your club in soccer .
you do n't see that at some of these clubs . " kahn said : " the bundesliga might look like a top product from the outside , with lovely packaging , but this great wrapping is n't worth a thing .
we 've got to show that we 've got the goods on the inside too . " in uefa 's five-year ratings , the bundesliga is sixth behind the leagues in spain , england , italy , france and romania . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision not to exclude these professions from the law has sparked an outcry from those who rely on being able to speak to their clients or contacts confidentially .
members of parliament , religious clerics and state prosecutors have been provided exceptions to the law .
politicians from the opposition free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the greens and the left party have said they will mount legal challenges to the statute .

police and others with access to the information will also be able to pinpoint where mobile phone calls took place .

german justice minister brigitte zypries said friday that criticism of the law had been exaggerated and stressed that it was not " paving the way towards a surveillance state . "

the minister said the law implemented an eu directive in a " minimal fashion . "
but the german commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , said parts of the law exceeded european requirements by failing to exclude less serious crimes .
" a sad day for democracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu directive behind the german law was prompted by the madrid train bombings fdp expert jörg van essen said the legislation " placed citizens under general suspicion . "
he said he wants to appeal to the german constitutional court .
jan korte from the left party called the law one of the biggest attacks on press freedom and said that abuse was bound to occur .
the greens described it as a " black day for civil rights " and a " sad day for democracy . "
siegfried kauder , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , countered the criticism , saying that the law found the right balance between data protection and the need to fight crime .
he said it , in fact , represented an improvement in the legal position of journalists .
the justice minister said the eu directive was a reaction to the terrorist attacks on madrid in march 2004 in which 191 people died .

9 . reginald dale is a trans-atlantic relations expert and a senior fellow at the center for strategic and international studies in washington . dw-world.de : what does the united states expect in terms of support and action from chancellor angela merkel 's germany on topics such as iran , afghanistan and the middle east ? reginald dale : germany is seen as less supportive than france on iraq and iran , but the bush administration is pleased that merkel agreed with the us that the time was ripe to launch a new middle east initiative - even if it is unlikely to get very far .
the us wants germany to support tougher sanctions on iran and merkel has made all the right noises to suggest that bush will get what he wants .
how far that support goes , time will tell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants german troops in action in afghanistan there is considerable concern in washington over the way some nato countries , particularly germany , are not pulling their weight in afghanistan , which is seen as a make-or-break test for nato .
if nato fails in afghanistan at least partly because german forces and others have failed to assume their share of the responsibility for the fighting through " caveats " - restrictive rules of engagement and absence from the battlefield - washington is much less likely in future to look to nato for joint operations and will resume its strategy of forming " coalitions of the willing , " something which germany does n't like .
washington wants germany and other countries to get involved in the dirty work of fighting the taliban .
this is very unlikely to happen , something merkel will again reiterate . although german politicians tend to think it was a major achievement to extend the stay of german forces in afghanistan , given the hostility of german public opinion , this is not the way germany 's commitment to afghanistan is seen in washington , where it is regarded as feeble and nit-picking . what is the us view of chancellor merkel ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tactile bush has a very different approach from merkel 's in america , the incident most remembered in the recent history of german-american relations is probably the moment at the st. petersburg g8 summit when bush gave merkel a surprise , high-speed backrub .
a video of the incident was widely circulated , to general merriment .
merkel was clearly horrified by the physical contact , just as she dislikes sarkozy 's constant hugging and kissing . bush and merkel express respect for each other , but their temperaments are completely different .
merkel likes quiet diplomacy , compromise and consensus - bush is driven by conviction and a sense of mission , which makes him much less likely to accept compromise easily . bush sees it as helpful that merkel is less pro-russian and less anti-american than her predecessor gerhard schröder , whom bush detested , and he is pleased that she is more inclined than schröder to understand the threats posed by international terrorism . is the working relationship between president bush and chancellor merkel a balanced one ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel claimed victory at the g8 , but bush was the winner , dale said i would not say that it is balanced , although chancellor merkel would probably say it is .
it seems that merkel , like many others , underestimates bush .
at the g8 heiligendamm summit , merkel claimed a diplomatic triumph in bringing bush on board on climate change , without apparently realizing that bush had run rings round her .
bush got virtually everything he wanted in heiligendamm . in exchange for agreeing to some vague global goal of reducing emissions , bush won on the following points : the goal would not be mandatory ; actions to try to counter climate change should not prevent strong economic growth ; technology is a large part of the answer ; and big emerging nations like china and india must be included in any post-kyoto agreement . bush , in fact , drove a stake through the heart of the whole kyoto approach right under merkel 's nose - and she did n't seem to notice . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 . reginald dale is a trans-atlantic relations expert and a senior fellow at the center for strategic and international studies in washington . dw-world.de : what does the united states expect in terms of support and action from chancellor angela merkel 's germany on topics such as iran , afghanistan and the middle east ? reginald dale : germany is seen as less supportive than france on iraq and iran , but the bush administration is pleased that merkel agreed with the us that the time was ripe to launch a new middle east initiative - even if it is unlikely to get very far .
the us wants germany to support tougher sanctions on iran and merkel has made all the right noises to suggest that bush will get what he wants .
how far that support goes , time will tell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants german troops in action in afghanistan there is considerable concern in washington over the way some nato countries , particularly germany , are not pulling their weight in afghanistan , which is seen as a make-or-break test for nato .
if nato fails in afghanistan at least partly because german forces and others have failed to assume their share of the responsibility for the fighting through " caveats " - restrictive rules of engagement and absence from the battlefield - washington is much less likely in future to look to nato for joint operations and will resume its strategy of forming " coalitions of the willing , " something which germany does n't like .
washington wants germany and other countries to get involved in the dirty work of fighting the taliban .
this is very unlikely to happen , something merkel will again reiterate . although german politicians tend to think it was a major achievement to extend the stay of german forces in afghanistan , given the hostility of german public opinion , this is not the way germany 's commitment to afghanistan is seen in washington , where it is regarded as feeble and nit-picking . what is the us view of chancellor merkel ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tactile bush has a very different approach from merkel 's in america , the incident most remembered in the recent history of german-american relations is probably the moment at the st. petersburg g8 summit when bush gave merkel a surprise , high-speed backrub .
a video of the incident was widely circulated , to general merriment .
merkel was clearly horrified by the physical contact , just as she dislikes sarkozy 's constant hugging and kissing . bush and merkel express respect for each other , but their temperaments are completely different .
merkel likes quiet diplomacy , compromise and consensus - bush is driven by conviction and a sense of mission , which makes him much less likely to accept compromise easily . bush sees it as helpful that merkel is less pro-russian and less anti-american than her predecessor gerhard schröder , whom bush detested , and he is pleased that she is more inclined than schröder to understand the threats posed by international terrorism . is the working relationship between president bush and chancellor merkel a balanced one ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel claimed victory at the g8 , but bush was the winner , dale said i would not say that it is balanced , although chancellor merkel would probably say it is .
it seems that merkel , like many others , underestimates bush .
at the g8 heiligendamm summit , merkel claimed a diplomatic triumph in bringing bush on board on climate change , without apparently realizing that bush had run rings round her .
bush got virtually everything he wanted in heiligendamm . in exchange for agreeing to some vague global goal of reducing emissions , bush won on the following points : the goal would not be mandatory ; actions to try to counter climate change should not prevent strong economic growth ; technology is a large part of the answer ; and big emerging nations like china and india must be included in any post-kyoto agreement . bush , in fact , drove a stake through the heart of the whole kyoto approach right under merkel 's nose - and she did n't seem to notice . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , border controls between eight european countries will cease .
malta will follow suit a short while later .
dw 's klaus dahmann is critical of the decision by eu interior ministers to expand the schengen zone . this early european christmas present has received little by way of media coverage in germany , although the implications for european union citizens are almost as far-reaching as those attached to the major eu expansion three years ago .
the deep gash that the iron curtain once scored right across the continent has already grown over , and with border controls about to be dropped , the physical scar will become invisible . the move , which will bring the newer eu countries into line with their western contemporaries , will also ease cross-border travel for citizens of older schengen countries .
germans will only have to show their passports to one of their neighbors : the swiss .
bildunterschrift : but to what extent is a relaxing of border controls and an expansion of the schengen zone a positive thing ?
the answer is : it 's good if you 're on the inside , but not so good if you are not .
barriers to russia , ukraine and serbia are getting higher and security measures are getting tighter .
bridges along the border between slovenia and croatia have been torn down , and there is no doubt that ljubljana is feeling an element of schadenfreude towards its non-schengen neighbor . in rolling its open-border system further eastwards , the eu is also opening up new and shorter crime routes .
regardless of the number of fences and security installations , and despite europe-wide visa data collection , europol and national police authorities will have fences of their own to climb if they are to take on the new challenges coming their way . the accusations of corruption currently facing the czech embassy in vietnam are a case in point .
before the czech republic has even become an official member of the schengen clan , german intelligence services pinpointed an increasing number of vietnamese citizens entering the country .
the allegations have not been proven , but they go to show that more embassies will have to implement tougher visa regulations in the future . yet even then , schengen will never manage to dispel the fear of certain european countries becoming a hot bet of economic refugees .
there is still a long way to go to solve integration problems within the union , and eu member states are far from reaching a consensus on how many immigrants they should allow into their respective territories . to the outside world , therefore , european politicians continue to sell higher external fences as the solution .
and rather than admit to their own citizens that the new schengen agreement will mean more workers from poland , slovakia or hungary seeking their fortune in the richer countries of western europe , they have opted to keep this celebration quiet . klaus dahmann is a correspondent for deutsche welle -lrb- tkw -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu ministers open up nine new countries to visa-free travel border controls will become a hassle of the past for nine more european countries as eu interior ministers agreed to expand the schengen free-movement to the south and east at a meeting in brussels .

however , despite the majority vote in favor of the " memorial to the freedom and unity of germany , " there were still many voices calling for a second monument in leipzig , the site of the demonstrations that marked the beginning of the end for communist rule in east germany .
former mayor of leipzig and current minister of transport wolfgang tiefensee , backed by saxony state premier georg milbradt , led the calls for the city to be included , but the motion was denied .
eastern states no nearer to being self-sufficient tiefensee , the federal representative for the states from the former east , injected a dose of reality into proceedings by presenting his annual findings on the progress of the eastern regions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee said the east 's positives should be focused on he told the bundestag that the eastern states were still far from being self-supporting , pointing out that his report focused on the divisions between east and west .
" we always talk only about the differences , " tiefensee said , adding that it would be more productive to highlight positive developments , which he said included eastern economic growth between 10 and 11 percent and a reduction of short-term unemployment .
but tiefensee added that long-term unemployment in the east was still a big problem and he urged the government to consider additional measures to the solidarity pact agreement that sends taxpayers ' money to the east , such as the continuation of the capital investment bonus beyond its current deadline of 2009 .
critics complain of western bias the location of the " memorial to the freedom and unity of germany " has been cited by some critics as just another example of how weighted the idea of unification towards the west has become .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig remembers the demos which led to unification luc jochimsen , cultural spokeswoman for the left party said earlier this week that the monument focuses on unification and ignores more important aspects of the 1989 revolution .
" we think berlin is the wrong place .
we think its focus should be on leipzig , not berlin , and on oct .
9 , not nov .
9 , " she said , referring to the start of the leipzig demonstrations in 1989 .
many germans still have mixed feelings about reunification , making the debate over the new monument even more complicated .
klaus-peter schöppner of the emnid polling institute told reuters this week that the majority of germans still think of the former communist east as a " second-class germany , " while a recent survey showed that one out of five germans would like to have the berlin wall back . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , 2008 the german parliament has given the go ahead to a law that will allow telephone and internet data to be stored for up to six months despite fierce criticism from the opposition and privacy advocates . the legislation approved friday , nov .
9 , also permits the telephone conversations of lawyers , journalists and doctors to be bugged under certain circumstances .
the decision not to exclude these professions from the law has sparked an outcry from those who rely on being able to speak to their clients or contacts confidentially .
members of parliament , religious clerics and state prosecutors have been provided exceptions to the law .
politicians from the opposition free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the greens and the left party have said they will mount legal challenges to the statute .
the marburger bund doctors ' association has also announced they would have its legality examined .
there have also been protests from journalists ' and publishing associations .
powers subject to judicial permission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police powers to conduct telephone surveillance will be extended under the law , police and german intelligence agencies must receive a court 's permission and show a strong suspicion of illegal activity in order to examine the data held by telephone companies .
the information will allow authorities to determine when and with whom their suspects had telephone , fax or e-mail contact .
police and others with access to the information will also be able to pinpoint where mobile phone calls took place .
the content of the communications will not , however , be provided to investigators .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said friday that criticism of the law had been exaggerated and stressed that it was not " paving the way towards a surveillance state . "
she added that the law would enable the authorities to combat crime and terrorism effectively .
the minister said the law implemented an eu directive in a " minimal fashion . "
but the german commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , said parts of the law exceeded european requirements by failing to exclude less serious crimes .
" a sad day for democracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu directive behind the german law was prompted by the madrid train bombings fdp expert jörg van essen said the legislation " placed citizens under general suspicion . "
he said he wants to appeal to the german constitutional court .
jan korte from the left party called the law one of the biggest attacks on press freedom and said that abuse was bound to occur .
the greens described it as a " black day for civil rights " and a " sad day for democracy . "
siegfried kauder , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , countered the criticism , saying that the law found the right balance between data protection and the need to fight crime .
he said it , in fact , represented an improvement in the legal position of journalists .
the justice minister said the eu directive was a reaction to the terrorist attacks on madrid in march 2004 in which 191 people died .
the perpetrators were tracked down using mobile telephone data .
some 366 parliamentarians voted in favor of the law , while 156 voted against .
there were two abstentions . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , 2008 the german parliament has given the go ahead to a law that will allow telephone and internet data to be stored for up to six months despite fierce criticism from the opposition and privacy advocates . the legislation approved friday , nov .
9 , also permits the telephone conversations of lawyers , journalists and doctors to be bugged under certain circumstances .
the decision not to exclude these professions from the law has sparked an outcry from those who rely on being able to speak to their clients or contacts confidentially .
members of parliament , religious clerics and state prosecutors have been provided exceptions to the law .
politicians from the opposition free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the greens and the left party have said they will mount legal challenges to the statute .
the marburger bund doctors ' association has also announced they would have its legality examined .
there have also been protests from journalists ' and publishing associations .
powers subject to judicial permission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police powers to conduct telephone surveillance will be extended under the law , police and german intelligence agencies must receive a court 's permission and show a strong suspicion of illegal activity in order to examine the data held by telephone companies .
the information will allow authorities to determine when and with whom their suspects had telephone , fax or e-mail contact .
police and others with access to the information will also be able to pinpoint where mobile phone calls took place .
the content of the communications will not , however , be provided to investigators .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said friday that criticism of the law had been exaggerated and stressed that it was not " paving the way towards a surveillance state . "
she added that the law would enable the authorities to combat crime and terrorism effectively .
the minister said the law implemented an eu directive in a " minimal fashion . "
but the german commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , said parts of the law exceeded european requirements by failing to exclude less serious crimes .
" a sad day for democracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu directive behind the german law was prompted by the madrid train bombings fdp expert jörg van essen said the legislation " placed citizens under general suspicion . "
he said he wants to appeal to the german constitutional court .
jan korte from the left party called the law one of the biggest attacks on press freedom and said that abuse was bound to occur .
the greens described it as a " black day for civil rights " and a " sad day for democracy . "
siegfried kauder , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , countered the criticism , saying that the law found the right balance between data protection and the need to fight crime .
he said it , in fact , represented an improvement in the legal position of journalists .
the justice minister said the eu directive was a reaction to the terrorist attacks on madrid in march 2004 in which 191 people died .
the perpetrators were tracked down using mobile telephone data .

1 , 2008 the german parliament has given the go ahead to a law that will allow telephone and internet data to be stored for up to six months despite fierce criticism from the opposition and privacy advocates . the legislation approved friday , nov .
9 , also permits the telephone conversations of lawyers , journalists and doctors to be bugged under certain circumstances .
the decision not to exclude these professions from the law has sparked an outcry from those who rely on being able to speak to their clients or contacts confidentially .
members of parliament , religious clerics and state prosecutors have been provided exceptions to the law .
politicians from the opposition free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the greens and the left party have said they will mount legal challenges to the statute .
the marburger bund doctors ' association has also announced they would have its legality examined .
there have also been protests from journalists ' and publishing associations .
powers subject to judicial permission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police powers to conduct telephone surveillance will be extended under the law , police and german intelligence agencies must receive a court 's permission and show a strong suspicion of illegal activity in order to examine the data held by telephone companies .
the information will allow authorities to determine when and with whom their suspects had telephone , fax or e-mail contact .
police and others with access to the information will also be able to pinpoint where mobile phone calls took place .
the content of the communications will not , however , be provided to investigators .
german justice minister brigitte zypries said friday that criticism of the law had been exaggerated and stressed that it was not " paving the way towards a surveillance state . "
she added that the law would enable the authorities to combat crime and terrorism effectively .
the minister said the law implemented an eu directive in a " minimal fashion . "
but the german commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , said parts of the law exceeded european requirements by failing to exclude less serious crimes .
" a sad day for democracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu directive behind the german law was prompted by the madrid train bombings fdp expert jörg van essen said the legislation " placed citizens under general suspicion . "
he said he wants to appeal to the german constitutional court .
jan korte from the left party called the law one of the biggest attacks on press freedom and said that abuse was bound to occur .
the greens described it as a " black day for civil rights " and a " sad day for democracy . "
siegfried kauder , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , countered the criticism , saying that the law found the right balance between data protection and the need to fight crime .
he said it , in fact , represented an improvement in the legal position of journalists .
the justice minister said the eu directive was a reaction to the terrorist attacks on madrid in march 2004 in which 191 people died .
the perpetrators were tracked down using mobile telephone data .
some 366 parliamentarians voted in favor of the law , while 156 voted against .
there were two abstentions . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 . reginald dale is a trans-atlantic relations expert and a senior fellow at the center for strategic and international studies in washington . dw-world.de : what does the united states expect in terms of support and action from chancellor angela merkel 's germany on topics such as iran , afghanistan and the middle east ? reginald dale : germany is seen as less supportive than france on iraq and iran , but the bush administration is pleased that merkel agreed with the us that the time was ripe to launch a new middle east initiative - even if it is unlikely to get very far .
the us wants germany to support tougher sanctions on iran and merkel has made all the right noises to suggest that bush will get what he wants .
how far that support goes , time will tell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants german troops in action in afghanistan there is considerable concern in washington over the way some nato countries , particularly germany , are not pulling their weight in afghanistan , which is seen as a make-or-break test for nato .
if nato fails in afghanistan at least partly because german forces and others have failed to assume their share of the responsibility for the fighting through " caveats " - restrictive rules of engagement and absence from the battlefield - washington is much less likely in future to look to nato for joint operations and will resume its strategy of forming " coalitions of the willing , " something which germany does n't like .
washington wants germany and other countries to get involved in the dirty work of fighting the taliban .
this is very unlikely to happen , something merkel will again reiterate . although german politicians tend to think it was a major achievement to extend the stay of german forces in afghanistan , given the hostility of german public opinion , this is not the way germany 's commitment to afghanistan is seen in washington , where it is regarded as feeble and nit-picking . what is the us view of chancellor merkel ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tactile bush has a very different approach from merkel 's in america , the incident most remembered in the recent history of german-american relations is probably the moment at the st. petersburg g8 summit when bush gave merkel a surprise , high-speed backrub .
a video of the incident was widely circulated , to general merriment .
merkel was clearly horrified by the physical contact , just as she dislikes sarkozy 's constant hugging and kissing . bush and merkel express respect for each other , but their temperaments are completely different .
merkel likes quiet diplomacy , compromise and consensus - bush is driven by conviction and a sense of mission , which makes him much less likely to accept compromise easily . bush sees it as helpful that merkel is less pro-russian and less anti-american than her predecessor gerhard schröder , whom bush detested , and he is pleased that she is more inclined than schröder to understand the threats posed by international terrorism . is the working relationship between president bush and chancellor merkel a balanced one ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel claimed victory at the g8 , but bush was the winner , dale said i would not say that it is balanced , although chancellor merkel would probably say it is .
it seems that merkel , like many others , underestimates bush .
at the g8 heiligendamm summit , merkel claimed a diplomatic triumph in bringing bush on board on climate change , without apparently realizing that bush had run rings round her .
bush got virtually everything he wanted in heiligendamm . in exchange for agreeing to some vague global goal of reducing emissions , bush won on the following points : the goal would not be mandatory ; actions to try to counter climate change should not prevent strong economic growth ; technology is a large part of the answer ; and big emerging nations like china and india must be included in any post-kyoto agreement . bush , in fact , drove a stake through the heart of the whole kyoto approach right under merkel 's nose - and she did n't seem to notice . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 .
both leaders have said they want to keep nuclear weapons out of tehran 's hands . " the international community must pursue its goal of preventing iran from having nuclear arms with firmness , " merkel said in an interview this week with the daily berliner zeitung .
" this is a process we should take step by step . " bush has also pointed to germany to take on an important role in nuclear negotiations with tehran . differences over dealing with iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both leaders want to keep nuclear weapons out of iran " we definitely need germany 's help on issues like iran , " president bush told german broadcaster rtl this week .
" germany is a crucial country in terms of building coalitions to deal with the threats we face . " but while merkel has stated a preference for giving the united nations a lead role in dealing with iran , bush has ratcheted up his rhetoric by saying that allowing tehran nuclear weapons could end in world war iii and that action needed to be taken quickly . disagreement over what step to take next will make reaching a us-german position difficult , according to thomas greven , a senior research fellow at the german institute for international relations in berlin .

21 , border controls between eight european countries will cease .
malta will follow suit a short while later .
dw 's klaus dahmann is critical of the decision by eu interior ministers to expand the schengen zone . this early european christmas present has received little by way of media coverage in germany , although the implications for european union citizens are almost as far-reaching as those attached to the major eu expansion three years ago .
the deep gash that the iron curtain once scored right across the continent has already grown over , and with border controls about to be dropped , the physical scar will become invisible . the move , which will bring the newer eu countries into line with their western contemporaries , will also ease cross-border travel for citizens of older schengen countries .
germans will only have to show their passports to one of their neighbors : the swiss .
bildunterschrift : but to what extent is a relaxing of border controls and an expansion of the schengen zone a positive thing ?
the answer is : it 's good if you 're on the inside , but not so good if you are not .
barriers to russia , ukraine and serbia are getting higher and security measures are getting tighter .
bridges along the border between slovenia and croatia have been torn down , and there is no doubt that ljubljana is feeling an element of schadenfreude towards its non-schengen neighbor . in rolling its open-border system further eastwards , the eu is also opening up new and shorter crime routes .
regardless of the number of fences and security installations , and despite europe-wide visa data collection , europol and national police authorities will have fences of their own to climb if they are to take on the new challenges coming their way . the accusations of corruption currently facing the czech embassy in vietnam are a case in point .
before the czech republic has even become an official member of the schengen clan , german intelligence services pinpointed an increasing number of vietnamese citizens entering the country .
the allegations have not been proven , but they go to show that more embassies will have to implement tougher visa regulations in the future . yet even then , schengen will never manage to dispel the fear of certain european countries becoming a hot bet of economic refugees .
there is still a long way to go to solve integration problems within the union , and eu member states are far from reaching a consensus on how many immigrants they should allow into their respective territories . to the outside world , therefore , european politicians continue to sell higher external fences as the solution .
and rather than admit to their own citizens that the new schengen agreement will mean more workers from poland , slovakia or hungary seeking their fortune in the richer countries of western europe , they have opted to keep this celebration quiet . klaus dahmann is a correspondent for deutsche welle -lrb- tkw -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us wants germany to support tougher sanctions on iran and merkel has made all the right noises to suggest that bush will get what he wants .
how far that support goes , time will tell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants german troops in action in afghanistan there is considerable concern in washington over the way some nato countries , particularly germany , are not pulling their weight in afghanistan , which is seen as a make-or-break test for nato .
if nato fails in afghanistan at least partly because german forces and others have failed to assume their share of the responsibility for the fighting through " caveats " - restrictive rules of engagement and absence from the battlefield - washington is much less likely in future to look to nato for joint operations and will resume its strategy of forming " coalitions of the willing , " something which germany does n't like .
washington wants germany and other countries to get involved in the dirty work of fighting the taliban .
this is very unlikely to happen , something merkel will again reiterate . although german politicians tend to think it was a major achievement to extend the stay of german forces in afghanistan , given the hostility of german public opinion , this is not the way germany 's commitment to afghanistan is seen in washington , where it is regarded as feeble and nit-picking . what is the us view of chancellor merkel ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tactile bush has a very different approach from merkel 's in america , the incident most remembered in the recent history of german-american relations is probably the moment at the st. petersburg g8 summit when bush gave merkel a surprise , high-speed backrub .

it is a view echoed by many big names in the german game . rummenigge 's comments follow a week of german clubs in european competition , with not one of the six clubs in action able to score a victory . he said the bundesliga could no longer compete financially with the top leagues in spain , england or italy . " we have to be clear that we no longer have a chance internationally , " he told the daily stuttgarter nachrichten on friday , nov .
9 .
" there is n't a manager or coach in the world who can compensate for this competitive disadvantage . " in the champions league , bundesliga champions vfl stuttgart are now out of contention after four successive defeats .
stuttgart will not even have the consolation of dropping into the uefa cup as third-placed finishers in their group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen 's campaign ended with defeat to lazio meanwhile werder bremen , who were beaten 2-1 by lazio on tuesday , are bottom of their group and schalke 04 , who drew 0-0 at home to chelsea , are third in their group . in uefa cup group matches thursday , bayern munich were held to a 2-2 draw at home to bolton wanderers , while nuremberg were beaten 2-0 at home by everton and bayer leverkusen went down 2-1 at spartak moscow .
the other german side in europe , sv hamburg , were without a game . rummenigge criticizes bayern 's uefa display rummenigge also publicly criticized bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld 's tactics after the draw with bolton , who sit just one place off the bottom of the english premier league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge says german teams are no longer competitive the bayern official lashed out at hitzfeld for replacing key players such as franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger for the final half hour with bayern leading 2-1 , which allowed bolton to grab a late equalizer . " i 'm really annoyed , " rummenigge had told journalists after the draw .
" it would have been very easy to win this one and advance .
the spectators have a right to see the best team play .
football is not mathematics .
you ca n't calculate everything . " hitzfeld said he did not want to directly comment on rummenigge 's remarks , but explained that he had wanted to rest ribery and schweinsteiger ahead of the bundesliga match at vfb stuttgart on saturday . " i hope i know the basic math of soccer , and i try to apply that , " said hitzfeld , who studied mathematics at university .
" i believe that i found the right mixture so that we can win in stuttgart , " hitzfeld also said , he wanted to rotate some of the players to prevent injuries . " it was a reasonable decision , " he added .
" we need to get back on track at stuttgart after two league draws . " hitzfeld added that he was not worried about rummenigge 's attack . " i 'm used to stormy weather , " he said .
" you should n't let yourself be influenced by such petty issues . " funding adding to lack of german competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke matched moneybags chelsea in the score only rummenigge 's tirade against bundesliga teams continued with a complaint that the german representatives in the champions league were " not sufficiently competitive " against their rivals from other major european leagues who were earning vastly more from television broadcast sales . the 52-year-old former international called for a new distribution of tv earnings in the bundesliga , saying a team like vfb stuttgart had to be treated differently from clubs such as energie cottbus or vfl bochum . " either we decide on individual marketing , or the key to distribution has to be aligned to the status and merit of the respective clubs , " he said . finance was now the key in international soccer , enabling top clubs to invest in quality players . " the bundesliga is buying only quantity on the transfer market .
one can see the result of this in the champions league , " rummenigge added . soccer statesmen weigh in on bundesliga malaise rummenigge is not alone in his concern over the comparative quality of the bundesliga .
germany national team coach joachim löw said earlier in the week that he was also alarmed at the poor showing of the three champions league representatives who have managed a total of just seven points from 12 matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi löw fears young players will lack international experience " that 's an extremely disappointing international performance , " löw told german sport news agency sid .
" there 's no way we can be happy about that .
it is no help for players like mario gomez and thomas hitzlsperger or young talents like serdar tasci and sami khedira if they do n't get international exposure . " the voices of concern also included former west germany coach and captain franz beckenbauer as well as ex-captains lothar matthäus and oliver kahn . " the results are alarming , " matthäus told premiere tv .
" you need heart , passion , engagement and an identification with your club in soccer .
you do n't see that at some of these clubs . " kahn said : " the bundesliga might look like a top product from the outside , with lovely packaging , but this great wrapping is n't worth a thing .
we 've got to show that we 've got the goods on the inside too . " in uefa 's five-year ratings , the bundesliga is sixth behind the leagues in spain , england , italy , france and romania . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both leaders have said they want to keep nuclear weapons out of tehran 's hands . " the international community must pursue its goal of preventing iran from having nuclear arms with firmness , " merkel said in an interview this week with the daily berliner zeitung .
" this is a process we should take step by step . " bush has also pointed to germany to take on an important role in nuclear negotiations with tehran . differences over dealing with iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both leaders want to keep nuclear weapons out of iran " we definitely need germany 's help on issues like iran , " president bush told german broadcaster rtl this week .
" germany is a crucial country in terms of building coalitions to deal with the threats we face . " but while merkel has stated a preference for giving the united nations a lead role in dealing with iran , bush has ratcheted up his rhetoric by saying that allowing tehran nuclear weapons could end in world war iii and that action needed to be taken quickly . disagreement over what step to take next will make reaching a us-german position difficult , according to thomas greven , a senior research fellow at the german institute for international relations in berlin . " i think that bush will also be testing the waters for potential military action against iran , " he said .
" there is in some sense a unity in europe and in germany for a tough diplomatic posture against iran but that does not extend to military action .

" it is quite true to say that angela merkel has brought the us and germany back to a calm professional relationship , " she said .
" and for this president , personal relationships are very important . " merkel is also said to have a strong regard for the president and the american people . " i think the affection and regard that merkel has for the us is genuine , " stelzenmüller said . for his part , bush has repeatedly expressed admiration for the german leader who grew up in communist east germany and went on to lead one of the world 's biggest democracies and europe 's largest economy . the texas white house bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel also hosted bush to an informal german barbecue in 2006 the invitation to the ranch in crawford , texas - where bush famously said he saw into the " soul " of russian president vladimir putin - is a signal that bush values good relations with germany , greven said . but he added that there was little hope of closing the gaps in the differences of opinion on germany 's desire for a permanent seat at the un security council , which bush does not support , and merkel 's refusal to send german troops to afghanistan 's war-torn south .

it is a view echoed by many big names in the german game . rummenigge 's comments follow a week of german clubs in european competition , with not one of the six clubs in action able to score a victory . he said the bundesliga could no longer compete financially with the top leagues in spain , england or italy . " we have to be clear that we no longer have a chance internationally , " he told the daily stuttgarter nachrichten on friday , nov .
9 .
" there is n't a manager or coach in the world who can compensate for this competitive disadvantage . " in the champions league , bundesliga champions vfl stuttgart are now out of contention after four successive defeats .
stuttgart will not even have the consolation of dropping into the uefa cup as third-placed finishers in their group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen 's campaign ended with defeat to lazio meanwhile werder bremen , who were beaten 2-1 by lazio on tuesday , are bottom of their group and schalke 04 , who drew 0-0 at home to chelsea , are third in their group . in uefa cup group matches thursday , bayern munich were held to a 2-2 draw at home to bolton wanderers , while nuremberg were beaten 2-0 at home by everton and bayer leverkusen went down 2-1 at spartak moscow .
the other german side in europe , sv hamburg , were without a game . rummenigge criticizes bayern 's uefa display rummenigge also publicly criticized bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld 's tactics after the draw with bolton , who sit just one place off the bottom of the english premier league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge says german teams are no longer competitive the bayern official lashed out at hitzfeld for replacing key players such as franck ribery and bastian schweinsteiger for the final half hour with bayern leading 2-1 , which allowed bolton to grab a late equalizer . " i 'm really annoyed , " rummenigge had told journalists after the draw .
" it would have been very easy to win this one and advance .
the spectators have a right to see the best team play .
football is not mathematics .
you ca n't calculate everything . " hitzfeld said he did not want to directly comment on rummenigge 's remarks , but explained that he had wanted to rest ribery and schweinsteiger ahead of the bundesliga match at vfb stuttgart on saturday . " i hope i know the basic math of soccer , and i try to apply that , " said hitzfeld , who studied mathematics at university .
" i believe that i found the right mixture so that we can win in stuttgart , " hitzfeld also said , he wanted to rotate some of the players to prevent injuries . " it was a reasonable decision , " he added .
" we need to get back on track at stuttgart after two league draws . " hitzfeld added that he was not worried about rummenigge 's attack . " i 'm used to stormy weather , " he said .
" you should n't let yourself be influenced by such petty issues . " funding adding to lack of german competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke matched moneybags chelsea in the score only rummenigge 's tirade against bundesliga teams continued with a complaint that the german representatives in the champions league were " not sufficiently competitive " against their rivals from other major european leagues who were earning vastly more from television broadcast sales . the 52-year-old former international called for a new distribution of tv earnings in the bundesliga , saying a team like vfb stuttgart had to be treated differently from clubs such as energie cottbus or vfl bochum . " either we decide on individual marketing , or the key to distribution has to be aligned to the status and merit of the respective clubs , " he said . finance was now the key in international soccer , enabling top clubs to invest in quality players . " the bundesliga is buying only quantity on the transfer market .
one can see the result of this in the champions league , " rummenigge added . soccer statesmen weigh in on bundesliga malaise rummenigge is not alone in his concern over the comparative quality of the bundesliga .
germany national team coach joachim löw said earlier in the week that he was also alarmed at the poor showing of the three champions league representatives who have managed a total of just seven points from 12 matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi löw fears young players will lack international experience " that 's an extremely disappointing international performance , " löw told german sport news agency sid .
" there 's no way we can be happy about that .
it is no help for players like mario gomez and thomas hitzlsperger or young talents like serdar tasci and sami khedira if they do n't get international exposure . " the voices of concern also included former west germany coach and captain franz beckenbauer as well as ex-captains lothar matthäus and oliver kahn . " the results are alarming , " matthäus told premiere tv .
" you need heart , passion , engagement and an identification with your club in soccer .
you do n't see that at some of these clubs . " kahn said : " the bundesliga might look like a top product from the outside , with lovely packaging , but this great wrapping is n't worth a thing .
we 've got to show that we 've got the goods on the inside too . " in uefa 's five-year ratings , the bundesliga is sixth behind the leagues in spain , england , italy , france and romania . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

adam goble told the bbc there was a shortage of sandbags in the area .
he said there were none left in his area , apart from a few " lying on the floor -lrb- with -rrb- a barrage of people arguing for them " .
adam smith , 16 , said : " it 's all a bit helpless here .
we do n't know if we will be evacuated . "
adam , whose home in the southtown area was flooded in september 2006 , said : " we 've had no local authority showing here and certainly no information about evacuation .
" people do n't really know what to do with themselves . "
i suppose in some ways we have n't lost as much as some people , but if we lose our tents we lose pretty much everything , we wo n't have anywhere to go then chris emmerson " i have moved all of our important things upstairs and we are now just waiting .
i went to the fish and chip shop area and there is a real blitz spirit here .
" we 've had the neighbours around to have a cup of tea and the street is full of people protecting their houses .
alastair agutter said that at 0500 gmt the wind had been increasing in strength .
" the area is now receiving a heavy downpour of rain that will only compound the threat and cause further anxiety , " he said .
" the town of great yarmouth still has power , but electricity has been surging for the last three hours . "
flooding concern chris emmerson , who is homeless , had been living rough on a beach in the town but has been told to spend the night at a local school .
" we 've just been moved off the beach as we 're living in tents , " he said .
" up until now it 's been pretty good the weather and everything but tonight the sea has almost reached our tents and we 've been moved to caister school as a safety precaution .
" i suppose in some ways we have n't lost as much as some people , but if we lose our tents we lose pretty much everything , we wo n't have anywhere to go then . "
another resident , theresa frost , is a single mother with three children who lives " just on the sea front " .
she said : " any flooding is going to be on our doorstep as it will flow into the lower area of our street .
" i am unsure as to how to obtain sand bags for some protection . "
terry yallop , of cobholm , said he had put " about six sand bags by our front and back door of our house " .

the spending watchdog says that demand in the " pathfinder areas " has risen , but it is not clear if that is because of the scheme launched in 2002 .
some 1,100 homes have been built , 40,000 refurbished and 10,200 demolished in the nine existing areas .
ministers say they have revitalised some of england 's most deprived areas .
national audit office head sir john bourn said : " housing market renewal is a radical programme but it is a high risk approach .
you have to wonder if these areas would see the same or greater regeneration if left to their own devices edward leigh , conservative mp " while there have been physical improvements in some neighbourhoods , it is unclear whether intervention itself has led to improvement in the problems of low demand .
" and in some cases intervention has exacerbated problems in the short term .
" the department for communities and local government needs to make sure that pathfinders not only delivers its regional development plans , but also complements the broader regeneration of areas contributing to better schools and transport links . "
the chairman of an influential mps ' committee said many residents felt the authorities had " ridden roughshod " over their communities , with little clear evidence of improvements .
refurbish and demolish edward leigh , the conservative chairman of the house of commons public accounts committee , said : " there is no evidence that pathfinders are bringing about improved social cohesion and although low demand for properties has fallen in the pathfinders areas , it has n't fallen as quickly as it has in the rest of the country .
" you have to wonder if these areas would see the same or greater regeneration if left to their own devices . "
a department of communities and local government spokesman said : " the nao acknowledges that housing markets have performed better in pathfinder local authorities than in those authorities with the most similar level of low-demand problems .
" significant progress has been made , and we are confident that this programme will continue to revitalise some of our most deprived neighbourhoods in the years ahead . "
pathfinders expect to demolish 57,100 properties - a reduction from the initially-planned 90,000 - and commission 67,600 new homes by the likely completion of the housing market renewal programme , which is due in 2018 .

the final such exam is due to take place next year , following legislation under direct rule .
this year 15,750 children signed up to sit the tests in english , maths and science , which determine the sort of secondary school they will attend .
that is more than sat the transfer test last year , but about the same proportion of those in the age group .
in a time of reported falling school numbers , the explanation given for the rise is a temporary blip in the population figures .
the minister for education , caitriona ruane , is under pressure to announce how children will be selected in future .
she insists it will not be by academic tests , but is opposed on that by other politicians .

the iphone is not perfect - far from it - but it genuinely re-moulds the expectations we have for mobile devices .
and it provokes a reaction among gadget lovers and ordinary members of the public that no other phone can match .
key iphone rivals nokia n95 sony ericsson w960 lg lgks20 htc touch palm centro blackberry pearl samsung blackjack t-mobile sidekick slide who 's afraid of the iphone ?
i have been testing it for the last two weeks and whenever people see it they want to hold it , touch it and play with it .
and they are genuinely amazed by some of its features .
under the strict letter of the non-disclosure agreement i had to sign with apple to be loaned the phone i was not supposed to let anyone hold the device .
nor was i to demonstrate it , display it , let anyone photograph it nor even " discuss " it with anyone outside my " immediate family " .
ridiculous ?
absolutely .
but perhaps a reflection of the iphone lunacy that has gripped many people - including , evidently staff at apple itself .
in the us it is known as the jesusphone - because of the hysteria and hype that surrounds the device .
but let 's start with the disappointments - it is a 2g device and not 3g .
anyone expecting to use the phone to surf websites or access content over the mobile network will be in for a shock .
graphics and picture-heavy websites take an age to load .
but rss feeds and mobile-friendly websites -lrb- such as news.bbc.co.uk / mobile -rrb- load quite quickly over the 2g edge network that o2 offers .
i also found it sufficiently speedy to send and receive e-mails on the go .
sadly , o2 's edge network only covers 30 % of the country so if you are not in a major urban area , you will experience painfully slow data connections .
the phone has built-in wi-fi and you can access more than 7,000 of the cloud 's hotspots for free .
web pages load very quickly over a wi-fi network and there is none of the usual " hang " , or delay , that is associated with mobile net devices .
the web browser successfully redefines the mobile web experience and over a wi-fi connection it is - for the first time on a phone - a pleasure to read sites on the go .
the iphone overcomes the physical limitations of screen size by letting the user zoom into sections of a page with a double tap .
the whole page can then be dragged around with a finger .
for a phone which boasts of being an internet communicator it lacks features such as instant messaging -lrb- im -rrb- and voice over ip .
apple might have had trouble finding network partners if the device had come with the mac 's im and talk client ichat , for example .
but the firm could have taken a lead in this field and revolutionised on-the-go communications in the way blackberry did for e-mail .
the phone also lacks the ability to sync data - such as calendar details and contacts - wirelessly , either through short-range bluetooth or over the mobile network .
the camera that comes with the phone is also deeply disappointing .
it offers a measly two megapixels and while the sensor in the phone is decent , images are often poor quality unless shot in direct sunlight .
however , the success of the phone lies in its marriage of touch screen and user interface .
many mobiles have touch technology but they are generally poorly implemented or a painful hybrid between touch screen and keypad .
the various functions of the phone have been knitted together brilliantly - it is child 's play to text or e-mail from a contact 's details , or to add calendar events and then open web pages from a link in an appointment .
these are the simplest of things but by stripping out cluttered menu options apple has taken out the fear from technology .
the programs and features are well laid out and there is none of the usual " hunt the settings " scenario that accompanies most phones .
its underlying operating system - based on mac os x - is very robust .
i have lost count of the times my personal handsets have crashed or frozen and required the battery being removed and restarted .
of course , you ca n't actually remove the battery from an iphone .
programs on the apple device slip easily in and out of running and i can not report a single " hang " or crash .
it is also very easy to overlook the ipod aspect of the phone .
it is a fully functional music and video player and syncs with itunes .
the touch screen user interface which lets the user flick between album cover art , or artists , genres and playlists will soon be copied by many other handset manufacturers as the sincerest form of flattery .
sadly , the iphone only comes with 8gb of flash memory - and no more can be added through memory cards .
in years to come the device will undoubtedly have more capacity , but if you want access to your whole album collection on the go , the iphone probably is n't the convergence device you have been waiting for .
the iphone is n't for everyone - it is not a true smartphone device , the storage capacity is fixed and limiting for people with large music collections , the camera is low quality , it lacks true internet communication capabilities and the 2g handset is slow for data connections over the cell network .
but in many ways it succeeds in the way the original ipod did .
both are flawed devices .
but like the ipod , the iphone will force every other competitor in the market to raise its game .
and for that consumers should be thankful for the iphone - even if they have no intention of buying one .

but rss feeds and mobile-friendly websites -lrb- such as news.bbc.co.uk / mobile -rrb- load quite quickly over the 2g edge network that o2 offers .
i also found it sufficiently speedy to send and receive e-mails on the go .
sadly , o2 's edge network only covers 30 % of the country so if you are not in a major urban area , you will experience painfully slow data connections .
as a work productivity device the iphone can not match blackberry the phone has built-in wi-fi and you can access more than 7,000 of the cloud 's hotspots for free .
web pages load very quickly over a wi-fi network and there is none of the usual " hang " , or delay , that is associated with mobile net devices .
the web browser successfully redefines the mobile web experience and over a wi-fi connection it is - for the first time on a phone - a pleasure to read sites on the go .
the iphone overcomes the physical limitations of screen size by letting the user zoom into sections of a page with a double tap .
the whole page can then be dragged around with a finger .
for a phone which boasts of being an internet communicator it lacks features such as instant messaging -lrb- im -rrb- and voice over ip .
apple might have had trouble finding network partners if the device had come with the mac 's im and talk client ichat , for example .
but the firm could have taken a lead in this field and revolutionised on-the-go communications in the way blackberry did for e-mail .
the phone also lacks the ability to sync data - such as calendar details and contacts - wirelessly , either through short-range bluetooth or over the mobile network .
the iphone is also apple 's premier ipod the camera that comes with the phone is also deeply disappointing .
it offers a measly two megapixels and while the sensor in the phone is decent , images are often poor quality unless shot in direct sunlight .
however , the success of the phone lies in its marriage of touch screen and user interface .
many mobiles have touch technology but they are generally poorly implemented or a painful hybrid between touch screen and keypad .
the various functions of the phone have been knitted together brilliantly - it is child 's play to text or e-mail from a contact 's details , or to add calendar events and then open web pages from a link in an appointment .
these are the simplest of things but by stripping out cluttered menu options apple has taken out the fear from technology .
the programs and features are well laid out and there is none of the usual " hunt the settings " scenario that accompanies most phones .
its underlying operating system - based on mac os x - is very robust .
i have lost count of the times my personal handsets have crashed or frozen and required the battery being removed and restarted .
of course , you ca n't actually remove the battery from an iphone .
programs on the apple device slip easily in and out of running and i can not report a single " hang " or crash .
other handsets boast touch features - like the htc touch it is also very easy to overlook the ipod aspect of the phone .
it is a fully functional music and video player and syncs with itunes .
the touch screen user interface which lets the user flick between album cover art , or artists , genres and playlists will soon be copied by many other handset manufacturers as the sincerest form of flattery .
sadly , the iphone only comes with 8gb of flash memory - and no more can be added through memory cards .
in years to come the device will undoubtedly have more capacity , but if you want access to your whole album collection on the go , the iphone probably is n't the convergence device you have been waiting for .
the iphone is n't for everyone - it is not a true smartphone device , the storage capacity is fixed and limiting for people with large music collections , the camera is low quality , it lacks true internet communication capabilities and the 2g handset is slow for data connections over the cell network .
but in many ways it succeeds in the way the original ipod did .
both are flawed devices .
but like the ipod , the iphone will force every other competitor in the market to raise its game .
and for that consumers should be thankful for the iphone - even if they have no intention of buying one .

the touch screen user interface which lets the user flick between album cover art , or artists , genres and playlists will soon be copied by many other handset manufacturers as the sincerest form of flattery .
sadly , the iphone only comes with 8gb of flash memory - and no more can be added through memory cards .
in years to come the device will undoubtedly have more capacity , but if you want access to your whole album collection on the go , the iphone probably is n't the convergence device you have been waiting for .
the iphone is n't for everyone - it is not a true smartphone device , the storage capacity is fixed and limiting for people with large music collections , the camera is low quality , it lacks true internet communication capabilities and the 2g handset is slow for data connections over the cell network .
but in many ways it succeeds in the way the original ipod did .

i have been testing it for the last two weeks and whenever people see it they want to hold it , touch it and play with it .
and they are genuinely amazed by some of its features .
under the strict letter of the non-disclosure agreement i had to sign with apple to be loaned the phone i was not supposed to let anyone hold the device .
nor was i to demonstrate it , display it , let anyone photograph it nor even " discuss " it with anyone outside my " immediate family " .
ridiculous ?
absolutely .
but perhaps a reflection of the iphone lunacy that has gripped many people - including , evidently staff at apple itself .
in the us it is known as the jesusphone - because of the hysteria and hype that surrounds the device .
n95 v apple iphone but let 's start with the disappointments - it is a 2g device and not 3g .
anyone expecting to use the phone to surf websites or access content over the mobile network will be in for a shock .
graphics and picture-heavy websites take an age to load .
but rss feeds and mobile-friendly websites -lrb- such as news.bbc.co.uk / mobile -rrb- load quite quickly over the 2g edge network that o2 offers .
i also found it sufficiently speedy to send and receive e-mails on the go .
sadly , o2 's edge network only covers 30 % of the country so if you are not in a major urban area , you will experience painfully slow data connections .
as a work productivity device the iphone can not match blackberry the phone has built-in wi-fi and you can access more than 7,000 of the cloud 's hotspots for free .
web pages load very quickly over a wi-fi network and there is none of the usual " hang " , or delay , that is associated with mobile net devices .
the web browser successfully redefines the mobile web experience and over a wi-fi connection it is - for the first time on a phone - a pleasure to read sites on the go .
the iphone overcomes the physical limitations of screen size by letting the user zoom into sections of a page with a double tap .
the whole page can then be dragged around with a finger .
for a phone which boasts of being an internet communicator it lacks features such as instant messaging -lrb- im -rrb- and voice over ip .
apple might have had trouble finding network partners if the device had come with the mac 's im and talk client ichat , for example .
but the firm could have taken a lead in this field and revolutionised on-the-go communications in the way blackberry did for e-mail .
the phone also lacks the ability to sync data - such as calendar details and contacts - wirelessly , either through short-range bluetooth or over the mobile network .
the iphone is also apple 's premier ipod the camera that comes with the phone is also deeply disappointing .
it offers a measly two megapixels and while the sensor in the phone is decent , images are often poor quality unless shot in direct sunlight .
however , the success of the phone lies in its marriage of touch screen and user interface .
many mobiles have touch technology but they are generally poorly implemented or a painful hybrid between touch screen and keypad .
the various functions of the phone have been knitted together brilliantly - it is child 's play to text or e-mail from a contact 's details , or to add calendar events and then open web pages from a link in an appointment .
these are the simplest of things but by stripping out cluttered menu options apple has taken out the fear from technology .

the iphone is not perfect - far from it - but it genuinely re-moulds the expectations we have for mobile devices .
and it provokes a reaction among gadget lovers and ordinary members of the public that no other phone can match .
key iphone rivals nokia n95 sony ericsson w960 lg lgks20 htc touch palm centro blackberry pearl samsung blackjack t-mobile sidekick slide who 's afraid of the iphone ?
i have been testing it for the last two weeks and whenever people see it they want to hold it , touch it and play with it .
and they are genuinely amazed by some of its features .
under the strict letter of the non-disclosure agreement i had to sign with apple to be loaned the phone i was not supposed to let anyone hold the device .
nor was i to demonstrate it , display it , let anyone photograph it nor even " discuss " it with anyone outside my " immediate family " .
ridiculous ?
absolutely .
but perhaps a reflection of the iphone lunacy that has gripped many people - including , evidently staff at apple itself .
in the us it is known as the jesusphone - because of the hysteria and hype that surrounds the device .
n95 v apple iphone but let 's start with the disappointments - it is a 2g device and not 3g .
anyone expecting to use the phone to surf websites or access content over the mobile network will be in for a shock .
graphics and picture-heavy websites take an age to load .
but rss feeds and mobile-friendly websites -lrb- such as news.bbc.co.uk / mobile -rrb- load quite quickly over the 2g edge network that o2 offers .
i also found it sufficiently speedy to send and receive e-mails on the go .
sadly , o2 's edge network only covers 30 % of the country so if you are not in a major urban area , you will experience painfully slow data connections .
as a work productivity device the iphone can not match blackberry the phone has built-in wi-fi and you can access more than 7,000 of the cloud 's hotspots for free .
web pages load very quickly over a wi-fi network and there is none of the usual " hang " , or delay , that is associated with mobile net devices .
the web browser successfully redefines the mobile web experience and over a wi-fi connection it is - for the first time on a phone - a pleasure to read sites on the go .
the iphone overcomes the physical limitations of screen size by letting the user zoom into sections of a page with a double tap .
the whole page can then be dragged around with a finger .
for a phone which boasts of being an internet communicator it lacks features such as instant messaging -lrb- im -rrb- and voice over ip .
apple might have had trouble finding network partners if the device had come with the mac 's im and talk client ichat , for example .
but the firm could have taken a lead in this field and revolutionised on-the-go communications in the way blackberry did for e-mail .
the phone also lacks the ability to sync data - such as calendar details and contacts - wirelessly , either through short-range bluetooth or over the mobile network .
the iphone is also apple 's premier ipod the camera that comes with the phone is also deeply disappointing .
it offers a measly two megapixels and while the sensor in the phone is decent , images are often poor quality unless shot in direct sunlight .
however , the success of the phone lies in its marriage of touch screen and user interface .
many mobiles have touch technology but they are generally poorly implemented or a painful hybrid between touch screen and keypad .
the various functions of the phone have been knitted together brilliantly - it is child 's play to text or e-mail from a contact 's details , or to add calendar events and then open web pages from a link in an appointment .
these are the simplest of things but by stripping out cluttered menu options apple has taken out the fear from technology .
the programs and features are well laid out and there is none of the usual " hunt the settings " scenario that accompanies most phones .
its underlying operating system - based on mac os x - is very robust .
i have lost count of the times my personal handsets have crashed or frozen and required the battery being removed and restarted .
of course , you ca n't actually remove the battery from an iphone .
programs on the apple device slip easily in and out of running and i can not report a single " hang " or crash .
other handsets boast touch features - like the htc touch it is also very easy to overlook the ipod aspect of the phone .
it is a fully functional music and video player and syncs with itunes .
the touch screen user interface which lets the user flick between album cover art , or artists , genres and playlists will soon be copied by many other handset manufacturers as the sincerest form of flattery .
sadly , the iphone only comes with 8gb of flash memory - and no more can be added through memory cards .
in years to come the device will undoubtedly have more capacity , but if you want access to your whole album collection on the go , the iphone probably is n't the convergence device you have been waiting for .
the iphone is n't for everyone - it is not a true smartphone device , the storage capacity is fixed and limiting for people with large music collections , the camera is low quality , it lacks true internet communication capabilities and the 2g handset is slow for data connections over the cell network .
but in many ways it succeeds in the way the original ipod did .
both are flawed devices .
but like the ipod , the iphone will force every other competitor in the market to raise its game .
and for that consumers should be thankful for the iphone - even if they have no intention of buying one .

the ships in the town 's historic harbour sat high in the water , gang planks and ladders hanging high above the quayside .
the water swelled on the river yare , and a furious tide rushed in to the norfolk broads .
as a natural spectacle it was amazing , yet not enough to forget the potential human cost .
while the immediate threat of flooding has begun to recede , in the hours leading up to this spectacle there was distress , anguish and panic .
people tried to fill sandbags to protect their homes and property and waited to discover if their homes would be safe from the surge .
i saw a huge scaffolding plank drifting downstream near the haven bridge where water lapped at its underside .
it took less than a minute for it to cover hundreds of metres .
relatives ' help in 2006 , great yarmouth was flooded four times by rain and sea water , so it is no surprise that people in the town have been taking the latest flood warning very seriously .
a lot of people have likened this alert to the 1953 floods , or at least their expectations of the potential consequences .
but in 2007 great yarmouth has much better sea and river defences .
had it not been for those defences some people fear the town could have been in the same position as 1953 .
i was one of those who had to swing into action in the middle of the night , calling relatives to help me protect my house and move furniture upstairs .
the river level has reached the bottom of the bridge at the moment i feel incredibly relieved .
i would rather be inconvenienced in putting back furniture than being forced to rip out sodden carpets and dry out wet plaster .
but there has been some localised flooding .
water edged towards the top of the haven bridge , one of the main routes into the town , and south quay , alongside the river yare , has been flooded .
schools and community centres across the town have been opened as rest centres for those who have fled .
they are full and many are oversubscribed .
family fears the mood of the people across great yarmouth has been mixed .
some people just wanted to be allowed to stay in their homes and have treated the evacuations as an inconvenience .
others , who have seen it all before , were resigned to fact they had to be moved to the rest centres .
many others were visibly upset at being forced to leave their homes , especially those who had previously been flooded .
some can not get insurance because of previous incidents , some simply can not afford it such is the level of the premiums .

the ships in the town 's historic harbour sat high in the water , gang planks and ladders hanging high above the quayside .
the water swelled on the river yare , and a furious tide rushed in to the norfolk broads .
as a natural spectacle it was amazing , yet not enough to forget the potential human cost .
while the immediate threat of flooding has begun to recede , in the hours leading up to this spectacle there was distress , anguish and panic .
people tried to fill sandbags to protect their homes and property and waited to discover if their homes would be safe from the surge .
i saw a huge scaffolding plank drifting downstream near the haven bridge where water lapped at its underside .
it took less than a minute for it to cover hundreds of metres .
relatives ' help in 2006 , great yarmouth was flooded four times by rain and sea water , so it is no surprise that people in the town have been taking the latest flood warning very seriously .
a lot of people have likened this alert to the 1953 floods , or at least their expectations of the potential consequences .
but in 2007 great yarmouth has much better sea and river defences .
had it not been for those defences some people fear the town could have been in the same position as 1953 .
i was one of those who had to swing into action in the middle of the night , calling relatives to help me protect my house and move furniture upstairs .
the river level has reached the bottom of the bridge at the moment i feel incredibly relieved .
i would rather be inconvenienced in putting back furniture than being forced to rip out sodden carpets and dry out wet plaster .
but there has been some localised flooding .
water edged towards the top of the haven bridge , one of the main routes into the town , and south quay , alongside the river yare , has been flooded .
schools and community centres across the town have been opened as rest centres for those who have fled .
they are full and many are oversubscribed .
family fears the mood of the people across great yarmouth has been mixed .
some people just wanted to be allowed to stay in their homes and have treated the evacuations as an inconvenience .
others , who have seen it all before , were resigned to fact they had to be moved to the rest centres .
many others were visibly upset at being forced to leave their homes , especially those who had previously been flooded .
some can not get insurance because of previous incidents , some simply can not afford it such is the level of the premiums .
for these people , the storm surge could have proven disastrous .

a lot of people have likened this alert to the 1953 floods , or at least their expectations of the potential consequences .
but in 2007 great yarmouth has much better sea and river defences .
had it not been for those defences some people fear the town could have been in the same position as 1953 .
i was one of those who had to swing into action in the middle of the night , calling relatives to help me protect my house and move furniture upstairs .
the river level has reached the bottom of the bridge at the moment i feel incredibly relieved .
i would rather be inconvenienced in putting back furniture than being forced to rip out sodden carpets and dry out wet plaster .
but there has been some localised flooding .
water edged towards the top of the haven bridge , one of the main routes into the town , and south quay , alongside the river yare , has been flooded .
schools and community centres across the town have been opened as rest centres for those who have fled .
they are full and many are oversubscribed .
family fears the mood of the people across great yarmouth has been mixed .
some people just wanted to be allowed to stay in their homes and have treated the evacuations as an inconvenience .
others , who have seen it all before , were resigned to fact they had to be moved to the rest centres .
many others were visibly upset at being forced to leave their homes , especially those who had previously been flooded .
some can not get insurance because of previous incidents , some simply can not afford it such is the level of the premiums .
for these people , the storm surge could have proven disastrous .
