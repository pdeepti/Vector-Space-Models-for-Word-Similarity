the challenge lies in demonstrating a subject that is neither tangible nor visible .
curators in berlin designed “ pain ” as a twofold experience . at the entrance to the hanburger bahnhof , a former train station that houses berlin ’ s national gallery of contemporary art , the first exhibit that catches the eye is a subtle hint of things to come .
enclosed in a showcase is a simple piece of wood , about one meter in length and tightly wrapped in a thick leather hide .
up until the 19th century , it was a staple piece of medical equipment : in the absence of effective anesthetics , countless people dug their teeth into this contraption to avoid biting their own tongue off during painful surgical procedures .
more than a relic of medical history , this inanimate object - full of bite marks - is capable of invoking harrowing images in the mind ’ s eye : images of a situation so painful , you can almost feel it .
indeed , that has been the central challenge for this new exhibition called " schmerz " -lrb- " pain " -rrb- : how to convey the sensation of pain , without actually inflicting it ?
bildunterschrift : berlin 's museum for contemporary art a twofold approach for hamburger bahnhof curator eugen blume , the solution lies in the mingling of art and science .
" the juxtaposition of scientific and artistic works in this joint exhibition is meant to blur the lines between these two areas , " he said .
this idea finds its most obvious expression in the fact that " schmerz " is a joint exhibition involving the hamburger bahnhof museum of contemporary art and the medical history museum of berlin 's charité teaching hospital .
the hamburger bahnhof explores the subjective experience of physical and psychological suffering from an artistic point of view .
divided into two distinct sections , " perceptions of pain " examines the way in which humans cope with the suffering of others , while " allure of pain " delves into individual ways of coping with pain - including the sexual pleasure that some derive from it .
just across the street , the charité museum presents a scientific examination of pain .
" time of pain " takes a historical view of human suffering and its perception , while " expression of pain " takes a look at how we communicate painful experiences to the outside world through the written word , art and music .
both houses are connected by a " path of suffering " : about 400 meters in length , this footpath itself contains 30 exhibits on human suffering .
taken as a whole , the exhibition aims to " walk the line between science and art , " as the preview states , through " combinations and confrontations of artistic works , medical , folkloristic , religious and daily objects . "
by dividing it up among the two museums , the exhibition also " accommodates the traditional expectations and viewing habits associated with both museums . "
the passion of christ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crucifixion of christ : the ultimate symbol of pain religious artifacts are an important part of the exhibition .
in what is perhaps the western world ’ s most vivid image of human suffering , the passion of jesus christ is in the foreground of these religious exhibits .
but always mixing the religious with the scientific , several exhibits also recall the experiments of frederick t. zugibes , an american doctor who in the late 1940s hung his assistants by the cross in order to measure the precise pains incurred by crucifixion .
there are also other , more obscure objects to be found , such as a 19th-century " medicinal magnetic cross of saint benedict " : at a time when people were unsure whether science or religion had the greater curative power , they simply combined the two into one device .
and in the charité museum , visitors are invited to examine tumor-ridden brains preserved in formaldehyde , skeletons with crooked vertebrae or skulls full of rotten teeth .
stomach ulcers , liver cirrhosis and deformed embryos are all part of this exploration of pain .
suited for all ages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " schmerz " explores pain through art , science and religion but the exhibition avoids the controversial and the confrontational , and examines pain in a way that is easily digestible .
hardly any of the exhibits approach contemporary topics such as torture , war , terrorism or genocide .
" schmerz " is a g-rated exhibition , suitable for all ages - a conscious decision , charité museum co-curator daniel tyradellis told spiegel online .
the hamburger bahnhof and the charité museum relied on their own berlin-based collections for this exhibition , rather than importing pieces from all around the world , as is often the case .
" schmerz " showcases artists ranging from marina abramovic , francis bacon and joseph beuys to louise bourgeois , bruce nauman and sam taylor-wood , among others .

divided into two distinct sections , " perceptions of pain " examines the way in which humans cope with the suffering of others , while " allure of pain " delves into individual ways of coping with pain - including the sexual pleasure that some derive from it .
just across the street , the charité museum presents a scientific examination of pain .
" time of pain " takes a historical view of human suffering and its perception , while " expression of pain " takes a look at how we communicate painful experiences to the outside world through the written word , art and music .
both houses are connected by a " path of suffering " : about 400 meters in length , this footpath itself contains 30 exhibits on human suffering .
taken as a whole , the exhibition aims to " walk the line between science and art , " as the preview states , through " combinations and confrontations of artistic works , medical , folkloristic , religious and daily objects . "
by dividing it up among the two museums , the exhibition also " accommodates the traditional expectations and viewing habits associated with both museums . "
the passion of christ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crucifixion of christ : the ultimate symbol of pain religious artifacts are an important part of the exhibition .
in what is perhaps the western world ’ s most vivid image of human suffering , the passion of jesus christ is in the foreground of these religious exhibits .
but always mixing the religious with the scientific , several exhibits also recall the experiments of frederick t. zugibes , an american doctor who in the late 1940s hung his assistants by the cross in order to measure the precise pains incurred by crucifixion .
there are also other , more obscure objects to be found , such as a 19th-century " medicinal magnetic cross of saint benedict " : at a time when people were unsure whether science or religion had the greater curative power , they simply combined the two into one device .
and in the charité museum , visitors are invited to examine tumor-ridden brains preserved in formaldehyde , skeletons with crooked vertebrae or skulls full of rotten teeth .
stomach ulcers , liver cirrhosis and deformed embryos are all part of this exploration of pain .
suited for all ages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " schmerz " explores pain through art , science and religion but the exhibition avoids the controversial and the confrontational , and examines pain in a way that is easily digestible .

the hamburger bahnhof and the charité museum relied on their own berlin-based collections for this exhibition , rather than importing pieces from all around the world , as is often the case .

mixed feelings about mission german officials in a foreign ministry crisis team working to release the hostages have said they have not given up hope , but are " greatly concerned . "

german interior minister wolfgang schäuble has expressed concern that the danger of terrorist attacks against germany could have risen as a result of the country 's involvement in afghanistan .

the hostage takers have twice set deadlines for germany to withdraw its 3,000 troops from afghanistan , posting videos on the internet of 61-year-old hannelore krause kadhim begging for help with her 20-year-old son sinana at her side .

germany is currently engaged in a heated debate over the creation of additional nursery schools .
while accepted in the former communist part of the country , western germans struggle with the plan , according to an expert . leonie herwartz-emden is a professor for pedagogy at the university of augsburg .
her postdoctoral research has focused on an intercultural comparison of motherhood and female concepts of self . dw-world.de : why do western germans have such a problem with nursery schools ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mothers are usually the ones who end up with more work leonie herwartz-emden : motherhood is still a loaded term in germany .
there are vastly differing views on the concept of motherhood .
on the one hand , mothers are highly revered and treated as icons .
on the other hand , motherhood is completely undervalued .
mothers accomplish so much in daily life .
they ensure employment - of their partners and possibly their own - and make sure that their children are nourished , groomed , educated and given an place in the educational system .
they eventually guarantee that the labor market is served by doing all the ground work in their family . studies show that the equal division between man and woman ends when children are born .
much of the work is then transferred to the woman .
men only participate marginally in educating and nurturing children .
this is still taken for granted and not necessarily questioned .
women , who stay at home , are no longer seen as full-fledged members of society by the public .
" i 'm only a housewife , " women and mothers often say ashamedly . but you also say that mothers are turned into icons - is there a german mother myth ? everything we think or feel about motherhood in 2007 can not be viewed independently of the burden of the third reich .
the mother myth has still negative connotations because of the heroic veneration of mothers during that time .
women were abused for the sake of national socialist ideology .
they had to serve at the home front .
a guidebook on education from that time , financed by -lrb- nazi propaganda minister joseph -rrb- göbbels , had a very large print run .
it was published - with a slightly different cover and text - until the 1970s .
it continued to propagate this heroic image of mothers .
we are still burdened by the national socialist legacy today . bildunterschrift : göbbels ' wife , magda , was hailed as a poster mother by the nazis .
she had seven children , six of whom were poisoned by her before she committed suicide in 1945 do other countries with a fascist past have a similar image of mothers today ? i do n't think so , because motherhood was not burdened with ideology everywhere else as it was in the case of germany .
what 's more , images of mothers are also rooted in different historic backgrounds and various societal contexts . how is germany 's image of mothers different from that of other countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two women in istanbul the german concept of motherhood is very polarized .
women themselves always feel this schism .
they are obliged to take complete care of their children and forget that they are individuals themselves .

germany is currently engaged in a heated debate over the creation of additional nursery schools .

there are vastly differing views on the concept of motherhood .

germany is currently engaged in a heated debate over the creation of additional nursery schools .

there are vastly differing views on the concept of motherhood .
on the one hand , mothers are highly revered and treated as icons .
on the other hand , motherhood is completely undervalued .
mothers accomplish so much in daily life .
they ensure employment - of their partners and possibly their own - and make sure that their children are nourished , groomed , educated and given an place in the educational system .
they eventually guarantee that the labor market is served by doing all the ground work in their family . studies show that the equal division between man and woman ends when children are born .
much of the work is then transferred to the woman .
men only participate marginally in educating and nurturing children .
this is still taken for granted and not necessarily questioned .
women , who stay at home , are no longer seen as full-fledged members of society by the public .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.04.2007 spain gets rich on cheap immigrant labor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of immigrants risk their lives each year to reach europe many illegal immigrants undertake perilous trips to reach europe .
but rather arriving in the land of milk and honey , for many the cold reality is working in a glasshouse in spain 's andalusia region . mustafa shivers and pulls his cap down more tightly over his face .
the 27-year-old senegalese is standing on a crossroad at the edge of the city el ejido .
it 's early in the morning , and there 's still a light fog . mustafa was n't the first to arrive at the crossroads - there are several small groups of africans silently waiting for work . " there are people here from gambia , guinea , and mali , " mustafa said . " we come here every morning . " el ejido , with a population of 75,000 and no tourist attractions , is in the middle of one of the world 's biggest vegetable growing regions and is surrounded by a sea of glasshouses filled with tomatoes , paprika , and lettuce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is one of the eu 's biggest vegetable producers with an annual production of 1.5 million tons of vegetables , there is enough work here .
yet mustafa and the others often have to wait for hours for one reason - they 're illegal . " everyone standing here is without papers , " mustafa said . long wait for illegals " sometimes we wait here for up to five hours , " he said .
" at two in the afternoon we go to get something to eat , and then we come back again at three . " the group do n't like journalists because no farmer is likely stop if a microphone is being waved about .
there are large fines for those who employ immigrants without papers .
but the africans still hope that a pick-up will pull up and load them in the back .
even if mustafa does n't find work today , he will come back tomorrow , as he has done for the past eight months . mustafa does n't plan on staying much longer in el ejido though .
he wants to go north to valencia or barcelona - or perhaps even france or germany . " i do n't have a place to live , " he said .
" i sleep in a garage on a construction site , on the street . " but people are nice to him , he said - even the police . tough living conditions the chances of mustafa ever getting a work permit are n't good .
that means it 's virtually impossible for him - like thousands of others in the same situation - to rent an apartment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting a legal permit is just a dream for many immigrants that 's why many of the illegals live in miserable conditions in abandoned houses dotted around the region . in the nearby town of nijar , in a place called casa vieja -lrb- old house -rrb- , about 50 young moroccans live in a fallen-down farmhouse .
halib has been squatting here for nearly eight months .
the 22-year-old has managed to acquire a mattress , some cardboard boxes and a couple of meters of plastic sheeting .
he might now have a roof over his head , but he does n't have the luxury of water or electricity . it takes halib an hour walk to where he works in a glasshouse . " the work is difficult , " he said .

the environmental group accuses the world bank and international loggers , including germans , of exacerbating the problem . the report , titled " carving up the congo , " claims over 15 million hectares -lrb- 37 million acres -rrb- of rain forest have been granted to international logging companies in 107 new contracts over the last five years , despite a 2002 government moratorium on such activity . " our findings expose serious lapses of governance , a massive lack of institutional capacity to control the forestry sector , widespread illegalities and social conflicts , as well as clashes with established conservation initiatives , " greenpeace says . the report accuses international logging companies of " causing social chaos and wreaking environmental havoc " in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . it details how timber worth thousands of dollars - african teak , for example , is worth some 6,000 euros per tree on european markets - is traded for cheap gifts and oft-unmet promises to local communities . the report documents several such gifts , including a motor bike for a chieftain , bags of salt and crates of beer for villagers , and pledges to build schools and hospitals . " these promises are rarely fulfilled and there are reports that intimidation tactics are used against people who try to protest , " greenpeace said , citing a lawsuit from siforco against the civil society of bumba , which complained of a " lack of respect " from the logging company and now stands trial on charges of defamation . german company siforco is one of those european firms that has been singled out for unscrupulous behaviour , along with other international logging companies , such as itb , cft , forabola , sodefor , soforma , olam , sicobois and trans-m . the biggest logging operator in the drc , siforco has roundly defended its record in congo .
but stefan van traet , greenpeace 's africa forest campaign co-ordinator , said it employs bullying tactics symptomatic of the congolese logging industry . " there is a court case from siforco against 29 persons of the civil society of bumba who complained of the lack of respect for the local communities by the logging company , " he told dw-radio .

the report says that logging in the congo - which boasts the world 's second-largest primal rain forest after the amazon - will release up to 34.4 billion tons of co2 by 2050 , or roughly the same as the united kingdom 's emissions over the past 60 years . furthermore , of the 60 million people living in the democratic republic of congo , greenpeace believes 40 million are dependent on the rain forests for food , medicine , energy , building materials and other non-timber products essential to their subsistence . the group says deforestation further threatens protected indigenous ape species , including gorillas , chimpanzees and bonobos . world bank under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under fire : world bank president paul wolfowitz greenpeace has also accused the world bank of failing to enforce the 2002 moratorium on logging in the congolese republic .

by 2006 , it had approved credits totaling more than $ 4 billion , giving the international institution considerable leverage over political and economic developments there . following a world bank investigation of tax records in 2002 , the transitional drc government cancelled 163 illegal logging contracts covering nearly half of the country 's rain forests , and imposed a moratorium on all logging activity .
but by 2006 , members of the government had signed 107 new contracts covering more than a quarter of the country 's rain forests , according to the greenpeace report . the world bank is now conducting a legal review of titles to verify the validity of these new contracts .
but greenpeace fears that " the legal review could become an exercise in laundering illegal contracts . " the world bank faces a difficult balancing act between environmental preservation and social justice on the one hand , and economic development on the other .

the environmental group accuses the world bank and international loggers , including germans , of exacerbating the problem . the report , titled " carving up the congo , " claims over 15 million hectares -lrb- 37 million acres -rrb- of rain forest have been granted to international logging companies in 107 new contracts over the last five years , despite a 2002 government moratorium on such activity . " our findings expose serious lapses of governance , a massive lack of institutional capacity to control the forestry sector , widespread illegalities and social conflicts , as well as clashes with established conservation initiatives , " greenpeace says . the report accuses international logging companies of " causing social chaos and wreaking environmental havoc " in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . it details how timber worth thousands of dollars - african teak , for example , is worth some 6,000 euros per tree on european markets - is traded for cheap gifts and oft-unmet promises to local communities . the report documents several such gifts , including a motor bike for a chieftain , bags of salt and crates of beer for villagers , and pledges to build schools and hospitals . " these promises are rarely fulfilled and there are reports that intimidation tactics are used against people who try to protest , " greenpeace said , citing a lawsuit from siforco against the civil society of bumba , which complained of a " lack of respect " from the logging company and now stands trial on charges of defamation . german company siforco is one of those european firms that has been singled out for unscrupulous behaviour , along with other international logging companies , such as itb , cft , forabola , sodefor , soforma , olam , sicobois and trans-m . the biggest logging operator in the drc , siforco has roundly defended its record in congo .
but stefan van traet , greenpeace 's africa forest campaign co-ordinator , said it employs bullying tactics symptomatic of the congolese logging industry . " there is a court case from siforco against 29 persons of the civil society of bumba who complained of the lack of respect for the local communities by the logging company , " he told dw-radio .

by 2006 , it had approved credits totaling more than $ 4 billion , giving the international institution considerable leverage over political and economic developments there . following a world bank investigation of tax records in 2002 , the transitional drc government cancelled 163 illegal logging contracts covering nearly half of the country 's rain forests , and imposed a moratorium on all logging activity .
but by 2006 , members of the government had signed 107 new contracts covering more than a quarter of the country 's rain forests , according to the greenpeace report . the world bank is now conducting a legal review of titles to verify the validity of these new contracts .
but greenpeace fears that " the legal review could become an exercise in laundering illegal contracts . " the world bank faces a difficult balancing act between environmental preservation and social justice on the one hand , and economic development on the other .

but rather arriving in the land of milk and honey , for many the cold reality is working in a glasshouse in spain 's andalusia region . mustafa shivers and pulls his cap down more tightly over his face .
the 27-year-old senegalese is standing on a crossroad at the edge of the city el ejido .
it 's early in the morning , and there 's still a light fog . mustafa was n't the first to arrive at the crossroads - there are several small groups of africans silently waiting for work . " there are people here from gambia , guinea , and mali , " mustafa said . " we come here every morning . " el ejido , with a population of 75,000 and no tourist attractions , is in the middle of one of the world 's biggest vegetable growing regions and is surrounded by a sea of glasshouses filled with tomatoes , paprika , and lettuce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is one of the eu 's biggest vegetable producers with an annual production of 1.5 million tons of vegetables , there is enough work here .
yet mustafa and the others often have to wait for hours for one reason - they 're illegal . " everyone standing here is without papers , " mustafa said . long wait for illegals " sometimes we wait here for up to five hours , " he said .
" at two in the afternoon we go to get something to eat , and then we come back again at three . " the group do n't like journalists because no farmer is likely stop if a microphone is being waved about .
there are large fines for those who employ immigrants without papers .
but the africans still hope that a pick-up will pull up and load them in the back .
even if mustafa does n't find work today , he will come back tomorrow , as he has done for the past eight months . mustafa does n't plan on staying much longer in el ejido though .
he wants to go north to valencia or barcelona - or perhaps even france or germany . " i do n't have a place to live , " he said .
" i sleep in a garage on a construction site , on the street . " but people are nice to him , he said - even the police . tough living conditions the chances of mustafa ever getting a work permit are n't good .
that means it 's virtually impossible for him - like thousands of others in the same situation - to rent an apartment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting a legal permit is just a dream for many immigrants that 's why many of the illegals live in miserable conditions in abandoned houses dotted around the region . in the nearby town of nijar , in a place called casa vieja -lrb- old house -rrb- , about 50 young moroccans live in a fallen-down farmhouse .
halib has been squatting here for nearly eight months .
the 22-year-old has managed to acquire a mattress , some cardboard boxes and a couple of meters of plastic sheeting .
he might now have a roof over his head , but he does n't have the luxury of water or electricity . it takes halib an hour walk to where he works in a glasshouse . " the work is difficult , " he said .
" it 's very hot , and for eight hours , they pay me 31 euros -lrb- $ 42 -rrb- .
life is bad . " being illegal leaves many of the workers vulnerable to exploitation .
abdelkader cacha , a right 's campaigns at the agricultural workers union , soc , said there is no protection for workers . " they do n't have masks or any protective clothing , " he said .

germany is currently engaged in a heated debate over the creation of additional nursery schools .
while accepted in the former communist part of the country , western germans struggle with the plan , according to an expert . leonie herwartz-emden is a professor for pedagogy at the university of augsburg .
her postdoctoral research has focused on an intercultural comparison of motherhood and female concepts of self . dw-world.de : why do western germans have such a problem with nursery schools ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mothers are usually the ones who end up with more work leonie herwartz-emden : motherhood is still a loaded term in germany .
there are vastly differing views on the concept of motherhood .
on the one hand , mothers are highly revered and treated as icons .
on the other hand , motherhood is completely undervalued .
mothers accomplish so much in daily life .
they ensure employment - of their partners and possibly their own - and make sure that their children are nourished , groomed , educated and given an place in the educational system .
they eventually guarantee that the labor market is served by doing all the ground work in their family . studies show that the equal division between man and woman ends when children are born .
much of the work is then transferred to the woman .
men only participate marginally in educating and nurturing children .
this is still taken for granted and not necessarily questioned .
women , who stay at home , are no longer seen as full-fledged members of society by the public .
" i 'm only a housewife , " women and mothers often say ashamedly . but you also say that mothers are turned into icons - is there a german mother myth ? everything we think or feel about motherhood in 2007 can not be viewed independently of the burden of the third reich .
the mother myth has still negative connotations because of the heroic veneration of mothers during that time .
women were abused for the sake of national socialist ideology .
they had to serve at the home front .
a guidebook on education from that time , financed by -lrb- nazi propaganda minister joseph -rrb- göbbels , had a very large print run .
it was published - with a slightly different cover and text - until the 1970s .
it continued to propagate this heroic image of mothers .
we are still burdened by the national socialist legacy today . bildunterschrift : göbbels ' wife , magda , was hailed as a poster mother by the nazis .
she had seven children , six of whom were poisoned by her before she committed suicide in 1945 do other countries with a fascist past have a similar image of mothers today ? i do n't think so , because motherhood was not burdened with ideology everywhere else as it was in the case of germany .
what 's more , images of mothers are also rooted in different historic backgrounds and various societal contexts . how is germany 's image of mothers different from that of other countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two women in istanbul the german concept of motherhood is very polarized .
women themselves always feel this schism .
they are obliged to take complete care of their children and forget that they are individuals themselves .
when they take care of themselves , they feel bad , because they might neglect the children .
women in turkey and the former soviet union do n't feel such an internal polarization .
the women in the former soviet union have been involved in the labor market for decades . the women in turkey have experienced a different gender relationship .
it 's taken for granted there that women have their own , female space - as far as their biographies and society as a whole is concerned .
they are separated from men , but still valued highly by society .
that way , their femininity and motherhood are untouched and anchored in society . you have two children yourself - how did you solve the dilemma of family vs. career ? by putting in a lot of personal effort .
when i gave birth to my first son , i had a husband who became a houseman for a while .
i earned the money .
we switched roles , so to speak .
we lived in berlin , where our surroundings were very supportive ideologically speaking .
we helped set up an alternative kindergarten .
everything was very experimental .
with the second child , we went the classic way with a nanny and kindergarten later on .
it was a typical morning kindergarten , which closed at noon .
the current discussion about nursery schools always reminds me of that time . what must change for german mothers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen has seven children germany 's educational system and the kindergarten system still rely strongly on the involvement of mothers .
mothers are seen as auxiliary educators .
people always gave you nasty looks when you turned up at a summer party with a cake from the store .
later on , mothers worked for free by doing homework with their children .
mothers are completely taken in but their work is simultaneously devalued because it is n't visible .
that has to change .
until now , everything mothers do is privatized and that can only change by making it public .
the discussion that 's been started by german family minister ursula von der leyen makes this problem visible for the public . pia volk interviewed leonie herwartz-emden send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parents to get more daycare options germany hopes to catch up with other european countries with progressive childcare policies by providing more nursery school places in a bid to encourage mothers to work and reverse a declining birthrate .

he proposed 2014 or 2015 as a possible date for membership . but if the eu " does n't want us , it should say so clearly now , " he said .
" if we are not wanted , the two sides need not continue wasting their time in talks . " merkel against membership merkel is personally and politically , through her christian democratic union party , against turkish membership of the eu .
instead she would prefer to see the secular islamic nation become a " privileged partner " of the 27-member bloc . public opinion in germany , the eu 's most populous country which has 2.5 million turkish residents , is generally against turkish membership . however , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , supports full membership . " if we really trust turkey , that will improve security and stability in europe , " he told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung regional newspaper . turks against erdogan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-erdogan demonstrators in front of the atatürk mausoleum on saturday chanting secularist slogans and waving turkish flags , more than 300,000 people from all over turkey meanwhile rallied in the turkish capital ankara on saturday to discourage erdogan , a conservative with an islamist political past , from running for the presidency . the demonstrators marched to the mausoleum of mustafa kemal ataturk , the founder of modern secular turkey in 1923 , transforming the normally hushed venue into an unprecedented demonstration ground . " turkey is secular , it will remain secular , " " the presidency 's roads are closed to sharia -lrb- islamic law -rrb- , " " an imam can not become a president , " they chanted , reflecting concerns that erdogan and his justice and devlopment party -lrb- akp -rrb- are not truly committed to the mainly muslim nation 's secular system . erdogan has yet to say whether or not he will run for the presidency when the akp-dominated parliament elects a successor to the staunchly secularist ahmet necdet sezer next month . the akp has pledged commitment to secularism and carried out a series of democracy reforms to boost turkey 's bid to join the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 14.04.2007 berlin exhibition explores art and science of pain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pain comes in many forms at berlin 's medical historical museum a new exhibition in berlin aims to explore the many facets of human pain .
the challenge lies in demonstrating a subject that is neither tangible nor visible .
curators in berlin designed “ pain ” as a twofold experience . at the entrance to the hanburger bahnhof , a former train station that houses berlin ’ s national gallery of contemporary art , the first exhibit that catches the eye is a subtle hint of things to come .
enclosed in a showcase is a simple piece of wood , about one meter in length and tightly wrapped in a thick leather hide .
up until the 19th century , it was a staple piece of medical equipment : in the absence of effective anesthetics , countless people dug their teeth into this contraption to avoid biting their own tongue off during painful surgical procedures .
more than a relic of medical history , this inanimate object - full of bite marks - is capable of invoking harrowing images in the mind ’ s eye : images of a situation so painful , you can almost feel it .
indeed , that has been the central challenge for this new exhibition called " schmerz " -lrb- " pain " -rrb- : how to convey the sensation of pain , without actually inflicting it ?
bildunterschrift : berlin 's museum for contemporary art a twofold approach for hamburger bahnhof curator eugen blume , the solution lies in the mingling of art and science .
" the juxtaposition of scientific and artistic works in this joint exhibition is meant to blur the lines between these two areas , " he said .
this idea finds its most obvious expression in the fact that " schmerz " is a joint exhibition involving the hamburger bahnhof museum of contemporary art and the medical history museum of berlin 's charité teaching hospital .
the hamburger bahnhof explores the subjective experience of physical and psychological suffering from an artistic point of view .
divided into two distinct sections , " perceptions of pain " examines the way in which humans cope with the suffering of others , while " allure of pain " delves into individual ways of coping with pain - including the sexual pleasure that some derive from it .
just across the street , the charité museum presents a scientific examination of pain .
" time of pain " takes a historical view of human suffering and its perception , while " expression of pain " takes a look at how we communicate painful experiences to the outside world through the written word , art and music .
both houses are connected by a " path of suffering " : about 400 meters in length , this footpath itself contains 30 exhibits on human suffering .
taken as a whole , the exhibition aims to " walk the line between science and art , " as the preview states , through " combinations and confrontations of artistic works , medical , folkloristic , religious and daily objects . "
by dividing it up among the two museums , the exhibition also " accommodates the traditional expectations and viewing habits associated with both museums . "
the passion of christ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crucifixion of christ : the ultimate symbol of pain religious artifacts are an important part of the exhibition .
in what is perhaps the western world ’ s most vivid image of human suffering , the passion of jesus christ is in the foreground of these religious exhibits .
but always mixing the religious with the scientific , several exhibits also recall the experiments of frederick t. zugibes , an american doctor who in the late 1940s hung his assistants by the cross in order to measure the precise pains incurred by crucifixion .
there are also other , more obscure objects to be found , such as a 19th-century " medicinal magnetic cross of saint benedict " : at a time when people were unsure whether science or religion had the greater curative power , they simply combined the two into one device .
and in the charité museum , visitors are invited to examine tumor-ridden brains preserved in formaldehyde , skeletons with crooked vertebrae or skulls full of rotten teeth .
stomach ulcers , liver cirrhosis and deformed embryos are all part of this exploration of pain .
suited for all ages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " schmerz " explores pain through art , science and religion but the exhibition avoids the controversial and the confrontational , and examines pain in a way that is easily digestible .
hardly any of the exhibits approach contemporary topics such as torture , war , terrorism or genocide .
" schmerz " is a g-rated exhibition , suitable for all ages - a conscious decision , charité museum co-curator daniel tyradellis told spiegel online .
the hamburger bahnhof and the charité museum relied on their own berlin-based collections for this exhibition , rather than importing pieces from all around the world , as is often the case .
" schmerz " showcases artists ranging from marina abramovic , francis bacon and joseph beuys to louise bourgeois , bruce nauman and sam taylor-wood , among others .
" schmerz " runs from april 5 through aug .
5 in the hamburger bahnhof museum of contemporary art and the charité medical historical museum .

" el ejido , with a population of 75,000 and no tourist attractions , is in the middle of one of the world 's biggest vegetable growing regions and is surrounded by a sea of glasshouses filled with tomatoes , paprika , and lettuce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is one of the eu 's biggest vegetable producers with an annual production of 1.5 million tons of vegetables , there is enough work here .
yet mustafa and the others often have to wait for hours for one reason - they 're illegal . " everyone standing here is without papers , " mustafa said . long wait for illegals " sometimes we wait here for up to five hours , " he said .
" at two in the afternoon we go to get something to eat , and then we come back again at three . " the group do n't like journalists because no farmer is likely stop if a microphone is being waved about .
there are large fines for those who employ immigrants without papers .
but the africans still hope that a pick-up will pull up and load them in the back .
even if mustafa does n't find work today , he will come back tomorrow , as he has done for the past eight months . mustafa does n't plan on staying much longer in el ejido though .
he wants to go north to valencia or barcelona - or perhaps even france or germany . " i do n't have a place to live , " he said .
" i sleep in a garage on a construction site , on the street . " but people are nice to him , he said - even the police . tough living conditions the chances of mustafa ever getting a work permit are n't good .
that means it 's virtually impossible for him - like thousands of others in the same situation - to rent an apartment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting a legal permit is just a dream for many immigrants that 's why many of the illegals live in miserable conditions in abandoned houses dotted around the region . in the nearby town of nijar , in a place called casa vieja -lrb- old house -rrb- , about 50 young moroccans live in a fallen-down farmhouse .
halib has been squatting here for nearly eight months .
the 22-year-old has managed to acquire a mattress , some cardboard boxes and a couple of meters of plastic sheeting .
he might now have a roof over his head , but he does n't have the luxury of water or electricity . it takes halib an hour walk to where he works in a glasshouse . " the work is difficult , " he said .
" it 's very hot , and for eight hours , they pay me 31 euros -lrb- $ 42 -rrb- .
life is bad . " being illegal leaves many of the workers vulnerable to exploitation .
abdelkader cacha , a right 's campaigns at the agricultural workers union , soc , said there is no protection for workers . " they do n't have masks or any protective clothing , " he said .
" and those who ask for them , get kicked out .

the challenge lies in demonstrating a subject that is neither tangible nor visible .
curators in berlin designed “ pain ” as a twofold experience . at the entrance to the hanburger bahnhof , a former train station that houses berlin ’ s national gallery of contemporary art , the first exhibit that catches the eye is a subtle hint of things to come .
enclosed in a showcase is a simple piece of wood , about one meter in length and tightly wrapped in a thick leather hide .
up until the 19th century , it was a staple piece of medical equipment : in the absence of effective anesthetics , countless people dug their teeth into this contraption to avoid biting their own tongue off during painful surgical procedures .
more than a relic of medical history , this inanimate object - full of bite marks - is capable of invoking harrowing images in the mind ’ s eye : images of a situation so painful , you can almost feel it .
indeed , that has been the central challenge for this new exhibition called " schmerz " -lrb- " pain " -rrb- : how to convey the sensation of pain , without actually inflicting it ?
bildunterschrift : berlin 's museum for contemporary art a twofold approach for hamburger bahnhof curator eugen blume , the solution lies in the mingling of art and science .
" the juxtaposition of scientific and artistic works in this joint exhibition is meant to blur the lines between these two areas , " he said .
this idea finds its most obvious expression in the fact that " schmerz " is a joint exhibition involving the hamburger bahnhof museum of contemporary art and the medical history museum of berlin 's charité teaching hospital .
the hamburger bahnhof explores the subjective experience of physical and psychological suffering from an artistic point of view .
divided into two distinct sections , " perceptions of pain " examines the way in which humans cope with the suffering of others , while " allure of pain " delves into individual ways of coping with pain - including the sexual pleasure that some derive from it .
just across the street , the charité museum presents a scientific examination of pain .
" time of pain " takes a historical view of human suffering and its perception , while " expression of pain " takes a look at how we communicate painful experiences to the outside world through the written word , art and music .
both houses are connected by a " path of suffering " : about 400 meters in length , this footpath itself contains 30 exhibits on human suffering .
taken as a whole , the exhibition aims to " walk the line between science and art , " as the preview states , through " combinations and confrontations of artistic works , medical , folkloristic , religious and daily objects . "
by dividing it up among the two museums , the exhibition also " accommodates the traditional expectations and viewing habits associated with both museums . "
the passion of christ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crucifixion of christ : the ultimate symbol of pain religious artifacts are an important part of the exhibition .
in what is perhaps the western world ’ s most vivid image of human suffering , the passion of jesus christ is in the foreground of these religious exhibits .
but always mixing the religious with the scientific , several exhibits also recall the experiments of frederick t. zugibes , an american doctor who in the late 1940s hung his assistants by the cross in order to measure the precise pains incurred by crucifixion .
there are also other , more obscure objects to be found , such as a 19th-century " medicinal magnetic cross of saint benedict " : at a time when people were unsure whether science or religion had the greater curative power , they simply combined the two into one device .
and in the charité museum , visitors are invited to examine tumor-ridden brains preserved in formaldehyde , skeletons with crooked vertebrae or skulls full of rotten teeth .
stomach ulcers , liver cirrhosis and deformed embryos are all part of this exploration of pain .
suited for all ages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " schmerz " explores pain through art , science and religion but the exhibition avoids the controversial and the confrontational , and examines pain in a way that is easily digestible .
hardly any of the exhibits approach contemporary topics such as torture , war , terrorism or genocide .
" schmerz " is a g-rated exhibition , suitable for all ages - a conscious decision , charité museum co-curator daniel tyradellis told spiegel online .
the hamburger bahnhof and the charité museum relied on their own berlin-based collections for this exhibition , rather than importing pieces from all around the world , as is often the case .
" schmerz " showcases artists ranging from marina abramovic , francis bacon and joseph beuys to louise bourgeois , bruce nauman and sam taylor-wood , among others .

german interior minister wolfgang schäuble has expressed concern that the danger of terrorist attacks against germany could have risen as a result of the country 's involvement in afghanistan .

but rather arriving in the land of milk and honey , for many the cold reality is working in a glasshouse in spain 's andalusia region . mustafa shivers and pulls his cap down more tightly over his face .
the 27-year-old senegalese is standing on a crossroad at the edge of the city el ejido .

" urgent debate is required on the matter .
the payments must be cancelled if the managers fail . "
in addition , the general principle of high salaries for executives was " untenable " for the union , friedrich said .
" employees do n't understand why their wages are continually cut , while managers ' pay continuallly rise , ostensibly in the name of remaining competitive at a global level , " the spokesman said .

eads said the payoff was provided for in his contract .
forgeard stood down last july in the face of troubles at airbus and controversy over his decision to exercise share options just months before news of the problems was announced .
airbus has since embarked on a massive restructuring programme that entails the loss of 10,000 jobs in europe , including 4,300 in france and 3,700 in germany .
the severance pay packet has sparked fierce protest in france , with presidential election candidates calling it a scandal .

royal called the payments a " scandal " and a " provocation " as airbus battles with major losses caused by delays to its new a380 super-jumbo jet .
" taking this information into account , i call on airbus leaders to withdraw the whole plan so we can start afresh to see which job cuts are justified by the industrial strategy , " royal said in a french television interview .
the communist party candidate in the election , marie-george buffet , asked : " how can a company give such a bonus to a boss who everyone agrees was a disastrous manager . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.04.2007 berlin exhibition explores art and science of pain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pain comes in many forms at berlin 's medical historical museum a new exhibition in berlin aims to explore the many facets of human pain .
the challenge lies in demonstrating a subject that is neither tangible nor visible .
curators in berlin designed “ pain ” as a twofold experience . at the entrance to the hanburger bahnhof , a former train station that houses berlin ’ s national gallery of contemporary art , the first exhibit that catches the eye is a subtle hint of things to come .
enclosed in a showcase is a simple piece of wood , about one meter in length and tightly wrapped in a thick leather hide .
up until the 19th century , it was a staple piece of medical equipment : in the absence of effective anesthetics , countless people dug their teeth into this contraption to avoid biting their own tongue off during painful surgical procedures .
more than a relic of medical history , this inanimate object - full of bite marks - is capable of invoking harrowing images in the mind ’ s eye : images of a situation so painful , you can almost feel it .
indeed , that has been the central challenge for this new exhibition called " schmerz " -lrb- " pain " -rrb- : how to convey the sensation of pain , without actually inflicting it ?
bildunterschrift : berlin 's museum for contemporary art a twofold approach for hamburger bahnhof curator eugen blume , the solution lies in the mingling of art and science .
" the juxtaposition of scientific and artistic works in this joint exhibition is meant to blur the lines between these two areas , " he said .
this idea finds its most obvious expression in the fact that " schmerz " is a joint exhibition involving the hamburger bahnhof museum of contemporary art and the medical history museum of berlin 's charité teaching hospital .
the hamburger bahnhof explores the subjective experience of physical and psychological suffering from an artistic point of view .
divided into two distinct sections , " perceptions of pain " examines the way in which humans cope with the suffering of others , while " allure of pain " delves into individual ways of coping with pain - including the sexual pleasure that some derive from it .
just across the street , the charité museum presents a scientific examination of pain .
" time of pain " takes a historical view of human suffering and its perception , while " expression of pain " takes a look at how we communicate painful experiences to the outside world through the written word , art and music .
both houses are connected by a " path of suffering " : about 400 meters in length , this footpath itself contains 30 exhibits on human suffering .
taken as a whole , the exhibition aims to " walk the line between science and art , " as the preview states , through " combinations and confrontations of artistic works , medical , folkloristic , religious and daily objects . "
by dividing it up among the two museums , the exhibition also " accommodates the traditional expectations and viewing habits associated with both museums . "
the passion of christ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crucifixion of christ : the ultimate symbol of pain religious artifacts are an important part of the exhibition .
in what is perhaps the western world ’ s most vivid image of human suffering , the passion of jesus christ is in the foreground of these religious exhibits .
but always mixing the religious with the scientific , several exhibits also recall the experiments of frederick t. zugibes , an american doctor who in the late 1940s hung his assistants by the cross in order to measure the precise pains incurred by crucifixion .
there are also other , more obscure objects to be found , such as a 19th-century " medicinal magnetic cross of saint benedict " : at a time when people were unsure whether science or religion had the greater curative power , they simply combined the two into one device .
and in the charité museum , visitors are invited to examine tumor-ridden brains preserved in formaldehyde , skeletons with crooked vertebrae or skulls full of rotten teeth .
stomach ulcers , liver cirrhosis and deformed embryos are all part of this exploration of pain .
suited for all ages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " schmerz " explores pain through art , science and religion but the exhibition avoids the controversial and the confrontational , and examines pain in a way that is easily digestible .
hardly any of the exhibits approach contemporary topics such as torture , war , terrorism or genocide .

the environmental group accuses the world bank and international loggers , including germans , of exacerbating the problem . the report , titled " carving up the congo , " claims over 15 million hectares -lrb- 37 million acres -rrb- of rain forest have been granted to international logging companies in 107 new contracts over the last five years , despite a 2002 government moratorium on such activity . " our findings expose serious lapses of governance , a massive lack of institutional capacity to control the forestry sector , widespread illegalities and social conflicts , as well as clashes with established conservation initiatives , " greenpeace says . the report accuses international logging companies of " causing social chaos and wreaking environmental havoc " in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . it details how timber worth thousands of dollars - african teak , for example , is worth some 6,000 euros per tree on european markets - is traded for cheap gifts and oft-unmet promises to local communities . the report documents several such gifts , including a motor bike for a chieftain , bags of salt and crates of beer for villagers , and pledges to build schools and hospitals . " these promises are rarely fulfilled and there are reports that intimidation tactics are used against people who try to protest , " greenpeace said , citing a lawsuit from siforco against the civil society of bumba , which complained of a " lack of respect " from the logging company and now stands trial on charges of defamation . german company siforco is one of those european firms that has been singled out for unscrupulous behaviour , along with other international logging companies , such as itb , cft , forabola , sodefor , soforma , olam , sicobois and trans-m . the biggest logging operator in the drc , siforco has roundly defended its record in congo .
but stefan van traet , greenpeace 's africa forest campaign co-ordinator , said it employs bullying tactics symptomatic of the congolese logging industry . " there is a court case from siforco against 29 persons of the civil society of bumba who complained of the lack of respect for the local communities by the logging company , " he told dw-radio .
" and the logging company said it 's defamation , because they signed a petition that was handed out to the local authorities . so you can see there is a kind of intimidation when local groups question the behavior of logging companies . " consequences for the congo and beyond bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logging threatens gorillas like this one , says greenpeace greenpeace estimates that tropical deforestation alone contributes up to 25 percent of the world 's human-induced carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions .
the report says that logging in the congo - which boasts the world 's second-largest primal rain forest after the amazon - will release up to 34.4 billion tons of co2 by 2050 , or roughly the same as the united kingdom 's emissions over the past 60 years . furthermore , of the 60 million people living in the democratic republic of congo , greenpeace believes 40 million are dependent on the rain forests for food , medicine , energy , building materials and other non-timber products essential to their subsistence . the group says deforestation further threatens protected indigenous ape species , including gorillas , chimpanzees and bonobos . world bank under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under fire : world bank president paul wolfowitz greenpeace has also accused the world bank of failing to enforce the 2002 moratorium on logging in the congolese republic .
" in a context of corruption and poor governance in the drc , the world bank 's attempts to reform the forestry sector are currently failing to control the expansion of logging , " wednesday 's report found . after a decade of war in the congo , the world bank resumed lending to the drc in 2001 .
by 2006 , it had approved credits totaling more than $ 4 billion , giving the international institution considerable leverage over political and economic developments there . following a world bank investigation of tax records in 2002 , the transitional drc government cancelled 163 illegal logging contracts covering nearly half of the country 's rain forests , and imposed a moratorium on all logging activity .
but by 2006 , members of the government had signed 107 new contracts covering more than a quarter of the country 's rain forests , according to the greenpeace report . the world bank is now conducting a legal review of titles to verify the validity of these new contracts .
but greenpeace fears that " the legal review could become an exercise in laundering illegal contracts . " the world bank faces a difficult balancing act between environmental preservation and social justice on the one hand , and economic development on the other .
greenpeace claims the world bank has ignored the " legal vacuum " in the congolese forestry industry in order to promote development . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to double aid to dr congo after democratic elections the eu has been the main donor in funding the november elections in dr congo , and now plans to double reconstruction aid to 400 million euros in order to secure democracy in the aftermath of civil war .

eads said the payoff was provided for in his contract .
forgeard stood down last july in the face of troubles at airbus and controversy over his decision to exercise share options just months before news of the problems was announced .
airbus has since embarked on a massive restructuring programme that entails the loss of 10,000 jobs in europe , including 4,300 in france and 3,700 in germany .
the severance pay packet has sparked fierce protest in france , with presidential election candidates calling it a scandal .

royal called the payments a " scandal " and a " provocation " as airbus battles with major losses caused by delays to its new a380 super-jumbo jet .
" taking this information into account , i call on airbus leaders to withdraw the whole plan so we can start afresh to see which job cuts are justified by the industrial strategy , " royal said in a french television interview .
the communist party candidate in the election , marie-george buffet , asked : " how can a company give such a bonus to a boss who everyone agrees was a disastrous manager . "
the president of the french lower house of parliament patrick ollier expressed " indignation " at the payoff . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mass strikes across europe hit airbus factories tens of thousands of striking airbus workers rallied across europe friday to protest management plans to cut 10,000 jobs under a sweeping restructuring plan at the struggling aircraft manufacturer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 14.04.2007 greenpeace : germans involved in illegal logging in dr congo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cogo rainforest is being decimated by illegal logging , says greenpeace greenpeace has called for urgent action to prevent illegal logging in dr congo .
the environmental group accuses the world bank and international loggers , including germans , of exacerbating the problem . the report , titled " carving up the congo , " claims over 15 million hectares -lrb- 37 million acres -rrb- of rain forest have been granted to international logging companies in 107 new contracts over the last five years , despite a 2002 government moratorium on such activity . " our findings expose serious lapses of governance , a massive lack of institutional capacity to control the forestry sector , widespread illegalities and social conflicts , as well as clashes with established conservation initiatives , " greenpeace says . the report accuses international logging companies of " causing social chaos and wreaking environmental havoc " in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . it details how timber worth thousands of dollars - african teak , for example , is worth some 6,000 euros per tree on european markets - is traded for cheap gifts and oft-unmet promises to local communities . the report documents several such gifts , including a motor bike for a chieftain , bags of salt and crates of beer for villagers , and pledges to build schools and hospitals . " these promises are rarely fulfilled and there are reports that intimidation tactics are used against people who try to protest , " greenpeace said , citing a lawsuit from siforco against the civil society of bumba , which complained of a " lack of respect " from the logging company and now stands trial on charges of defamation . german company siforco is one of those european firms that has been singled out for unscrupulous behaviour , along with other international logging companies , such as itb , cft , forabola , sodefor , soforma , olam , sicobois and trans-m . the biggest logging operator in the drc , siforco has roundly defended its record in congo .
but stefan van traet , greenpeace 's africa forest campaign co-ordinator , said it employs bullying tactics symptomatic of the congolese logging industry . " there is a court case from siforco against 29 persons of the civil society of bumba who complained of the lack of respect for the local communities by the logging company , " he told dw-radio .
" and the logging company said it 's defamation , because they signed a petition that was handed out to the local authorities . so you can see there is a kind of intimidation when local groups question the behavior of logging companies . " consequences for the congo and beyond bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logging threatens gorillas like this one , says greenpeace greenpeace estimates that tropical deforestation alone contributes up to 25 percent of the world 's human-induced carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions .
the report says that logging in the congo - which boasts the world 's second-largest primal rain forest after the amazon - will release up to 34.4 billion tons of co2 by 2050 , or roughly the same as the united kingdom 's emissions over the past 60 years . furthermore , of the 60 million people living in the democratic republic of congo , greenpeace believes 40 million are dependent on the rain forests for food , medicine , energy , building materials and other non-timber products essential to their subsistence . the group says deforestation further threatens protected indigenous ape species , including gorillas , chimpanzees and bonobos . world bank under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under fire : world bank president paul wolfowitz greenpeace has also accused the world bank of failing to enforce the 2002 moratorium on logging in the congolese republic .
" in a context of corruption and poor governance in the drc , the world bank 's attempts to reform the forestry sector are currently failing to control the expansion of logging , " wednesday 's report found . after a decade of war in the congo , the world bank resumed lending to the drc in 2001 .
by 2006 , it had approved credits totaling more than $ 4 billion , giving the international institution considerable leverage over political and economic developments there . following a world bank investigation of tax records in 2002 , the transitional drc government cancelled 163 illegal logging contracts covering nearly half of the country 's rain forests , and imposed a moratorium on all logging activity .
but by 2006 , members of the government had signed 107 new contracts covering more than a quarter of the country 's rain forests , according to the greenpeace report . the world bank is now conducting a legal review of titles to verify the validity of these new contracts .
but greenpeace fears that " the legal review could become an exercise in laundering illegal contracts . " the world bank faces a difficult balancing act between environmental preservation and social justice on the one hand , and economic development on the other .
greenpeace claims the world bank has ignored the " legal vacuum " in the congolese forestry industry in order to promote development . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to double aid to dr congo after democratic elections the eu has been the main donor in funding the november elections in dr congo , and now plans to double reconstruction aid to 400 million euros in order to secure democracy in the aftermath of civil war .

the 27-year-old senegalese is standing on a crossroad at the edge of the city el ejido .
it 's early in the morning , and there 's still a light fog . mustafa was n't the first to arrive at the crossroads - there are several small groups of africans silently waiting for work . " there are people here from gambia , guinea , and mali , " mustafa said . " we come here every morning . " el ejido , with a population of 75,000 and no tourist attractions , is in the middle of one of the world 's biggest vegetable growing regions and is surrounded by a sea of glasshouses filled with tomatoes , paprika , and lettuce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is one of the eu 's biggest vegetable producers with an annual production of 1.5 million tons of vegetables , there is enough work here .
yet mustafa and the others often have to wait for hours for one reason - they 're illegal . " everyone standing here is without papers , " mustafa said . long wait for illegals " sometimes we wait here for up to five hours , " he said .
" at two in the afternoon we go to get something to eat , and then we come back again at three . " the group do n't like journalists because no farmer is likely stop if a microphone is being waved about .
there are large fines for those who employ immigrants without papers .
but the africans still hope that a pick-up will pull up and load them in the back .
even if mustafa does n't find work today , he will come back tomorrow , as he has done for the past eight months . mustafa does n't plan on staying much longer in el ejido though .
he wants to go north to valencia or barcelona - or perhaps even france or germany . " i do n't have a place to live , " he said .
" i sleep in a garage on a construction site , on the street . " but people are nice to him , he said - even the police . tough living conditions the chances of mustafa ever getting a work permit are n't good .
that means it 's virtually impossible for him - like thousands of others in the same situation - to rent an apartment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting a legal permit is just a dream for many immigrants that 's why many of the illegals live in miserable conditions in abandoned houses dotted around the region . in the nearby town of nijar , in a place called casa vieja -lrb- old house -rrb- , about 50 young moroccans live in a fallen-down farmhouse .
halib has been squatting here for nearly eight months .
the 22-year-old has managed to acquire a mattress , some cardboard boxes and a couple of meters of plastic sheeting .
he might now have a roof over his head , but he does n't have the luxury of water or electricity . it takes halib an hour walk to where he works in a glasshouse . " the work is difficult , " he said .
" it 's very hot , and for eight hours , they pay me 31 euros -lrb- $ 42 -rrb- .
life is bad . " being illegal leaves many of the workers vulnerable to exploitation .
abdelkader cacha , a right 's campaigns at the agricultural workers union , soc , said there is no protection for workers . " they do n't have masks or any protective clothing , " he said .

the environmental group accuses the world bank and international loggers , including germans , of exacerbating the problem . the report , titled " carving up the congo , " claims over 15 million hectares -lrb- 37 million acres -rrb- of rain forest have been granted to international logging companies in 107 new contracts over the last five years , despite a 2002 government moratorium on such activity . " our findings expose serious lapses of governance , a massive lack of institutional capacity to control the forestry sector , widespread illegalities and social conflicts , as well as clashes with established conservation initiatives , " greenpeace says . the report accuses international logging companies of " causing social chaos and wreaking environmental havoc " in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . it details how timber worth thousands of dollars - african teak , for example , is worth some 6,000 euros per tree on european markets - is traded for cheap gifts and oft-unmet promises to local communities . the report documents several such gifts , including a motor bike for a chieftain , bags of salt and crates of beer for villagers , and pledges to build schools and hospitals . " these promises are rarely fulfilled and there are reports that intimidation tactics are used against people who try to protest , " greenpeace said , citing a lawsuit from siforco against the civil society of bumba , which complained of a " lack of respect " from the logging company and now stands trial on charges of defamation . german company siforco is one of those european firms that has been singled out for unscrupulous behaviour , along with other international logging companies , such as itb , cft , forabola , sodefor , soforma , olam , sicobois and trans-m . the biggest logging operator in the drc , siforco has roundly defended its record in congo .
but stefan van traet , greenpeace 's africa forest campaign co-ordinator , said it employs bullying tactics symptomatic of the congolese logging industry . " there is a court case from siforco against 29 persons of the civil society of bumba who complained of the lack of respect for the local communities by the logging company , " he told dw-radio .
" and the logging company said it 's defamation , because they signed a petition that was handed out to the local authorities . so you can see there is a kind of intimidation when local groups question the behavior of logging companies . " consequences for the congo and beyond bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logging threatens gorillas like this one , says greenpeace greenpeace estimates that tropical deforestation alone contributes up to 25 percent of the world 's human-induced carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions .
the report says that logging in the congo - which boasts the world 's second-largest primal rain forest after the amazon - will release up to 34.4 billion tons of co2 by 2050 , or roughly the same as the united kingdom 's emissions over the past 60 years . furthermore , of the 60 million people living in the democratic republic of congo , greenpeace believes 40 million are dependent on the rain forests for food , medicine , energy , building materials and other non-timber products essential to their subsistence . the group says deforestation further threatens protected indigenous ape species , including gorillas , chimpanzees and bonobos . world bank under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under fire : world bank president paul wolfowitz greenpeace has also accused the world bank of failing to enforce the 2002 moratorium on logging in the congolese republic .
" in a context of corruption and poor governance in the drc , the world bank 's attempts to reform the forestry sector are currently failing to control the expansion of logging , " wednesday 's report found . after a decade of war in the congo , the world bank resumed lending to the drc in 2001 .
by 2006 , it had approved credits totaling more than $ 4 billion , giving the international institution considerable leverage over political and economic developments there . following a world bank investigation of tax records in 2002 , the transitional drc government cancelled 163 illegal logging contracts covering nearly half of the country 's rain forests , and imposed a moratorium on all logging activity .
but by 2006 , members of the government had signed 107 new contracts covering more than a quarter of the country 's rain forests , according to the greenpeace report . the world bank is now conducting a legal review of titles to verify the validity of these new contracts .
but greenpeace fears that " the legal review could become an exercise in laundering illegal contracts . " the world bank faces a difficult balancing act between environmental preservation and social justice on the one hand , and economic development on the other .

germany is currently engaged in a heated debate over the creation of additional nursery schools .
while accepted in the former communist part of the country , western germans struggle with the plan , according to an expert . leonie herwartz-emden is a professor for pedagogy at the university of augsburg .
her postdoctoral research has focused on an intercultural comparison of motherhood and female concepts of self . dw-world.de : why do western germans have such a problem with nursery schools ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mothers are usually the ones who end up with more work leonie herwartz-emden : motherhood is still a loaded term in germany .
there are vastly differing views on the concept of motherhood .
on the one hand , mothers are highly revered and treated as icons .
on the other hand , motherhood is completely undervalued .
mothers accomplish so much in daily life .
they ensure employment - of their partners and possibly their own - and make sure that their children are nourished , groomed , educated and given an place in the educational system .
they eventually guarantee that the labor market is served by doing all the ground work in their family . studies show that the equal division between man and woman ends when children are born .
much of the work is then transferred to the woman .
men only participate marginally in educating and nurturing children .
this is still taken for granted and not necessarily questioned .
women , who stay at home , are no longer seen as full-fledged members of society by the public .
" i 'm only a housewife , " women and mothers often say ashamedly . but you also say that mothers are turned into icons - is there a german mother myth ? everything we think or feel about motherhood in 2007 can not be viewed independently of the burden of the third reich .
the mother myth has still negative connotations because of the heroic veneration of mothers during that time .
women were abused for the sake of national socialist ideology .
they had to serve at the home front .
a guidebook on education from that time , financed by -lrb- nazi propaganda minister joseph -rrb- göbbels , had a very large print run .
it was published - with a slightly different cover and text - until the 1970s .
it continued to propagate this heroic image of mothers .
we are still burdened by the national socialist legacy today . bildunterschrift : göbbels ' wife , magda , was hailed as a poster mother by the nazis .
she had seven children , six of whom were poisoned by her before she committed suicide in 1945 do other countries with a fascist past have a similar image of mothers today ? i do n't think so , because motherhood was not burdened with ideology everywhere else as it was in the case of germany .
what 's more , images of mothers are also rooted in different historic backgrounds and various societal contexts . how is germany 's image of mothers different from that of other countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two women in istanbul the german concept of motherhood is very polarized .
women themselves always feel this schism .
they are obliged to take complete care of their children and forget that they are individuals themselves .
when they take care of themselves , they feel bad , because they might neglect the children .
women in turkey and the former soviet union do n't feel such an internal polarization .
the women in the former soviet union have been involved in the labor market for decades . the women in turkey have experienced a different gender relationship .
it 's taken for granted there that women have their own , female space - as far as their biographies and society as a whole is concerned .
they are separated from men , but still valued highly by society .
that way , their femininity and motherhood are untouched and anchored in society . you have two children yourself - how did you solve the dilemma of family vs. career ? by putting in a lot of personal effort .
when i gave birth to my first son , i had a husband who became a houseman for a while .
i earned the money .
we switched roles , so to speak .
we lived in berlin , where our surroundings were very supportive ideologically speaking .
we helped set up an alternative kindergarten .
everything was very experimental .
with the second child , we went the classic way with a nanny and kindergarten later on .
it was a typical morning kindergarten , which closed at noon .
the current discussion about nursery schools always reminds me of that time . what must change for german mothers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen has seven children germany 's educational system and the kindergarten system still rely strongly on the involvement of mothers .
mothers are seen as auxiliary educators .
people always gave you nasty looks when you turned up at a summer party with a cake from the store .
later on , mothers worked for free by doing homework with their children .
mothers are completely taken in but their work is simultaneously devalued because it is n't visible .
that has to change .
until now , everything mothers do is privatized and that can only change by making it public .
the discussion that 's been started by german family minister ursula von der leyen makes this problem visible for the public . pia volk interviewed leonie herwartz-emden send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parents to get more daycare options germany hopes to catch up with other european countries with progressive childcare policies by providing more nursery school places in a bid to encourage mothers to work and reverse a declining birthrate .

german interior minister wolfgang schäuble has expressed concern that the danger of terrorist attacks against germany could have risen as a result of the country 's involvement in afghanistan .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble the interior minister referred to the abduction in baghdad in early february of a german woman and her german-iraqi son days after a second ultimatum by the hostage-takers had run out .
" we are concerned that terrorists are attacking our involvement in afghanistan with the abduction of two germans in iraq , " schäuble said .
the hostage takers have twice set deadlines for germany to withdraw its 3,000 troops from afghanistan , posting videos on the internet of 61-year-old hannelore krause kadhim begging for help with her 20-year-old son sinana at her side .
schäuble said attacks on germany could follow .
" the danger level is high , " he said .
mixed feelings about mission german officials in a foreign ministry crisis team working to release the hostages have said they have not given up hope , but are " greatly concerned . "

germany is currently engaged in a heated debate over the creation of additional nursery schools .
while accepted in the former communist part of the country , western germans struggle with the plan , according to an expert . leonie herwartz-emden is a professor for pedagogy at the university of augsburg .
her postdoctoral research has focused on an intercultural comparison of motherhood and female concepts of self . dw-world.de : why do western germans have such a problem with nursery schools ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mothers are usually the ones who end up with more work leonie herwartz-emden : motherhood is still a loaded term in germany .
there are vastly differing views on the concept of motherhood .
on the one hand , mothers are highly revered and treated as icons .
on the other hand , motherhood is completely undervalued .
mothers accomplish so much in daily life .
they ensure employment - of their partners and possibly their own - and make sure that their children are nourished , groomed , educated and given an place in the educational system .
they eventually guarantee that the labor market is served by doing all the ground work in their family . studies show that the equal division between man and woman ends when children are born .
much of the work is then transferred to the woman .
men only participate marginally in educating and nurturing children .
this is still taken for granted and not necessarily questioned .
women , who stay at home , are no longer seen as full-fledged members of society by the public .
" i 'm only a housewife , " women and mothers often say ashamedly . but you also say that mothers are turned into icons - is there a german mother myth ? everything we think or feel about motherhood in 2007 can not be viewed independently of the burden of the third reich .
the mother myth has still negative connotations because of the heroic veneration of mothers during that time .
women were abused for the sake of national socialist ideology .
they had to serve at the home front .
a guidebook on education from that time , financed by -lrb- nazi propaganda minister joseph -rrb- göbbels , had a very large print run .
it was published - with a slightly different cover and text - until the 1970s .
it continued to propagate this heroic image of mothers .
we are still burdened by the national socialist legacy today . bildunterschrift : göbbels ' wife , magda , was hailed as a poster mother by the nazis .
she had seven children , six of whom were poisoned by her before she committed suicide in 1945 do other countries with a fascist past have a similar image of mothers today ? i do n't think so , because motherhood was not burdened with ideology everywhere else as it was in the case of germany .
what 's more , images of mothers are also rooted in different historic backgrounds and various societal contexts . how is germany 's image of mothers different from that of other countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two women in istanbul the german concept of motherhood is very polarized .
women themselves always feel this schism .
they are obliged to take complete care of their children and forget that they are individuals themselves .
when they take care of themselves , they feel bad , because they might neglect the children .
women in turkey and the former soviet union do n't feel such an internal polarization .
the women in the former soviet union have been involved in the labor market for decades . the women in turkey have experienced a different gender relationship .
it 's taken for granted there that women have their own , female space - as far as their biographies and society as a whole is concerned .
they are separated from men , but still valued highly by society .
that way , their femininity and motherhood are untouched and anchored in society . you have two children yourself - how did you solve the dilemma of family vs. career ? by putting in a lot of personal effort .
when i gave birth to my first son , i had a husband who became a houseman for a while .
i earned the money .
we switched roles , so to speak .
we lived in berlin , where our surroundings were very supportive ideologically speaking .
we helped set up an alternative kindergarten .
everything was very experimental .
with the second child , we went the classic way with a nanny and kindergarten later on .
it was a typical morning kindergarten , which closed at noon .
the current discussion about nursery schools always reminds me of that time . what must change for german mothers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen has seven children germany 's educational system and the kindergarten system still rely strongly on the involvement of mothers .
mothers are seen as auxiliary educators .
people always gave you nasty looks when you turned up at a summer party with a cake from the store .
later on , mothers worked for free by doing homework with their children .
mothers are completely taken in but their work is simultaneously devalued because it is n't visible .
that has to change .
until now , everything mothers do is privatized and that can only change by making it public .
the discussion that 's been started by german family minister ursula von der leyen makes this problem visible for the public . pia volk interviewed leonie herwartz-emden send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parents to get more daycare options germany hopes to catch up with other european countries with progressive childcare policies by providing more nursery school places in a bid to encourage mothers to work and reverse a declining birthrate .

" seriously , i expected more from germany " , which currently holds the six-month rotating presidency of the eu , he told german magazine der spiegel . he was speaking ahead of a visit to germany on sunday , where he is due to open the hanover industrial fair alongside chancellor angela merkel . erdogan also explicitly reproached germany for his lack of invitation to the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the treaty of rome in berlin three weeks ago . that was a " grave error , " the turkish prime minister said , adding that it had " overshadowed the german presidency . clear timeline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and erdogan are unlikely to get too cozy on sunday " we would like a clear idea of a date , a roadmap , a calendar for negotiations " to show the eu was serious about turkey joining its ranks , he told the magazine .
he proposed 2014 or 2015 as a possible date for membership . but if the eu " does n't want us , it should say so clearly now , " he said .
" if we are not wanted , the two sides need not continue wasting their time in talks . " merkel against membership merkel is personally and politically , through her christian democratic union party , against turkish membership of the eu .
instead she would prefer to see the secular islamic nation become a " privileged partner " of the 27-member bloc . public opinion in germany , the eu 's most populous country which has 2.5 million turkish residents , is generally against turkish membership . however , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , supports full membership . " if we really trust turkey , that will improve security and stability in europe , " he told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung regional newspaper . turks against erdogan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-erdogan demonstrators in front of the atatürk mausoleum on saturday chanting secularist slogans and waving turkish flags , more than 300,000 people from all over turkey meanwhile rallied in the turkish capital ankara on saturday to discourage erdogan , a conservative with an islamist political past , from running for the presidency . the demonstrators marched to the mausoleum of mustafa kemal ataturk , the founder of modern secular turkey in 1923 , transforming the normally hushed venue into an unprecedented demonstration ground . " turkey is secular , it will remain secular , " " the presidency 's roads are closed to sharia -lrb- islamic law -rrb- , " " an imam can not become a president , " they chanted , reflecting concerns that erdogan and his justice and devlopment party -lrb- akp -rrb- are not truly committed to the mainly muslim nation 's secular system . erdogan has yet to say whether or not he will run for the presidency when the akp-dominated parliament elects a successor to the staunchly secularist ahmet necdet sezer next month . the akp has pledged commitment to secularism and carried out a series of democracy reforms to boost turkey 's bid to join the european union .
yet , the secular establishment , including the powerful army , remains sceptical of erdogan 's avowed rejection of his radical islamist past . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges restraint over turkish talk of kurdish crackdown the european commission urged turkey on friday to play a " constructive " role in iraq a day after turkey 's army chief called for a military incursion into northern iraq to hunt turkish kurd rebels .

" urgent debate is required on the matter .
the payments must be cancelled if the managers fail . "

but rather arriving in the land of milk and honey , for many the cold reality is working in a glasshouse in spain 's andalusia region . mustafa shivers and pulls his cap down more tightly over his face .
the 27-year-old senegalese is standing on a crossroad at the edge of the city el ejido .
it 's early in the morning , and there 's still a light fog . mustafa was n't the first to arrive at the crossroads - there are several small groups of africans silently waiting for work . " there are people here from gambia , guinea , and mali , " mustafa said . " we come here every morning . " el ejido , with a population of 75,000 and no tourist attractions , is in the middle of one of the world 's biggest vegetable growing regions and is surrounded by a sea of glasshouses filled with tomatoes , paprika , and lettuce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is one of the eu 's biggest vegetable producers with an annual production of 1.5 million tons of vegetables , there is enough work here .
yet mustafa and the others often have to wait for hours for one reason - they 're illegal . " everyone standing here is without papers , " mustafa said . long wait for illegals " sometimes we wait here for up to five hours , " he said .
" at two in the afternoon we go to get something to eat , and then we come back again at three . " the group do n't like journalists because no farmer is likely stop if a microphone is being waved about .
there are large fines for those who employ immigrants without papers .
but the africans still hope that a pick-up will pull up and load them in the back .
even if mustafa does n't find work today , he will come back tomorrow , as he has done for the past eight months . mustafa does n't plan on staying much longer in el ejido though .
he wants to go north to valencia or barcelona - or perhaps even france or germany . " i do n't have a place to live , " he said .
" i sleep in a garage on a construction site , on the street . " but people are nice to him , he said - even the police . tough living conditions the chances of mustafa ever getting a work permit are n't good .
that means it 's virtually impossible for him - like thousands of others in the same situation - to rent an apartment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting a legal permit is just a dream for many immigrants that 's why many of the illegals live in miserable conditions in abandoned houses dotted around the region . in the nearby town of nijar , in a place called casa vieja -lrb- old house -rrb- , about 50 young moroccans live in a fallen-down farmhouse .
halib has been squatting here for nearly eight months .
the 22-year-old has managed to acquire a mattress , some cardboard boxes and a couple of meters of plastic sheeting .
he might now have a roof over his head , but he does n't have the luxury of water or electricity . it takes halib an hour walk to where he works in a glasshouse . " the work is difficult , " he said .
" it 's very hot , and for eight hours , they pay me 31 euros -lrb- $ 42 -rrb- .
life is bad . " being illegal leaves many of the workers vulnerable to exploitation .
abdelkader cacha , a right 's campaigns at the agricultural workers union , soc , said there is no protection for workers . " they do n't have masks or any protective clothing , " he said .

" turkey is secular , it will remain secular , " " the presidency 's roads are closed to sharia -lrb- islamic law -rrb- , " " an imam can not become a president , " they chanted , reflecting concerns that erdogan and his justice and devlopment party -lrb- akp -rrb- are not truly committed to the mainly muslim nation 's secular system . erdogan has yet to say whether or not he will run for the presidency when the akp-dominated parliament elects a successor to the staunchly secularist ahmet necdet sezer next month . the akp has pledged commitment to secularism and carried out a series of democracy reforms to boost turkey 's bid to join the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.04.2007 berlin exhibition explores art and science of pain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pain comes in many forms at berlin 's medical historical museum a new exhibition in berlin aims to explore the many facets of human pain .
the challenge lies in demonstrating a subject that is neither tangible nor visible .
curators in berlin designed “ pain ” as a twofold experience . at the entrance to the hanburger bahnhof , a former train station that houses berlin ’ s national gallery of contemporary art , the first exhibit that catches the eye is a subtle hint of things to come .
enclosed in a showcase is a simple piece of wood , about one meter in length and tightly wrapped in a thick leather hide .
up until the 19th century , it was a staple piece of medical equipment : in the absence of effective anesthetics , countless people dug their teeth into this contraption to avoid biting their own tongue off during painful surgical procedures .
more than a relic of medical history , this inanimate object - full of bite marks - is capable of invoking harrowing images in the mind ’ s eye : images of a situation so painful , you can almost feel it .
indeed , that has been the central challenge for this new exhibition called " schmerz " -lrb- " pain " -rrb- : how to convey the sensation of pain , without actually inflicting it ?
bildunterschrift : berlin 's museum for contemporary art a twofold approach for hamburger bahnhof curator eugen blume , the solution lies in the mingling of art and science .
" the juxtaposition of scientific and artistic works in this joint exhibition is meant to blur the lines between these two areas , " he said .
this idea finds its most obvious expression in the fact that " schmerz " is a joint exhibition involving the hamburger bahnhof museum of contemporary art and the medical history museum of berlin 's charité teaching hospital .
the hamburger bahnhof explores the subjective experience of physical and psychological suffering from an artistic point of view .
divided into two distinct sections , " perceptions of pain " examines the way in which humans cope with the suffering of others , while " allure of pain " delves into individual ways of coping with pain - including the sexual pleasure that some derive from it .
just across the street , the charité museum presents a scientific examination of pain .
" time of pain " takes a historical view of human suffering and its perception , while " expression of pain " takes a look at how we communicate painful experiences to the outside world through the written word , art and music .
both houses are connected by a " path of suffering " : about 400 meters in length , this footpath itself contains 30 exhibits on human suffering .
taken as a whole , the exhibition aims to " walk the line between science and art , " as the preview states , through " combinations and confrontations of artistic works , medical , folkloristic , religious and daily objects . "
by dividing it up among the two museums , the exhibition also " accommodates the traditional expectations and viewing habits associated with both museums . "
the passion of christ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crucifixion of christ : the ultimate symbol of pain religious artifacts are an important part of the exhibition .
in what is perhaps the western world ’ s most vivid image of human suffering , the passion of jesus christ is in the foreground of these religious exhibits .
but always mixing the religious with the scientific , several exhibits also recall the experiments of frederick t. zugibes , an american doctor who in the late 1940s hung his assistants by the cross in order to measure the precise pains incurred by crucifixion .
there are also other , more obscure objects to be found , such as a 19th-century " medicinal magnetic cross of saint benedict " : at a time when people were unsure whether science or religion had the greater curative power , they simply combined the two into one device .
and in the charité museum , visitors are invited to examine tumor-ridden brains preserved in formaldehyde , skeletons with crooked vertebrae or skulls full of rotten teeth .
stomach ulcers , liver cirrhosis and deformed embryos are all part of this exploration of pain .
suited for all ages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " schmerz " explores pain through art , science and religion but the exhibition avoids the controversial and the confrontational , and examines pain in a way that is easily digestible .
hardly any of the exhibits approach contemporary topics such as torture , war , terrorism or genocide .
" schmerz " is a g-rated exhibition , suitable for all ages - a conscious decision , charité museum co-curator daniel tyradellis told spiegel online .
the hamburger bahnhof and the charité museum relied on their own berlin-based collections for this exhibition , rather than importing pieces from all around the world , as is often the case .

" we are critical of these managers who fail , but who nevertheless receive payments that are provided for in their contracts , " a spokesman for ig metall 's north german branch , daniel friedrich , told afp .
" urgent debate is required on the matter .
the payments must be cancelled if the managers fail . "
in addition , the general principle of high salaries for executives was " untenable " for the union , friedrich said .
" employees do n't understand why their wages are continually cut , while managers ' pay continuallly rise , ostensibly in the name of remaining competitive at a global level , " the spokesman said .

eads said the payoff was provided for in his contract .
forgeard stood down last july in the face of troubles at airbus and controversy over his decision to exercise share options just months before news of the problems was announced .
airbus has since embarked on a massive restructuring programme that entails the loss of 10,000 jobs in europe , including 4,300 in france and 3,700 in germany .
the severance pay packet has sparked fierce protest in france , with presidential election candidates calling it a scandal .

royal called the payments a " scandal " and a " provocation " as airbus battles with major losses caused by delays to its new a380 super-jumbo jet .
" taking this information into account , i call on airbus leaders to withdraw the whole plan so we can start afresh to see which job cuts are justified by the industrial strategy , " royal said in a french television interview .
the communist party candidate in the election , marie-george buffet , asked : " how can a company give such a bonus to a boss who everyone agrees was a disastrous manager . "

but rather arriving in the land of milk and honey , for many the cold reality is working in a glasshouse in spain 's andalusia region . mustafa shivers and pulls his cap down more tightly over his face .
the 27-year-old senegalese is standing on a crossroad at the edge of the city el ejido .
it 's early in the morning , and there 's still a light fog . mustafa was n't the first to arrive at the crossroads - there are several small groups of africans silently waiting for work . " there are people here from gambia , guinea , and mali , " mustafa said . " we come here every morning . " el ejido , with a population of 75,000 and no tourist attractions , is in the middle of one of the world 's biggest vegetable growing regions and is surrounded by a sea of glasshouses filled with tomatoes , paprika , and lettuce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is one of the eu 's biggest vegetable producers with an annual production of 1.5 million tons of vegetables , there is enough work here .
yet mustafa and the others often have to wait for hours for one reason - they 're illegal . " everyone standing here is without papers , " mustafa said . long wait for illegals " sometimes we wait here for up to five hours , " he said .
" at two in the afternoon we go to get something to eat , and then we come back again at three . " the group do n't like journalists because no farmer is likely stop if a microphone is being waved about .
there are large fines for those who employ immigrants without papers .
but the africans still hope that a pick-up will pull up and load them in the back .
even if mustafa does n't find work today , he will come back tomorrow , as he has done for the past eight months . mustafa does n't plan on staying much longer in el ejido though .
he wants to go north to valencia or barcelona - or perhaps even france or germany . " i do n't have a place to live , " he said .
" i sleep in a garage on a construction site , on the street . " but people are nice to him , he said - even the police . tough living conditions the chances of mustafa ever getting a work permit are n't good .
that means it 's virtually impossible for him - like thousands of others in the same situation - to rent an apartment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting a legal permit is just a dream for many immigrants that 's why many of the illegals live in miserable conditions in abandoned houses dotted around the region . in the nearby town of nijar , in a place called casa vieja -lrb- old house -rrb- , about 50 young moroccans live in a fallen-down farmhouse .
halib has been squatting here for nearly eight months .

" we are critical of these managers who fail , but who nevertheless receive payments that are provided for in their contracts , " a spokesman for ig metall 's north german branch , daniel friedrich , told afp .
" urgent debate is required on the matter .
the payments must be cancelled if the managers fail . "
in addition , the general principle of high salaries for executives was " untenable " for the union , friedrich said .
" employees do n't understand why their wages are continually cut , while managers ' pay continuallly rise , ostensibly in the name of remaining competitive at a global level , " the spokesman said .
bum per pay-off for ex-ceo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forgeard is probably not looking so glum these days forgeard , former chief executive of the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its plane-making subsidiary , airbus , was awarded 6.1 million euros -lrb- $ 8.2 million -rrb- in pay - more than two years ' salary - when he left and was also entitled to a non-competition indemnity package payable over two years worth 2.4 million euros more , according to company documents released on tuesday .
eads said the payoff was provided for in his contract .
forgeard stood down last july in the face of troubles at airbus and controversy over his decision to exercise share options just months before news of the problems was announced .
airbus has since embarked on a massive restructuring programme that entails the loss of 10,000 jobs in europe , including 4,300 in france and 3,700 in germany .
the severance pay packet has sparked fierce protest in france , with presidential election candidates calling it a scandal .
royal calls for reversal of job cuts plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal is championing the cause of airbus workers socialist contender segolene royal called on airbus to withdraw its proposed 10,000 job cuts across europe following revelations of the money paid to forgeard .
royal called the payments a " scandal " and a " provocation " as airbus battles with major losses caused by delays to its new a380 super-jumbo jet .
" taking this information into account , i call on airbus leaders to withdraw the whole plan so we can start afresh to see which job cuts are justified by the industrial strategy , " royal said in a french television interview .
the communist party candidate in the election , marie-george buffet , asked : " how can a company give such a bonus to a boss who everyone agrees was a disastrous manager . "
the president of the french lower house of parliament patrick ollier expressed " indignation " at the payoff . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mass strikes across europe hit airbus factories tens of thousands of striking airbus workers rallied across europe friday to protest management plans to cut 10,000 jobs under a sweeping restructuring plan at the struggling aircraft manufacturer .

the environmental group accuses the world bank and international loggers , including germans , of exacerbating the problem . the report , titled " carving up the congo , " claims over 15 million hectares -lrb- 37 million acres -rrb- of rain forest have been granted to international logging companies in 107 new contracts over the last five years , despite a 2002 government moratorium on such activity . " our findings expose serious lapses of governance , a massive lack of institutional capacity to control the forestry sector , widespread illegalities and social conflicts , as well as clashes with established conservation initiatives , " greenpeace says . the report accuses international logging companies of " causing social chaos and wreaking environmental havoc " in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . it details how timber worth thousands of dollars - african teak , for example , is worth some 6,000 euros per tree on european markets - is traded for cheap gifts and oft-unmet promises to local communities . the report documents several such gifts , including a motor bike for a chieftain , bags of salt and crates of beer for villagers , and pledges to build schools and hospitals . " these promises are rarely fulfilled and there are reports that intimidation tactics are used against people who try to protest , " greenpeace said , citing a lawsuit from siforco against the civil society of bumba , which complained of a " lack of respect " from the logging company and now stands trial on charges of defamation . german company siforco is one of those european firms that has been singled out for unscrupulous behaviour , along with other international logging companies , such as itb , cft , forabola , sodefor , soforma , olam , sicobois and trans-m . the biggest logging operator in the drc , siforco has roundly defended its record in congo .
but stefan van traet , greenpeace 's africa forest campaign co-ordinator , said it employs bullying tactics symptomatic of the congolese logging industry . " there is a court case from siforco against 29 persons of the civil society of bumba who complained of the lack of respect for the local communities by the logging company , " he told dw-radio .
" and the logging company said it 's defamation , because they signed a petition that was handed out to the local authorities . so you can see there is a kind of intimidation when local groups question the behavior of logging companies . " consequences for the congo and beyond bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logging threatens gorillas like this one , says greenpeace greenpeace estimates that tropical deforestation alone contributes up to 25 percent of the world 's human-induced carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions .
the report says that logging in the congo - which boasts the world 's second-largest primal rain forest after the amazon - will release up to 34.4 billion tons of co2 by 2050 , or roughly the same as the united kingdom 's emissions over the past 60 years . furthermore , of the 60 million people living in the democratic republic of congo , greenpeace believes 40 million are dependent on the rain forests for food , medicine , energy , building materials and other non-timber products essential to their subsistence . the group says deforestation further threatens protected indigenous ape species , including gorillas , chimpanzees and bonobos . world bank under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under fire : world bank president paul wolfowitz greenpeace has also accused the world bank of failing to enforce the 2002 moratorium on logging in the congolese republic .
" in a context of corruption and poor governance in the drc , the world bank 's attempts to reform the forestry sector are currently failing to control the expansion of logging , " wednesday 's report found . after a decade of war in the congo , the world bank resumed lending to the drc in 2001 .
by 2006 , it had approved credits totaling more than $ 4 billion , giving the international institution considerable leverage over political and economic developments there . following a world bank investigation of tax records in 2002 , the transitional drc government cancelled 163 illegal logging contracts covering nearly half of the country 's rain forests , and imposed a moratorium on all logging activity .
but by 2006 , members of the government had signed 107 new contracts covering more than a quarter of the country 's rain forests , according to the greenpeace report . the world bank is now conducting a legal review of titles to verify the validity of these new contracts .
but greenpeace fears that " the legal review could become an exercise in laundering illegal contracts . " the world bank faces a difficult balancing act between environmental preservation and social justice on the one hand , and economic development on the other .
greenpeace claims the world bank has ignored the " legal vacuum " in the congolese forestry industry in order to promote development . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to double aid to dr congo after democratic elections the eu has been the main donor in funding the november elections in dr congo , and now plans to double reconstruction aid to 400 million euros in order to secure democracy in the aftermath of civil war .

" we are critical of these managers who fail , but who nevertheless receive payments that are provided for in their contracts , " a spokesman for ig metall 's north german branch , daniel friedrich , told afp .
" urgent debate is required on the matter .
the payments must be cancelled if the managers fail . "
in addition , the general principle of high salaries for executives was " untenable " for the union , friedrich said .
" employees do n't understand why their wages are continually cut , while managers ' pay continuallly rise , ostensibly in the name of remaining competitive at a global level , " the spokesman said .
bum per pay-off for ex-ceo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forgeard is probably not looking so glum these days forgeard , former chief executive of the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its plane-making subsidiary , airbus , was awarded 6.1 million euros -lrb- $ 8.2 million -rrb- in pay - more than two years ' salary - when he left and was also entitled to a non-competition indemnity package payable over two years worth 2.4 million euros more , according to company documents released on tuesday .
eads said the payoff was provided for in his contract .
forgeard stood down last july in the face of troubles at airbus and controversy over his decision to exercise share options just months before news of the problems was announced .
airbus has since embarked on a massive restructuring programme that entails the loss of 10,000 jobs in europe , including 4,300 in france and 3,700 in germany .
the severance pay packet has sparked fierce protest in france , with presidential election candidates calling it a scandal .
royal calls for reversal of job cuts plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal is championing the cause of airbus workers socialist contender segolene royal called on airbus to withdraw its proposed 10,000 job cuts across europe following revelations of the money paid to forgeard .
royal called the payments a " scandal " and a " provocation " as airbus battles with major losses caused by delays to its new a380 super-jumbo jet .
" taking this information into account , i call on airbus leaders to withdraw the whole plan so we can start afresh to see which job cuts are justified by the industrial strategy , " royal said in a french television interview .
the communist party candidate in the election , marie-george buffet , asked : " how can a company give such a bonus to a boss who everyone agrees was a disastrous manager . "
the president of the french lower house of parliament patrick ollier expressed " indignation " at the payoff . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mass strikes across europe hit airbus factories tens of thousands of striking airbus workers rallied across europe friday to protest management plans to cut 10,000 jobs under a sweeping restructuring plan at the struggling aircraft manufacturer .

the environmental group accuses the world bank and international loggers , including germans , of exacerbating the problem . the report , titled " carving up the congo , " claims over 15 million hectares -lrb- 37 million acres -rrb- of rain forest have been granted to international logging companies in 107 new contracts over the last five years , despite a 2002 government moratorium on such activity . " our findings expose serious lapses of governance , a massive lack of institutional capacity to control the forestry sector , widespread illegalities and social conflicts , as well as clashes with established conservation initiatives , " greenpeace says . the report accuses international logging companies of " causing social chaos and wreaking environmental havoc " in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . it details how timber worth thousands of dollars - african teak , for example , is worth some 6,000 euros per tree on european markets - is traded for cheap gifts and oft-unmet promises to local communities . the report documents several such gifts , including a motor bike for a chieftain , bags of salt and crates of beer for villagers , and pledges to build schools and hospitals . " these promises are rarely fulfilled and there are reports that intimidation tactics are used against people who try to protest , " greenpeace said , citing a lawsuit from siforco against the civil society of bumba , which complained of a " lack of respect " from the logging company and now stands trial on charges of defamation . german company siforco is one of those european firms that has been singled out for unscrupulous behaviour , along with other international logging companies , such as itb , cft , forabola , sodefor , soforma , olam , sicobois and trans-m . the biggest logging operator in the drc , siforco has roundly defended its record in congo .
but stefan van traet , greenpeace 's africa forest campaign co-ordinator , said it employs bullying tactics symptomatic of the congolese logging industry . " there is a court case from siforco against 29 persons of the civil society of bumba who complained of the lack of respect for the local communities by the logging company , " he told dw-radio .
" and the logging company said it 's defamation , because they signed a petition that was handed out to the local authorities . so you can see there is a kind of intimidation when local groups question the behavior of logging companies . " consequences for the congo and beyond bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logging threatens gorillas like this one , says greenpeace greenpeace estimates that tropical deforestation alone contributes up to 25 percent of the world 's human-induced carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions .
the report says that logging in the congo - which boasts the world 's second-largest primal rain forest after the amazon - will release up to 34.4 billion tons of co2 by 2050 , or roughly the same as the united kingdom 's emissions over the past 60 years . furthermore , of the 60 million people living in the democratic republic of congo , greenpeace believes 40 million are dependent on the rain forests for food , medicine , energy , building materials and other non-timber products essential to their subsistence . the group says deforestation further threatens protected indigenous ape species , including gorillas , chimpanzees and bonobos . world bank under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under fire : world bank president paul wolfowitz greenpeace has also accused the world bank of failing to enforce the 2002 moratorium on logging in the congolese republic .
" in a context of corruption and poor governance in the drc , the world bank 's attempts to reform the forestry sector are currently failing to control the expansion of logging , " wednesday 's report found . after a decade of war in the congo , the world bank resumed lending to the drc in 2001 .
by 2006 , it had approved credits totaling more than $ 4 billion , giving the international institution considerable leverage over political and economic developments there . following a world bank investigation of tax records in 2002 , the transitional drc government cancelled 163 illegal logging contracts covering nearly half of the country 's rain forests , and imposed a moratorium on all logging activity .
but by 2006 , members of the government had signed 107 new contracts covering more than a quarter of the country 's rain forests , according to the greenpeace report . the world bank is now conducting a legal review of titles to verify the validity of these new contracts .
but greenpeace fears that " the legal review could become an exercise in laundering illegal contracts . " the world bank faces a difficult balancing act between environmental preservation and social justice on the one hand , and economic development on the other .
greenpeace claims the world bank has ignored the " legal vacuum " in the congolese forestry industry in order to promote development . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to double aid to dr congo after democratic elections the eu has been the main donor in funding the november elections in dr congo , and now plans to double reconstruction aid to 400 million euros in order to secure democracy in the aftermath of civil war .

the challenge lies in demonstrating a subject that is neither tangible nor visible .
curators in berlin designed “ pain ” as a twofold experience . at the entrance to the hanburger bahnhof , a former train station that houses berlin ’ s national gallery of contemporary art , the first exhibit that catches the eye is a subtle hint of things to come .
enclosed in a showcase is a simple piece of wood , about one meter in length and tightly wrapped in a thick leather hide .
up until the 19th century , it was a staple piece of medical equipment : in the absence of effective anesthetics , countless people dug their teeth into this contraption to avoid biting their own tongue off during painful surgical procedures .
more than a relic of medical history , this inanimate object - full of bite marks - is capable of invoking harrowing images in the mind ’ s eye : images of a situation so painful , you can almost feel it .
indeed , that has been the central challenge for this new exhibition called " schmerz " -lrb- " pain " -rrb- : how to convey the sensation of pain , without actually inflicting it ?
bildunterschrift : berlin 's museum for contemporary art a twofold approach for hamburger bahnhof curator eugen blume , the solution lies in the mingling of art and science .
" the juxtaposition of scientific and artistic works in this joint exhibition is meant to blur the lines between these two areas , " he said .
this idea finds its most obvious expression in the fact that " schmerz " is a joint exhibition involving the hamburger bahnhof museum of contemporary art and the medical history museum of berlin 's charité teaching hospital .
the hamburger bahnhof explores the subjective experience of physical and psychological suffering from an artistic point of view .
divided into two distinct sections , " perceptions of pain " examines the way in which humans cope with the suffering of others , while " allure of pain " delves into individual ways of coping with pain - including the sexual pleasure that some derive from it .
just across the street , the charité museum presents a scientific examination of pain .
" time of pain " takes a historical view of human suffering and its perception , while " expression of pain " takes a look at how we communicate painful experiences to the outside world through the written word , art and music .
both houses are connected by a " path of suffering " : about 400 meters in length , this footpath itself contains 30 exhibits on human suffering .
taken as a whole , the exhibition aims to " walk the line between science and art , " as the preview states , through " combinations and confrontations of artistic works , medical , folkloristic , religious and daily objects . "
by dividing it up among the two museums , the exhibition also " accommodates the traditional expectations and viewing habits associated with both museums . "
the passion of christ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crucifixion of christ : the ultimate symbol of pain religious artifacts are an important part of the exhibition .
in what is perhaps the western world ’ s most vivid image of human suffering , the passion of jesus christ is in the foreground of these religious exhibits .
but always mixing the religious with the scientific , several exhibits also recall the experiments of frederick t. zugibes , an american doctor who in the late 1940s hung his assistants by the cross in order to measure the precise pains incurred by crucifixion .
there are also other , more obscure objects to be found , such as a 19th-century " medicinal magnetic cross of saint benedict " : at a time when people were unsure whether science or religion had the greater curative power , they simply combined the two into one device .
and in the charité museum , visitors are invited to examine tumor-ridden brains preserved in formaldehyde , skeletons with crooked vertebrae or skulls full of rotten teeth .
stomach ulcers , liver cirrhosis and deformed embryos are all part of this exploration of pain .
suited for all ages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " schmerz " explores pain through art , science and religion but the exhibition avoids the controversial and the confrontational , and examines pain in a way that is easily digestible .
hardly any of the exhibits approach contemporary topics such as torture , war , terrorism or genocide .
" schmerz " is a g-rated exhibition , suitable for all ages - a conscious decision , charité museum co-curator daniel tyradellis told spiegel online .
the hamburger bahnhof and the charité museum relied on their own berlin-based collections for this exhibition , rather than importing pieces from all around the world , as is often the case .
" schmerz " showcases artists ranging from marina abramovic , francis bacon and joseph beuys to louise bourgeois , bruce nauman and sam taylor-wood , among others .
" schmerz " runs from april 5 through aug .

divided into two distinct sections , " perceptions of pain " examines the way in which humans cope with the suffering of others , while " allure of pain " delves into individual ways of coping with pain - including the sexual pleasure that some derive from it .
just across the street , the charité museum presents a scientific examination of pain .
" time of pain " takes a historical view of human suffering and its perception , while " expression of pain " takes a look at how we communicate painful experiences to the outside world through the written word , art and music .
both houses are connected by a " path of suffering " : about 400 meters in length , this footpath itself contains 30 exhibits on human suffering .
taken as a whole , the exhibition aims to " walk the line between science and art , " as the preview states , through " combinations and confrontations of artistic works , medical , folkloristic , religious and daily objects . "
by dividing it up among the two museums , the exhibition also " accommodates the traditional expectations and viewing habits associated with both museums . "
the passion of christ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crucifixion of christ : the ultimate symbol of pain religious artifacts are an important part of the exhibition .
in what is perhaps the western world ’ s most vivid image of human suffering , the passion of jesus christ is in the foreground of these religious exhibits .
but always mixing the religious with the scientific , several exhibits also recall the experiments of frederick t. zugibes , an american doctor who in the late 1940s hung his assistants by the cross in order to measure the precise pains incurred by crucifixion .
there are also other , more obscure objects to be found , such as a 19th-century " medicinal magnetic cross of saint benedict " : at a time when people were unsure whether science or religion had the greater curative power , they simply combined the two into one device .
and in the charité museum , visitors are invited to examine tumor-ridden brains preserved in formaldehyde , skeletons with crooked vertebrae or skulls full of rotten teeth .
stomach ulcers , liver cirrhosis and deformed embryos are all part of this exploration of pain .
suited for all ages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " schmerz " explores pain through art , science and religion but the exhibition avoids the controversial and the confrontational , and examines pain in a way that is easily digestible .
hardly any of the exhibits approach contemporary topics such as torture , war , terrorism or genocide .
" schmerz " is a g-rated exhibition , suitable for all ages - a conscious decision , charité museum co-curator daniel tyradellis told spiegel online .
the hamburger bahnhof and the charité museum relied on their own berlin-based collections for this exhibition , rather than importing pieces from all around the world , as is often the case .

the challenge lies in demonstrating a subject that is neither tangible nor visible .
curators in berlin designed “ pain ” as a twofold experience . at the entrance to the hanburger bahnhof , a former train station that houses berlin ’ s national gallery of contemporary art , the first exhibit that catches the eye is a subtle hint of things to come .
enclosed in a showcase is a simple piece of wood , about one meter in length and tightly wrapped in a thick leather hide .
up until the 19th century , it was a staple piece of medical equipment : in the absence of effective anesthetics , countless people dug their teeth into this contraption to avoid biting their own tongue off during painful surgical procedures .
more than a relic of medical history , this inanimate object - full of bite marks - is capable of invoking harrowing images in the mind ’ s eye : images of a situation so painful , you can almost feel it .
indeed , that has been the central challenge for this new exhibition called " schmerz " -lrb- " pain " -rrb- : how to convey the sensation of pain , without actually inflicting it ?
bildunterschrift : berlin 's museum for contemporary art a twofold approach for hamburger bahnhof curator eugen blume , the solution lies in the mingling of art and science .
" the juxtaposition of scientific and artistic works in this joint exhibition is meant to blur the lines between these two areas , " he said .
this idea finds its most obvious expression in the fact that " schmerz " is a joint exhibition involving the hamburger bahnhof museum of contemporary art and the medical history museum of berlin 's charité teaching hospital .

german interior minister wolfgang schäuble has expressed concern that the danger of terrorist attacks against germany could have risen as a result of the country 's involvement in afghanistan . " we are part of the global threat by islamist terrorism , " schäuble told die welt am sonntag newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble the interior minister referred to the abduction in baghdad in early february of a german woman and her german-iraqi son days after a second ultimatum by the hostage-takers had run out .
" we are concerned that terrorists are attacking our involvement in afghanistan with the abduction of two germans in iraq , " schäuble said .
the hostage takers have twice set deadlines for germany to withdraw its 3,000 troops from afghanistan , posting videos on the internet of 61-year-old hannelore krause kadhim begging for help with her 20-year-old son sinana at her side .
schäuble said attacks on germany could follow .
" the danger level is high , " he said .
mixed feelings about mission german officials in a foreign ministry crisis team working to release the hostages have said they have not given up hope , but are " greatly concerned . "
according to recent opinion polls , the german public remains broadly behind the country 's reconstruction mission in relatively peaceful northern afghanistan , but there is strong opposition to the deployment this month of six reconnaissance jets to assist nato forces fighting the taliban in the south . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europol seeks broader mandate amid growing terror threat eu police arrested over 700 terror suspects last year , according to a report released tuesday .

" taking this information into account , i call on airbus leaders to withdraw the whole plan so we can start afresh to see which job cuts are justified by the industrial strategy , " royal said in a french television interview .

" urgent debate is required on the matter .
the payments must be cancelled if the managers fail . "
in addition , the general principle of high salaries for executives was " untenable " for the union , friedrich said .

the environmental group accuses the world bank and international loggers , including germans , of exacerbating the problem . the report , titled " carving up the congo , " claims over 15 million hectares -lrb- 37 million acres -rrb- of rain forest have been granted to international logging companies in 107 new contracts over the last five years , despite a 2002 government moratorium on such activity .

" these promises are rarely fulfilled and there are reports that intimidation tactics are used against people who try to protest , " greenpeace said , citing a lawsuit from siforco against the civil society of bumba , which complained of a " lack of respect " from the logging company and now stands trial on charges of defamation . german company siforco is one of those european firms that has been singled out for unscrupulous behaviour , along with other international logging companies , such as itb , cft , forabola , sodefor , soforma , olam , sicobois and trans-m . the biggest logging operator in the drc , siforco has roundly defended its record in congo .

" there is a court case from siforco against 29 persons of the civil society of bumba who complained of the lack of respect for the local communities by the logging company , " he told dw-radio .

by 2006 , it had approved credits totaling more than $ 4 billion , giving the international institution considerable leverage over political and economic developments there . following a world bank investigation of tax records in 2002 , the transitional drc government cancelled 163 illegal logging contracts covering nearly half of the country 's rain forests , and imposed a moratorium on all logging activity .
but by 2006 , members of the government had signed 107 new contracts covering more than a quarter of the country 's rain forests , according to the greenpeace report . the world bank is now conducting a legal review of titles to verify the validity of these new contracts .
but greenpeace fears that " the legal review could become an exercise in laundering illegal contracts . " the world bank faces a difficult balancing act between environmental preservation and social justice on the one hand , and economic development on the other .

germany is currently engaged in a heated debate over the creation of additional nursery schools .
while accepted in the former communist part of the country , western germans struggle with the plan , according to an expert . leonie herwartz-emden is a professor for pedagogy at the university of augsburg .
her postdoctoral research has focused on an intercultural comparison of motherhood and female concepts of self . dw-world.de : why do western germans have such a problem with nursery schools ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mothers are usually the ones who end up with more work leonie herwartz-emden : motherhood is still a loaded term in germany .
there are vastly differing views on the concept of motherhood .
on the one hand , mothers are highly revered and treated as icons .
on the other hand , motherhood is completely undervalued .
mothers accomplish so much in daily life .
they ensure employment - of their partners and possibly their own - and make sure that their children are nourished , groomed , educated and given an place in the educational system .
they eventually guarantee that the labor market is served by doing all the ground work in their family . studies show that the equal division between man and woman ends when children are born .
much of the work is then transferred to the woman .
men only participate marginally in educating and nurturing children .
this is still taken for granted and not necessarily questioned .
women , who stay at home , are no longer seen as full-fledged members of society by the public .
" i 'm only a housewife , " women and mothers often say ashamedly . but you also say that mothers are turned into icons - is there a german mother myth ? everything we think or feel about motherhood in 2007 can not be viewed independently of the burden of the third reich .
the mother myth has still negative connotations because of the heroic veneration of mothers during that time .
women were abused for the sake of national socialist ideology .
they had to serve at the home front .
a guidebook on education from that time , financed by -lrb- nazi propaganda minister joseph -rrb- göbbels , had a very large print run .
it was published - with a slightly different cover and text - until the 1970s .
it continued to propagate this heroic image of mothers .
we are still burdened by the national socialist legacy today . bildunterschrift : göbbels ' wife , magda , was hailed as a poster mother by the nazis .
she had seven children , six of whom were poisoned by her before she committed suicide in 1945 do other countries with a fascist past have a similar image of mothers today ? i do n't think so , because motherhood was not burdened with ideology everywhere else as it was in the case of germany .
what 's more , images of mothers are also rooted in different historic backgrounds and various societal contexts . how is germany 's image of mothers different from that of other countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two women in istanbul the german concept of motherhood is very polarized .
women themselves always feel this schism .
they are obliged to take complete care of their children and forget that they are individuals themselves .
when they take care of themselves , they feel bad , because they might neglect the children .
women in turkey and the former soviet union do n't feel such an internal polarization .
the women in the former soviet union have been involved in the labor market for decades . the women in turkey have experienced a different gender relationship .
it 's taken for granted there that women have their own , female space - as far as their biographies and society as a whole is concerned .
they are separated from men , but still valued highly by society .
that way , their femininity and motherhood are untouched and anchored in society . you have two children yourself - how did you solve the dilemma of family vs. career ? by putting in a lot of personal effort .
when i gave birth to my first son , i had a husband who became a houseman for a while .
i earned the money .
we switched roles , so to speak .
we lived in berlin , where our surroundings were very supportive ideologically speaking .
we helped set up an alternative kindergarten .
everything was very experimental .
with the second child , we went the classic way with a nanny and kindergarten later on .
it was a typical morning kindergarten , which closed at noon .
the current discussion about nursery schools always reminds me of that time . what must change for german mothers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen has seven children germany 's educational system and the kindergarten system still rely strongly on the involvement of mothers .
mothers are seen as auxiliary educators .
people always gave you nasty looks when you turned up at a summer party with a cake from the store .
later on , mothers worked for free by doing homework with their children .
mothers are completely taken in but their work is simultaneously devalued because it is n't visible .
that has to change .
until now , everything mothers do is privatized and that can only change by making it public .
the discussion that 's been started by german family minister ursula von der leyen makes this problem visible for the public . pia volk interviewed leonie herwartz-emden send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parents to get more daycare options germany hopes to catch up with other european countries with progressive childcare policies by providing more nursery school places in a bid to encourage mothers to work and reverse a declining birthrate .

germany is currently engaged in a heated debate over the creation of additional nursery schools .

german interior minister wolfgang schäuble has expressed concern that the danger of terrorist attacks against germany could have risen as a result of the country 's involvement in afghanistan . " we are part of the global threat by islamist terrorism , " schäuble told die welt am sonntag newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble the interior minister referred to the abduction in baghdad in early february of a german woman and her german-iraqi son days after a second ultimatum by the hostage-takers had run out .
" we are concerned that terrorists are attacking our involvement in afghanistan with the abduction of two germans in iraq , " schäuble said .
the hostage takers have twice set deadlines for germany to withdraw its 3,000 troops from afghanistan , posting videos on the internet of 61-year-old hannelore krause kadhim begging for help with her 20-year-old son sinana at her side .
schäuble said attacks on germany could follow .
" the danger level is high , " he said .
mixed feelings about mission german officials in a foreign ministry crisis team working to release the hostages have said they have not given up hope , but are " greatly concerned . "
according to recent opinion polls , the german public remains broadly behind the country 's reconstruction mission in relatively peaceful northern afghanistan , but there is strong opposition to the deployment this month of six reconnaissance jets to assist nato forces fighting the taliban in the south . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europol seeks broader mandate amid growing terror threat eu police arrested over 700 terror suspects last year , according to a report released tuesday .

the environmental group accuses the world bank and international loggers , including germans , of exacerbating the problem . the report , titled " carving up the congo , " claims over 15 million hectares -lrb- 37 million acres -rrb- of rain forest have been granted to international logging companies in 107 new contracts over the last five years , despite a 2002 government moratorium on such activity . " our findings expose serious lapses of governance , a massive lack of institutional capacity to control the forestry sector , widespread illegalities and social conflicts , as well as clashes with established conservation initiatives , " greenpeace says . the report accuses international logging companies of " causing social chaos and wreaking environmental havoc " in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . it details how timber worth thousands of dollars - african teak , for example , is worth some 6,000 euros per tree on european markets - is traded for cheap gifts and oft-unmet promises to local communities . the report documents several such gifts , including a motor bike for a chieftain , bags of salt and crates of beer for villagers , and pledges to build schools and hospitals . " these promises are rarely fulfilled and there are reports that intimidation tactics are used against people who try to protest , " greenpeace said , citing a lawsuit from siforco against the civil society of bumba , which complained of a " lack of respect " from the logging company and now stands trial on charges of defamation . german company siforco is one of those european firms that has been singled out for unscrupulous behaviour , along with other international logging companies , such as itb , cft , forabola , sodefor , soforma , olam , sicobois and trans-m . the biggest logging operator in the drc , siforco has roundly defended its record in congo .
but stefan van traet , greenpeace 's africa forest campaign co-ordinator , said it employs bullying tactics symptomatic of the congolese logging industry . " there is a court case from siforco against 29 persons of the civil society of bumba who complained of the lack of respect for the local communities by the logging company , " he told dw-radio .

by 2006 , it had approved credits totaling more than $ 4 billion , giving the international institution considerable leverage over political and economic developments there . following a world bank investigation of tax records in 2002 , the transitional drc government cancelled 163 illegal logging contracts covering nearly half of the country 's rain forests , and imposed a moratorium on all logging activity .
but by 2006 , members of the government had signed 107 new contracts covering more than a quarter of the country 's rain forests , according to the greenpeace report . the world bank is now conducting a legal review of titles to verify the validity of these new contracts .
but greenpeace fears that " the legal review could become an exercise in laundering illegal contracts . " the world bank faces a difficult balancing act between environmental preservation and social justice on the one hand , and economic development on the other .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.04.2007 berlin exhibition explores art and science of pain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pain comes in many forms at berlin 's medical historical museum a new exhibition in berlin aims to explore the many facets of human pain .
the challenge lies in demonstrating a subject that is neither tangible nor visible .
curators in berlin designed “ pain ” as a twofold experience . at the entrance to the hanburger bahnhof , a former train station that houses berlin ’ s national gallery of contemporary art , the first exhibit that catches the eye is a subtle hint of things to come .
enclosed in a showcase is a simple piece of wood , about one meter in length and tightly wrapped in a thick leather hide .
up until the 19th century , it was a staple piece of medical equipment : in the absence of effective anesthetics , countless people dug their teeth into this contraption to avoid biting their own tongue off during painful surgical procedures .
more than a relic of medical history , this inanimate object - full of bite marks - is capable of invoking harrowing images in the mind ’ s eye : images of a situation so painful , you can almost feel it .
indeed , that has been the central challenge for this new exhibition called " schmerz " -lrb- " pain " -rrb- : how to convey the sensation of pain , without actually inflicting it ?
bildunterschrift : berlin 's museum for contemporary art a twofold approach for hamburger bahnhof curator eugen blume , the solution lies in the mingling of art and science .
" the juxtaposition of scientific and artistic works in this joint exhibition is meant to blur the lines between these two areas , " he said .
this idea finds its most obvious expression in the fact that " schmerz " is a joint exhibition involving the hamburger bahnhof museum of contemporary art and the medical history museum of berlin 's charité teaching hospital .
the hamburger bahnhof explores the subjective experience of physical and psychological suffering from an artistic point of view .
divided into two distinct sections , " perceptions of pain " examines the way in which humans cope with the suffering of others , while " allure of pain " delves into individual ways of coping with pain - including the sexual pleasure that some derive from it .
just across the street , the charité museum presents a scientific examination of pain .
" time of pain " takes a historical view of human suffering and its perception , while " expression of pain " takes a look at how we communicate painful experiences to the outside world through the written word , art and music .
both houses are connected by a " path of suffering " : about 400 meters in length , this footpath itself contains 30 exhibits on human suffering .
taken as a whole , the exhibition aims to " walk the line between science and art , " as the preview states , through " combinations and confrontations of artistic works , medical , folkloristic , religious and daily objects . "
by dividing it up among the two museums , the exhibition also " accommodates the traditional expectations and viewing habits associated with both museums . "
the passion of christ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crucifixion of christ : the ultimate symbol of pain religious artifacts are an important part of the exhibition .
in what is perhaps the western world ’ s most vivid image of human suffering , the passion of jesus christ is in the foreground of these religious exhibits .
but always mixing the religious with the scientific , several exhibits also recall the experiments of frederick t. zugibes , an american doctor who in the late 1940s hung his assistants by the cross in order to measure the precise pains incurred by crucifixion .
there are also other , more obscure objects to be found , such as a 19th-century " medicinal magnetic cross of saint benedict " : at a time when people were unsure whether science or religion had the greater curative power , they simply combined the two into one device .

more than a relic of medical history , this inanimate object - full of bite marks - is capable of invoking harrowing images in the mind ’ s eye : images of a situation so painful , you can almost feel it .
indeed , that has been the central challenge for this new exhibition called " schmerz " -lrb- " pain " -rrb- : how to convey the sensation of pain , without actually inflicting it ?
bildunterschrift : berlin 's museum for contemporary art a twofold approach for hamburger bahnhof curator eugen blume , the solution lies in the mingling of art and science .
" the juxtaposition of scientific and artistic works in this joint exhibition is meant to blur the lines between these two areas , " he said .
this idea finds its most obvious expression in the fact that " schmerz " is a joint exhibition involving the hamburger bahnhof museum of contemporary art and the medical history museum of berlin 's charité teaching hospital .
the hamburger bahnhof explores the subjective experience of physical and psychological suffering from an artistic point of view .
divided into two distinct sections , " perceptions of pain " examines the way in which humans cope with the suffering of others , while " allure of pain " delves into individual ways of coping with pain - including the sexual pleasure that some derive from it .
just across the street , the charité museum presents a scientific examination of pain .
" time of pain " takes a historical view of human suffering and its perception , while " expression of pain " takes a look at how we communicate painful experiences to the outside world through the written word , art and music .
both houses are connected by a " path of suffering " : about 400 meters in length , this footpath itself contains 30 exhibits on human suffering .
taken as a whole , the exhibition aims to " walk the line between science and art , " as the preview states , through " combinations and confrontations of artistic works , medical , folkloristic , religious and daily objects . "
by dividing it up among the two museums , the exhibition also " accommodates the traditional expectations and viewing habits associated with both museums . "
the passion of christ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crucifixion of christ : the ultimate symbol of pain religious artifacts are an important part of the exhibition .
in what is perhaps the western world ’ s most vivid image of human suffering , the passion of jesus christ is in the foreground of these religious exhibits .
but always mixing the religious with the scientific , several exhibits also recall the experiments of frederick t. zugibes , an american doctor who in the late 1940s hung his assistants by the cross in order to measure the precise pains incurred by crucifixion .
there are also other , more obscure objects to be found , such as a 19th-century " medicinal magnetic cross of saint benedict " : at a time when people were unsure whether science or religion had the greater curative power , they simply combined the two into one device .

in what is perhaps the western world ’ s most vivid image of human suffering , the passion of jesus christ is in the foreground of these religious exhibits .
but always mixing the religious with the scientific , several exhibits also recall the experiments of frederick t. zugibes , an american doctor who in the late 1940s hung his assistants by the cross in order to measure the precise pains incurred by crucifixion .
there are also other , more obscure objects to be found , such as a 19th-century " medicinal magnetic cross of saint benedict " : at a time when people were unsure whether science or religion had the greater curative power , they simply combined the two into one device .
and in the charité museum , visitors are invited to examine tumor-ridden brains preserved in formaldehyde , skeletons with crooked vertebrae or skulls full of rotten teeth .
stomach ulcers , liver cirrhosis and deformed embryos are all part of this exploration of pain .
suited for all ages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " schmerz " explores pain through art , science and religion but the exhibition avoids the controversial and the confrontational , and examines pain in a way that is easily digestible .
hardly any of the exhibits approach contemporary topics such as torture , war , terrorism or genocide .
" schmerz " is a g-rated exhibition , suitable for all ages - a conscious decision , charité museum co-curator daniel tyradellis told spiegel online .
the hamburger bahnhof and the charité museum relied on their own berlin-based collections for this exhibition , rather than importing pieces from all around the world , as is often the case .
" schmerz " showcases artists ranging from marina abramovic , francis bacon and joseph beuys to louise bourgeois , bruce nauman and sam taylor-wood , among others .
" schmerz " runs from april 5 through aug .

" turkey is secular , it will remain secular , " " the presidency 's roads are closed to sharia -lrb- islamic law -rrb- , " " an imam can not become a president , " they chanted , reflecting concerns that erdogan and his justice and devlopment party -lrb- akp -rrb- are not truly committed to the mainly muslim nation 's secular system . erdogan has yet to say whether or not he will run for the presidency when the akp-dominated parliament elects a successor to the staunchly secularist ahmet necdet sezer next month . the akp has pledged commitment to secularism and carried out a series of democracy reforms to boost turkey 's bid to join the european union .

it 's early in the morning , and there 's still a light fog . mustafa was n't the first to arrive at the crossroads - there are several small groups of africans silently waiting for work . " there are people here from gambia , guinea , and mali , " mustafa said . " we come here every morning . " el ejido , with a population of 75,000 and no tourist attractions , is in the middle of one of the world 's biggest vegetable growing regions and is surrounded by a sea of glasshouses filled with tomatoes , paprika , and lettuce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is one of the eu 's biggest vegetable producers with an annual production of 1.5 million tons of vegetables , there is enough work here .
yet mustafa and the others often have to wait for hours for one reason - they 're illegal . " everyone standing here is without papers , " mustafa said . long wait for illegals " sometimes we wait here for up to five hours , " he said .
" at two in the afternoon we go to get something to eat , and then we come back again at three . " the group do n't like journalists because no farmer is likely stop if a microphone is being waved about .
there are large fines for those who employ immigrants without papers .
but the africans still hope that a pick-up will pull up and load them in the back .
even if mustafa does n't find work today , he will come back tomorrow , as he has done for the past eight months . mustafa does n't plan on staying much longer in el ejido though .
he wants to go north to valencia or barcelona - or perhaps even france or germany . " i do n't have a place to live , " he said .
" i sleep in a garage on a construction site , on the street . " but people are nice to him , he said - even the police . tough living conditions the chances of mustafa ever getting a work permit are n't good .
that means it 's virtually impossible for him - like thousands of others in the same situation - to rent an apartment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting a legal permit is just a dream for many immigrants that 's why many of the illegals live in miserable conditions in abandoned houses dotted around the region . in the nearby town of nijar , in a place called casa vieja -lrb- old house -rrb- , about 50 young moroccans live in a fallen-down farmhouse .
halib has been squatting here for nearly eight months .
the 22-year-old has managed to acquire a mattress , some cardboard boxes and a couple of meters of plastic sheeting .
he might now have a roof over his head , but he does n't have the luxury of water or electricity . it takes halib an hour walk to where he works in a glasshouse . " the work is difficult , " he said .
" it 's very hot , and for eight hours , they pay me 31 euros -lrb- $ 42 -rrb- .
life is bad . " being illegal leaves many of the workers vulnerable to exploitation .
abdelkader cacha , a right 's campaigns at the agricultural workers union , soc , said there is no protection for workers . " they do n't have masks or any protective clothing , " he said .
" and those who ask for them , get kicked out .

" seriously , i expected more from germany " , which currently holds the six-month rotating presidency of the eu , he told german magazine der spiegel . he was speaking ahead of a visit to germany on sunday , where he is due to open the hanover industrial fair alongside chancellor angela merkel . erdogan also explicitly reproached germany for his lack of invitation to the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the treaty of rome in berlin three weeks ago . that was a " grave error , " the turkish prime minister said , adding that it had " overshadowed the german presidency . clear timeline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and erdogan are unlikely to get too cozy on sunday " we would like a clear idea of a date , a roadmap , a calendar for negotiations " to show the eu was serious about turkey joining its ranks , he told the magazine .
he proposed 2014 or 2015 as a possible date for membership . but if the eu " does n't want us , it should say so clearly now , " he said .
" if we are not wanted , the two sides need not continue wasting their time in talks . " merkel against membership merkel is personally and politically , through her christian democratic union party , against turkish membership of the eu .
instead she would prefer to see the secular islamic nation become a " privileged partner " of the 27-member bloc . public opinion in germany , the eu 's most populous country which has 2.5 million turkish residents , is generally against turkish membership . however , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , supports full membership .

" turkey is secular , it will remain secular , " " the presidency 's roads are closed to sharia -lrb- islamic law -rrb- , " " an imam can not become a president , " they chanted , reflecting concerns that erdogan and his justice and devlopment party -lrb- akp -rrb- are not truly committed to the mainly muslim nation 's secular system . erdogan has yet to say whether or not he will run for the presidency when the akp-dominated parliament elects a successor to the staunchly secularist ahmet necdet sezer next month . the akp has pledged commitment to secularism and carried out a series of democracy reforms to boost turkey 's bid to join the european union .

german interior minister wolfgang schäuble has expressed concern that the danger of terrorist attacks against germany could have risen as a result of the country 's involvement in afghanistan . " we are part of the global threat by islamist terrorism , " schäuble told die welt am sonntag newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble the interior minister referred to the abduction in baghdad in early february of a german woman and her german-iraqi son days after a second ultimatum by the hostage-takers had run out .
" we are concerned that terrorists are attacking our involvement in afghanistan with the abduction of two germans in iraq , " schäuble said .
the hostage takers have twice set deadlines for germany to withdraw its 3,000 troops from afghanistan , posting videos on the internet of 61-year-old hannelore krause kadhim begging for help with her 20-year-old son sinana at her side .
schäuble said attacks on germany could follow .
" the danger level is high , " he said .
mixed feelings about mission german officials in a foreign ministry crisis team working to release the hostages have said they have not given up hope , but are " greatly concerned . "
according to recent opinion polls , the german public remains broadly behind the country 's reconstruction mission in relatively peaceful northern afghanistan , but there is strong opposition to the deployment this month of six reconnaissance jets to assist nato forces fighting the taliban in the south . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europol seeks broader mandate amid growing terror threat eu police arrested over 700 terror suspects last year , according to a report released tuesday .
half of the arrests involved islamist extremism - the most dangerous variety of terrorism , the report says .

" seriously , i expected more from germany " , which currently holds the six-month rotating presidency of the eu , he told german magazine der spiegel . he was speaking ahead of a visit to germany on sunday , where he is due to open the hanover industrial fair alongside chancellor angela merkel . erdogan also explicitly reproached germany for his lack of invitation to the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the treaty of rome in berlin three weeks ago . that was a " grave error , " the turkish prime minister said , adding that it had " overshadowed the german presidency . clear timeline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and erdogan are unlikely to get too cozy on sunday " we would like a clear idea of a date , a roadmap , a calendar for negotiations " to show the eu was serious about turkey joining its ranks , he told the magazine .
he proposed 2014 or 2015 as a possible date for membership . but if the eu " does n't want us , it should say so clearly now , " he said .
" if we are not wanted , the two sides need not continue wasting their time in talks . " merkel against membership merkel is personally and politically , through her christian democratic union party , against turkish membership of the eu .
instead she would prefer to see the secular islamic nation become a " privileged partner " of the 27-member bloc . public opinion in germany , the eu 's most populous country which has 2.5 million turkish residents , is generally against turkish membership . however , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , supports full membership . " if we really trust turkey , that will improve security and stability in europe , " he told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung regional newspaper . turks against erdogan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-erdogan demonstrators in front of the atatürk mausoleum on saturday chanting secularist slogans and waving turkish flags , more than 300,000 people from all over turkey meanwhile rallied in the turkish capital ankara on saturday to discourage erdogan , a conservative with an islamist political past , from running for the presidency . the demonstrators marched to the mausoleum of mustafa kemal ataturk , the founder of modern secular turkey in 1923 , transforming the normally hushed venue into an unprecedented demonstration ground . " turkey is secular , it will remain secular , " " the presidency 's roads are closed to sharia -lrb- islamic law -rrb- , " " an imam can not become a president , " they chanted , reflecting concerns that erdogan and his justice and devlopment party -lrb- akp -rrb- are not truly committed to the mainly muslim nation 's secular system . erdogan has yet to say whether or not he will run for the presidency when the akp-dominated parliament elects a successor to the staunchly secularist ahmet necdet sezer next month . the akp has pledged commitment to secularism and carried out a series of democracy reforms to boost turkey 's bid to join the european union .
yet , the secular establishment , including the powerful army , remains sceptical of erdogan 's avowed rejection of his radical islamist past . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges restraint over turkish talk of kurdish crackdown the european commission urged turkey on friday to play a " constructive " role in iraq a day after turkey 's army chief called for a military incursion into northern iraq to hunt turkish kurd rebels .

the 27-year-old senegalese is standing on a crossroad at the edge of the city el ejido .
it 's early in the morning , and there 's still a light fog . mustafa was n't the first to arrive at the crossroads - there are several small groups of africans silently waiting for work . " there are people here from gambia , guinea , and mali , " mustafa said . " we come here every morning .

the challenge lies in demonstrating a subject that is neither tangible nor visible .
curators in berlin designed “ pain ” as a twofold experience . at the entrance to the hanburger bahnhof , a former train station that houses berlin ’ s national gallery of contemporary art , the first exhibit that catches the eye is a subtle hint of things to come .
enclosed in a showcase is a simple piece of wood , about one meter in length and tightly wrapped in a thick leather hide .
up until the 19th century , it was a staple piece of medical equipment : in the absence of effective anesthetics , countless people dug their teeth into this contraption to avoid biting their own tongue off during painful surgical procedures .
more than a relic of medical history , this inanimate object - full of bite marks - is capable of invoking harrowing images in the mind ’ s eye : images of a situation so painful , you can almost feel it .
indeed , that has been the central challenge for this new exhibition called " schmerz " -lrb- " pain " -rrb- : how to convey the sensation of pain , without actually inflicting it ?
bildunterschrift : berlin 's museum for contemporary art a twofold approach for hamburger bahnhof curator eugen blume , the solution lies in the mingling of art and science .
" the juxtaposition of scientific and artistic works in this joint exhibition is meant to blur the lines between these two areas , " he said .
this idea finds its most obvious expression in the fact that " schmerz " is a joint exhibition involving the hamburger bahnhof museum of contemporary art and the medical history museum of berlin 's charité teaching hospital .
the hamburger bahnhof explores the subjective experience of physical and psychological suffering from an artistic point of view .
divided into two distinct sections , " perceptions of pain " examines the way in which humans cope with the suffering of others , while " allure of pain " delves into individual ways of coping with pain - including the sexual pleasure that some derive from it .
just across the street , the charité museum presents a scientific examination of pain .
" time of pain " takes a historical view of human suffering and its perception , while " expression of pain " takes a look at how we communicate painful experiences to the outside world through the written word , art and music .
both houses are connected by a " path of suffering " : about 400 meters in length , this footpath itself contains 30 exhibits on human suffering .
taken as a whole , the exhibition aims to " walk the line between science and art , " as the preview states , through " combinations and confrontations of artistic works , medical , folkloristic , religious and daily objects . "
by dividing it up among the two museums , the exhibition also " accommodates the traditional expectations and viewing habits associated with both museums . "
the passion of christ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crucifixion of christ : the ultimate symbol of pain religious artifacts are an important part of the exhibition .
in what is perhaps the western world ’ s most vivid image of human suffering , the passion of jesus christ is in the foreground of these religious exhibits .
but always mixing the religious with the scientific , several exhibits also recall the experiments of frederick t. zugibes , an american doctor who in the late 1940s hung his assistants by the cross in order to measure the precise pains incurred by crucifixion .
there are also other , more obscure objects to be found , such as a 19th-century " medicinal magnetic cross of saint benedict " : at a time when people were unsure whether science or religion had the greater curative power , they simply combined the two into one device .
and in the charité museum , visitors are invited to examine tumor-ridden brains preserved in formaldehyde , skeletons with crooked vertebrae or skulls full of rotten teeth .
stomach ulcers , liver cirrhosis and deformed embryos are all part of this exploration of pain .
suited for all ages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " schmerz " explores pain through art , science and religion but the exhibition avoids the controversial and the confrontational , and examines pain in a way that is easily digestible .
hardly any of the exhibits approach contemporary topics such as torture , war , terrorism or genocide .
" schmerz " is a g-rated exhibition , suitable for all ages - a conscious decision , charité museum co-curator daniel tyradellis told spiegel online .
the hamburger bahnhof and the charité museum relied on their own berlin-based collections for this exhibition , rather than importing pieces from all around the world , as is often the case .
" schmerz " showcases artists ranging from marina abramovic , francis bacon and joseph beuys to louise bourgeois , bruce nauman and sam taylor-wood , among others .

the challenge lies in demonstrating a subject that is neither tangible nor visible .
curators in berlin designed “ pain ” as a twofold experience . at the entrance to the hanburger bahnhof , a former train station that houses berlin ’ s national gallery of contemporary art , the first exhibit that catches the eye is a subtle hint of things to come .
enclosed in a showcase is a simple piece of wood , about one meter in length and tightly wrapped in a thick leather hide .
up until the 19th century , it was a staple piece of medical equipment : in the absence of effective anesthetics , countless people dug their teeth into this contraption to avoid biting their own tongue off during painful surgical procedures .
more than a relic of medical history , this inanimate object - full of bite marks - is capable of invoking harrowing images in the mind ’ s eye : images of a situation so painful , you can almost feel it .
indeed , that has been the central challenge for this new exhibition called " schmerz " -lrb- " pain " -rrb- : how to convey the sensation of pain , without actually inflicting it ?
bildunterschrift : berlin 's museum for contemporary art a twofold approach for hamburger bahnhof curator eugen blume , the solution lies in the mingling of art and science .
" the juxtaposition of scientific and artistic works in this joint exhibition is meant to blur the lines between these two areas , " he said .
this idea finds its most obvious expression in the fact that " schmerz " is a joint exhibition involving the hamburger bahnhof museum of contemporary art and the medical history museum of berlin 's charité teaching hospital .
the hamburger bahnhof explores the subjective experience of physical and psychological suffering from an artistic point of view .
divided into two distinct sections , " perceptions of pain " examines the way in which humans cope with the suffering of others , while " allure of pain " delves into individual ways of coping with pain - including the sexual pleasure that some derive from it .
just across the street , the charité museum presents a scientific examination of pain .
" time of pain " takes a historical view of human suffering and its perception , while " expression of pain " takes a look at how we communicate painful experiences to the outside world through the written word , art and music .
both houses are connected by a " path of suffering " : about 400 meters in length , this footpath itself contains 30 exhibits on human suffering .
taken as a whole , the exhibition aims to " walk the line between science and art , " as the preview states , through " combinations and confrontations of artistic works , medical , folkloristic , religious and daily objects . "
by dividing it up among the two museums , the exhibition also " accommodates the traditional expectations and viewing habits associated with both museums . "
the passion of christ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crucifixion of christ : the ultimate symbol of pain religious artifacts are an important part of the exhibition .
in what is perhaps the western world ’ s most vivid image of human suffering , the passion of jesus christ is in the foreground of these religious exhibits .
but always mixing the religious with the scientific , several exhibits also recall the experiments of frederick t. zugibes , an american doctor who in the late 1940s hung his assistants by the cross in order to measure the precise pains incurred by crucifixion .
there are also other , more obscure objects to be found , such as a 19th-century " medicinal magnetic cross of saint benedict " : at a time when people were unsure whether science or religion had the greater curative power , they simply combined the two into one device .
and in the charité museum , visitors are invited to examine tumor-ridden brains preserved in formaldehyde , skeletons with crooked vertebrae or skulls full of rotten teeth .
stomach ulcers , liver cirrhosis and deformed embryos are all part of this exploration of pain .
suited for all ages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " schmerz " explores pain through art , science and religion but the exhibition avoids the controversial and the confrontational , and examines pain in a way that is easily digestible .
hardly any of the exhibits approach contemporary topics such as torture , war , terrorism or genocide .
" schmerz " is a g-rated exhibition , suitable for all ages - a conscious decision , charité museum co-curator daniel tyradellis told spiegel online .
the hamburger bahnhof and the charité museum relied on their own berlin-based collections for this exhibition , rather than importing pieces from all around the world , as is often the case .
" schmerz " showcases artists ranging from marina abramovic , francis bacon and joseph beuys to louise bourgeois , bruce nauman and sam taylor-wood , among others .

the environmental group accuses the world bank and international loggers , including germans , of exacerbating the problem . the report , titled " carving up the congo , " claims over 15 million hectares -lrb- 37 million acres -rrb- of rain forest have been granted to international logging companies in 107 new contracts over the last five years , despite a 2002 government moratorium on such activity . " our findings expose serious lapses of governance , a massive lack of institutional capacity to control the forestry sector , widespread illegalities and social conflicts , as well as clashes with established conservation initiatives , " greenpeace says . the report accuses international logging companies of " causing social chaos and wreaking environmental havoc " in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . it details how timber worth thousands of dollars - african teak , for example , is worth some 6,000 euros per tree on european markets - is traded for cheap gifts and oft-unmet promises to local communities . the report documents several such gifts , including a motor bike for a chieftain , bags of salt and crates of beer for villagers , and pledges to build schools and hospitals . " these promises are rarely fulfilled and there are reports that intimidation tactics are used against people who try to protest , " greenpeace said , citing a lawsuit from siforco against the civil society of bumba , which complained of a " lack of respect " from the logging company and now stands trial on charges of defamation . german company siforco is one of those european firms that has been singled out for unscrupulous behaviour , along with other international logging companies , such as itb , cft , forabola , sodefor , soforma , olam , sicobois and trans-m . the biggest logging operator in the drc , siforco has roundly defended its record in congo .
but stefan van traet , greenpeace 's africa forest campaign co-ordinator , said it employs bullying tactics symptomatic of the congolese logging industry . " there is a court case from siforco against 29 persons of the civil society of bumba who complained of the lack of respect for the local communities by the logging company , " he told dw-radio .
" and the logging company said it 's defamation , because they signed a petition that was handed out to the local authorities . so you can see there is a kind of intimidation when local groups question the behavior of logging companies . " consequences for the congo and beyond bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logging threatens gorillas like this one , says greenpeace greenpeace estimates that tropical deforestation alone contributes up to 25 percent of the world 's human-induced carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions .
the report says that logging in the congo - which boasts the world 's second-largest primal rain forest after the amazon - will release up to 34.4 billion tons of co2 by 2050 , or roughly the same as the united kingdom 's emissions over the past 60 years . furthermore , of the 60 million people living in the democratic republic of congo , greenpeace believes 40 million are dependent on the rain forests for food , medicine , energy , building materials and other non-timber products essential to their subsistence . the group says deforestation further threatens protected indigenous ape species , including gorillas , chimpanzees and bonobos . world bank under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under fire : world bank president paul wolfowitz greenpeace has also accused the world bank of failing to enforce the 2002 moratorium on logging in the congolese republic .
" in a context of corruption and poor governance in the drc , the world bank 's attempts to reform the forestry sector are currently failing to control the expansion of logging , " wednesday 's report found . after a decade of war in the congo , the world bank resumed lending to the drc in 2001 .
by 2006 , it had approved credits totaling more than $ 4 billion , giving the international institution considerable leverage over political and economic developments there . following a world bank investigation of tax records in 2002 , the transitional drc government cancelled 163 illegal logging contracts covering nearly half of the country 's rain forests , and imposed a moratorium on all logging activity .
but by 2006 , members of the government had signed 107 new contracts covering more than a quarter of the country 's rain forests , according to the greenpeace report . the world bank is now conducting a legal review of titles to verify the validity of these new contracts .
but greenpeace fears that " the legal review could become an exercise in laundering illegal contracts . " the world bank faces a difficult balancing act between environmental preservation and social justice on the one hand , and economic development on the other .

" our findings expose serious lapses of governance , a massive lack of institutional capacity to control the forestry sector , widespread illegalities and social conflicts , as well as clashes with established conservation initiatives , " greenpeace says . the report accuses international logging companies of " causing social chaos and wreaking environmental havoc " in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . it details how timber worth thousands of dollars - african teak , for example , is worth some 6,000 euros per tree on european markets - is traded for cheap gifts and oft-unmet promises to local communities . the report documents several such gifts , including a motor bike for a chieftain , bags of salt and crates of beer for villagers , and pledges to build schools and hospitals . " these promises are rarely fulfilled and there are reports that intimidation tactics are used against people who try to protest , " greenpeace said , citing a lawsuit from siforco against the civil society of bumba , which complained of a " lack of respect " from the logging company and now stands trial on charges of defamation . german company siforco is one of those european firms that has been singled out for unscrupulous behaviour , along with other international logging companies , such as itb , cft , forabola , sodefor , soforma , olam , sicobois and trans-m . the biggest logging operator in the drc , siforco has roundly defended its record in congo .
but stefan van traet , greenpeace 's africa forest campaign co-ordinator , said it employs bullying tactics symptomatic of the congolese logging industry . " there is a court case from siforco against 29 persons of the civil society of bumba who complained of the lack of respect for the local communities by the logging company , " he told dw-radio .
" and the logging company said it 's defamation , because they signed a petition that was handed out to the local authorities . so you can see there is a kind of intimidation when local groups question the behavior of logging companies . " consequences for the congo and beyond bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logging threatens gorillas like this one , says greenpeace greenpeace estimates that tropical deforestation alone contributes up to 25 percent of the world 's human-induced carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions .
the report says that logging in the congo - which boasts the world 's second-largest primal rain forest after the amazon - will release up to 34.4 billion tons of co2 by 2050 , or roughly the same as the united kingdom 's emissions over the past 60 years . furthermore , of the 60 million people living in the democratic republic of congo , greenpeace believes 40 million are dependent on the rain forests for food , medicine , energy , building materials and other non-timber products essential to their subsistence . the group says deforestation further threatens protected indigenous ape species , including gorillas , chimpanzees and bonobos . world bank under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under fire : world bank president paul wolfowitz greenpeace has also accused the world bank of failing to enforce the 2002 moratorium on logging in the congolese republic .
" in a context of corruption and poor governance in the drc , the world bank 's attempts to reform the forestry sector are currently failing to control the expansion of logging , " wednesday 's report found . after a decade of war in the congo , the world bank resumed lending to the drc in 2001 .
by 2006 , it had approved credits totaling more than $ 4 billion , giving the international institution considerable leverage over political and economic developments there . following a world bank investigation of tax records in 2002 , the transitional drc government cancelled 163 illegal logging contracts covering nearly half of the country 's rain forests , and imposed a moratorium on all logging activity .
but by 2006 , members of the government had signed 107 new contracts covering more than a quarter of the country 's rain forests , according to the greenpeace report . the world bank is now conducting a legal review of titles to verify the validity of these new contracts .
but greenpeace fears that " the legal review could become an exercise in laundering illegal contracts . " the world bank faces a difficult balancing act between environmental preservation and social justice on the one hand , and economic development on the other .

the hostage takers have twice set deadlines for germany to withdraw its 3,000 troops from afghanistan , posting videos on the internet of 61-year-old hannelore krause kadhim begging for help with her 20-year-old son sinana at her side .
schäuble said attacks on germany could follow .

the environmental group accuses the world bank and international loggers , including germans , of exacerbating the problem . the report , titled " carving up the congo , " claims over 15 million hectares -lrb- 37 million acres -rrb- of rain forest have been granted to international logging companies in 107 new contracts over the last five years , despite a 2002 government moratorium on such activity . " our findings expose serious lapses of governance , a massive lack of institutional capacity to control the forestry sector , widespread illegalities and social conflicts , as well as clashes with established conservation initiatives , " greenpeace says . the report accuses international logging companies of " causing social chaos and wreaking environmental havoc " in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . it details how timber worth thousands of dollars - african teak , for example , is worth some 6,000 euros per tree on european markets - is traded for cheap gifts and oft-unmet promises to local communities . the report documents several such gifts , including a motor bike for a chieftain , bags of salt and crates of beer for villagers , and pledges to build schools and hospitals . " these promises are rarely fulfilled and there are reports that intimidation tactics are used against people who try to protest , " greenpeace said , citing a lawsuit from siforco against the civil society of bumba , which complained of a " lack of respect " from the logging company and now stands trial on charges of defamation . german company siforco is one of those european firms that has been singled out for unscrupulous behaviour , along with other international logging companies , such as itb , cft , forabola , sodefor , soforma , olam , sicobois and trans-m . the biggest logging operator in the drc , siforco has roundly defended its record in congo .
but stefan van traet , greenpeace 's africa forest campaign co-ordinator , said it employs bullying tactics symptomatic of the congolese logging industry . " there is a court case from siforco against 29 persons of the civil society of bumba who complained of the lack of respect for the local communities by the logging company , " he told dw-radio .
" and the logging company said it 's defamation , because they signed a petition that was handed out to the local authorities . so you can see there is a kind of intimidation when local groups question the behavior of logging companies . " consequences for the congo and beyond bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logging threatens gorillas like this one , says greenpeace greenpeace estimates that tropical deforestation alone contributes up to 25 percent of the world 's human-induced carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions .
the report says that logging in the congo - which boasts the world 's second-largest primal rain forest after the amazon - will release up to 34.4 billion tons of co2 by 2050 , or roughly the same as the united kingdom 's emissions over the past 60 years . furthermore , of the 60 million people living in the democratic republic of congo , greenpeace believes 40 million are dependent on the rain forests for food , medicine , energy , building materials and other non-timber products essential to their subsistence . the group says deforestation further threatens protected indigenous ape species , including gorillas , chimpanzees and bonobos . world bank under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under fire : world bank president paul wolfowitz greenpeace has also accused the world bank of failing to enforce the 2002 moratorium on logging in the congolese republic .
" in a context of corruption and poor governance in the drc , the world bank 's attempts to reform the forestry sector are currently failing to control the expansion of logging , " wednesday 's report found . after a decade of war in the congo , the world bank resumed lending to the drc in 2001 .
by 2006 , it had approved credits totaling more than $ 4 billion , giving the international institution considerable leverage over political and economic developments there . following a world bank investigation of tax records in 2002 , the transitional drc government cancelled 163 illegal logging contracts covering nearly half of the country 's rain forests , and imposed a moratorium on all logging activity .
but by 2006 , members of the government had signed 107 new contracts covering more than a quarter of the country 's rain forests , according to the greenpeace report . the world bank is now conducting a legal review of titles to verify the validity of these new contracts .
but greenpeace fears that " the legal review could become an exercise in laundering illegal contracts . " the world bank faces a difficult balancing act between environmental preservation and social justice on the one hand , and economic development on the other .
greenpeace claims the world bank has ignored the " legal vacuum " in the congolese forestry industry in order to promote development . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : eu to double aid to dr congo after democratic elections the eu has been the main donor in funding the november elections in dr congo , and now plans to double reconstruction aid to 400 million euros in order to secure democracy in the aftermath of civil war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 14.04.2007 berlin exhibition explores art and science of pain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pain comes in many forms at berlin 's medical historical museum a new exhibition in berlin aims to explore the many facets of human pain .
the challenge lies in demonstrating a subject that is neither tangible nor visible .
curators in berlin designed “ pain ” as a twofold experience . at the entrance to the hanburger bahnhof , a former train station that houses berlin ’ s national gallery of contemporary art , the first exhibit that catches the eye is a subtle hint of things to come .
enclosed in a showcase is a simple piece of wood , about one meter in length and tightly wrapped in a thick leather hide .
up until the 19th century , it was a staple piece of medical equipment : in the absence of effective anesthetics , countless people dug their teeth into this contraption to avoid biting their own tongue off during painful surgical procedures .
more than a relic of medical history , this inanimate object - full of bite marks - is capable of invoking harrowing images in the mind ’ s eye : images of a situation so painful , you can almost feel it .
indeed , that has been the central challenge for this new exhibition called " schmerz " -lrb- " pain " -rrb- : how to convey the sensation of pain , without actually inflicting it ?
bildunterschrift : berlin 's museum for contemporary art a twofold approach for hamburger bahnhof curator eugen blume , the solution lies in the mingling of art and science .
" the juxtaposition of scientific and artistic works in this joint exhibition is meant to blur the lines between these two areas , " he said .
this idea finds its most obvious expression in the fact that " schmerz " is a joint exhibition involving the hamburger bahnhof museum of contemporary art and the medical history museum of berlin 's charité teaching hospital .
the hamburger bahnhof explores the subjective experience of physical and psychological suffering from an artistic point of view .
divided into two distinct sections , " perceptions of pain " examines the way in which humans cope with the suffering of others , while " allure of pain " delves into individual ways of coping with pain - including the sexual pleasure that some derive from it .
just across the street , the charité museum presents a scientific examination of pain .
" time of pain " takes a historical view of human suffering and its perception , while " expression of pain " takes a look at how we communicate painful experiences to the outside world through the written word , art and music .
both houses are connected by a " path of suffering " : about 400 meters in length , this footpath itself contains 30 exhibits on human suffering .
taken as a whole , the exhibition aims to " walk the line between science and art , " as the preview states , through " combinations and confrontations of artistic works , medical , folkloristic , religious and daily objects . "
by dividing it up among the two museums , the exhibition also " accommodates the traditional expectations and viewing habits associated with both museums . "
the passion of christ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crucifixion of christ : the ultimate symbol of pain religious artifacts are an important part of the exhibition .
in what is perhaps the western world ’ s most vivid image of human suffering , the passion of jesus christ is in the foreground of these religious exhibits .
but always mixing the religious with the scientific , several exhibits also recall the experiments of frederick t. zugibes , an american doctor who in the late 1940s hung his assistants by the cross in order to measure the precise pains incurred by crucifixion .
there are also other , more obscure objects to be found , such as a 19th-century " medicinal magnetic cross of saint benedict " : at a time when people were unsure whether science or religion had the greater curative power , they simply combined the two into one device .
and in the charité museum , visitors are invited to examine tumor-ridden brains preserved in formaldehyde , skeletons with crooked vertebrae or skulls full of rotten teeth .
stomach ulcers , liver cirrhosis and deformed embryos are all part of this exploration of pain .
suited for all ages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " schmerz " explores pain through art , science and religion but the exhibition avoids the controversial and the confrontational , and examines pain in a way that is easily digestible .
hardly any of the exhibits approach contemporary topics such as torture , war , terrorism or genocide .
" schmerz " is a g-rated exhibition , suitable for all ages - a conscious decision , charité museum co-curator daniel tyradellis told spiegel online .
the hamburger bahnhof and the charité museum relied on their own berlin-based collections for this exhibition , rather than importing pieces from all around the world , as is often the case .
" schmerz " showcases artists ranging from marina abramovic , francis bacon and joseph beuys to louise bourgeois , bruce nauman and sam taylor-wood , among others .
" schmerz " runs from april 5 through aug .
5 in the hamburger bahnhof museum of contemporary art and the charité medical historical museum .

a british medical association poll of 964 young gps and hospital doctors found 61 % thought patients would have to pay for some treatment by 2017 .
nearly half of all young doctors also expect to leave the nhs within 10 years , according to the survey .
all three main political parties have ruled out bringing in a form of charging in the short-term .
the doctors questioned were members of the bma 's junior members forum , which amongst its members are the top are doctors of the future as it includes those who have graduated within the last 12 years and students .

various options have been put forward , including asking patients to contribute towards the cost of some minor treatments , such as varicose veins , or excluding them from nhs care altogether .
there has also been suggestions that an nhs tax could be introduced to help pay for the extra demands on the health service .
dr thomson said his members were not expressing a favour for any one option , but he suggested patients may well be ready for a change in the system .
' equal access ' bma policy is still that the nhs should be free at the point of need , although the issue is likely to be discussed at the doctors ' annual conference , which sets policy , later this year .

the incident took place in the tremorfa area of cardiff .
the clip of the chip shop incident was viewed around 4,000 times before it was removed from the video website youtube on friday .
the footage begins with the schoolgirl fighting with the chip shop worker before both of them fall to the ground .
the schoolgirl , who appears to be wearing school uniform from the local willows high school , leaps up and attempts to kick and punch the woman , before the worker walks back into the shop as watching children cheer .
' upset ' youtube , which enables web users to post their own videos , has become one of the internet 's most popular sites .
meanwhile , a girl , 15 , has spoken of her " disgust " after footage of her being attacked was also put on the web .
the teenager was left with bruising to her head and body after her female attacker , sitting astride her , delivered a series of blows .
" i feel upset because everyone is going to know that i am a wimp , " she told the bbc 's radio wales .
