riis made his announcement at a news conference in copenhagen , one day after two former team-mates from germany 's team telekom , erik zabel and rolf aldag , made similar confessions .
danish cyclist riis admitted that he was involved in doping from 1993 until 1998 , including the 1996 season when he won the tour de france .
riis said he used a substance called epo to boost the production of red blood cells in his body , increasing his oxygen-carrying capacity and therefore improving his endurance .
" i have taken banned substances , i have taken epo .
i bought it and took it myself , " riis said , adding that team doctors bore no responsibility for his actions .

even the current sports director at the t-mobile team , rolf aldag , confessed at the same press conference that he had taken epo between 1995 and 2002 .
aldag , who admitted that he lied in the past when denying doping allegation , offered to resign over the scandal .
but t-mobile ’ s team manager bob stapleton says aldag now stands for clean cycling , and that he ’ ll be allowed to keep his job .
“ i think this is an extremely healthy process .

having used him as an impact player from the bench , stuttgart coach armin veh revealed his plans to hit the nuremberg defence with gomez , who has been included in the squad for germany 's euro 2008 qualifiers , from the start .
" there is a strong chance he will play from the outset , " said veh , who will tempt fate by not be wearing his trade-mark lucky grey suit , the one he wore when his side captured their first bundesliga title for 15 years last weekend .
having been hammered 3-0 and 4-1 by nuremberg home and away this season , stuttgart are in the hunt for some sweet revenge in saturday 's dfb cup final at berlin 's olympic stadium .
champs on the end of two thrashings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg have twice routed stuttgart this season stuttgart opened the season with a 3-0 defeat at their gottlieb-daimler-stadium and after the winter break went down 4-1 away at their deadly rivals nuremberg , so are looking to lay a few ghosts on saturday .
this is the first cup final clash between these two particular sides and both clubs have won the cup three times apiece , so it promises to be an emotional afternoon for both teams - especially their goalkeepers .
stuttgart 's shot-stopper timo hildebrand is set to join spanish giants valencia , while nuremberg 's raphael schaefer , in an ironic twist which could add to the drama , is leaving this summer to join ...
stuttgart .
schaefer will no doubt be hoping the game will not be decided on penalties and that his likely back four of dominik reinhardt , andreas wolf , the brazilian glauber and javier horacio pinola give him little to do .
nuremberg smell a cup upset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sides will be hoping for better conditions in the final pinola said after training on thursday that he feels a nuremberg win is in the air and wolf was just as optimistic , saying : " we are very confident of our chances . "
but for nuremberg striker , markus schroth , who wants to give hildebrand the worst possible send off in his last game having spent the last 12 years at stuttgart , the bundesliga is now history .
" the league is over , " he said , " now we are onto something quite special , we play as a tight unit and we 'll know exactly what to do on saturday .

having used him as an impact player from the bench , stuttgart coach armin veh revealed his plans to hit the nuremberg defence with gomez , who has been included in the squad for germany 's euro 2008 qualifiers , from the start .
" there is a strong chance he will play from the outset , " said veh , who will tempt fate by not be wearing his trade-mark lucky grey suit , the one he wore when his side captured their first bundesliga title for 15 years last weekend .
having been hammered 3-0 and 4-1 by nuremberg home and away this season , stuttgart are in the hunt for some sweet revenge in saturday 's dfb cup final at berlin 's olympic stadium .
champs on the end of two thrashings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg have twice routed stuttgart this season stuttgart opened the season with a 3-0 defeat at their gottlieb-daimler-stadium and after the winter break went down 4-1 away at their deadly rivals nuremberg , so are looking to lay a few ghosts on saturday .
this is the first cup final clash between these two particular sides and both clubs have won the cup three times apiece , so it promises to be an emotional afternoon for both teams - especially their goalkeepers .
stuttgart 's shot-stopper timo hildebrand is set to join spanish giants valencia , while nuremberg 's raphael schaefer , in an ironic twist which could add to the drama , is leaving this summer to join ...
stuttgart .
schaefer will no doubt be hoping the game will not be decided on penalties and that his likely back four of dominik reinhardt , andreas wolf , the brazilian glauber and javier horacio pinola give him little to do .
nuremberg smell a cup upset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sides will be hoping for better conditions in the final pinola said after training on thursday that he feels a nuremberg win is in the air and wolf was just as optimistic , saying : " we are very confident of our chances . "
but for nuremberg striker , markus schroth , who wants to give hildebrand the worst possible send off in his last game having spent the last 12 years at stuttgart , the bundesliga is now history .
" the league is over , " he said , " now we are onto something quite special , we play as a tight unit and we 'll know exactly what to do on saturday .

" these cyber attacks have a security dimension without any doubt and that is the reason that nato expertise was sent to estonia to see what can and should be done , " he told a meeting of lawmakers from nato member states held in funchal on the portuguese island of madeira . " does this have a security implication ?
yes , it does have a security implication .
is it relevant for nato ?
yes , it is relevant for nato .
it is a subject which i am afraid will stay on the political agenda in the times to come , " he added . nato nations have sent cyber experts to estonia , one of the 26 members in the military alliance , as has the united states to help it combat the cyber attacks which have jammed mostly government websites . estonia has said that some of the cyber attacks came from russian government computers , including the kremlin .
moscow denies any role . attacks begin after removal of monument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cyber attacks on the high-tech country began after estonian officials removed a statue on april 27 from central tallinn which commemorates soviet troops killed fighting the nazis .
many estonians consider the statue a reminder of five decades of soviet occupation when their country was a soviet republic after world war ii . but the move angered moscow and estonia 's large ethnic russian minority , who see it as an affront to the memory of the fallen soldiers .
the monument is seen by russians , including the sizeable majority that lives in estonia , as a tribute to soviet soldiers who fought fascism in world war ii , while many estonians view it as a painful reminder of 50 years of soviet occupation . relations between the two countries plunged to their lowest ebb since the baltic state regained independence from the soviet union in 1991 .

having used him as an impact player from the bench , stuttgart coach armin veh revealed his plans to hit the nuremberg defence with gomez , who has been included in the squad for germany 's euro 2008 qualifiers , from the start .
" there is a strong chance he will play from the outset , " said veh , who will tempt fate by not be wearing his trade-mark lucky grey suit , the one he wore when his side captured their first bundesliga title for 15 years last weekend .

but with ten minutes to go goalkeeprschaefer brought down gomez in the penalty area , and mexican midfielder pavel pardo drove home his shot to make it 2-2 .
the game went into extra-time and it was kristiansen 's 30 metres shot which gave hildebrand no chance and sealed uremberg 's win .
a win which ends stuttgarts dream of the double and which makes veteran nürnberg coach hans meyer into a true nürnberg legend .

lincoln and halil altintop scored in the first quarter of an hour , fuelling schalke hopes of the championship - a four-goal margin would have earned them their elusive first bundesliga title if stuttgart had drawn against energie cottbus .
schalke , who nevertheless secured second and direct qualification to the champions league , were unable to add to the lead and radim kucera got a stoppage time goal for the visitors . wolfsburg 0 werder bremen 2 werder won but still finished third behind schalke 04 and will enter the champions league third qualifying round - one peg below their second place finish a year ago .
sweden 's markus rosenberg replaced germany striker miroslav klose and scored twice for werder , who dominated the first half of the season before stumbling after the winter break . bayern munich 5 mainz 2 outgoing champions bayern won their second straight but finished a disappointing fourth , 10 points behind stuttgart , and will clean house in the off season .
mainz were relegated after three years the bundesliga .

the game went into extra-time and it was kristiansen 's 30 metres shot which gave hildebrand no chance and sealed uremberg 's win .
a win which ends stuttgarts dream of the double and which makes veteran nürnberg coach hans meyer into a true nürnberg legend .
he is the only coach to have won the former east german cup -lrb- with carl zeiss jena -rrb- and the dfb cup -lrb- with nuremberg -rrb- last bundesliga matchday of 2007 season . stuttgart 2 cottbus 1 stuttgart secured their fifth championship with an eighth straight victory to cap a remarkable finish .
they erased a seven-point deficit and rallied from third place .
after cottbus 's sergiu radu deflected a pass to beat timo hildebrand in the 19th minute , thomas hitzlsperger equalised with a blazing long-range volley and sami khedira scored the winner just past the hour . schalke 2 arminia bielefeld 1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dissapointed supporters of schalke who failed to win their first bundesliga title .
lincoln and halil altintop scored in the first quarter of an hour , fuelling schalke hopes of the championship - a four-goal margin would have earned them their elusive first bundesliga title if stuttgart had drawn against energie cottbus .
schalke , who nevertheless secured second and direct qualification to the champions league , were unable to add to the lead and radim kucera got a stoppage time goal for the visitors . wolfsburg 0 werder bremen 2 werder won but still finished third behind schalke 04 and will enter the champions league third qualifying round - one peg below their second place finish a year ago .
sweden 's markus rosenberg replaced germany striker miroslav klose and scored twice for werder , who dominated the first half of the season before stumbling after the winter break . bayern munich 5 mainz 2 outgoing champions bayern won their second straight but finished a disappointing fourth , 10 points behind stuttgart , and will clean house in the off season .
mainz were relegated after three years the bundesliga .
veteran mehmet scholl scored in his final match for bayern , who also had goals from roque santa cruz , mark van bommel , ali karimi and claudio pizarro .
leverkusen 2 dortmund 1 l everkusen secured fifth place for the second season in succession and a direct berth in the uefa cup .
stefan kiessling got a stoppage-time goal just before the intermission and simon rolfes doubled the lead nine minutes after the break .
ebi smolarek got one in the 79th minute for dortmund , whose four-match winning streak salvaged a poor season ending . m 'gladbach 0 bochum 2 christoph dabrowski and dariusz wosz scored for bochum while moenchengladbach , relegated for the second time since 1999 , went down to a sixth loss in nine matches .
bochum 's greece striker theofanis gekas was crowned league top scorer with 20 goals . frankfurt 1 hertha berlin 2 serbia striker marko pantelic got the winner three minutes from time in a consolation victory for an otherwise disappointing season for hertha , who ended 10th .
kevin-prince boateng put hertha ahead just after the half before albert streit got the equaliser with a free kick that hit the post and bounced past hertha goalkeeper christian fielder . hamburg 4 aachen 0 croatia striker ovica olic and argentina defender juan pablo sorin scored two goals each for hamburg , who climbed past hanover 96 and borussia dortmund into seventh place after languishing in the relegation zone until february .
aachen were relegated after one season in the top flight . hannover 0 nuremberg 3 nuremberg tuned up for next saturday 's german cup final against stuttgart .
marek mintal , marko engelhardt and ivica banovic scored for nuremberg , who finished a strong sixth . standings : 1 stuttgart 70 2 schalke 68 3 bremen 66 4 bayern munich 60 5 leverkusen 51 6 nuremberg 48 7 hamburg 45 8 bochum 45 9 dortmund 44 10 hertha berlin 44 11 hanover 44 12 bielefeld 42 13 cottbus 41 14 frankfurt 40 15 wolfsburg 37 16 mainz 34 17 aachen 34 18 m 'gladbach 26 alex sisto send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

thanks to the efforts of a french filmmaker , they 'll also be shown in some poorer neighborhoods in parisian suburbs . there was no red carpet and the blue mediterranean was missing , but there was plenty of enthusiasm among the hundreds of people gathered in front of a giant screen in a small park between several concrete-tower tenement houses .

it was the idea of filmmaker luc besson , who says he was deeply disturbed by the 2005 riots that shook suburbs such as st. denis .

"
ukrainian television showed footage of blue interior ministry buses driving in a long column , the day after yuschenko issued a decree assuming control of the ministry 's forces . according to the interior ministry , the troops were deployed by the commander of the ministry 's military branch , olexander kikhtenko , who backs yushchenko and no longer recognizes the authority of pro-yanukovych interior minister vassyl tsushko .
the commander " acts according to his own logic and his own view , " tsushko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency . tsushko appealed for calm , asking " politicians to be more restrained . " " it 's necessary to calm down .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 26.05.2007 cannes films come to poor parisian suburbs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good cinema is n't just for the rich and famous for the first time , the cannes festival ’ s top films won ’ t be screened exclusively in the beach town .
thanks to the efforts of a french filmmaker , they 'll also be shown in some poorer neighborhoods in parisian suburbs . there was no red carpet and the blue mediterranean was missing , but there was plenty of enthusiasm among the hundreds of people gathered in front of a giant screen in a small park between several concrete-tower tenement houses .
this year the cannes en banlieu festival will bring cannes movie premiers to ten paris suburbs .
it was the idea of filmmaker luc besson , who says he was deeply disturbed by the 2005 riots that shook suburbs such as st. denis .
" this year was the 60th anniversary of cannes , so that was a good opportunity to link the two things and say you ca n't go to cannes , so cannes will come to you , " said besson .
" and the cannes festival was kind enough to give us films every night so we can show them to all these neighborhoods so they feel respected . "
" bridge between universes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if only they could bring the beach to paris too on a warm spring evening a crowd showed up several hours before the movie begins to enjoy local performers and even a double dutch jump rope competition .
there was colorful african dress and lots of muslim headscarves .
local singer aboo , who moved to the paris suburbs from mali when he was two year old , said he was happy he was able to perform there .
cannes is very prestigious , " said aboo , " but it 's far .
this is a great idea because it lets people get a little closer to this world of cinema .
this event can inspire young people because it will give them the chance to see a film they might not ordinarily see .
we could call it a sort of a bridge between two universes . "
not the real thing not everyone is so enthusiastic about the event , however .
" this is n't like cannes , " said a group of young men in their early twenties who said they have no jobs .
" there are no buildings like this in cannes and there are no blacks or arabs .
we 'd like to go to cannes , but we 've been stuck in this crappy place for the past 20 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out in paris ' largely immigrant suburbs in 2005 at twilight , film director luc besson took the stage to introduce a surprise guest , french comedian and film star jemal debbouz , originally from morocco .
debbouz was greeted with enthusiastic screams from fans .
make-believe " we ’ re gonna dream tonight , dream ladies and gentlemen , yes we wanna dream ! " yelled the actor to the ecstatic crowd .
on a political note , debbouz said he hoped new french president nicolas sarkozy would consider the people of saint denis and of all the suburbs .
sarkozy has been blamed for aggravating the 2005 riots with harsh words and rough tactics .
when the sky grew dark , the movie begun and the crowd grew quiet with interest .
families gathered to watch from the windows of the surrounding high rises .
even if only for a short while , the magic of cannes settled in saint denis . eleanor beardsley -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politics dominate silver screen at cannes film festival politics have always played an important role at the cannes film festival .

riis made his announcement at a news conference in copenhagen , one day after two former team-mates from germany 's team telekom , erik zabel and rolf aldag , made similar confessions .
danish cyclist riis admitted that he was involved in doping from 1993 until 1998 , including the 1996 season when he won the tour de france .
riis said he used a substance called epo to boost the production of red blood cells in his body , increasing his oxygen-carrying capacity and therefore improving his endurance .
" i have taken banned substances , i have taken epo .
i bought it and took it myself , " riis said , adding that team doctors bore no responsibility for his actions .

aldag , who admitted that he lied in the past when denying doping allegation , offered to resign over the scandal .
but t-mobile ’ s team manager bob stapleton says aldag now stands for clean cycling , and that he ’ ll be allowed to keep his job .
“ i think this is an extremely healthy process .

thanks to the efforts of a french filmmaker , they 'll also be shown in some poorer neighborhoods in parisian suburbs . there was no red carpet and the blue mediterranean was missing , but there was plenty of enthusiasm among the hundreds of people gathered in front of a giant screen in a small park between several concrete-tower tenement houses .
this year the cannes en banlieu festival will bring cannes movie premiers to ten paris suburbs .
it was the idea of filmmaker luc besson , who says he was deeply disturbed by the 2005 riots that shook suburbs such as st. denis .
" this year was the 60th anniversary of cannes , so that was a good opportunity to link the two things and say you ca n't go to cannes , so cannes will come to you , " said besson .
" and the cannes festival was kind enough to give us films every night so we can show them to all these neighborhoods so they feel respected . "
" bridge between universes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if only they could bring the beach to paris too on a warm spring evening a crowd showed up several hours before the movie begins to enjoy local performers and even a double dutch jump rope competition .
there was colorful african dress and lots of muslim headscarves .
local singer aboo , who moved to the paris suburbs from mali when he was two year old , said he was happy he was able to perform there .
cannes is very prestigious , " said aboo , " but it 's far .
this is a great idea because it lets people get a little closer to this world of cinema .
this event can inspire young people because it will give them the chance to see a film they might not ordinarily see .
we could call it a sort of a bridge between two universes . "
not the real thing not everyone is so enthusiastic about the event , however .
" this is n't like cannes , " said a group of young men in their early twenties who said they have no jobs .
" there are no buildings like this in cannes and there are no blacks or arabs .
we 'd like to go to cannes , but we 've been stuck in this crappy place for the past 20 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out in paris ' largely immigrant suburbs in 2005 at twilight , film director luc besson took the stage to introduce a surprise guest , french comedian and film star jemal debbouz , originally from morocco .
debbouz was greeted with enthusiastic screams from fans .
make-believe " we ’ re gonna dream tonight , dream ladies and gentlemen , yes we wanna dream ! " yelled the actor to the ecstatic crowd .
on a political note , debbouz said he hoped new french president nicolas sarkozy would consider the people of saint denis and of all the suburbs .
sarkozy has been blamed for aggravating the 2005 riots with harsh words and rough tactics .
when the sky grew dark , the movie begun and the crowd grew quiet with interest .
families gathered to watch from the windows of the surrounding high rises .
even if only for a short while , the magic of cannes settled in saint denis . eleanor beardsley -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politics dominate silver screen at cannes film festival politics have always played an important role at the cannes film festival .

with less than two weeks remaining before the june 6-8 summit , the climate document is the only unresolved issue in the statements the world leaders are expected to sign there , said the report , citing sources close to the talks .
representatives from the world 's leading industrial nations met the past two days in heiligendamm , germany , to negotiate over german chancellor angela merkel 's proposed climate statement .
it calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .

with less than two weeks remaining before the june 6-8 summit , the climate document is the only unresolved issue in the statements the world leaders are expected to sign there , said the report , citing sources close to the talks .
representatives from the world 's leading industrial nations met the past two days in heiligendamm , germany , to negotiate over german chancellor angela merkel 's proposed climate statement .
it calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
us objects to drafts ' red lines ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants us progress on climate change " the us still has serious , fundamental concerns about this draft statement , " the post quotes a document dated may 14 as saying .
" the treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses multiple ' red lines ' in terms of what we simply can not agree to ...
we have tried to ' tread lightly ' but there is only so far we can go given our fundamental opposition to the german position . "
the most recent draft , dated may 24 , shows that the two sides still remain at odds , the paper said .
concessions made still not enough while germany has offered to alter language identifying a rise in global temperature of 3.6 degrees fahrenheit as a dangerous tipping point and instead to accept a russian proposal that targets a range from 2.7 to 4.5 degrees , the united states has yet to accept the modified language .

having used him as an impact player from the bench , stuttgart coach armin veh revealed his plans to hit the nuremberg defence with gomez , who has been included in the squad for germany 's euro 2008 qualifiers , from the start .
" there is a strong chance he will play from the outset , " said veh , who will tempt fate by not be wearing his trade-mark lucky grey suit , the one he wore when his side captured their first bundesliga title for 15 years last weekend .
having been hammered 3-0 and 4-1 by nuremberg home and away this season , stuttgart are in the hunt for some sweet revenge in saturday 's dfb cup final at berlin 's olympic stadium .
champs on the end of two thrashings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg have twice routed stuttgart this season stuttgart opened the season with a 3-0 defeat at their gottlieb-daimler-stadium and after the winter break went down 4-1 away at their deadly rivals nuremberg , so are looking to lay a few ghosts on saturday .
this is the first cup final clash between these two particular sides and both clubs have won the cup three times apiece , so it promises to be an emotional afternoon for both teams - especially their goalkeepers .
stuttgart 's shot-stopper timo hildebrand is set to join spanish giants valencia , while nuremberg 's raphael schaefer , in an ironic twist which could add to the drama , is leaving this summer to join ...
stuttgart .
schaefer will no doubt be hoping the game will not be decided on penalties and that his likely back four of dominik reinhardt , andreas wolf , the brazilian glauber and javier horacio pinola give him little to do .
nuremberg smell a cup upset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sides will be hoping for better conditions in the final pinola said after training on thursday that he feels a nuremberg win is in the air and wolf was just as optimistic , saying : " we are very confident of our chances . "
but for nuremberg striker , markus schroth , who wants to give hildebrand the worst possible send off in his last game having spent the last 12 years at stuttgart , the bundesliga is now history .

with less than two weeks remaining before the june 6-8 summit , the climate document is the only unresolved issue in the statements the world leaders are expected to sign there , said the report , citing sources close to the talks .
representatives from the world 's leading industrial nations met the past two days in heiligendamm , germany , to negotiate over german chancellor angela merkel 's proposed climate statement .
it calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
us objects to drafts ' red lines ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants us progress on climate change " the us still has serious , fundamental concerns about this draft statement , " the post quotes a document dated may 14 as saying .
" the treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses multiple ' red lines ' in terms of what we simply can not agree to ...
we have tried to ' tread lightly ' but there is only so far we can go given our fundamental opposition to the german position . "
the most recent draft , dated may 24 , shows that the two sides still remain at odds , the paper said .
concessions made still not enough while germany has offered to alter language identifying a rise in global temperature of 3.6 degrees fahrenheit as a dangerous tipping point and instead to accept a russian proposal that targets a range from 2.7 to 4.5 degrees , the united states has yet to accept the modified language .

with less than two weeks remaining before the june 6-8 summit , the climate document is the only unresolved issue in the statements the world leaders are expected to sign there , said the report , citing sources close to the talks .
representatives from the world 's leading industrial nations met the past two days in heiligendamm , germany , to negotiate over german chancellor angela merkel 's proposed climate statement .
it calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
us objects to drafts ' red lines ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants us progress on climate change " the us still has serious , fundamental concerns about this draft statement , " the post quotes a document dated may 14 as saying .
" the treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses multiple ' red lines ' in terms of what we simply can not agree to ...
we have tried to ' tread lightly ' but there is only so far we can go given our fundamental opposition to the german position . "
the most recent draft , dated may 24 , shows that the two sides still remain at odds , the paper said .
concessions made still not enough while germany has offered to alter language identifying a rise in global temperature of 3.6 degrees fahrenheit as a dangerous tipping point and instead to accept a russian proposal that targets a range from 2.7 to 4.5 degrees , the united states has yet to accept the modified language .

riis made his announcement at a news conference in copenhagen , one day after two former team-mates from germany 's team telekom , erik zabel and rolf aldag , made similar confessions .
danish cyclist riis admitted that he was involved in doping from 1993 until 1998 , including the 1996 season when he won the tour de france .
riis said he used a substance called epo to boost the production of red blood cells in his body , increasing his oxygen-carrying capacity and therefore improving his endurance .
" i have taken banned substances , i have taken epo .
i bought it and took it myself , " riis said , adding that team doctors bore no responsibility for his actions .
telekom admissions set ball rolling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riis , the 1996 tour de france winner , admits epo use riis ’ admission rounds off a week of doping confessions by two former team telekom doctors and a number of former riders , including german cycling legend erik zabel , who told reporters that he took epo competing in 1996 .
even the current sports director at the t-mobile team , rolf aldag , confessed at the same press conference that he had taken epo between 1995 and 2002 .
aldag , who admitted that he lied in the past when denying doping allegation , offered to resign over the scandal .
but t-mobile ’ s team manager bob stapleton says aldag now stands for clean cycling , and that he ’ ll be allowed to keep his job .
“ i think this is an extremely healthy process .
i mean , we pushed it quite hard ourselves .
i think the fact we held a press conference where people knew things were going to come out , really prompted this small tidal wave of admissions .
i personally believe this is fundamental to moving forward in a positive way in the sport . ”
silver lining for ullrich ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich could step out of the darkness into the light one of the few positive developments to arise from this avalanche of scandal and admission could mean a reprieve for germany ’ s most controversial cycling star jan ullrich .
ullrich has been very quiet all week because he ’ s still facing criminal proceedings after packets of his blood were found in the offices of doping-scandal doctor eufemiano fuentes .
the office of public prosecution in bonn , which is handling the case , says it will review its evidence in light of the new admissions , and analysts say the charges could even be dropped .
one prosecution spokesman explained that the original case had been prepared under the assumption that the t-mobile directors didn ’ t know about the doping practices - something that ’ s now unclear .
jan ullrich retired in february after his involvement in the fuentes scandal and has always protested his innocence .
but even his lawyer hans-michael diestel said on german television on thursday that successful high-performance sport was not possible without doping these days .
a few hours later he was fired . sam edmonds -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " mass doping is now the order of the day " peter danckert , chairman of the parliamentary committee on sports , spoke with dw-world.de about the recent slough of doping confessions , germany 's new anti-doping law and what the sport world can do better .

thanks to the efforts of a french filmmaker , they 'll also be shown in some poorer neighborhoods in parisian suburbs . there was no red carpet and the blue mediterranean was missing , but there was plenty of enthusiasm among the hundreds of people gathered in front of a giant screen in a small park between several concrete-tower tenement houses .
this year the cannes en banlieu festival will bring cannes movie premiers to ten paris suburbs .
it was the idea of filmmaker luc besson , who says he was deeply disturbed by the 2005 riots that shook suburbs such as st. denis .
" this year was the 60th anniversary of cannes , so that was a good opportunity to link the two things and say you ca n't go to cannes , so cannes will come to you , " said besson .
" and the cannes festival was kind enough to give us films every night so we can show them to all these neighborhoods so they feel respected . "
" bridge between universes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if only they could bring the beach to paris too on a warm spring evening a crowd showed up several hours before the movie begins to enjoy local performers and even a double dutch jump rope competition .
there was colorful african dress and lots of muslim headscarves .
local singer aboo , who moved to the paris suburbs from mali when he was two year old , said he was happy he was able to perform there .
cannes is very prestigious , " said aboo , " but it 's far .
this is a great idea because it lets people get a little closer to this world of cinema .
this event can inspire young people because it will give them the chance to see a film they might not ordinarily see .
we could call it a sort of a bridge between two universes . "
not the real thing not everyone is so enthusiastic about the event , however .
" this is n't like cannes , " said a group of young men in their early twenties who said they have no jobs .
" there are no buildings like this in cannes and there are no blacks or arabs .
we 'd like to go to cannes , but we 've been stuck in this crappy place for the past 20 years . "

debbouz was greeted with enthusiastic screams from fans .
make-believe " we ’ re gonna dream tonight , dream ladies and gentlemen , yes we wanna dream ! " yelled the actor to the ecstatic crowd .
on a political note , debbouz said he hoped new french president nicolas sarkozy would consider the people of saint denis and of all the suburbs .
sarkozy has been blamed for aggravating the 2005 riots with harsh words and rough tactics .

" these cyber attacks have a security dimension without any doubt and that is the reason that nato expertise was sent to estonia to see what can and should be done , " he told a meeting of lawmakers from nato member states held in funchal on the portuguese island of madeira . " does this have a security implication ?
yes , it does have a security implication .
is it relevant for nato ?
yes , it is relevant for nato .
it is a subject which i am afraid will stay on the political agenda in the times to come , " he added . nato nations have sent cyber experts to estonia , one of the 26 members in the military alliance , as has the united states to help it combat the cyber attacks which have jammed mostly government websites . estonia has said that some of the cyber attacks came from russian government computers , including the kremlin .
moscow denies any role . attacks begin after removal of monument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cyber attacks on the high-tech country began after estonian officials removed a statue on april 27 from central tallinn which commemorates soviet troops killed fighting the nazis .
many estonians consider the statue a reminder of five decades of soviet occupation when their country was a soviet republic after world war ii . but the move angered moscow and estonia 's large ethnic russian minority , who see it as an affront to the memory of the fallen soldiers .
the monument is seen by russians , including the sizeable majority that lives in estonia , as a tribute to soviet soldiers who fought fascism in world war ii , while many estonians view it as a painful reminder of 50 years of soviet occupation . relations between the two countries plunged to their lowest ebb since the baltic state regained independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
the still simmering row between the neighbors was triggered when the authorities in estonia moved a soviet war memorial from central tallinn to a military cemetery , and exhumed the bodies of red army soldiers buried beneath it . attack one , attack all , says nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's de hoop scheffer the eu , nato , united states and individual eu members have all taken estonia 's side in the row , ignoring russian calls to punish the baltic state for violating the human rights of ethnic russians .
the western powers have all taken the side of estonia in the wake of the alleged cyber-attacks , angering the russians further . nato 's treaty states that an armed attack on one of its members is " an attack against them all " and some commentators in estonia have argued that this means nato is obliged help it respond to the cyber attacks .
the issue is , along with nato 's plans for further eastern expansion and us plans to set up a missile defense system in europe , one of several matters which have raised tensions between the european union and russia . estonia , an eu member with some 1.3 million people , has established itself as an internet pioneer since it broke away from the soviet union . russia row boosts eu identity in estonia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passion for europe has increased in recent weeks support among estonians for the eu , which the baltic state joined in 2004 , has soared since the row erupted with russia over the removal of the soviet war monument from central tallinn , a poll showed friday .
" in comparison with the end of last year , support of the people of estonia for membership of the eu , has grown significantly , " the emor polling agency said in a statement . of 1,001 people surveyed , 85 percent said they support estonia 's membership in the eu , compared with 74 percent in december , emor said . " the record-high support is linked to events at the end of last month , " emor analyst aivar voog told afp .
" the massive pressure from russia on estonia made people appreciate the eu as a security guarantee , " voog said .

" these cyber attacks have a security dimension without any doubt and that is the reason that nato expertise was sent to estonia to see what can and should be done , " he told a meeting of lawmakers from nato member states held in funchal on the portuguese island of madeira . " does this have a security implication ?
yes , it does have a security implication .
is it relevant for nato ?
yes , it is relevant for nato .
it is a subject which i am afraid will stay on the political agenda in the times to come , " he added . nato nations have sent cyber experts to estonia , one of the 26 members in the military alliance , as has the united states to help it combat the cyber attacks which have jammed mostly government websites . estonia has said that some of the cyber attacks came from russian government computers , including the kremlin .
moscow denies any role . attacks begin after removal of monument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cyber attacks on the high-tech country began after estonian officials removed a statue on april 27 from central tallinn which commemorates soviet troops killed fighting the nazis .
many estonians consider the statue a reminder of five decades of soviet occupation when their country was a soviet republic after world war ii . but the move angered moscow and estonia 's large ethnic russian minority , who see it as an affront to the memory of the fallen soldiers .
the monument is seen by russians , including the sizeable majority that lives in estonia , as a tribute to soviet soldiers who fought fascism in world war ii , while many estonians view it as a painful reminder of 50 years of soviet occupation . relations between the two countries plunged to their lowest ebb since the baltic state regained independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
the still simmering row between the neighbors was triggered when the authorities in estonia moved a soviet war memorial from central tallinn to a military cemetery , and exhumed the bodies of red army soldiers buried beneath it . attack one , attack all , says nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's de hoop scheffer the eu , nato , united states and individual eu members have all taken estonia 's side in the row , ignoring russian calls to punish the baltic state for violating the human rights of ethnic russians .
the western powers have all taken the side of estonia in the wake of the alleged cyber-attacks , angering the russians further . nato 's treaty states that an armed attack on one of its members is " an attack against them all " and some commentators in estonia have argued that this means nato is obliged help it respond to the cyber attacks .
the issue is , along with nato 's plans for further eastern expansion and us plans to set up a missile defense system in europe , one of several matters which have raised tensions between the european union and russia . estonia , an eu member with some 1.3 million people , has established itself as an internet pioneer since it broke away from the soviet union . russia row boosts eu identity in estonia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passion for europe has increased in recent weeks support among estonians for the eu , which the baltic state joined in 2004 , has soared since the row erupted with russia over the removal of the soviet war monument from central tallinn , a poll showed friday .
" in comparison with the end of last year , support of the people of estonia for membership of the eu , has grown significantly , " the emor polling agency said in a statement . of 1,001 people surveyed , 85 percent said they support estonia 's membership in the eu , compared with 74 percent in december , emor said . " the record-high support is linked to events at the end of last month , " emor analyst aivar voog told afp .
" the massive pressure from russia on estonia made people appreciate the eu as a security guarantee , " voog said .

with less than two weeks remaining before the june 6-8 summit , the climate document is the only unresolved issue in the statements the world leaders are expected to sign there , said the report , citing sources close to the talks .
representatives from the world 's leading industrial nations met the past two days in heiligendamm , germany , to negotiate over german chancellor angela merkel 's proposed climate statement .
it calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
us objects to drafts ' red lines ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants us progress on climate change " the us still has serious , fundamental concerns about this draft statement , " the post quotes a document dated may 14 as saying .
" the treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses multiple ' red lines ' in terms of what we simply can not agree to ...
we have tried to ' tread lightly ' but there is only so far we can go given our fundamental opposition to the german position . "
the most recent draft , dated may 24 , shows that the two sides still remain at odds , the paper said .
concessions made still not enough while germany has offered to alter language identifying a rise in global temperature of 3.6 degrees fahrenheit as a dangerous tipping point and instead to accept a russian proposal that targets a range from 2.7 to 4.5 degrees , the united states has yet to accept the modified language .
the post said that the united states also remains opposed to a statement that reads , " we acknowledge that the un climate process is an appropriate forum for negotiating future global action on climate change .

riis made his announcement at a news conference in copenhagen , one day after two former team-mates from germany 's team telekom , erik zabel and rolf aldag , made similar confessions .
danish cyclist riis admitted that he was involved in doping from 1993 until 1998 , including the 1996 season when he won the tour de france .
riis said he used a substance called epo to boost the production of red blood cells in his body , increasing his oxygen-carrying capacity and therefore improving his endurance .
" i have taken banned substances , i have taken epo .
i bought it and took it myself , " riis said , adding that team doctors bore no responsibility for his actions .
telekom admissions set ball rolling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riis , the 1996 tour de france winner , admits epo use riis ’ admission rounds off a week of doping confessions by two former team telekom doctors and a number of former riders , including german cycling legend erik zabel , who told reporters that he took epo competing in 1996 .
even the current sports director at the t-mobile team , rolf aldag , confessed at the same press conference that he had taken epo between 1995 and 2002 .
aldag , who admitted that he lied in the past when denying doping allegation , offered to resign over the scandal .
but t-mobile ’ s team manager bob stapleton says aldag now stands for clean cycling , and that he ’ ll be allowed to keep his job .
“ i think this is an extremely healthy process .
i mean , we pushed it quite hard ourselves .
i think the fact we held a press conference where people knew things were going to come out , really prompted this small tidal wave of admissions .
i personally believe this is fundamental to moving forward in a positive way in the sport . ”

thanks to the efforts of a french filmmaker , they 'll also be shown in some poorer neighborhoods in parisian suburbs . there was no red carpet and the blue mediterranean was missing , but there was plenty of enthusiasm among the hundreds of people gathered in front of a giant screen in a small park between several concrete-tower tenement houses .
this year the cannes en banlieu festival will bring cannes movie premiers to ten paris suburbs .
it was the idea of filmmaker luc besson , who says he was deeply disturbed by the 2005 riots that shook suburbs such as st. denis .
" this year was the 60th anniversary of cannes , so that was a good opportunity to link the two things and say you ca n't go to cannes , so cannes will come to you , " said besson .
" and the cannes festival was kind enough to give us films every night so we can show them to all these neighborhoods so they feel respected . "

local singer aboo , who moved to the paris suburbs from mali when he was two year old , said he was happy he was able to perform there .
cannes is very prestigious , " said aboo , " but it 's far .
this is a great idea because it lets people get a little closer to this world of cinema .
this event can inspire young people because it will give them the chance to see a film they might not ordinarily see .

on a political note , debbouz said he hoped new french president nicolas sarkozy would consider the people of saint denis and of all the suburbs .
sarkozy has been blamed for aggravating the 2005 riots with harsh words and rough tactics .

"
ukrainian television showed footage of blue interior ministry buses driving in a long column , the day after yuschenko issued a decree assuming control of the ministry 's forces . according to the interior ministry , the troops were deployed by the commander of the ministry 's military branch , olexander kikhtenko , who backs yushchenko and no longer recognizes the authority of pro-yanukovych interior minister vassyl tsushko .
the commander " acts according to his own logic and his own view , " tsushko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency . tsushko appealed for calm , asking " politicians to be more restrained . " " it 's necessary to calm down .
there wo n't be any use of force .
we wo n't storm anything , " he said . russia , the european union and the united states have expressed concern over the situation in ukraine , which is sandwiched between russia and several eu states including poland . growing feud adding to escalation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which viktor will be victorious ?
fears of violence are growing as the feud between yushchenko and yanukovych drags on , with both sides competing for loyalty of the security forces . tens of thousands of troops serve in the interior ministry 's military branch .
the ministry also comprises police and paramilitary units and in general has sided with yanukovych . yushchenko 's decree assuming control over the ministry 's armed forces prompted parliament speaker oleksandr moroz , a yanukovych ally , to accuse the president of a " coup attempt .

riis made his announcement at a news conference in copenhagen , one day after two former team-mates from germany 's team telekom , erik zabel and rolf aldag , made similar confessions .
danish cyclist riis admitted that he was involved in doping from 1993 until 1998 , including the 1996 season when he won the tour de france .
riis said he used a substance called epo to boost the production of red blood cells in his body , increasing his oxygen-carrying capacity and therefore improving his endurance .
" i have taken banned substances , i have taken epo .
i bought it and took it myself , " riis said , adding that team doctors bore no responsibility for his actions .
telekom admissions set ball rolling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riis , the 1996 tour de france winner , admits epo use riis ’ admission rounds off a week of doping confessions by two former team telekom doctors and a number of former riders , including german cycling legend erik zabel , who told reporters that he took epo competing in 1996 .
even the current sports director at the t-mobile team , rolf aldag , confessed at the same press conference that he had taken epo between 1995 and 2002 .
aldag , who admitted that he lied in the past when denying doping allegation , offered to resign over the scandal .
but t-mobile ’ s team manager bob stapleton says aldag now stands for clean cycling , and that he ’ ll be allowed to keep his job .
“ i think this is an extremely healthy process .
i mean , we pushed it quite hard ourselves .
i think the fact we held a press conference where people knew things were going to come out , really prompted this small tidal wave of admissions .
i personally believe this is fundamental to moving forward in a positive way in the sport . ”

one prosecution spokesman explained that the original case had been prepared under the assumption that the t-mobile directors didn ’ t know about the doping practices - something that ’ s now unclear .

" these cyber attacks have a security dimension without any doubt and that is the reason that nato expertise was sent to estonia to see what can and should be done , " he told a meeting of lawmakers from nato member states held in funchal on the portuguese island of madeira . " does this have a security implication ?
yes , it does have a security implication .
is it relevant for nato ?
yes , it is relevant for nato .
it is a subject which i am afraid will stay on the political agenda in the times to come , " he added . nato nations have sent cyber experts to estonia , one of the 26 members in the military alliance , as has the united states to help it combat the cyber attacks which have jammed mostly government websites . estonia has said that some of the cyber attacks came from russian government computers , including the kremlin .
moscow denies any role . attacks begin after removal of monument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cyber attacks on the high-tech country began after estonian officials removed a statue on april 27 from central tallinn which commemorates soviet troops killed fighting the nazis .
many estonians consider the statue a reminder of five decades of soviet occupation when their country was a soviet republic after world war ii . but the move angered moscow and estonia 's large ethnic russian minority , who see it as an affront to the memory of the fallen soldiers .
the monument is seen by russians , including the sizeable majority that lives in estonia , as a tribute to soviet soldiers who fought fascism in world war ii , while many estonians view it as a painful reminder of 50 years of soviet occupation . relations between the two countries plunged to their lowest ebb since the baltic state regained independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
the still simmering row between the neighbors was triggered when the authorities in estonia moved a soviet war memorial from central tallinn to a military cemetery , and exhumed the bodies of red army soldiers buried beneath it . attack one , attack all , says nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's de hoop scheffer the eu , nato , united states and individual eu members have all taken estonia 's side in the row , ignoring russian calls to punish the baltic state for violating the human rights of ethnic russians .
the western powers have all taken the side of estonia in the wake of the alleged cyber-attacks , angering the russians further . nato 's treaty states that an armed attack on one of its members is " an attack against them all " and some commentators in estonia have argued that this means nato is obliged help it respond to the cyber attacks .
the issue is , along with nato 's plans for further eastern expansion and us plans to set up a missile defense system in europe , one of several matters which have raised tensions between the european union and russia . estonia , an eu member with some 1.3 million people , has established itself as an internet pioneer since it broke away from the soviet union . russia row boosts eu identity in estonia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passion for europe has increased in recent weeks support among estonians for the eu , which the baltic state joined in 2004 , has soared since the row erupted with russia over the removal of the soviet war monument from central tallinn , a poll showed friday .
" in comparison with the end of last year , support of the people of estonia for membership of the eu , has grown significantly , " the emor polling agency said in a statement . of 1,001 people surveyed , 85 percent said they support estonia 's membership in the eu , compared with 74 percent in december , emor said . " the record-high support is linked to events at the end of last month , " emor analyst aivar voog told afp .
" the massive pressure from russia on estonia made people appreciate the eu as a security guarantee , " voog said .

with less than two weeks remaining before the june 6-8 summit , the climate document is the only unresolved issue in the statements the world leaders are expected to sign there , said the report , citing sources close to the talks .
representatives from the world 's leading industrial nations met the past two days in heiligendamm , germany , to negotiate over german chancellor angela merkel 's proposed climate statement .
it calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
us objects to drafts ' red lines ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants us progress on climate change " the us still has serious , fundamental concerns about this draft statement , " the post quotes a document dated may 14 as saying .
" the treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses multiple ' red lines ' in terms of what we simply can not agree to ...
we have tried to ' tread lightly ' but there is only so far we can go given our fundamental opposition to the german position . "
the most recent draft , dated may 24 , shows that the two sides still remain at odds , the paper said .

bayern and leverkusen in the uefa cup .
mainz , aachen and m 'gladbach relegated german cupfinal in berlin : stuttgart 2 nuremberg 3 a.e.t danish midfielder jan kristiansen was the toast of nuremberg on saturday night as his goal in extra-time ended his side 's 45-year wait for the german cup with a 2-1 win over 10-man stuttgart .
kristiansen struck in the 109th minute with a long-range effort at berlin 's olympic stadium which made his side german cup winners for the fourth time and denied bundesliga champions stuttgart their first domestic double .
stuttgart 's prolific striker cacau put his side ahead when he stabbed the ball home past goalkeeper raphael schaefer after 20 minutes .
nuremberg hit back quickly when slovakian midfielder marek mintal blasted home his shot after 27 minutes .
ironically , both scorers were off the pitch soon after both for different reasons .
first cacau was sent off for lashing out at nuremberg defender andreas wolf .
then slovakian striker mintal had to be stretchered off after a terrible tackle by portuguese defender fernando meira which should have been red-carded .
but referee weiner , having just sent off cacao , declined .
nuremberg took the lead just two minutes after the break when german international midfielder marco engelhardt headed home .
but with ten minutes to go goalkeeprschaefer brought down gomez in the penalty area , and mexican midfielder pavel pardo drove home his shot to make it 2-2 .
the game went into extra-time and it was kristiansen 's 30 metres shot which gave hildebrand no chance and sealed uremberg 's win .
a win which ends stuttgarts dream of the double and which makes veteran nürnberg coach hans meyer into a true nürnberg legend .
he is the only coach to have won the former east german cup -lrb- with carl zeiss jena -rrb- and the dfb cup -lrb- with nuremberg -rrb- last bundesliga matchday of 2007 season . stuttgart 2 cottbus 1 stuttgart secured their fifth championship with an eighth straight victory to cap a remarkable finish .
they erased a seven-point deficit and rallied from third place .

lincoln and halil altintop scored in the first quarter of an hour , fuelling schalke hopes of the championship - a four-goal margin would have earned them their elusive first bundesliga title if stuttgart had drawn against energie cottbus .
schalke , who nevertheless secured second and direct qualification to the champions league , were unable to add to the lead and radim kucera got a stoppage time goal for the visitors . wolfsburg 0 werder bremen 2 werder won but still finished third behind schalke 04 and will enter the champions league third qualifying round - one peg below their second place finish a year ago .
sweden 's markus rosenberg replaced germany striker miroslav klose and scored twice for werder , who dominated the first half of the season before stumbling after the winter break . bayern munich 5 mainz 2 outgoing champions bayern won their second straight but finished a disappointing fourth , 10 points behind stuttgart , and will clean house in the off season .
mainz were relegated after three years the bundesliga .
veteran mehmet scholl scored in his final match for bayern , who also had goals from roque santa cruz , mark van bommel , ali karimi and claudio pizarro .
leverkusen 2 dortmund 1 l everkusen secured fifth place for the second season in succession and a direct berth in the uefa cup .
stefan kiessling got a stoppage-time goal just before the intermission and simon rolfes doubled the lead nine minutes after the break .

bochum 's greece striker theofanis gekas was crowned league top scorer with 20 goals . frankfurt 1 hertha berlin 2 serbia striker marko pantelic got the winner three minutes from time in a consolation victory for an otherwise disappointing season for hertha , who ended 10th .

bayern and leverkusen in the uefa cup .
mainz , aachen and m 'gladbach relegated german cupfinal in berlin : stuttgart 2 nuremberg 3 a.e.t danish midfielder jan kristiansen was the toast of nuremberg on saturday night as his goal in extra-time ended his side 's 45-year wait for the german cup with a 2-1 win over 10-man stuttgart .
kristiansen struck in the 109th minute with a long-range effort at berlin 's olympic stadium which made his side german cup winners for the fourth time and denied bundesliga champions stuttgart their first domestic double .
stuttgart 's prolific striker cacau put his side ahead when he stabbed the ball home past goalkeeper raphael schaefer after 20 minutes .
nuremberg hit back quickly when slovakian midfielder marek mintal blasted home his shot after 27 minutes .
ironically , both scorers were off the pitch soon after both for different reasons .
first cacau was sent off for lashing out at nuremberg defender andreas wolf .
then slovakian striker mintal had to be stretchered off after a terrible tackle by portuguese defender fernando meira which should have been red-carded .
but referee weiner , having just sent off cacao , declined .
nuremberg took the lead just two minutes after the break when german international midfielder marco engelhardt headed home .
but with ten minutes to go goalkeeprschaefer brought down gomez in the penalty area , and mexican midfielder pavel pardo drove home his shot to make it 2-2 .
the game went into extra-time and it was kristiansen 's 30 metres shot which gave hildebrand no chance and sealed uremberg 's win .
a win which ends stuttgarts dream of the double and which makes veteran nürnberg coach hans meyer into a true nürnberg legend .
he is the only coach to have won the former east german cup -lrb- with carl zeiss jena -rrb- and the dfb cup -lrb- with nuremberg -rrb- last bundesliga matchday of 2007 season . stuttgart 2 cottbus 1 stuttgart secured their fifth championship with an eighth straight victory to cap a remarkable finish .
they erased a seven-point deficit and rallied from third place .

lincoln and halil altintop scored in the first quarter of an hour , fuelling schalke hopes of the championship - a four-goal margin would have earned them their elusive first bundesliga title if stuttgart had drawn against energie cottbus .
schalke , who nevertheless secured second and direct qualification to the champions league , were unable to add to the lead and radim kucera got a stoppage time goal for the visitors . wolfsburg 0 werder bremen 2 werder won but still finished third behind schalke 04 and will enter the champions league third qualifying round - one peg below their second place finish a year ago .
sweden 's markus rosenberg replaced germany striker miroslav klose and scored twice for werder , who dominated the first half of the season before stumbling after the winter break . bayern munich 5 mainz 2 outgoing champions bayern won their second straight but finished a disappointing fourth , 10 points behind stuttgart , and will clean house in the off season .
mainz were relegated after three years the bundesliga .
veteran mehmet scholl scored in his final match for bayern , who also had goals from roque santa cruz , mark van bommel , ali karimi and claudio pizarro .
leverkusen 2 dortmund 1 l everkusen secured fifth place for the second season in succession and a direct berth in the uefa cup .
stefan kiessling got a stoppage-time goal just before the intermission and simon rolfes doubled the lead nine minutes after the break .
ebi smolarek got one in the 79th minute for dortmund , whose four-match winning streak salvaged a poor season ending . m 'gladbach 0 bochum 2 christoph dabrowski and dariusz wosz scored for bochum while moenchengladbach , relegated for the second time since 1999 , went down to a sixth loss in nine matches .
bochum 's greece striker theofanis gekas was crowned league top scorer with 20 goals . frankfurt 1 hertha berlin 2 serbia striker marko pantelic got the winner three minutes from time in a consolation victory for an otherwise disappointing season for hertha , who ended 10th .

bayern and leverkusen in the uefa cup .
mainz , aachen and m 'gladbach relegated german cupfinal in berlin : stuttgart 2 nuremberg 3 a.e.t danish midfielder jan kristiansen was the toast of nuremberg on saturday night as his goal in extra-time ended his side 's 45-year wait for the german cup with a 2-1 win over 10-man stuttgart .
kristiansen struck in the 109th minute with a long-range effort at berlin 's olympic stadium which made his side german cup winners for the fourth time and denied bundesliga champions stuttgart their first domestic double .
stuttgart 's prolific striker cacau put his side ahead when he stabbed the ball home past goalkeeper raphael schaefer after 20 minutes .
nuremberg hit back quickly when slovakian midfielder marek mintal blasted home his shot after 27 minutes .
ironically , both scorers were off the pitch soon after both for different reasons .
first cacau was sent off for lashing out at nuremberg defender andreas wolf .
then slovakian striker mintal had to be stretchered off after a terrible tackle by portuguese defender fernando meira which should have been red-carded .
but referee weiner , having just sent off cacao , declined .
nuremberg took the lead just two minutes after the break when german international midfielder marco engelhardt headed home .
but with ten minutes to go goalkeeprschaefer brought down gomez in the penalty area , and mexican midfielder pavel pardo drove home his shot to make it 2-2 .
the game went into extra-time and it was kristiansen 's 30 metres shot which gave hildebrand no chance and sealed uremberg 's win .
a win which ends stuttgarts dream of the double and which makes veteran nürnberg coach hans meyer into a true nürnberg legend .
he is the only coach to have won the former east german cup -lrb- with carl zeiss jena -rrb- and the dfb cup -lrb- with nuremberg -rrb- last bundesliga matchday of 2007 season . stuttgart 2 cottbus 1 stuttgart secured their fifth championship with an eighth straight victory to cap a remarkable finish .
they erased a seven-point deficit and rallied from third place .
after cottbus 's sergiu radu deflected a pass to beat timo hildebrand in the 19th minute , thomas hitzlsperger equalised with a blazing long-range volley and sami khedira scored the winner just past the hour . schalke 2 arminia bielefeld 1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dissapointed supporters of schalke who failed to win their first bundesliga title .
lincoln and halil altintop scored in the first quarter of an hour , fuelling schalke hopes of the championship - a four-goal margin would have earned them their elusive first bundesliga title if stuttgart had drawn against energie cottbus .
schalke , who nevertheless secured second and direct qualification to the champions league , were unable to add to the lead and radim kucera got a stoppage time goal for the visitors . wolfsburg 0 werder bremen 2 werder won but still finished third behind schalke 04 and will enter the champions league third qualifying round - one peg below their second place finish a year ago .
sweden 's markus rosenberg replaced germany striker miroslav klose and scored twice for werder , who dominated the first half of the season before stumbling after the winter break . bayern munich 5 mainz 2 outgoing champions bayern won their second straight but finished a disappointing fourth , 10 points behind stuttgart , and will clean house in the off season .
mainz were relegated after three years the bundesliga .
veteran mehmet scholl scored in his final match for bayern , who also had goals from roque santa cruz , mark van bommel , ali karimi and claudio pizarro .
leverkusen 2 dortmund 1 l everkusen secured fifth place for the second season in succession and a direct berth in the uefa cup .
stefan kiessling got a stoppage-time goal just before the intermission and simon rolfes doubled the lead nine minutes after the break .
ebi smolarek got one in the 79th minute for dortmund , whose four-match winning streak salvaged a poor season ending . m 'gladbach 0 bochum 2 christoph dabrowski and dariusz wosz scored for bochum while moenchengladbach , relegated for the second time since 1999 , went down to a sixth loss in nine matches .
bochum 's greece striker theofanis gekas was crowned league top scorer with 20 goals . frankfurt 1 hertha berlin 2 serbia striker marko pantelic got the winner three minutes from time in a consolation victory for an otherwise disappointing season for hertha , who ended 10th .
kevin-prince boateng put hertha ahead just after the half before albert streit got the equaliser with a free kick that hit the post and bounced past hertha goalkeeper christian fielder . hamburg 4 aachen 0 croatia striker ovica olic and argentina defender juan pablo sorin scored two goals each for hamburg , who climbed past hanover 96 and borussia dortmund into seventh place after languishing in the relegation zone until february .

bayern and leverkusen in the uefa cup .
mainz , aachen and m 'gladbach relegated german cupfinal in berlin : stuttgart 2 nuremberg 3 a.e.t danish midfielder jan kristiansen was the toast of nuremberg on saturday night as his goal in extra-time ended his side 's 45-year wait for the german cup with a 2-1 win over 10-man stuttgart .
kristiansen struck in the 109th minute with a long-range effort at berlin 's olympic stadium which made his side german cup winners for the fourth time and denied bundesliga champions stuttgart their first domestic double .
stuttgart 's prolific striker cacau put his side ahead when he stabbed the ball home past goalkeeper raphael schaefer after 20 minutes .
nuremberg hit back quickly when slovakian midfielder marek mintal blasted home his shot after 27 minutes .
ironically , both scorers were off the pitch soon after both for different reasons .
first cacau was sent off for lashing out at nuremberg defender andreas wolf .
then slovakian striker mintal had to be stretchered off after a terrible tackle by portuguese defender fernando meira which should have been red-carded .
but referee weiner , having just sent off cacao , declined .
nuremberg took the lead just two minutes after the break when german international midfielder marco engelhardt headed home .
but with ten minutes to go goalkeeprschaefer brought down gomez in the penalty area , and mexican midfielder pavel pardo drove home his shot to make it 2-2 .
the game went into extra-time and it was kristiansen 's 30 metres shot which gave hildebrand no chance and sealed uremberg 's win .
a win which ends stuttgarts dream of the double and which makes veteran nürnberg coach hans meyer into a true nürnberg legend .
he is the only coach to have won the former east german cup -lrb- with carl zeiss jena -rrb- and the dfb cup -lrb- with nuremberg -rrb- last bundesliga matchday of 2007 season . stuttgart 2 cottbus 1 stuttgart secured their fifth championship with an eighth straight victory to cap a remarkable finish .
they erased a seven-point deficit and rallied from third place .
after cottbus 's sergiu radu deflected a pass to beat timo hildebrand in the 19th minute , thomas hitzlsperger equalised with a blazing long-range volley and sami khedira scored the winner just past the hour . schalke 2 arminia bielefeld 1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dissapointed supporters of schalke who failed to win their first bundesliga title .
lincoln and halil altintop scored in the first quarter of an hour , fuelling schalke hopes of the championship - a four-goal margin would have earned them their elusive first bundesliga title if stuttgart had drawn against energie cottbus .
schalke , who nevertheless secured second and direct qualification to the champions league , were unable to add to the lead and radim kucera got a stoppage time goal for the visitors . wolfsburg 0 werder bremen 2 werder won but still finished third behind schalke 04 and will enter the champions league third qualifying round - one peg below their second place finish a year ago .
sweden 's markus rosenberg replaced germany striker miroslav klose and scored twice for werder , who dominated the first half of the season before stumbling after the winter break . bayern munich 5 mainz 2 outgoing champions bayern won their second straight but finished a disappointing fourth , 10 points behind stuttgart , and will clean house in the off season .
mainz were relegated after three years the bundesliga .
veteran mehmet scholl scored in his final match for bayern , who also had goals from roque santa cruz , mark van bommel , ali karimi and claudio pizarro .
leverkusen 2 dortmund 1 l everkusen secured fifth place for the second season in succession and a direct berth in the uefa cup .
stefan kiessling got a stoppage-time goal just before the intermission and simon rolfes doubled the lead nine minutes after the break .

bochum 's greece striker theofanis gekas was crowned league top scorer with 20 goals . frankfurt 1 hertha berlin 2 serbia striker marko pantelic got the winner three minutes from time in a consolation victory for an otherwise disappointing season for hertha , who ended 10th .

bayern and leverkusen in the uefa cup .
mainz , aachen and m 'gladbach relegated german cupfinal in berlin : stuttgart 2 nuremberg 3 a.e.t danish midfielder jan kristiansen was the toast of nuremberg on saturday night as his goal in extra-time ended his side 's 45-year wait for the german cup with a 2-1 win over 10-man stuttgart .
kristiansen struck in the 109th minute with a long-range effort at berlin 's olympic stadium which made his side german cup winners for the fourth time and denied bundesliga champions stuttgart their first domestic double .
stuttgart 's prolific striker cacau put his side ahead when he stabbed the ball home past goalkeeper raphael schaefer after 20 minutes .
nuremberg hit back quickly when slovakian midfielder marek mintal blasted home his shot after 27 minutes .
ironically , both scorers were off the pitch soon after both for different reasons .
first cacau was sent off for lashing out at nuremberg defender andreas wolf .
then slovakian striker mintal had to be stretchered off after a terrible tackle by portuguese defender fernando meira which should have been red-carded .
but referee weiner , having just sent off cacao , declined .
nuremberg took the lead just two minutes after the break when german international midfielder marco engelhardt headed home .
but with ten minutes to go goalkeeprschaefer brought down gomez in the penalty area , and mexican midfielder pavel pardo drove home his shot to make it 2-2 .
the game went into extra-time and it was kristiansen 's 30 metres shot which gave hildebrand no chance and sealed uremberg 's win .
a win which ends stuttgarts dream of the double and which makes veteran nürnberg coach hans meyer into a true nürnberg legend .
he is the only coach to have won the former east german cup -lrb- with carl zeiss jena -rrb- and the dfb cup -lrb- with nuremberg -rrb- last bundesliga matchday of 2007 season . stuttgart 2 cottbus 1 stuttgart secured their fifth championship with an eighth straight victory to cap a remarkable finish .
they erased a seven-point deficit and rallied from third place .

lincoln and halil altintop scored in the first quarter of an hour , fuelling schalke hopes of the championship - a four-goal margin would have earned them their elusive first bundesliga title if stuttgart had drawn against energie cottbus .
schalke , who nevertheless secured second and direct qualification to the champions league , were unable to add to the lead and radim kucera got a stoppage time goal for the visitors . wolfsburg 0 werder bremen 2 werder won but still finished third behind schalke 04 and will enter the champions league third qualifying round - one peg below their second place finish a year ago .
sweden 's markus rosenberg replaced germany striker miroslav klose and scored twice for werder , who dominated the first half of the season before stumbling after the winter break . bayern munich 5 mainz 2 outgoing champions bayern won their second straight but finished a disappointing fourth , 10 points behind stuttgart , and will clean house in the off season .
mainz were relegated after three years the bundesliga .
veteran mehmet scholl scored in his final match for bayern , who also had goals from roque santa cruz , mark van bommel , ali karimi and claudio pizarro .
leverkusen 2 dortmund 1 l everkusen secured fifth place for the second season in succession and a direct berth in the uefa cup .
stefan kiessling got a stoppage-time goal just before the intermission and simon rolfes doubled the lead nine minutes after the break .
ebi smolarek got one in the 79th minute for dortmund , whose four-match winning streak salvaged a poor season ending . m 'gladbach 0 bochum 2 christoph dabrowski and dariusz wosz scored for bochum while moenchengladbach , relegated for the second time since 1999 , went down to a sixth loss in nine matches .
bochum 's greece striker theofanis gekas was crowned league top scorer with 20 goals . frankfurt 1 hertha berlin 2 serbia striker marko pantelic got the winner three minutes from time in a consolation victory for an otherwise disappointing season for hertha , who ended 10th .

bayern and leverkusen in the uefa cup .
mainz , aachen and m 'gladbach relegated german cupfinal in berlin : stuttgart 2 nuremberg 3 a.e.t danish midfielder jan kristiansen was the toast of nuremberg on saturday night as his goal in extra-time ended his side 's 45-year wait for the german cup with a 2-1 win over 10-man stuttgart .
kristiansen struck in the 109th minute with a long-range effort at berlin 's olympic stadium which made his side german cup winners for the fourth time and denied bundesliga champions stuttgart their first domestic double .
stuttgart 's prolific striker cacau put his side ahead when he stabbed the ball home past goalkeeper raphael schaefer after 20 minutes .
nuremberg hit back quickly when slovakian midfielder marek mintal blasted home his shot after 27 minutes .
ironically , both scorers were off the pitch soon after both for different reasons .
first cacau was sent off for lashing out at nuremberg defender andreas wolf .
then slovakian striker mintal had to be stretchered off after a terrible tackle by portuguese defender fernando meira which should have been red-carded .
but referee weiner , having just sent off cacao , declined .
nuremberg took the lead just two minutes after the break when german international midfielder marco engelhardt headed home .
but with ten minutes to go goalkeeprschaefer brought down gomez in the penalty area , and mexican midfielder pavel pardo drove home his shot to make it 2-2 .
the game went into extra-time and it was kristiansen 's 30 metres shot which gave hildebrand no chance and sealed uremberg 's win .
a win which ends stuttgarts dream of the double and which makes veteran nürnberg coach hans meyer into a true nürnberg legend .
he is the only coach to have won the former east german cup -lrb- with carl zeiss jena -rrb- and the dfb cup -lrb- with nuremberg -rrb- last bundesliga matchday of 2007 season . stuttgart 2 cottbus 1 stuttgart secured their fifth championship with an eighth straight victory to cap a remarkable finish .
they erased a seven-point deficit and rallied from third place .
after cottbus 's sergiu radu deflected a pass to beat timo hildebrand in the 19th minute , thomas hitzlsperger equalised with a blazing long-range volley and sami khedira scored the winner just past the hour . schalke 2 arminia bielefeld 1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dissapointed supporters of schalke who failed to win their first bundesliga title .
lincoln and halil altintop scored in the first quarter of an hour , fuelling schalke hopes of the championship - a four-goal margin would have earned them their elusive first bundesliga title if stuttgart had drawn against energie cottbus .
schalke , who nevertheless secured second and direct qualification to the champions league , were unable to add to the lead and radim kucera got a stoppage time goal for the visitors . wolfsburg 0 werder bremen 2 werder won but still finished third behind schalke 04 and will enter the champions league third qualifying round - one peg below their second place finish a year ago .
sweden 's markus rosenberg replaced germany striker miroslav klose and scored twice for werder , who dominated the first half of the season before stumbling after the winter break . bayern munich 5 mainz 2 outgoing champions bayern won their second straight but finished a disappointing fourth , 10 points behind stuttgart , and will clean house in the off season .
mainz were relegated after three years the bundesliga .
veteran mehmet scholl scored in his final match for bayern , who also had goals from roque santa cruz , mark van bommel , ali karimi and claudio pizarro .
leverkusen 2 dortmund 1 l everkusen secured fifth place for the second season in succession and a direct berth in the uefa cup .
stefan kiessling got a stoppage-time goal just before the intermission and simon rolfes doubled the lead nine minutes after the break .
ebi smolarek got one in the 79th minute for dortmund , whose four-match winning streak salvaged a poor season ending . m 'gladbach 0 bochum 2 christoph dabrowski and dariusz wosz scored for bochum while moenchengladbach , relegated for the second time since 1999 , went down to a sixth loss in nine matches .
bochum 's greece striker theofanis gekas was crowned league top scorer with 20 goals . frankfurt 1 hertha berlin 2 serbia striker marko pantelic got the winner three minutes from time in a consolation victory for an otherwise disappointing season for hertha , who ended 10th .
kevin-prince boateng put hertha ahead just after the half before albert streit got the equaliser with a free kick that hit the post and bounced past hertha goalkeeper christian fielder . hamburg 4 aachen 0 croatia striker ovica olic and argentina defender juan pablo sorin scored two goals each for hamburg , who climbed past hanover 96 and borussia dortmund into seventh place after languishing in the relegation zone until february .

with less than two weeks remaining before the june 6-8 summit , the climate document is the only unresolved issue in the statements the world leaders are expected to sign there , said the report , citing sources close to the talks .
representatives from the world 's leading industrial nations met the past two days in heiligendamm , germany , to negotiate over german chancellor angela merkel 's proposed climate statement .
it calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
us objects to drafts ' red lines ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants us progress on climate change " the us still has serious , fundamental concerns about this draft statement , " the post quotes a document dated may 14 as saying .
" the treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses multiple ' red lines ' in terms of what we simply can not agree to ...
we have tried to ' tread lightly ' but there is only so far we can go given our fundamental opposition to the german position . "
the most recent draft , dated may 24 , shows that the two sides still remain at odds , the paper said .
concessions made still not enough while germany has offered to alter language identifying a rise in global temperature of 3.6 degrees fahrenheit as a dangerous tipping point and instead to accept a russian proposal that targets a range from 2.7 to 4.5 degrees , the united states has yet to accept the modified language .
the post said that the united states also remains opposed to a statement that reads , " we acknowledge that the un climate process is an appropriate forum for negotiating future global action on climate change .

" these cyber attacks have a security dimension without any doubt and that is the reason that nato expertise was sent to estonia to see what can and should be done , " he told a meeting of lawmakers from nato member states held in funchal on the portuguese island of madeira . " does this have a security implication ?
yes , it does have a security implication .
is it relevant for nato ?
yes , it is relevant for nato .
it is a subject which i am afraid will stay on the political agenda in the times to come , " he added . nato nations have sent cyber experts to estonia , one of the 26 members in the military alliance , as has the united states to help it combat the cyber attacks which have jammed mostly government websites . estonia has said that some of the cyber attacks came from russian government computers , including the kremlin .
moscow denies any role . attacks begin after removal of monument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cyber attacks on the high-tech country began after estonian officials removed a statue on april 27 from central tallinn which commemorates soviet troops killed fighting the nazis .
many estonians consider the statue a reminder of five decades of soviet occupation when their country was a soviet republic after world war ii . but the move angered moscow and estonia 's large ethnic russian minority , who see it as an affront to the memory of the fallen soldiers .
the monument is seen by russians , including the sizeable majority that lives in estonia , as a tribute to soviet soldiers who fought fascism in world war ii , while many estonians view it as a painful reminder of 50 years of soviet occupation . relations between the two countries plunged to their lowest ebb since the baltic state regained independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
the still simmering row between the neighbors was triggered when the authorities in estonia moved a soviet war memorial from central tallinn to a military cemetery , and exhumed the bodies of red army soldiers buried beneath it . attack one , attack all , says nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's de hoop scheffer the eu , nato , united states and individual eu members have all taken estonia 's side in the row , ignoring russian calls to punish the baltic state for violating the human rights of ethnic russians .
the western powers have all taken the side of estonia in the wake of the alleged cyber-attacks , angering the russians further . nato 's treaty states that an armed attack on one of its members is " an attack against them all " and some commentators in estonia have argued that this means nato is obliged help it respond to the cyber attacks .
the issue is , along with nato 's plans for further eastern expansion and us plans to set up a missile defense system in europe , one of several matters which have raised tensions between the european union and russia . estonia , an eu member with some 1.3 million people , has established itself as an internet pioneer since it broke away from the soviet union . russia row boosts eu identity in estonia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passion for europe has increased in recent weeks support among estonians for the eu , which the baltic state joined in 2004 , has soared since the row erupted with russia over the removal of the soviet war monument from central tallinn , a poll showed friday .
" in comparison with the end of last year , support of the people of estonia for membership of the eu , has grown significantly , " the emor polling agency said in a statement . of 1,001 people surveyed , 85 percent said they support estonia 's membership in the eu , compared with 74 percent in december , emor said . " the record-high support is linked to events at the end of last month , " emor analyst aivar voog told afp .
" the massive pressure from russia on estonia made people appreciate the eu as a security guarantee , " voog said .

having used him as an impact player from the bench , stuttgart coach armin veh revealed his plans to hit the nuremberg defence with gomez , who has been included in the squad for germany 's euro 2008 qualifiers , from the start .
" there is a strong chance he will play from the outset , " said veh , who will tempt fate by not be wearing his trade-mark lucky grey suit , the one he wore when his side captured their first bundesliga title for 15 years last weekend .
having been hammered 3-0 and 4-1 by nuremberg home and away this season , stuttgart are in the hunt for some sweet revenge in saturday 's dfb cup final at berlin 's olympic stadium .
champs on the end of two thrashings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg have twice routed stuttgart this season stuttgart opened the season with a 3-0 defeat at their gottlieb-daimler-stadium and after the winter break went down 4-1 away at their deadly rivals nuremberg , so are looking to lay a few ghosts on saturday .
this is the first cup final clash between these two particular sides and both clubs have won the cup three times apiece , so it promises to be an emotional afternoon for both teams - especially their goalkeepers .
stuttgart 's shot-stopper timo hildebrand is set to join spanish giants valencia , while nuremberg 's raphael schaefer , in an ironic twist which could add to the drama , is leaving this summer to join ...
stuttgart .
schaefer will no doubt be hoping the game will not be decided on penalties and that his likely back four of dominik reinhardt , andreas wolf , the brazilian glauber and javier horacio pinola give him little to do .

with less than two weeks remaining before the june 6-8 summit , the climate document is the only unresolved issue in the statements the world leaders are expected to sign there , said the report , citing sources close to the talks .
representatives from the world 's leading industrial nations met the past two days in heiligendamm , germany , to negotiate over german chancellor angela merkel 's proposed climate statement .
it calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
us objects to drafts ' red lines ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants us progress on climate change " the us still has serious , fundamental concerns about this draft statement , " the post quotes a document dated may 14 as saying .
" the treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses multiple ' red lines ' in terms of what we simply can not agree to ...
we have tried to ' tread lightly ' but there is only so far we can go given our fundamental opposition to the german position . "
the most recent draft , dated may 24 , shows that the two sides still remain at odds , the paper said .
concessions made still not enough while germany has offered to alter language identifying a rise in global temperature of 3.6 degrees fahrenheit as a dangerous tipping point and instead to accept a russian proposal that targets a range from 2.7 to 4.5 degrees , the united states has yet to accept the modified language .

" a senior security advisor to yushchenko warned saturday that yanukovych 's camp could mount " provocations " aimed at " destabilizing the situation in the capital . " on thursday an elite paramilitary unit from the interior ministry intervened to protect the country 's pro-yanukovych prosecutor general after yushchenko ordered his dismissal . the elite forces arrived at the kiev offices where the prosecutor general was holed up and forced out the president 's security personnel . crisis reopen divisions and old wounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loyalties have once again split the people of ukraine control over interior ministry forces was also crucial in the orange revolution of 2004 , when mass street protests helped bring western-leaning yushchenko to the presidency , overturning a flawed vote initially granted to yanukovych . the latest surge in the long-running political crisis began last month when yushchenko dissolved parliament , where yanukovych 's pro-russian allies hold a majority .

fears of violence are growing as the feud between yushchenko and yanukovych drags on , with both sides competing for loyalty of the security forces . tens of thousands of troops serve in the interior ministry 's military branch .
the ministry also comprises police and paramilitary units and in general has sided with yanukovych . yushchenko 's decree assuming control over the ministry 's armed forces prompted parliament speaker oleksandr moroz , a yanukovych ally , to accuse the president of a " coup attempt . " a senior security advisor to yushchenko warned saturday that yanukovych 's camp could mount " provocations " aimed at " destabilizing the situation in the capital . " on thursday an elite paramilitary unit from the interior ministry intervened to protect the country 's pro-yanukovych prosecutor general after yushchenko ordered his dismissal . the elite forces arrived at the kiev offices where the prosecutor general was holed up and forced out the president 's security personnel . crisis reopen divisions and old wounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loyalties have once again split the people of ukraine control over interior ministry forces was also crucial in the orange revolution of 2004 , when mass street protests helped bring western-leaning yushchenko to the presidency , overturning a flawed vote initially granted to yanukovych . the latest surge in the long-running political crisis began last month when yushchenko dissolved parliament , where yanukovych 's pro-russian allies hold a majority .

thanks to the efforts of a french filmmaker , they 'll also be shown in some poorer neighborhoods in parisian suburbs . there was no red carpet and the blue mediterranean was missing , but there was plenty of enthusiasm among the hundreds of people gathered in front of a giant screen in a small park between several concrete-tower tenement houses .
this year the cannes en banlieu festival will bring cannes movie premiers to ten paris suburbs .
it was the idea of filmmaker luc besson , who says he was deeply disturbed by the 2005 riots that shook suburbs such as st. denis .
" this year was the 60th anniversary of cannes , so that was a good opportunity to link the two things and say you ca n't go to cannes , so cannes will come to you , " said besson .
" and the cannes festival was kind enough to give us films every night so we can show them to all these neighborhoods so they feel respected . "
" bridge between universes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if only they could bring the beach to paris too on a warm spring evening a crowd showed up several hours before the movie begins to enjoy local performers and even a double dutch jump rope competition .
there was colorful african dress and lots of muslim headscarves .
local singer aboo , who moved to the paris suburbs from mali when he was two year old , said he was happy he was able to perform there .
cannes is very prestigious , " said aboo , " but it 's far .
this is a great idea because it lets people get a little closer to this world of cinema .
this event can inspire young people because it will give them the chance to see a film they might not ordinarily see .
we could call it a sort of a bridge between two universes . "
not the real thing not everyone is so enthusiastic about the event , however .
" this is n't like cannes , " said a group of young men in their early twenties who said they have no jobs .
" there are no buildings like this in cannes and there are no blacks or arabs .
we 'd like to go to cannes , but we 've been stuck in this crappy place for the past 20 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out in paris ' largely immigrant suburbs in 2005 at twilight , film director luc besson took the stage to introduce a surprise guest , french comedian and film star jemal debbouz , originally from morocco .
debbouz was greeted with enthusiastic screams from fans .
make-believe " we ’ re gonna dream tonight , dream ladies and gentlemen , yes we wanna dream ! " yelled the actor to the ecstatic crowd .
on a political note , debbouz said he hoped new french president nicolas sarkozy would consider the people of saint denis and of all the suburbs .
sarkozy has been blamed for aggravating the 2005 riots with harsh words and rough tactics .
when the sky grew dark , the movie begun and the crowd grew quiet with interest .
families gathered to watch from the windows of the surrounding high rises .
even if only for a short while , the magic of cannes settled in saint denis . eleanor beardsley -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politics dominate silver screen at cannes film festival politics have always played an important role at the cannes film festival .

many estonians consider the statue a reminder of five decades of soviet occupation when their country was a soviet republic after world war ii . but the move angered moscow and estonia 's large ethnic russian minority , who see it as an affront to the memory of the fallen soldiers .
the monument is seen by russians , including the sizeable majority that lives in estonia , as a tribute to soviet soldiers who fought fascism in world war ii , while many estonians view it as a painful reminder of 50 years of soviet occupation . relations between the two countries plunged to their lowest ebb since the baltic state regained independence from the soviet union in 1991 .

the issue is , along with nato 's plans for further eastern expansion and us plans to set up a missile defense system in europe , one of several matters which have raised tensions between the european union and russia . estonia , an eu member with some 1.3 million people , has established itself as an internet pioneer since it broke away from the soviet union . russia row boosts eu identity in estonia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passion for europe has increased in recent weeks support among estonians for the eu , which the baltic state joined in 2004 , has soared since the row erupted with russia over the removal of the soviet war monument from central tallinn , a poll showed friday .
" in comparison with the end of last year , support of the people of estonia for membership of the eu , has grown significantly , " the emor polling agency said in a statement . of 1,001 people surveyed , 85 percent said they support estonia 's membership in the eu , compared with 74 percent in december , emor said . " the record-high support is linked to events at the end of last month , " emor analyst aivar voog told afp .
" the massive pressure from russia on estonia made people appreciate the eu as a security guarantee , " voog said .

with less than two weeks remaining before the june 6-8 summit , the climate document is the only unresolved issue in the statements the world leaders are expected to sign there , said the report , citing sources close to the talks .
representatives from the world 's leading industrial nations met the past two days in heiligendamm , germany , to negotiate over german chancellor angela merkel 's proposed climate statement .
it calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
us objects to drafts ' red lines ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants us progress on climate change " the us still has serious , fundamental concerns about this draft statement , " the post quotes a document dated may 14 as saying .
" the treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses multiple ' red lines ' in terms of what we simply can not agree to ...
we have tried to ' tread lightly ' but there is only so far we can go given our fundamental opposition to the german position . "
the most recent draft , dated may 24 , shows that the two sides still remain at odds , the paper said .
concessions made still not enough while germany has offered to alter language identifying a rise in global temperature of 3.6 degrees fahrenheit as a dangerous tipping point and instead to accept a russian proposal that targets a range from 2.7 to 4.5 degrees , the united states has yet to accept the modified language .

" these cyber attacks have a security dimension without any doubt and that is the reason that nato expertise was sent to estonia to see what can and should be done , " he told a meeting of lawmakers from nato member states held in funchal on the portuguese island of madeira . " does this have a security implication ?
yes , it does have a security implication .
is it relevant for nato ?
yes , it is relevant for nato .
it is a subject which i am afraid will stay on the political agenda in the times to come , " he added . nato nations have sent cyber experts to estonia , one of the 26 members in the military alliance , as has the united states to help it combat the cyber attacks which have jammed mostly government websites . estonia has said that some of the cyber attacks came from russian government computers , including the kremlin .
moscow denies any role . attacks begin after removal of monument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cyber attacks on the high-tech country began after estonian officials removed a statue on april 27 from central tallinn which commemorates soviet troops killed fighting the nazis .
many estonians consider the statue a reminder of five decades of soviet occupation when their country was a soviet republic after world war ii . but the move angered moscow and estonia 's large ethnic russian minority , who see it as an affront to the memory of the fallen soldiers .
the monument is seen by russians , including the sizeable majority that lives in estonia , as a tribute to soviet soldiers who fought fascism in world war ii , while many estonians view it as a painful reminder of 50 years of soviet occupation . relations between the two countries plunged to their lowest ebb since the baltic state regained independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
the still simmering row between the neighbors was triggered when the authorities in estonia moved a soviet war memorial from central tallinn to a military cemetery , and exhumed the bodies of red army soldiers buried beneath it . attack one , attack all , says nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's de hoop scheffer the eu , nato , united states and individual eu members have all taken estonia 's side in the row , ignoring russian calls to punish the baltic state for violating the human rights of ethnic russians .

riis made his announcement at a news conference in copenhagen , one day after two former team-mates from germany 's team telekom , erik zabel and rolf aldag , made similar confessions .
danish cyclist riis admitted that he was involved in doping from 1993 until 1998 , including the 1996 season when he won the tour de france .
riis said he used a substance called epo to boost the production of red blood cells in his body , increasing his oxygen-carrying capacity and therefore improving his endurance .
" i have taken banned substances , i have taken epo .
i bought it and took it myself , " riis said , adding that team doctors bore no responsibility for his actions .
telekom admissions set ball rolling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riis , the 1996 tour de france winner , admits epo use riis ’ admission rounds off a week of doping confessions by two former team telekom doctors and a number of former riders , including german cycling legend erik zabel , who told reporters that he took epo competing in 1996 .
even the current sports director at the t-mobile team , rolf aldag , confessed at the same press conference that he had taken epo between 1995 and 2002 .
aldag , who admitted that he lied in the past when denying doping allegation , offered to resign over the scandal .
but t-mobile ’ s team manager bob stapleton says aldag now stands for clean cycling , and that he ’ ll be allowed to keep his job .
“ i think this is an extremely healthy process .
i mean , we pushed it quite hard ourselves .
i think the fact we held a press conference where people knew things were going to come out , really prompted this small tidal wave of admissions .
i personally believe this is fundamental to moving forward in a positive way in the sport . ”

ullrich has been very quiet all week because he ’ s still facing criminal proceedings after packets of his blood were found in the offices of doping-scandal doctor eufemiano fuentes .
the office of public prosecution in bonn , which is handling the case , says it will review its evidence in light of the new admissions , and analysts say the charges could even be dropped .
one prosecution spokesman explained that the original case had been prepared under the assumption that the t-mobile directors didn ’ t know about the doping practices - something that ’ s now unclear .
jan ullrich retired in february after his involvement in the fuentes scandal and has always protested his innocence .

this year the cannes en banlieu festival will bring cannes movie premiers to ten paris suburbs .

on a political note , debbouz said he hoped new french president nicolas sarkozy would consider the people of saint denis and of all the suburbs .
sarkozy has been blamed for aggravating the 2005 riots with harsh words and rough tactics .

riis made his announcement at a news conference in copenhagen , one day after two former team-mates from germany 's team telekom , erik zabel and rolf aldag , made similar confessions .
danish cyclist riis admitted that he was involved in doping from 1993 until 1998 , including the 1996 season when he won the tour de france .
riis said he used a substance called epo to boost the production of red blood cells in his body , increasing his oxygen-carrying capacity and therefore improving his endurance .
" i have taken banned substances , i have taken epo .
i bought it and took it myself , " riis said , adding that team doctors bore no responsibility for his actions .

even the current sports director at the t-mobile team , rolf aldag , confessed at the same press conference that he had taken epo between 1995 and 2002 .
aldag , who admitted that he lied in the past when denying doping allegation , offered to resign over the scandal .
but t-mobile ’ s team manager bob stapleton says aldag now stands for clean cycling , and that he ’ ll be allowed to keep his job .
“ i think this is an extremely healthy process .

with less than two weeks remaining before the june 6-8 summit , the climate document is the only unresolved issue in the statements the world leaders are expected to sign there , said the report , citing sources close to the talks .
representatives from the world 's leading industrial nations met the past two days in heiligendamm , germany , to negotiate over german chancellor angela merkel 's proposed climate statement .
it calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
us objects to drafts ' red lines ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants us progress on climate change " the us still has serious , fundamental concerns about this draft statement , " the post quotes a document dated may 14 as saying .
" the treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses multiple ' red lines ' in terms of what we simply can not agree to ...
we have tried to ' tread lightly ' but there is only so far we can go given our fundamental opposition to the german position . "
the most recent draft , dated may 24 , shows that the two sides still remain at odds , the paper said .
concessions made still not enough while germany has offered to alter language identifying a rise in global temperature of 3.6 degrees fahrenheit as a dangerous tipping point and instead to accept a russian proposal that targets a range from 2.7 to 4.5 degrees , the united states has yet to accept the modified language .
the post said that the united states also remains opposed to a statement that reads , " we acknowledge that the un climate process is an appropriate forum for negotiating future global action on climate change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 26.05.2007 more confessions as merkel urges doping cyclists to come clean großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who have slipped through the tester 's net are now confessing in large numbers german chancellor angela merkel has urged all cyclists involved in doping to own up and come clean as more confessions from top stars pile up in what is becoming the sport 's biggest ever scandal . her appeal came as retired danish cycling star bjarne riis ended months of speculation by admitting that he used blood doping in his 1996 tour de france win .
riis made his announcement at a news conference in copenhagen , one day after two former team-mates from germany 's team telekom , erik zabel and rolf aldag , made similar confessions .
danish cyclist riis admitted that he was involved in doping from 1993 until 1998 , including the 1996 season when he won the tour de france .
riis said he used a substance called epo to boost the production of red blood cells in his body , increasing his oxygen-carrying capacity and therefore improving his endurance .
" i have taken banned substances , i have taken epo .
i bought it and took it myself , " riis said , adding that team doctors bore no responsibility for his actions .
telekom admissions set ball rolling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riis , the 1996 tour de france winner , admits epo use riis ’ admission rounds off a week of doping confessions by two former team telekom doctors and a number of former riders , including german cycling legend erik zabel , who told reporters that he took epo competing in 1996 .
even the current sports director at the t-mobile team , rolf aldag , confessed at the same press conference that he had taken epo between 1995 and 2002 .
aldag , who admitted that he lied in the past when denying doping allegation , offered to resign over the scandal .
but t-mobile ’ s team manager bob stapleton says aldag now stands for clean cycling , and that he ’ ll be allowed to keep his job .
“ i think this is an extremely healthy process .
i mean , we pushed it quite hard ourselves .
i think the fact we held a press conference where people knew things were going to come out , really prompted this small tidal wave of admissions .
i personally believe this is fundamental to moving forward in a positive way in the sport . ”
silver lining for ullrich ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich could step out of the darkness into the light one of the few positive developments to arise from this avalanche of scandal and admission could mean a reprieve for germany ’ s most controversial cycling star jan ullrich .
ullrich has been very quiet all week because he ’ s still facing criminal proceedings after packets of his blood were found in the offices of doping-scandal doctor eufemiano fuentes .
the office of public prosecution in bonn , which is handling the case , says it will review its evidence in light of the new admissions , and analysts say the charges could even be dropped .
one prosecution spokesman explained that the original case had been prepared under the assumption that the t-mobile directors didn ’ t know about the doping practices - something that ’ s now unclear .

the ministry also comprises police and paramilitary units and in general has sided with yanukovych . yushchenko 's decree assuming control over the ministry 's armed forces prompted parliament speaker oleksandr moroz , a yanukovych ally , to accuse the president of a " coup attempt . " a senior security advisor to yushchenko warned saturday that yanukovych 's camp could mount " provocations " aimed at " destabilizing the situation in the capital .

moscow denies any role . attacks begin after removal of monument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cyber attacks on the high-tech country began after estonian officials removed a statue on april 27 from central tallinn which commemorates soviet troops killed fighting the nazis .
many estonians consider the statue a reminder of five decades of soviet occupation when their country was a soviet republic after world war ii . but the move angered moscow and estonia 's large ethnic russian minority , who see it as an affront to the memory of the fallen soldiers .
the monument is seen by russians , including the sizeable majority that lives in estonia , as a tribute to soviet soldiers who fought fascism in world war ii , while many estonians view it as a painful reminder of 50 years of soviet occupation . relations between the two countries plunged to their lowest ebb since the baltic state regained independence from the soviet union in 1991 .

thanks to the efforts of a french filmmaker , they 'll also be shown in some poorer neighborhoods in parisian suburbs . there was no red carpet and the blue mediterranean was missing , but there was plenty of enthusiasm among the hundreds of people gathered in front of a giant screen in a small park between several concrete-tower tenement houses .
this year the cannes en banlieu festival will bring cannes movie premiers to ten paris suburbs .
it was the idea of filmmaker luc besson , who says he was deeply disturbed by the 2005 riots that shook suburbs such as st. denis .

having used him as an impact player from the bench , stuttgart coach armin veh revealed his plans to hit the nuremberg defence with gomez , who has been included in the squad for germany 's euro 2008 qualifiers , from the start .
" there is a strong chance he will play from the outset , " said veh , who will tempt fate by not be wearing his trade-mark lucky grey suit , the one he wore when his side captured their first bundesliga title for 15 years last weekend .
having been hammered 3-0 and 4-1 by nuremberg home and away this season , stuttgart are in the hunt for some sweet revenge in saturday 's dfb cup final at berlin 's olympic stadium .
champs on the end of two thrashings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg have twice routed stuttgart this season stuttgart opened the season with a 3-0 defeat at their gottlieb-daimler-stadium and after the winter break went down 4-1 away at their deadly rivals nuremberg , so are looking to lay a few ghosts on saturday .
this is the first cup final clash between these two particular sides and both clubs have won the cup three times apiece , so it promises to be an emotional afternoon for both teams - especially their goalkeepers .
stuttgart 's shot-stopper timo hildebrand is set to join spanish giants valencia , while nuremberg 's raphael schaefer , in an ironic twist which could add to the drama , is leaving this summer to join ...
stuttgart .
schaefer will no doubt be hoping the game will not be decided on penalties and that his likely back four of dominik reinhardt , andreas wolf , the brazilian glauber and javier horacio pinola give him little to do .
nuremberg smell a cup upset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sides will be hoping for better conditions in the final pinola said after training on thursday that he feels a nuremberg win is in the air and wolf was just as optimistic , saying : " we are very confident of our chances . "
but for nuremberg striker , markus schroth , who wants to give hildebrand the worst possible send off in his last game having spent the last 12 years at stuttgart , the bundesliga is now history .
" the league is over , " he said , " now we are onto something quite special , we play as a tight unit and we 'll know exactly what to do on saturday .

riis made his announcement at a news conference in copenhagen , one day after two former team-mates from germany 's team telekom , erik zabel and rolf aldag , made similar confessions .
danish cyclist riis admitted that he was involved in doping from 1993 until 1998 , including the 1996 season when he won the tour de france .
riis said he used a substance called epo to boost the production of red blood cells in his body , increasing his oxygen-carrying capacity and therefore improving his endurance .
" i have taken banned substances , i have taken epo .
i bought it and took it myself , " riis said , adding that team doctors bore no responsibility for his actions .
telekom admissions set ball rolling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riis , the 1996 tour de france winner , admits epo use riis ’ admission rounds off a week of doping confessions by two former team telekom doctors and a number of former riders , including german cycling legend erik zabel , who told reporters that he took epo competing in 1996 .
even the current sports director at the t-mobile team , rolf aldag , confessed at the same press conference that he had taken epo between 1995 and 2002 .
aldag , who admitted that he lied in the past when denying doping allegation , offered to resign over the scandal .
but t-mobile ’ s team manager bob stapleton says aldag now stands for clean cycling , and that he ’ ll be allowed to keep his job .
“ i think this is an extremely healthy process .
i mean , we pushed it quite hard ourselves .
i think the fact we held a press conference where people knew things were going to come out , really prompted this small tidal wave of admissions .
i personally believe this is fundamental to moving forward in a positive way in the sport . ”
silver lining for ullrich ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich could step out of the darkness into the light one of the few positive developments to arise from this avalanche of scandal and admission could mean a reprieve for germany ’ s most controversial cycling star jan ullrich .
ullrich has been very quiet all week because he ’ s still facing criminal proceedings after packets of his blood were found in the offices of doping-scandal doctor eufemiano fuentes .
the office of public prosecution in bonn , which is handling the case , says it will review its evidence in light of the new admissions , and analysts say the charges could even be dropped .
one prosecution spokesman explained that the original case had been prepared under the assumption that the t-mobile directors didn ’ t know about the doping practices - something that ’ s now unclear .
jan ullrich retired in february after his involvement in the fuentes scandal and has always protested his innocence .
but even his lawyer hans-michael diestel said on german television on thursday that successful high-performance sport was not possible without doping these days .
a few hours later he was fired . sam edmonds -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " mass doping is now the order of the day " peter danckert , chairman of the parliamentary committee on sports , spoke with dw-world.de about the recent slough of doping confessions , germany 's new anti-doping law and what the sport world can do better .

" a senior security advisor to yushchenko warned saturday that yanukovych 's camp could mount " provocations " aimed at " destabilizing the situation in the capital .

yes , it does have a security implication .
is it relevant for nato ?
yes , it is relevant for nato .
it is a subject which i am afraid will stay on the political agenda in the times to come , " he added . nato nations have sent cyber experts to estonia , one of the 26 members in the military alliance , as has the united states to help it combat the cyber attacks which have jammed mostly government websites . estonia has said that some of the cyber attacks came from russian government computers , including the kremlin .
moscow denies any role . attacks begin after removal of monument bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cyber attacks on the high-tech country began after estonian officials removed a statue on april 27 from central tallinn which commemorates soviet troops killed fighting the nazis .
many estonians consider the statue a reminder of five decades of soviet occupation when their country was a soviet republic after world war ii . but the move angered moscow and estonia 's large ethnic russian minority , who see it as an affront to the memory of the fallen soldiers .
the monument is seen by russians , including the sizeable majority that lives in estonia , as a tribute to soviet soldiers who fought fascism in world war ii , while many estonians view it as a painful reminder of 50 years of soviet occupation . relations between the two countries plunged to their lowest ebb since the baltic state regained independence from the soviet union in 1991 .
the still simmering row between the neighbors was triggered when the authorities in estonia moved a soviet war memorial from central tallinn to a military cemetery , and exhumed the bodies of red army soldiers buried beneath it . attack one , attack all , says nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's de hoop scheffer the eu , nato , united states and individual eu members have all taken estonia 's side in the row , ignoring russian calls to punish the baltic state for violating the human rights of ethnic russians .
the western powers have all taken the side of estonia in the wake of the alleged cyber-attacks , angering the russians further . nato 's treaty states that an armed attack on one of its members is " an attack against them all " and some commentators in estonia have argued that this means nato is obliged help it respond to the cyber attacks .
the issue is , along with nato 's plans for further eastern expansion and us plans to set up a missile defense system in europe , one of several matters which have raised tensions between the european union and russia . estonia , an eu member with some 1.3 million people , has established itself as an internet pioneer since it broke away from the soviet union . russia row boosts eu identity in estonia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passion for europe has increased in recent weeks support among estonians for the eu , which the baltic state joined in 2004 , has soared since the row erupted with russia over the removal of the soviet war monument from central tallinn , a poll showed friday .
" in comparison with the end of last year , support of the people of estonia for membership of the eu , has grown significantly , " the emor polling agency said in a statement . of 1,001 people surveyed , 85 percent said they support estonia 's membership in the eu , compared with 74 percent in december , emor said . " the record-high support is linked to events at the end of last month , " emor analyst aivar voog told afp .
" the massive pressure from russia on estonia made people appreciate the eu as a security guarantee , " voog said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 26.05.2007 report : us rejects germany 's g8 climate declaration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if looks could kill : merkel and bush may have harsh words on the climate at g8 the united states has raised new serious objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by germany for next month 's group of eight summit , the washington post reported saturday . citing documents obtained by the newspaper , the report said officials representing the administration of president george w. bush rejected the idea of setting mandatory emissions targets as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .
with less than two weeks remaining before the june 6-8 summit , the climate document is the only unresolved issue in the statements the world leaders are expected to sign there , said the report , citing sources close to the talks .
representatives from the world 's leading industrial nations met the past two days in heiligendamm , germany , to negotiate over german chancellor angela merkel 's proposed climate statement .
it calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
us objects to drafts ' red lines ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants us progress on climate change " the us still has serious , fundamental concerns about this draft statement , " the post quotes a document dated may 14 as saying .
" the treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses multiple ' red lines ' in terms of what we simply can not agree to ...
we have tried to ' tread lightly ' but there is only so far we can go given our fundamental opposition to the german position . "
the most recent draft , dated may 24 , shows that the two sides still remain at odds , the paper said .
concessions made still not enough while germany has offered to alter language identifying a rise in global temperature of 3.6 degrees fahrenheit as a dangerous tipping point and instead to accept a russian proposal that targets a range from 2.7 to 4.5 degrees , the united states has yet to accept the modified language .
the post said that the united states also remains opposed to a statement that reads , " we acknowledge that the un climate process is an appropriate forum for negotiating future global action on climate change . " dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel sets g8 agenda , doubts concrete results climate change , development aid and hedge-fund transparency would top the agenda at the g8 summit on june 6-8 , said chancellor angela merkel thursday , but she was n't confident that much progress would be made .
-lrb- 24.05.2007 -rrb- eu urged to take lead on battling climate change at a summit starting thursday , the european union will seek to thrash out a common policy in fighting climate change , with plans to set tough targets for cutting carbon dioxide emissions .

"
ukrainian television showed footage of blue interior ministry buses driving in a long column , the day after yuschenko issued a decree assuming control of the ministry 's forces . according to the interior ministry , the troops were deployed by the commander of the ministry 's military branch , olexander kikhtenko , who backs yushchenko and no longer recognizes the authority of pro-yanukovych interior minister vassyl tsushko .
the commander " acts according to his own logic and his own view , " tsushko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency . tsushko appealed for calm , asking " politicians to be more restrained . " " it 's necessary to calm down .

fears of violence are growing as the feud between yushchenko and yanukovych drags on , with both sides competing for loyalty of the security forces . tens of thousands of troops serve in the interior ministry 's military branch .
the ministry also comprises police and paramilitary units and in general has sided with yanukovych . yushchenko 's decree assuming control over the ministry 's armed forces prompted parliament speaker oleksandr moroz , a yanukovych ally , to accuse the president of a " coup attempt . " a senior security advisor to yushchenko warned saturday that yanukovych 's camp could mount " provocations " aimed at " destabilizing the situation in the capital . " on thursday an elite paramilitary unit from the interior ministry intervened to protect the country 's pro-yanukovych prosecutor general after yushchenko ordered his dismissal . the elite forces arrived at the kiev offices where the prosecutor general was holed up and forced out the president 's security personnel . crisis reopen divisions and old wounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loyalties have once again split the people of ukraine control over interior ministry forces was also crucial in the orange revolution of 2004 , when mass street protests helped bring western-leaning yushchenko to the presidency , overturning a flawed vote initially granted to yanukovych . the latest surge in the long-running political crisis began last month when yushchenko dissolved parliament , where yanukovych 's pro-russian allies hold a majority .

having used him as an impact player from the bench , stuttgart coach armin veh revealed his plans to hit the nuremberg defence with gomez , who has been included in the squad for germany 's euro 2008 qualifiers , from the start .
" there is a strong chance he will play from the outset , " said veh , who will tempt fate by not be wearing his trade-mark lucky grey suit , the one he wore when his side captured their first bundesliga title for 15 years last weekend .
having been hammered 3-0 and 4-1 by nuremberg home and away this season , stuttgart are in the hunt for some sweet revenge in saturday 's dfb cup final at berlin 's olympic stadium .
champs on the end of two thrashings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg have twice routed stuttgart this season stuttgart opened the season with a 3-0 defeat at their gottlieb-daimler-stadium and after the winter break went down 4-1 away at their deadly rivals nuremberg , so are looking to lay a few ghosts on saturday .
this is the first cup final clash between these two particular sides and both clubs have won the cup three times apiece , so it promises to be an emotional afternoon for both teams - especially their goalkeepers .
stuttgart 's shot-stopper timo hildebrand is set to join spanish giants valencia , while nuremberg 's raphael schaefer , in an ironic twist which could add to the drama , is leaving this summer to join ...
stuttgart .
schaefer will no doubt be hoping the game will not be decided on penalties and that his likely back four of dominik reinhardt , andreas wolf , the brazilian glauber and javier horacio pinola give him little to do .
nuremberg smell a cup upset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sides will be hoping for better conditions in the final pinola said after training on thursday that he feels a nuremberg win is in the air and wolf was just as optimistic , saying : " we are very confident of our chances . "
but for nuremberg striker , markus schroth , who wants to give hildebrand the worst possible send off in his last game having spent the last 12 years at stuttgart , the bundesliga is now history .

riis made his announcement at a news conference in copenhagen , one day after two former team-mates from germany 's team telekom , erik zabel and rolf aldag , made similar confessions .
danish cyclist riis admitted that he was involved in doping from 1993 until 1998 , including the 1996 season when he won the tour de france .
riis said he used a substance called epo to boost the production of red blood cells in his body , increasing his oxygen-carrying capacity and therefore improving his endurance .
" i have taken banned substances , i have taken epo .
i bought it and took it myself , " riis said , adding that team doctors bore no responsibility for his actions .

even the current sports director at the t-mobile team , rolf aldag , confessed at the same press conference that he had taken epo between 1995 and 2002 .
aldag , who admitted that he lied in the past when denying doping allegation , offered to resign over the scandal .
but t-mobile ’ s team manager bob stapleton says aldag now stands for clean cycling , and that he ’ ll be allowed to keep his job .
“ i think this is an extremely healthy process .
i mean , we pushed it quite hard ourselves .
i think the fact we held a press conference where people knew things were going to come out , really prompted this small tidal wave of admissions .
i personally believe this is fundamental to moving forward in a positive way in the sport . ”

riis made his announcement at a news conference in copenhagen , one day after two former team-mates from germany 's team telekom , erik zabel and rolf aldag , made similar confessions .
danish cyclist riis admitted that he was involved in doping from 1993 until 1998 , including the 1996 season when he won the tour de france .
riis said he used a substance called epo to boost the production of red blood cells in his body , increasing his oxygen-carrying capacity and therefore improving his endurance .
" i have taken banned substances , i have taken epo .
i bought it and took it myself , " riis said , adding that team doctors bore no responsibility for his actions .
telekom admissions set ball rolling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riis , the 1996 tour de france winner , admits epo use riis ’ admission rounds off a week of doping confessions by two former team telekom doctors and a number of former riders , including german cycling legend erik zabel , who told reporters that he took epo competing in 1996 .
even the current sports director at the t-mobile team , rolf aldag , confessed at the same press conference that he had taken epo between 1995 and 2002 .
aldag , who admitted that he lied in the past when denying doping allegation , offered to resign over the scandal .
but t-mobile ’ s team manager bob stapleton says aldag now stands for clean cycling , and that he ’ ll be allowed to keep his job .
“ i think this is an extremely healthy process .
i mean , we pushed it quite hard ourselves .
i think the fact we held a press conference where people knew things were going to come out , really prompted this small tidal wave of admissions .
i personally believe this is fundamental to moving forward in a positive way in the sport . ”
silver lining for ullrich ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich could step out of the darkness into the light one of the few positive developments to arise from this avalanche of scandal and admission could mean a reprieve for germany ’ s most controversial cycling star jan ullrich .
ullrich has been very quiet all week because he ’ s still facing criminal proceedings after packets of his blood were found in the offices of doping-scandal doctor eufemiano fuentes .
the office of public prosecution in bonn , which is handling the case , says it will review its evidence in light of the new admissions , and analysts say the charges could even be dropped .
one prosecution spokesman explained that the original case had been prepared under the assumption that the t-mobile directors didn ’ t know about the doping practices - something that ’ s now unclear .
jan ullrich retired in february after his involvement in the fuentes scandal and has always protested his innocence .
but even his lawyer hans-michael diestel said on german television on thursday that successful high-performance sport was not possible without doping these days .
a few hours later he was fired . sam edmonds -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " mass doping is now the order of the day " peter danckert , chairman of the parliamentary committee on sports , spoke with dw-world.de about the recent slough of doping confessions , germany 's new anti-doping law and what the sport world can do better .
-lrb- 24.05.2007 -rrb- t-mobile doping confessions keep mounting the list of those confessing to doping in germany 's biggest cycling team just keeps on growing .
now , t-mobile 's sport director rolf aldag and former tour rider erik zabel have come clean .
-lrb- 24.05.2007 -rrb- team t-mobile under fire from doping admissions germany 's largest cycling team is in crisis after two ex-riders said team doctors administered the banned substance epo .
the admissions have cast a shadow over the telekom team 's tour de france victories in the 1990s .

inside the halls the convention was filled with jedi knights , stormtroopers , hairy wookies and wannabe darth vaders .
many fans recreated key scenes from the six films for the cameras .
princess leia 's famous bikini slave scene from return of the jedi was particularly popular .
for those not in costume , the convention offered plentiful opportunities to buy the latest in star wars merchandise .
some fell foul of heightened security procedures in place for the convention .
actors from all six star wars films - including david prowse , the real man inside the famous darth vader costume - were on hand for autographs .

full-back bale , 17 , wales 's youngest international , has finalised his £ 10m move from southampton to tottenham .
his early talent was spotted at whitchurch high school in cardiff .
head of pe gwyn morris said he rated the teenager as one of the most talented pupils he had taught , but said bale remained " so modest " .
bale shot to prominence in 2006 when he made his southampton debut at 16 , followed closely by his first appearance for wales in a 2-1 win over trinidad and tobago .
in october , he became the youngest player the score for wales with a free-kick in a defeat to slovakia at cardiff 's millennium stadium . "

but his former pe teacher said such a high-profile move would not affect the teenager .
mr morris said : " he 's just gareth bale , he 's had a good upbringing and he 's a strong young man , " said gwyn morris .
" i came to whitchurch when he was in year nine so he was about 14 and he had already been spotted by southampton then .
" he was such a gifted young man even then and he had the attitude and commitment to go with it .
" i 've said it before , but he had such a fierce determination to succeed but remains so modest and was one of the most talented pupils i 've ever had the pleasure to teach . "
mr morris said bale 's obvious football skills meant teachers could challenge him during sports lessons .
" we banned him from using his left foot , " said mr morris .
" but even though we did that , he was still as good with his right foot !
" we wanted him to be challenged and to focus on certain areas to help him in the future .
" tactically and skill wise , he is doing super . "
he also remained unchanged by success , according to mr morris .
" he was always one of the lads and he still comes to school sometimes to visit because his year group are still here in the sixth form , " he said .
" he 's such a level-headed young man and still has a kick-about with the boys on the common - that 's the sort of boy he is .

full-back bale , 17 , wales 's youngest international , has finalised his £ 10m move from southampton to tottenham .
his early talent was spotted at whitchurch high school in cardiff .
head of pe gwyn morris said he rated the teenager as one of the most talented pupils he had taught , but said bale remained " so modest " .
bale shot to prominence in 2006 when he made his southampton debut at 16 , followed closely by his first appearance for wales in a 2-1 win over trinidad and tobago .
in october , he became the youngest player the score for wales with a free-kick in a defeat to slovakia at cardiff 's millennium stadium .
when i saw him playing for wales , it brought a lump to my throat gwyn morris he has been a rumoured transfer target for premiership clubs including manchester united , but opted to sign for spurs .
spurs will make a first payment of £ 5m , and extra instalments could see it go up to £ 10m .
but his former pe teacher said such a high-profile move would not affect the teenager .
mr morris said : " he 's just gareth bale , he 's had a good upbringing and he 's a strong young man , " said gwyn morris .
" i came to whitchurch when he was in year nine so he was about 14 and he had already been spotted by southampton then .
" he was such a gifted young man even then and he had the attitude and commitment to go with it .
" i 've said it before , but he had such a fierce determination to succeed but remains so modest and was one of the most talented pupils i 've ever had the pleasure to teach . "
gareth bale still keeps in touch with his old school in cardiff mr morris said bale 's obvious football skills meant teachers could challenge him during sports lessons .
" we banned him from using his left foot , " said mr morris .
" but even though we did that , he was still as good with his right foot !
" we wanted him to be challenged and to focus on certain areas to help him in the future .
" tactically and skill wise , he is doing super . "
he also remained unchanged by success , according to mr morris .
" he was always one of the lads and he still comes to school sometimes to visit because his year group are still here in the sixth form , " he said .
