" he might have been misguided by people around him , but he was n't harmless , " schily said . he added there were indications that when kurnaz was arrested in 2001 , he was actually on his way to train as a terrorist in afghanistan .
schily said it was the duty of the secret service to do everything possible to avert the danger of terrorism . he also said the government had supported kurnaz ' repatriation to turkey .
but at the same time , schily said , he was n't aware of an offer from the usa in 2002 to set kurnaz free . criticism of the us the former interior minister also stressed that the responsibility for guantanamo rested firmly with the united states .

" i wo n't allow the blame for what happened in guantanamo to be laid at the door of the -lrb- social democratic-green -rrb- government , " schily said . kurnaz was eventually freed after chancellor angela merkel came to power due to a lack of proof that he belonged to a terrorist group .
he lives in the northern german city of bremen . steinmeier faces questioning steinmeier is to speak before the committee later on thursday afternoon , in his second appearance before the investigative committee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz was released after the intervention of current chancellor angela merkel free democratic party chairman max stadler , who heads the bnd committee , has accused steinmeier of contradictory behavior .
stadler said he wants steinmeier to explain why he was actively against the return of kurnaz while chief of staff , but then pushed for his release as foreign minister . the human rights organization amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- said the former social democratic-green government had a " clear co-responsibility " for kurnaz ' lengthy detention . " the government did n't push for the early release of kurnaz from his nearly five-years of degrading detention even though he was n't proven guilty , " the head of ai 's german branch , barbara lochbihler said . the german government should pay kurnaz damages because it was responsible for delaying the man 's release , the united nation 's special investigator on torture , manfred nowak , told german broadcaster bayerische runkfunk . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ex-spy chief defends labeling guantanamo inmate security risk as chancellery chief of staff , current foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was aware of the interior ministry 's plans to keep a german-born guantanamo bay prisoner out of the country , a high-ranking official said .

naturally , -lrb- the release -rrb- will be suspended and it will not take place , " larijani said on state television . his announcement came a day after london said it was freezing ties with iran . larijani , who is also iran 's chief negotiator in its nuclear dispute with western powers , also threatened to pursue a " legal path " in the crisis , which has caused global concerns and sent oil prices to six month highs . " instead of sending a technical team to examine the problem , they kicked up a media storm , announced a freeze in relations and spoke about the security council .
that will not resolve the problem .

the film provoked a furious reaction in the british government which suspects she spoke under duress . the footage showed the britons having a meal and featured the 26-year-old turney wearing a black headscarf .
" obviously we trespassed in the waters , " she said .
" they were friendly , very hospitable , very thoughtful .
nice people , " she said of her captors . access denied the british embassy in tehran said it still had no news about the location of the sailors and had not been able to visit them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says the britons were in iranian waters at six different points " we have no information for the moment about a consular visit with the 15 sailors and the release of faye turney , " a british diplomat told afp .

without a number of established stars , the debutants gave a good account of themselves . germany 's soccer stars were the toast of the nation after their winning in prague at the weekend .
the victory over the czech republic left joachim löw 's men top of their european championship qualifying group and the team is now the favorite to reach the final stages next summer . on wednesday though , it was an almost unrecognizable side that took to the field for the friendly game against denmark . löw fielded a team missing stars like michael ballack , miroslav klose and jens lehmann .
in their place , the german coach brought in young stars robert enke , simon rolfes and roberto hibert . including substitutes , a total of seven players wore the national team colors for the first time ever in the friendly against denmark in duisburg as löw experimented without the pressure of a qualifying match . danes rob löw of undefeated title bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niclas bendtner , right , ended löw 's unbeaten run but the undefeated coach paid the price in the end , with his first reverse in charge of the national side .
danish striker niclas bendtner scored the only goal in the 82nd minute after connecting with a good cross from jesper groenkjar . however , löw was happy with his fledgling stars . " we are always being told to support young players in germany , and that is what we are doing , " he told ard television .
" we talked about it last october and have pretty quickly put it into practice . " it was down to experience , " the coach added .
" there were a lot of young players out there and it was a very important game for their development .
one day they will have to replace frings , ballack or klose .
we took the risk that we might lose the game , but it was great experience for the youngsters . " the most impressive of the debutants does n't even play top-flight soccer .
patrick helmes , from second division cologne , had three great chances to score despite only coming on late in the game . " it was a great feeling and a great honor , " helmes said .
" but on the other hand , i 'm disappointed because we did n't win .
a goal for me would have been the crowning glory but it was n't to be .
i 'll just have to try again against koblenz on sunday . " composed first-half per formance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's youngsters held their own until the 82nd minute it was the first international game to be played in duisburg since 1933 , and although the fans were a little disappointed at not seeing their heroes from the world cup , the new , young team did inspire the crowd in the first half with some neat passing movements . however the tempo dropped a little after the restart as both teams took the game 's " friendly " label rather too literally as neither side looked intent on challenging or fighting for the ball in a very gentlemanly opening . denmark , fielding their strongest side , had the better of the chances in the second half but , despite some signs of dissatisfaction from the supporters , a very young and inexperienced germany side certainly held their own on the international stage . even in defeat , it was a promising sign for the future . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de löw to blood german youngsters much to denmark 's chagrin germany 's coach joachim löw will ring the changes for wednesday night 's friendly against denmark by announcing an inexperienced 16-man squad aimed at blooding some of his rising stars .

that 's due to injuries , but it also reflects the plethora of young talent he has at his disposal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.03.2007 german parliament debates living wills for the dying großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors face uncertainty over living wills germany 's parliament debates the issue of living wills on thursday , as those involved in caring for the terminally ill demand a legal framework for patients to set out their treatment wishes . it is unconstitutional in germany for a doctor to treat a person against his or her will , even if the patient is at risk of dying .
but when it comes to those who ca n't communicate a so-called living will can help . the german parliament will debate the sensitive issue on thursday when parliamentarians consider draft legal guidelines that would apply to living wills .
more than 30 members of parliament have signed up to speak , three times more than usually do during bundestag debates . an estimated 8 million germans have made out a living will , setting out how they wish to be treated by medical staff in case of an accident or terminal illness .
for example , in a living will , a person might specify that her life-support machines should be turned off if they are still necessary four weeks after a bad accident . currently the legal framework around living wills is unclear and open to multiple interpretations .
many have read a 2003 decision by germany 's federal court as ruling that a stipulation to end medical treatment is only binding if the illness or injury will inevitably lead to death .
however , others have read the ruling differently . a draft guideline introduced by wolfgang bosbach of the conservative union bloc of parties would make patient stipulations regarding treatment or resuscitation only valid in the case of irreversible , terminal illness or injury . an alternative draft , presented by social democratic parliamentarian joachim stünker , gives the wishes of the patient highest priority . new guidelines needed ? according to urban wiesing of germany 's federal chamber of physicians , doctors are acting correctly if they follow instructions given in a living will now , even if the patient dies .
" it is the will of the patient that counts , " wiesing said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could pass a law on living wills later this year however , wiesing stressed that doctors are still required to follow german law .

but when it comes to those who ca n't communicate a so-called living will can help . the german parliament will debate the sensitive issue on thursday when parliamentarians consider draft legal guidelines that would apply to living wills .
more than 30 members of parliament have signed up to speak , three times more than usually do during bundestag debates . an estimated 8 million germans have made out a living will , setting out how they wish to be treated by medical staff in case of an accident or terminal illness .
for example , in a living will , a person might specify that her life-support machines should be turned off if they are still necessary four weeks after a bad accident . currently the legal framework around living wills is unclear and open to multiple interpretations .
many have read a 2003 decision by germany 's federal court as ruling that a stipulation to end medical treatment is only binding if the illness or injury will inevitably lead to death .
however , others have read the ruling differently . a draft guideline introduced by wolfgang bosbach of the conservative union bloc of parties would make patient stipulations regarding treatment or resuscitation only valid in the case of irreversible , terminal illness or injury . an alternative draft , presented by social democratic parliamentarian joachim stünker , gives the wishes of the patient highest priority . new guidelines needed ? according to urban wiesing of germany 's federal chamber of physicians , doctors are acting correctly if they follow instructions given in a living will now , even if the patient dies .
" it is the will of the patient that counts , " wiesing said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could pass a law on living wills later this year however , wiesing stressed that doctors are still required to follow german law .

but when it comes to those who ca n't communicate a so-called living will can help . the german parliament will debate the sensitive issue on thursday when parliamentarians consider draft legal guidelines that would apply to living wills .
more than 30 members of parliament have signed up to speak , three times more than usually do during bundestag debates . an estimated 8 million germans have made out a living will , setting out how they wish to be treated by medical staff in case of an accident or terminal illness .
for example , in a living will , a person might specify that her life-support machines should be turned off if they are still necessary four weeks after a bad accident . currently the legal framework around living wills is unclear and open to multiple interpretations .
many have read a 2003 decision by germany 's federal court as ruling that a stipulation to end medical treatment is only binding if the illness or injury will inevitably lead to death .
however , others have read the ruling differently . a draft guideline introduced by wolfgang bosbach of the conservative union bloc of parties would make patient stipulations regarding treatment or resuscitation only valid in the case of irreversible , terminal illness or injury . an alternative draft , presented by social democratic parliamentarian joachim stünker , gives the wishes of the patient highest priority . new guidelines needed ? according to urban wiesing of germany 's federal chamber of physicians , doctors are acting correctly if they follow instructions given in a living will now , even if the patient dies .
" it is the will of the patient that counts , " wiesing said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could pass a law on living wills later this year however , wiesing stressed that doctors are still required to follow german law .
" if a patient asks for medically assisted suicide , a doctor ca n't do that because that 's illegal , " he said . his group , along with the marburger bund doctors ' federation , has come out against putting new legal guidelines in place , saying that patients need only to be better informed about what goes into making a living will . " we are solving a problem here that was only created through politicians ' debate of the issue , " frank ulrich montgomery , head of the marburger bund , told the passauer neue presse newspaper . call for regulation at the moment there is no legal framework setting out how a living will should be made . that means medical staff are bound to consider even a couple of lines that a patient scribbled on a scrap of paper .
but such information can lead to more uncertainty about a person 's wishes , because their instructions are often too nebulous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal chamber of physicians is against regulating living wills " it needs to be more detailed , " said wolfgang kramer from the german hospice foundation .
" in our experience , people write something down , but it ca n't be used in a concrete situation because it 's too unspecific . " the german hospice foundation offers consultations on how to make a living will .
because there are so many topics to cover , the appointments usually last more than 90 minutes , and the result is a seven-page document . " at the beginning there are wishes such as ' i do n't want to suffer ' or ' i do n't want to end up attached to a tube , " ' kramer said .
" but when you explain the different possibilities and the kinds of conditions that come with certain illnesses , then people make completely different decisions . " wiesing from the federal chamber of physicians was hesitant about calling for government regulation of living wills . " currently , the situation is n't that clear - both for patients and doctors , " he said .
" we should all try to reduce this uncertainty but not at the cost of individual rights .

schily said it was the duty of the secret service to do everything possible to avert the danger of terrorism . he also said the government had supported kurnaz ' repatriation to turkey .

11 attacks in 2001 . there were " good reasons " why kurnaz had been categorized as a possible radical-islamist " sleeper " and a security risk , steinmeier told the committee , which is investigating cooperation between the former social democratic-green party coalition under gerhard schröder with the unites states ' " war on terror . " kurnaz was arrested in pakistan just weeks after sept .
11 and handed over to us authorities .
he eventually landed in the us detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba , where he says he was tortured until his release without charges in august 2006 . vote against kurnaz ' return in october 2002 , steinmeier - who was then schröder 's chief of staff - led a committee of german secret service officials which voted against allowing kurnaz to return to germany .
steinmeier has denied the united states offered to release kurnaz in 2002 , as has been alleged by german media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz says he was tortured in guantanamo " the us never considered releasing him , " steinmeier said . he also stressed that the government had " tried many times to intervene " in the case , but the plan was to return kurnaz to turkey , where he had citizenship , rather than to germany , where kurnaz had been born but for which he only had a residence permit . " in october 2002 , germany was considered to be a direct target for attacks , " the foreign minister said . " attack warnings came on a weekly basis . we reckoned with an estimated 3,000 sleepers , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.03.2007 germans fear new far-left union could threaten establishment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left offers a haven for german left wingers who feel underserved a new , far-left german political party , called simply the left , was recently made official .
some say it could seriously damage the country 's ruling center-left social democrats . when delegates from germany 's two biggest far-left parties overwhelmingly backed a formal merger on sunday , it was a penultimate step toward establishing " dielinke " -lrb- the left -rrb- as the country 's fourth-largest political party . observers say the party poses a credible threat to the social democratic party , the traditional home of germany 's left wing .
the spd is currently part of the uneasy " grand coalition " government that rules together with angela merkel 's center-right christian democratic union / christian socialist union bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its official : party delegates vote in favor of a wasg-pds union on sunday , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , a successor to the communist party of east germany , and the labor and social justice party -lrb- wasg -rrb- , a western splinter group led by former spd chairman oskar lafontaine , officially approved the merger .
the new party , dielinke . -lrb- period included -rrb- will be formally called into life at a conference in june . heavy losses at the spd the pds and wasg first campaigned under one banner in the snap national elections in 2005 , where they got a respectable 8.7 percent of the vote .
that result landed them the fourth slot on the national political scene . now , political watchers are warning that the the new party poses an additional threat to the established spd , which has already seen its membership drop by over 40 percent since it gained national power under gerhard schröder , in 1998 .
the new party is now serving as a catch-all for those who feel the spd has moved too far to the center , observers say . the von der leyen problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister von der leyen pleases right and left alike one big problem for the spd : it lost support from its traditional trade-union voter base after it took measures to reform the ailing social-welfare state .
meanwhile , the right , traditionally conservative on social issues , seems to have recently discovered the glories of progressive social policy , particulary around women 's and family issues . " the most popular politician these days is -lrb- cdu -rrb- family minister ursula von der leyen , who advocates all-day schools and a woman 's right to work , " said arnold schölzel , editor-in-chief of the far-left newspaper junge welt .
" meanwhile the spd came up with the idea of pushing back retirement to 67 , essentially shortening retirement .
this has left lafontaine a wide-open field . " part of the spd 's problem is simply that it moved from having the freedom of being an opposition party to actually governing the country , said uwe andersen , a professor emeritus of political science at the university of bochum . " as a party in government , the spd is responsible for policy measures that are not always liked by the public , " andersen said .
" it 's especially interesting that the -lrb- new left -rrb- is pitching this anti-war movement , because even the green party , when they were in government with the spd , sent german troops abroad . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi , of the pds -lrb- left -rrb- , with his new partner , wasg 's lafontaine he said the new left-wing party could benefit from the difficult position the spd finds itself in , trying to strike a balance between holding on to disgruntled left-wing voters , while not losing the middle , where elections are generally decided . spd : what problem ? the spd response has been to play down the affair and deny the new party poses any real threat . " i think it is absurd to believe the left will get political momentum out of this new fusion , " spd steering committee member andrea nahles told berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper . and a member of the spd executive committee , niels annen , likewise told reporters he did n't expect to lose members to the far left - although he did caution trade unions not to let the workers ' movement become " fragmented . " spd spokesmen also took care to stress that the party continues to represent the interests of workers - most recently , in a public push to create a minimum wage . yet some critics say this response is not enough . local elections as indicator " the spd 's only chance is to leave the government and go look at its ideas again , " said junge welt 's schölzel .
" it is inevitable that they will have to leave the coalition before the next regular election . "
german voters will go to the polls in the general election in 2009 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under schröder , spd membership tumbled schölzel and others agree that upcoming parliamentary elections in some german states will be a good indicator of the relative weakness , or strength , of the spd and the left . meanwhile , political scientist andersen said he sees the advent of a fourth major political party as heralding a wider change in national politics , almost a balkanization of the german political landscape , which used to be dominated by the two big parties , the cdu / csu and the spd . " but now there is a tendency where a bigger part of the electorate is ready to vote for smaller parties - even extremist parties , " he said .
" it makes it more difficult to form a government .

without a number of established stars , the debutants gave a good account of themselves . germany 's soccer stars were the toast of the nation after their winning in prague at the weekend .
the victory over the czech republic left joachim löw 's men top of their european championship qualifying group and the team is now the favorite to reach the final stages next summer . on wednesday though , it was an almost unrecognizable side that took to the field for the friendly game against denmark . löw fielded a team missing stars like michael ballack , miroslav klose and jens lehmann .
in their place , the german coach brought in young stars robert enke , simon rolfes and roberto hibert . including substitutes , a total of seven players wore the national team colors for the first time ever in the friendly against denmark in duisburg as löw experimented without the pressure of a qualifying match . danes rob löw of undefeated title bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niclas bendtner , right , ended löw 's unbeaten run but the undefeated coach paid the price in the end , with his first reverse in charge of the national side .
danish striker niclas bendtner scored the only goal in the 82nd minute after connecting with a good cross from jesper groenkjar . however , löw was happy with his fledgling stars . " we are always being told to support young players in germany , and that is what we are doing , " he told ard television .
" we talked about it last october and have pretty quickly put it into practice . " it was down to experience , " the coach added .
" there were a lot of young players out there and it was a very important game for their development .
one day they will have to replace frings , ballack or klose .
we took the risk that we might lose the game , but it was great experience for the youngsters . " the most impressive of the debutants does n't even play top-flight soccer .
patrick helmes , from second division cologne , had three great chances to score despite only coming on late in the game . " it was a great feeling and a great honor , " helmes said .
" but on the other hand , i 'm disappointed because we did n't win .
a goal for me would have been the crowning glory but it was n't to be .
i 'll just have to try again against koblenz on sunday . " composed first-half per formance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's youngsters held their own until the 82nd minute it was the first international game to be played in duisburg since 1933 , and although the fans were a little disappointed at not seeing their heroes from the world cup , the new , young team did inspire the crowd in the first half with some neat passing movements . however the tempo dropped a little after the restart as both teams took the game 's " friendly " label rather too literally as neither side looked intent on challenging or fighting for the ball in a very gentlemanly opening . denmark , fielding their strongest side , had the better of the chances in the second half but , despite some signs of dissatisfaction from the supporters , a very young and inexperienced germany side certainly held their own on the international stage . even in defeat , it was a promising sign for the future . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de löw to blood german youngsters much to denmark 's chagrin germany 's coach joachim löw will ring the changes for wednesday night 's friendly against denmark by announcing an inexperienced 16-man squad aimed at blooding some of his rising stars .

but when it comes to those who ca n't communicate a so-called living will can help . the german parliament will debate the sensitive issue on thursday when parliamentarians consider draft legal guidelines that would apply to living wills .
more than 30 members of parliament have signed up to speak , three times more than usually do during bundestag debates . an estimated 8 million germans have made out a living will , setting out how they wish to be treated by medical staff in case of an accident or terminal illness .
for example , in a living will , a person might specify that her life-support machines should be turned off if they are still necessary four weeks after a bad accident . currently the legal framework around living wills is unclear and open to multiple interpretations .
many have read a 2003 decision by germany 's federal court as ruling that a stipulation to end medical treatment is only binding if the illness or injury will inevitably lead to death .
however , others have read the ruling differently . a draft guideline introduced by wolfgang bosbach of the conservative union bloc of parties would make patient stipulations regarding treatment or resuscitation only valid in the case of irreversible , terminal illness or injury . an alternative draft , presented by social democratic parliamentarian joachim stünker , gives the wishes of the patient highest priority . new guidelines needed ? according to urban wiesing of germany 's federal chamber of physicians , doctors are acting correctly if they follow instructions given in a living will now , even if the patient dies .
" it is the will of the patient that counts , " wiesing said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could pass a law on living wills later this year however , wiesing stressed that doctors are still required to follow german law .
" if a patient asks for medically assisted suicide , a doctor ca n't do that because that 's illegal , " he said . his group , along with the marburger bund doctors ' federation , has come out against putting new legal guidelines in place , saying that patients need only to be better informed about what goes into making a living will . " we are solving a problem here that was only created through politicians ' debate of the issue , " frank ulrich montgomery , head of the marburger bund , told the passauer neue presse newspaper . call for regulation at the moment there is no legal framework setting out how a living will should be made . that means medical staff are bound to consider even a couple of lines that a patient scribbled on a scrap of paper .
but such information can lead to more uncertainty about a person 's wishes , because their instructions are often too nebulous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal chamber of physicians is against regulating living wills " it needs to be more detailed , " said wolfgang kramer from the german hospice foundation .
" in our experience , people write something down , but it ca n't be used in a concrete situation because it 's too unspecific . " the german hospice foundation offers consultations on how to make a living will .
because there are so many topics to cover , the appointments usually last more than 90 minutes , and the result is a seven-page document . " at the beginning there are wishes such as ' i do n't want to suffer ' or ' i do n't want to end up attached to a tube , " ' kramer said .
" but when you explain the different possibilities and the kinds of conditions that come with certain illnesses , then people make completely different decisions . " wiesing from the federal chamber of physicians was hesitant about calling for government regulation of living wills . " currently , the situation is n't that clear - both for patients and doctors , " he said .

but when it comes to those who ca n't communicate a so-called living will can help . the german parliament will debate the sensitive issue on thursday when parliamentarians consider draft legal guidelines that would apply to living wills .
more than 30 members of parliament have signed up to speak , three times more than usually do during bundestag debates . an estimated 8 million germans have made out a living will , setting out how they wish to be treated by medical staff in case of an accident or terminal illness .
for example , in a living will , a person might specify that her life-support machines should be turned off if they are still necessary four weeks after a bad accident . currently the legal framework around living wills is unclear and open to multiple interpretations .
many have read a 2003 decision by germany 's federal court as ruling that a stipulation to end medical treatment is only binding if the illness or injury will inevitably lead to death .
however , others have read the ruling differently . a draft guideline introduced by wolfgang bosbach of the conservative union bloc of parties would make patient stipulations regarding treatment or resuscitation only valid in the case of irreversible , terminal illness or injury . an alternative draft , presented by social democratic parliamentarian joachim stünker , gives the wishes of the patient highest priority . new guidelines needed ? according to urban wiesing of germany 's federal chamber of physicians , doctors are acting correctly if they follow instructions given in a living will now , even if the patient dies .
" it is the will of the patient that counts , " wiesing said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could pass a law on living wills later this year however , wiesing stressed that doctors are still required to follow german law .
" if a patient asks for medically assisted suicide , a doctor ca n't do that because that 's illegal , " he said . his group , along with the marburger bund doctors ' federation , has come out against putting new legal guidelines in place , saying that patients need only to be better informed about what goes into making a living will . " we are solving a problem here that was only created through politicians ' debate of the issue , " frank ulrich montgomery , head of the marburger bund , told the passauer neue presse newspaper . call for regulation at the moment there is no legal framework setting out how a living will should be made . that means medical staff are bound to consider even a couple of lines that a patient scribbled on a scrap of paper .
but such information can lead to more uncertainty about a person 's wishes , because their instructions are often too nebulous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal chamber of physicians is against regulating living wills " it needs to be more detailed , " said wolfgang kramer from the german hospice foundation .
" in our experience , people write something down , but it ca n't be used in a concrete situation because it 's too unspecific . " the german hospice foundation offers consultations on how to make a living will .
because there are so many topics to cover , the appointments usually last more than 90 minutes , and the result is a seven-page document . " at the beginning there are wishes such as ' i do n't want to suffer ' or ' i do n't want to end up attached to a tube , " ' kramer said .
" but when you explain the different possibilities and the kinds of conditions that come with certain illnesses , then people make completely different decisions . " wiesing from the federal chamber of physicians was hesitant about calling for government regulation of living wills . " currently , the situation is n't that clear - both for patients and doctors , " he said .

some say it could seriously damage the country 's ruling center-left social democrats . when delegates from germany 's two biggest far-left parties overwhelmingly backed a formal merger on sunday , it was a penultimate step toward establishing " dielinke " -lrb- the left -rrb- as the country 's fourth-largest political party . observers say the party poses a credible threat to the social democratic party , the traditional home of germany 's left wing .
the spd is currently part of the uneasy " grand coalition " government that rules together with angela merkel 's center-right christian democratic union / christian socialist union bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its official : party delegates vote in favor of a wasg-pds union on sunday , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , a successor to the communist party of east germany , and the labor and social justice party -lrb- wasg -rrb- , a western splinter group led by former spd chairman oskar lafontaine , officially approved the merger .
the new party , dielinke . -lrb- period included -rrb- will be formally called into life at a conference in june . heavy losses at the spd the pds and wasg first campaigned under one banner in the snap national elections in 2005 , where they got a respectable 8.7 percent of the vote .
that result landed them the fourth slot on the national political scene . now , political watchers are warning that the the new party poses an additional threat to the established spd , which has already seen its membership drop by over 40 percent since it gained national power under gerhard schröder , in 1998 .
the new party is now serving as a catch-all for those who feel the spd has moved too far to the center , observers say . the von der leyen problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister von der leyen pleases right and left alike one big problem for the spd : it lost support from its traditional trade-union voter base after it took measures to reform the ailing social-welfare state .
meanwhile , the right , traditionally conservative on social issues , seems to have recently discovered the glories of progressive social policy , particulary around women 's and family issues . " the most popular politician these days is -lrb- cdu -rrb- family minister ursula von der leyen , who advocates all-day schools and a woman 's right to work , " said arnold schölzel , editor-in-chief of the far-left newspaper junge welt .
" meanwhile the spd came up with the idea of pushing back retirement to 67 , essentially shortening retirement .
this has left lafontaine a wide-open field . " part of the spd 's problem is simply that it moved from having the freedom of being an opposition party to actually governing the country , said uwe andersen , a professor emeritus of political science at the university of bochum . " as a party in government , the spd is responsible for policy measures that are not always liked by the public , " andersen said .
" it 's especially interesting that the -lrb- new left -rrb- is pitching this anti-war movement , because even the green party , when they were in government with the spd , sent german troops abroad .

but when it comes to those who ca n't communicate a so-called living will can help . the german parliament will debate the sensitive issue on thursday when parliamentarians consider draft legal guidelines that would apply to living wills .
more than 30 members of parliament have signed up to speak , three times more than usually do during bundestag debates . an estimated 8 million germans have made out a living will , setting out how they wish to be treated by medical staff in case of an accident or terminal illness .
for example , in a living will , a person might specify that her life-support machines should be turned off if they are still necessary four weeks after a bad accident . currently the legal framework around living wills is unclear and open to multiple interpretations .
many have read a 2003 decision by germany 's federal court as ruling that a stipulation to end medical treatment is only binding if the illness or injury will inevitably lead to death .
however , others have read the ruling differently . a draft guideline introduced by wolfgang bosbach of the conservative union bloc of parties would make patient stipulations regarding treatment or resuscitation only valid in the case of irreversible , terminal illness or injury . an alternative draft , presented by social democratic parliamentarian joachim stünker , gives the wishes of the patient highest priority . new guidelines needed ? according to urban wiesing of germany 's federal chamber of physicians , doctors are acting correctly if they follow instructions given in a living will now , even if the patient dies .
" it is the will of the patient that counts , " wiesing said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could pass a law on living wills later this year however , wiesing stressed that doctors are still required to follow german law .
" if a patient asks for medically assisted suicide , a doctor ca n't do that because that 's illegal , " he said . his group , along with the marburger bund doctors ' federation , has come out against putting new legal guidelines in place , saying that patients need only to be better informed about what goes into making a living will . " we are solving a problem here that was only created through politicians ' debate of the issue , " frank ulrich montgomery , head of the marburger bund , told the passauer neue presse newspaper . call for regulation at the moment there is no legal framework setting out how a living will should be made . that means medical staff are bound to consider even a couple of lines that a patient scribbled on a scrap of paper .
but such information can lead to more uncertainty about a person 's wishes , because their instructions are often too nebulous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal chamber of physicians is against regulating living wills " it needs to be more detailed , " said wolfgang kramer from the german hospice foundation .
" in our experience , people write something down , but it ca n't be used in a concrete situation because it 's too unspecific . " the german hospice foundation offers consultations on how to make a living will .
because there are so many topics to cover , the appointments usually last more than 90 minutes , and the result is a seven-page document . " at the beginning there are wishes such as ' i do n't want to suffer ' or ' i do n't want to end up attached to a tube , " ' kramer said .
" but when you explain the different possibilities and the kinds of conditions that come with certain illnesses , then people make completely different decisions . " wiesing from the federal chamber of physicians was hesitant about calling for government regulation of living wills . " currently , the situation is n't that clear - both for patients and doctors , " he said .
" we should all try to reduce this uncertainty but not at the cost of individual rights .

" it was only when we point out that the detention -lrb- of the 15 -rrb- was inappropriate and in our view unlawful that the coordinates were then changed by the iranian government to be coordinates within iranian waters , " british ambassador emyr jones parry said . iran reneges on freeing sole female as the british government sought to ratchet up diplomatic pressure , ali larijani , head of iran 's supreme national security council , said a female sailor among the captives , faye turney , would not be released because of britain 's " incorrect " attitude . " it was announced that a woman in the group would be freed , but -lrb- this development -rrb- was met with an incorrect attitude .
naturally , -lrb- the release -rrb- will be suspended and it will not take place , " larijani said on state television . his announcement came a day after london said it was freezing ties with iran . larijani , who is also iran 's chief negotiator in its nuclear dispute with western powers , also threatened to pursue a " legal path " in the crisis , which has caused global concerns and sent oil prices to six month highs . " instead of sending a technical team to examine the problem , they kicked up a media storm , announced a freeze in relations and spoke about the security council .
that will not resolve the problem .
they have miscalculated . " iranian state television on wednesday broadcast footage of turney and her 14 colleagues , in which she said the group had strayed into iranian waters .
the film provoked a furious reaction in the british government which suspects she spoke under duress . the footage showed the britons having a meal and featured the 26-year-old turney wearing a black headscarf .
" obviously we trespassed in the waters , " she said .
" they were friendly , very hospitable , very thoughtful .

" germany has an alcohol problem , " said rolf huellinghorst , general manager of the german headquarters for dependency issues .
he pointed out that europe 's most populous nation has one of the highest levels of alcohol consumption in the industrialized world . germans consume an average of 10 liters -lrb- 2.6 gallons -rrb- of pure alcohol each year , he said , adding that around 12 percent of the 82 million population was " at risk " because of their drinking habits . a survey published earlier this month by the european union showed that one in 10 europeans confesses to regular binge-drinking , with the irish leading the way , followed by finns and britons . germans up there with the brits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer makers complain that drinkers are going for spirits and wine with higher alcohol content germany was lower down the list in the study published by the eu pollsters eurobarometer , but another survey conducted by britain 's datamonitor last year showed that germans drink more on a night out than in any other western european country , except the united kingdom . in germany , the legal age to drink beer , wine and champagne is 16 , but for stronger drinks such as vodka , brandy and other spirits it is 18 . the government on wednesday rejected calls to tighten laws governing the sale of alcohol in a bid to clamp down on binge-drinking . a stricter application of the laws already in place would suffice , said bätzing , pointing out that bar and club owners should be held accountable for serving under-age drinkers and those who are drunk . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians call for increasing drinking age to 18 numerous politicians have demanded that alcohol be banned from minors in germany .

but when it comes to those who ca n't communicate a so-called living will can help . the german parliament will debate the sensitive issue on thursday when parliamentarians consider draft legal guidelines that would apply to living wills .
more than 30 members of parliament have signed up to speak , three times more than usually do during bundestag debates . an estimated 8 million germans have made out a living will , setting out how they wish to be treated by medical staff in case of an accident or terminal illness .
for example , in a living will , a person might specify that her life-support machines should be turned off if they are still necessary four weeks after a bad accident . currently the legal framework around living wills is unclear and open to multiple interpretations .
many have read a 2003 decision by germany 's federal court as ruling that a stipulation to end medical treatment is only binding if the illness or injury will inevitably lead to death .
however , others have read the ruling differently . a draft guideline introduced by wolfgang bosbach of the conservative union bloc of parties would make patient stipulations regarding treatment or resuscitation only valid in the case of irreversible , terminal illness or injury . an alternative draft , presented by social democratic parliamentarian joachim stünker , gives the wishes of the patient highest priority . new guidelines needed ? according to urban wiesing of germany 's federal chamber of physicians , doctors are acting correctly if they follow instructions given in a living will now , even if the patient dies .
" it is the will of the patient that counts , " wiesing said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could pass a law on living wills later this year however , wiesing stressed that doctors are still required to follow german law .
" if a patient asks for medically assisted suicide , a doctor ca n't do that because that 's illegal , " he said . his group , along with the marburger bund doctors ' federation , has come out against putting new legal guidelines in place , saying that patients need only to be better informed about what goes into making a living will . " we are solving a problem here that was only created through politicians ' debate of the issue , " frank ulrich montgomery , head of the marburger bund , told the passauer neue presse newspaper . call for regulation at the moment there is no legal framework setting out how a living will should be made . that means medical staff are bound to consider even a couple of lines that a patient scribbled on a scrap of paper .
but such information can lead to more uncertainty about a person 's wishes , because their instructions are often too nebulous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal chamber of physicians is against regulating living wills " it needs to be more detailed , " said wolfgang kramer from the german hospice foundation .
" in our experience , people write something down , but it ca n't be used in a concrete situation because it 's too unspecific . " the german hospice foundation offers consultations on how to make a living will .
because there are so many topics to cover , the appointments usually last more than 90 minutes , and the result is a seven-page document . " at the beginning there are wishes such as ' i do n't want to suffer ' or ' i do n't want to end up attached to a tube , " ' kramer said .
" but when you explain the different possibilities and the kinds of conditions that come with certain illnesses , then people make completely different decisions . " wiesing from the federal chamber of physicians was hesitant about calling for government regulation of living wills . " currently , the situation is n't that clear - both for patients and doctors , " he said .

but when it comes to those who ca n't communicate a so-called living will can help . the german parliament will debate the sensitive issue on thursday when parliamentarians consider draft legal guidelines that would apply to living wills .
more than 30 members of parliament have signed up to speak , three times more than usually do during bundestag debates . an estimated 8 million germans have made out a living will , setting out how they wish to be treated by medical staff in case of an accident or terminal illness .
for example , in a living will , a person might specify that her life-support machines should be turned off if they are still necessary four weeks after a bad accident . currently the legal framework around living wills is unclear and open to multiple interpretations .
many have read a 2003 decision by germany 's federal court as ruling that a stipulation to end medical treatment is only binding if the illness or injury will inevitably lead to death .
however , others have read the ruling differently . a draft guideline introduced by wolfgang bosbach of the conservative union bloc of parties would make patient stipulations regarding treatment or resuscitation only valid in the case of irreversible , terminal illness or injury . an alternative draft , presented by social democratic parliamentarian joachim stünker , gives the wishes of the patient highest priority . new guidelines needed ? according to urban wiesing of germany 's federal chamber of physicians , doctors are acting correctly if they follow instructions given in a living will now , even if the patient dies .
" it is the will of the patient that counts , " wiesing said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could pass a law on living wills later this year however , wiesing stressed that doctors are still required to follow german law .
" if a patient asks for medically assisted suicide , a doctor ca n't do that because that 's illegal , " he said . his group , along with the marburger bund doctors ' federation , has come out against putting new legal guidelines in place , saying that patients need only to be better informed about what goes into making a living will . " we are solving a problem here that was only created through politicians ' debate of the issue , " frank ulrich montgomery , head of the marburger bund , told the passauer neue presse newspaper . call for regulation at the moment there is no legal framework setting out how a living will should be made . that means medical staff are bound to consider even a couple of lines that a patient scribbled on a scrap of paper .
but such information can lead to more uncertainty about a person 's wishes , because their instructions are often too nebulous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal chamber of physicians is against regulating living wills " it needs to be more detailed , " said wolfgang kramer from the german hospice foundation .
" in our experience , people write something down , but it ca n't be used in a concrete situation because it 's too unspecific . " the german hospice foundation offers consultations on how to make a living will .
because there are so many topics to cover , the appointments usually last more than 90 minutes , and the result is a seven-page document . " at the beginning there are wishes such as ' i do n't want to suffer ' or ' i do n't want to end up attached to a tube , " ' kramer said .
" but when you explain the different possibilities and the kinds of conditions that come with certain illnesses , then people make completely different decisions . " wiesing from the federal chamber of physicians was hesitant about calling for government regulation of living wills . " currently , the situation is n't that clear - both for patients and doctors , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.03.2007 germans fear new far-left union could threaten establishment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left offers a haven for german left wingers who feel underserved a new , far-left german political party , called simply the left , was recently made official .
some say it could seriously damage the country 's ruling center-left social democrats . when delegates from germany 's two biggest far-left parties overwhelmingly backed a formal merger on sunday , it was a penultimate step toward establishing " dielinke " -lrb- the left -rrb- as the country 's fourth-largest political party . observers say the party poses a credible threat to the social democratic party , the traditional home of germany 's left wing .
the spd is currently part of the uneasy " grand coalition " government that rules together with angela merkel 's center-right christian democratic union / christian socialist union bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its official : party delegates vote in favor of a wasg-pds union on sunday , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , a successor to the communist party of east germany , and the labor and social justice party -lrb- wasg -rrb- , a western splinter group led by former spd chairman oskar lafontaine , officially approved the merger .
the new party , dielinke . -lrb- period included -rrb- will be formally called into life at a conference in june . heavy losses at the spd the pds and wasg first campaigned under one banner in the snap national elections in 2005 , where they got a respectable 8.7 percent of the vote .
that result landed them the fourth slot on the national political scene . now , political watchers are warning that the the new party poses an additional threat to the established spd , which has already seen its membership drop by over 40 percent since it gained national power under gerhard schröder , in 1998 .
the new party is now serving as a catch-all for those who feel the spd has moved too far to the center , observers say . the von der leyen problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister von der leyen pleases right and left alike one big problem for the spd : it lost support from its traditional trade-union voter base after it took measures to reform the ailing social-welfare state .
meanwhile , the right , traditionally conservative on social issues , seems to have recently discovered the glories of progressive social policy , particulary around women 's and family issues . " the most popular politician these days is -lrb- cdu -rrb- family minister ursula von der leyen , who advocates all-day schools and a woman 's right to work , " said arnold schölzel , editor-in-chief of the far-left newspaper junge welt .
" meanwhile the spd came up with the idea of pushing back retirement to 67 , essentially shortening retirement .
this has left lafontaine a wide-open field . " part of the spd 's problem is simply that it moved from having the freedom of being an opposition party to actually governing the country , said uwe andersen , a professor emeritus of political science at the university of bochum . " as a party in government , the spd is responsible for policy measures that are not always liked by the public , " andersen said .
" it 's especially interesting that the -lrb- new left -rrb- is pitching this anti-war movement , because even the green party , when they were in government with the spd , sent german troops abroad . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi , of the pds -lrb- left -rrb- , with his new partner , wasg 's lafontaine he said the new left-wing party could benefit from the difficult position the spd finds itself in , trying to strike a balance between holding on to disgruntled left-wing voters , while not losing the middle , where elections are generally decided . spd : what problem ? the spd response has been to play down the affair and deny the new party poses any real threat . " i think it is absurd to believe the left will get political momentum out of this new fusion , " spd steering committee member andrea nahles told berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper . and a member of the spd executive committee , niels annen , likewise told reporters he did n't expect to lose members to the far left - although he did caution trade unions not to let the workers ' movement become " fragmented . " spd spokesmen also took care to stress that the party continues to represent the interests of workers - most recently , in a public push to create a minimum wage . yet some critics say this response is not enough . local elections as indicator " the spd 's only chance is to leave the government and go look at its ideas again , " said junge welt 's schölzel .
" it is inevitable that they will have to leave the coalition before the next regular election . "
german voters will go to the polls in the general election in 2009 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under schröder , spd membership tumbled schölzel and others agree that upcoming parliamentary elections in some german states will be a good indicator of the relative weakness , or strength , of the spd and the left . meanwhile , political scientist andersen said he sees the advent of a fourth major political party as heralding a wider change in national politics , almost a balkanization of the german political landscape , which used to be dominated by the two big parties , the cdu / csu and the spd . " but now there is a tendency where a bigger part of the electorate is ready to vote for smaller parties - even extremist parties , " he said .
" it makes it more difficult to form a government .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily defended the former government 's handing of the kurnaz case schily took some of the pressure of german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was schröder 's chief of staff at the time of kurnaz 's imprisonment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.03.2007 germans fear new far-left union could threaten establishment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left offers a haven for german left wingers who feel underserved a new , far-left german political party , called simply the left , was recently made official .
some say it could seriously damage the country 's ruling center-left social democrats . when delegates from germany 's two biggest far-left parties overwhelmingly backed a formal merger on sunday , it was a penultimate step toward establishing " dielinke " -lrb- the left -rrb- as the country 's fourth-largest political party . observers say the party poses a credible threat to the social democratic party , the traditional home of germany 's left wing .
the spd is currently part of the uneasy " grand coalition " government that rules together with angela merkel 's center-right christian democratic union / christian socialist union bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its official : party delegates vote in favor of a wasg-pds union on sunday , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , a successor to the communist party of east germany , and the labor and social justice party -lrb- wasg -rrb- , a western splinter group led by former spd chairman oskar lafontaine , officially approved the merger .
the new party , dielinke . -lrb- period included -rrb- will be formally called into life at a conference in june . heavy losses at the spd the pds and wasg first campaigned under one banner in the snap national elections in 2005 , where they got a respectable 8.7 percent of the vote .
that result landed them the fourth slot on the national political scene . now , political watchers are warning that the the new party poses an additional threat to the established spd , which has already seen its membership drop by over 40 percent since it gained national power under gerhard schröder , in 1998 .
the new party is now serving as a catch-all for those who feel the spd has moved too far to the center , observers say . the von der leyen problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister von der leyen pleases right and left alike one big problem for the spd : it lost support from its traditional trade-union voter base after it took measures to reform the ailing social-welfare state .
meanwhile , the right , traditionally conservative on social issues , seems to have recently discovered the glories of progressive social policy , particulary around women 's and family issues . " the most popular politician these days is -lrb- cdu -rrb- family minister ursula von der leyen , who advocates all-day schools and a woman 's right to work , " said arnold schölzel , editor-in-chief of the far-left newspaper junge welt .
" meanwhile the spd came up with the idea of pushing back retirement to 67 , essentially shortening retirement .
this has left lafontaine a wide-open field . " part of the spd 's problem is simply that it moved from having the freedom of being an opposition party to actually governing the country , said uwe andersen , a professor emeritus of political science at the university of bochum . " as a party in government , the spd is responsible for policy measures that are not always liked by the public , " andersen said .
" it 's especially interesting that the -lrb- new left -rrb- is pitching this anti-war movement , because even the green party , when they were in government with the spd , sent german troops abroad . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi , of the pds -lrb- left -rrb- , with his new partner , wasg 's lafontaine he said the new left-wing party could benefit from the difficult position the spd finds itself in , trying to strike a balance between holding on to disgruntled left-wing voters , while not losing the middle , where elections are generally decided . spd : what problem ? the spd response has been to play down the affair and deny the new party poses any real threat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.03.2007 germans fear new far-left union could threaten establishment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left offers a haven for german left wingers who feel underserved a new , far-left german political party , called simply the left , was recently made official .
some say it could seriously damage the country 's ruling center-left social democrats . when delegates from germany 's two biggest far-left parties overwhelmingly backed a formal merger on sunday , it was a penultimate step toward establishing " dielinke " -lrb- the left -rrb- as the country 's fourth-largest political party . observers say the party poses a credible threat to the social democratic party , the traditional home of germany 's left wing .
the spd is currently part of the uneasy " grand coalition " government that rules together with angela merkel 's center-right christian democratic union / christian socialist union bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its official : party delegates vote in favor of a wasg-pds union on sunday , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , a successor to the communist party of east germany , and the labor and social justice party -lrb- wasg -rrb- , a western splinter group led by former spd chairman oskar lafontaine , officially approved the merger .
the new party , dielinke . -lrb- period included -rrb- will be formally called into life at a conference in june . heavy losses at the spd the pds and wasg first campaigned under one banner in the snap national elections in 2005 , where they got a respectable 8.7 percent of the vote .
that result landed them the fourth slot on the national political scene . now , political watchers are warning that the the new party poses an additional threat to the established spd , which has already seen its membership drop by over 40 percent since it gained national power under gerhard schröder , in 1998 .
the new party is now serving as a catch-all for those who feel the spd has moved too far to the center , observers say . the von der leyen problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister von der leyen pleases right and left alike one big problem for the spd : it lost support from its traditional trade-union voter base after it took measures to reform the ailing social-welfare state .
meanwhile , the right , traditionally conservative on social issues , seems to have recently discovered the glories of progressive social policy , particulary around women 's and family issues . " the most popular politician these days is -lrb- cdu -rrb- family minister ursula von der leyen , who advocates all-day schools and a woman 's right to work , " said arnold schölzel , editor-in-chief of the far-left newspaper junge welt .
" meanwhile the spd came up with the idea of pushing back retirement to 67 , essentially shortening retirement .
this has left lafontaine a wide-open field . " part of the spd 's problem is simply that it moved from having the freedom of being an opposition party to actually governing the country , said uwe andersen , a professor emeritus of political science at the university of bochum . " as a party in government , the spd is responsible for policy measures that are not always liked by the public , " andersen said .
" it 's especially interesting that the -lrb- new left -rrb- is pitching this anti-war movement , because even the green party , when they were in government with the spd , sent german troops abroad . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi , of the pds -lrb- left -rrb- , with his new partner , wasg 's lafontaine he said the new left-wing party could benefit from the difficult position the spd finds itself in , trying to strike a balance between holding on to disgruntled left-wing voters , while not losing the middle , where elections are generally decided . spd : what problem ? the spd response has been to play down the affair and deny the new party poses any real threat . " i think it is absurd to believe the left will get political momentum out of this new fusion , " spd steering committee member andrea nahles told berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper . and a member of the spd executive committee , niels annen , likewise told reporters he did n't expect to lose members to the far left - although he did caution trade unions not to let the workers ' movement become " fragmented .

" he might have been misguided by people around him , but he was n't harmless , " schily said . he added there were indications that when kurnaz was arrested in 2001 , he was actually on his way to train as a terrorist in afghanistan .
schily said it was the duty of the secret service to do everything possible to avert the danger of terrorism . he also said the government had supported kurnaz ' repatriation to turkey .

without a number of established stars , the debutants gave a good account of themselves . germany 's soccer stars were the toast of the nation after their winning in prague at the weekend .
the victory over the czech republic left joachim löw 's men top of their european championship qualifying group and the team is now the favorite to reach the final stages next summer . on wednesday though , it was an almost unrecognizable side that took to the field for the friendly game against denmark . löw fielded a team missing stars like michael ballack , miroslav klose and jens lehmann .
in their place , the german coach brought in young stars robert enke , simon rolfes and roberto hibert . including substitutes , a total of seven players wore the national team colors for the first time ever in the friendly against denmark in duisburg as löw experimented without the pressure of a qualifying match . danes rob löw of undefeated title bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niclas bendtner , right , ended löw 's unbeaten run but the undefeated coach paid the price in the end , with his first reverse in charge of the national side .
danish striker niclas bendtner scored the only goal in the 82nd minute after connecting with a good cross from jesper groenkjar . however , löw was happy with his fledgling stars . " we are always being told to support young players in germany , and that is what we are doing , " he told ard television .

" there were a lot of young players out there and it was a very important game for their development .

we took the risk that we might lose the game , but it was great experience for the youngsters . " the most impressive of the debutants does n't even play top-flight soccer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.03.2007 germans fear new far-left union could threaten establishment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left offers a haven for german left wingers who feel underserved a new , far-left german political party , called simply the left , was recently made official .
some say it could seriously damage the country 's ruling center-left social democrats . when delegates from germany 's two biggest far-left parties overwhelmingly backed a formal merger on sunday , it was a penultimate step toward establishing " dielinke " -lrb- the left -rrb- as the country 's fourth-largest political party . observers say the party poses a credible threat to the social democratic party , the traditional home of germany 's left wing .
the spd is currently part of the uneasy " grand coalition " government that rules together with angela merkel 's center-right christian democratic union / christian socialist union bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its official : party delegates vote in favor of a wasg-pds union on sunday , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , a successor to the communist party of east germany , and the labor and social justice party -lrb- wasg -rrb- , a western splinter group led by former spd chairman oskar lafontaine , officially approved the merger .
the new party , dielinke . -lrb- period included -rrb- will be formally called into life at a conference in june . heavy losses at the spd the pds and wasg first campaigned under one banner in the snap national elections in 2005 , where they got a respectable 8.7 percent of the vote .
that result landed them the fourth slot on the national political scene . now , political watchers are warning that the the new party poses an additional threat to the established spd , which has already seen its membership drop by over 40 percent since it gained national power under gerhard schröder , in 1998 .
the new party is now serving as a catch-all for those who feel the spd has moved too far to the center , observers say . the von der leyen problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister von der leyen pleases right and left alike one big problem for the spd : it lost support from its traditional trade-union voter base after it took measures to reform the ailing social-welfare state .

some say it could seriously damage the country 's ruling center-left social democrats . when delegates from germany 's two biggest far-left parties overwhelmingly backed a formal merger on sunday , it was a penultimate step toward establishing " dielinke " -lrb- the left -rrb- as the country 's fourth-largest political party . observers say the party poses a credible threat to the social democratic party , the traditional home of germany 's left wing .
the spd is currently part of the uneasy " grand coalition " government that rules together with angela merkel 's center-right christian democratic union / christian socialist union bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its official : party delegates vote in favor of a wasg-pds union on sunday , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , a successor to the communist party of east germany , and the labor and social justice party -lrb- wasg -rrb- , a western splinter group led by former spd chairman oskar lafontaine , officially approved the merger .
the new party , dielinke . -lrb- period included -rrb- will be formally called into life at a conference in june . heavy losses at the spd the pds and wasg first campaigned under one banner in the snap national elections in 2005 , where they got a respectable 8.7 percent of the vote .
that result landed them the fourth slot on the national political scene . now , political watchers are warning that the the new party poses an additional threat to the established spd , which has already seen its membership drop by over 40 percent since it gained national power under gerhard schröder , in 1998 .
the new party is now serving as a catch-all for those who feel the spd has moved too far to the center , observers say . the von der leyen problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister von der leyen pleases right and left alike one big problem for the spd : it lost support from its traditional trade-union voter base after it took measures to reform the ailing social-welfare state .
meanwhile , the right , traditionally conservative on social issues , seems to have recently discovered the glories of progressive social policy , particulary around women 's and family issues . " the most popular politician these days is -lrb- cdu -rrb- family minister ursula von der leyen , who advocates all-day schools and a woman 's right to work , " said arnold schölzel , editor-in-chief of the far-left newspaper junge welt .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily defended the former government 's handing of the kurnaz case schily took some of the pressure of german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was schröder 's chief of staff at the time of kurnaz 's imprisonment . " steinmeier had to rely on the proper , careful analysis of the facts carried out by the interior ministry and the intelligence services , " schily said , adding that the government 's conduct had been " perfectly correct . " no charges against kurnaz kurnaz was arrested in pakistan just weeks after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks and handed over to us authorities .
he eventually landed in the us detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba , where he says he was tortured until his release in august 2006 . the bnd secret service parliamentary investigative committee is looking at whether the former government turned down an offer to release kurnaz in 2002 after us officials found he posed no danger - as is claimed by kurnaz . schily said the former government made the decision not to let kurnaz travel back into germany because he was a security risk . " he might have been misguided by people around him , but he was n't harmless , " schily said . he added there were indications that when kurnaz was arrested in 2001 , he was actually on his way to train as a terrorist in afghanistan .
schily said it was the duty of the secret service to do everything possible to avert the danger of terrorism . he also said the government had supported kurnaz ' repatriation to turkey .
but at the same time , schily said , he was n't aware of an offer from the usa in 2002 to set kurnaz free . criticism of the us the former interior minister also stressed that the responsibility for guantanamo rested firmly with the united states .
criticism , therefore , had to be directed at the us government and not at the german government , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has been heavily criticized for its handing of inmates at guantanamo " the american 's responsibility is clear , " schily told the committee .
" i wo n't allow the blame for what happened in guantanamo to be laid at the door of the -lrb- social democratic-green -rrb- government , " schily said . kurnaz was eventually freed after chancellor angela merkel came to power due to a lack of proof that he belonged to a terrorist group .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.03.2007 germans fear new far-left union could threaten establishment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left offers a haven for german left wingers who feel underserved a new , far-left german political party , called simply the left , was recently made official .
some say it could seriously damage the country 's ruling center-left social democrats . when delegates from germany 's two biggest far-left parties overwhelmingly backed a formal merger on sunday , it was a penultimate step toward establishing " dielinke " -lrb- the left -rrb- as the country 's fourth-largest political party . observers say the party poses a credible threat to the social democratic party , the traditional home of germany 's left wing .
the spd is currently part of the uneasy " grand coalition " government that rules together with angela merkel 's center-right christian democratic union / christian socialist union bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its official : party delegates vote in favor of a wasg-pds union on sunday , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , a successor to the communist party of east germany , and the labor and social justice party -lrb- wasg -rrb- , a western splinter group led by former spd chairman oskar lafontaine , officially approved the merger .
the new party , dielinke . -lrb- period included -rrb- will be formally called into life at a conference in june . heavy losses at the spd the pds and wasg first campaigned under one banner in the snap national elections in 2005 , where they got a respectable 8.7 percent of the vote .
that result landed them the fourth slot on the national political scene . now , political watchers are warning that the the new party poses an additional threat to the established spd , which has already seen its membership drop by over 40 percent since it gained national power under gerhard schröder , in 1998 .
the new party is now serving as a catch-all for those who feel the spd has moved too far to the center , observers say . the von der leyen problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister von der leyen pleases right and left alike one big problem for the spd : it lost support from its traditional trade-union voter base after it took measures to reform the ailing social-welfare state .
meanwhile , the right , traditionally conservative on social issues , seems to have recently discovered the glories of progressive social policy , particulary around women 's and family issues . " the most popular politician these days is -lrb- cdu -rrb- family minister ursula von der leyen , who advocates all-day schools and a woman 's right to work , " said arnold schölzel , editor-in-chief of the far-left newspaper junge welt .
" meanwhile the spd came up with the idea of pushing back retirement to 67 , essentially shortening retirement .
this has left lafontaine a wide-open field . " part of the spd 's problem is simply that it moved from having the freedom of being an opposition party to actually governing the country , said uwe andersen , a professor emeritus of political science at the university of bochum . " as a party in government , the spd is responsible for policy measures that are not always liked by the public , " andersen said .
" it 's especially interesting that the -lrb- new left -rrb- is pitching this anti-war movement , because even the green party , when they were in government with the spd , sent german troops abroad . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi , of the pds -lrb- left -rrb- , with his new partner , wasg 's lafontaine he said the new left-wing party could benefit from the difficult position the spd finds itself in , trying to strike a balance between holding on to disgruntled left-wing voters , while not losing the middle , where elections are generally decided . spd : what problem ? the spd response has been to play down the affair and deny the new party poses any real threat . " i think it is absurd to believe the left will get political momentum out of this new fusion , " spd steering committee member andrea nahles told berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper . and a member of the spd executive committee , niels annen , likewise told reporters he did n't expect to lose members to the far left - although he did caution trade unions not to let the workers ' movement become " fragmented . " spd spokesmen also took care to stress that the party continues to represent the interests of workers - most recently , in a public push to create a minimum wage . yet some critics say this response is not enough . local elections as indicator " the spd 's only chance is to leave the government and go look at its ideas again , " said junge welt 's schölzel .
" it is inevitable that they will have to leave the coalition before the next regular election . "
german voters will go to the polls in the general election in 2009 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under schröder , spd membership tumbled schölzel and others agree that upcoming parliamentary elections in some german states will be a good indicator of the relative weakness , or strength , of the spd and the left . meanwhile , political scientist andersen said he sees the advent of a fourth major political party as heralding a wider change in national politics , almost a balkanization of the german political landscape , which used to be dominated by the two big parties , the cdu / csu and the spd . " but now there is a tendency where a bigger part of the electorate is ready to vote for smaller parties - even extremist parties , " he said .
" it makes it more difficult to form a government .

but when it comes to those who ca n't communicate a so-called living will can help . the german parliament will debate the sensitive issue on thursday when parliamentarians consider draft legal guidelines that would apply to living wills .
more than 30 members of parliament have signed up to speak , three times more than usually do during bundestag debates . an estimated 8 million germans have made out a living will , setting out how they wish to be treated by medical staff in case of an accident or terminal illness .
for example , in a living will , a person might specify that her life-support machines should be turned off if they are still necessary four weeks after a bad accident . currently the legal framework around living wills is unclear and open to multiple interpretations .
many have read a 2003 decision by germany 's federal court as ruling that a stipulation to end medical treatment is only binding if the illness or injury will inevitably lead to death .
however , others have read the ruling differently . a draft guideline introduced by wolfgang bosbach of the conservative union bloc of parties would make patient stipulations regarding treatment or resuscitation only valid in the case of irreversible , terminal illness or injury . an alternative draft , presented by social democratic parliamentarian joachim stünker , gives the wishes of the patient highest priority . new guidelines needed ? according to urban wiesing of germany 's federal chamber of physicians , doctors are acting correctly if they follow instructions given in a living will now , even if the patient dies .
" it is the will of the patient that counts , " wiesing said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could pass a law on living wills later this year however , wiesing stressed that doctors are still required to follow german law .
" if a patient asks for medically assisted suicide , a doctor ca n't do that because that 's illegal , " he said . his group , along with the marburger bund doctors ' federation , has come out against putting new legal guidelines in place , saying that patients need only to be better informed about what goes into making a living will . " we are solving a problem here that was only created through politicians ' debate of the issue , " frank ulrich montgomery , head of the marburger bund , told the passauer neue presse newspaper . call for regulation at the moment there is no legal framework setting out how a living will should be made . that means medical staff are bound to consider even a couple of lines that a patient scribbled on a scrap of paper .
but such information can lead to more uncertainty about a person 's wishes , because their instructions are often too nebulous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal chamber of physicians is against regulating living wills " it needs to be more detailed , " said wolfgang kramer from the german hospice foundation .
" in our experience , people write something down , but it ca n't be used in a concrete situation because it 's too unspecific . " the german hospice foundation offers consultations on how to make a living will .
because there are so many topics to cover , the appointments usually last more than 90 minutes , and the result is a seven-page document . " at the beginning there are wishes such as ' i do n't want to suffer ' or ' i do n't want to end up attached to a tube , " ' kramer said .
" but when you explain the different possibilities and the kinds of conditions that come with certain illnesses , then people make completely different decisions . " wiesing from the federal chamber of physicians was hesitant about calling for government regulation of living wills .

but when it comes to those who ca n't communicate a so-called living will can help . the german parliament will debate the sensitive issue on thursday when parliamentarians consider draft legal guidelines that would apply to living wills .
more than 30 members of parliament have signed up to speak , three times more than usually do during bundestag debates . an estimated 8 million germans have made out a living will , setting out how they wish to be treated by medical staff in case of an accident or terminal illness .
for example , in a living will , a person might specify that her life-support machines should be turned off if they are still necessary four weeks after a bad accident . currently the legal framework around living wills is unclear and open to multiple interpretations .
many have read a 2003 decision by germany 's federal court as ruling that a stipulation to end medical treatment is only binding if the illness or injury will inevitably lead to death .
however , others have read the ruling differently . a draft guideline introduced by wolfgang bosbach of the conservative union bloc of parties would make patient stipulations regarding treatment or resuscitation only valid in the case of irreversible , terminal illness or injury . an alternative draft , presented by social democratic parliamentarian joachim stünker , gives the wishes of the patient highest priority . new guidelines needed ? according to urban wiesing of germany 's federal chamber of physicians , doctors are acting correctly if they follow instructions given in a living will now , even if the patient dies .
" it is the will of the patient that counts , " wiesing said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could pass a law on living wills later this year however , wiesing stressed that doctors are still required to follow german law .
" if a patient asks for medically assisted suicide , a doctor ca n't do that because that 's illegal , " he said . his group , along with the marburger bund doctors ' federation , has come out against putting new legal guidelines in place , saying that patients need only to be better informed about what goes into making a living will . " we are solving a problem here that was only created through politicians ' debate of the issue , " frank ulrich montgomery , head of the marburger bund , told the passauer neue presse newspaper . call for regulation at the moment there is no legal framework setting out how a living will should be made . that means medical staff are bound to consider even a couple of lines that a patient scribbled on a scrap of paper .
but such information can lead to more uncertainty about a person 's wishes , because their instructions are often too nebulous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal chamber of physicians is against regulating living wills " it needs to be more detailed , " said wolfgang kramer from the german hospice foundation .
" in our experience , people write something down , but it ca n't be used in a concrete situation because it 's too unspecific . " the german hospice foundation offers consultations on how to make a living will .
because there are so many topics to cover , the appointments usually last more than 90 minutes , and the result is a seven-page document . " at the beginning there are wishes such as ' i do n't want to suffer ' or ' i do n't want to end up attached to a tube , " ' kramer said .
" but when you explain the different possibilities and the kinds of conditions that come with certain illnesses , then people make completely different decisions . " wiesing from the federal chamber of physicians was hesitant about calling for government regulation of living wills .

without a number of established stars , the debutants gave a good account of themselves . germany 's soccer stars were the toast of the nation after their winning in prague at the weekend .
the victory over the czech republic left joachim löw 's men top of their european championship qualifying group and the team is now the favorite to reach the final stages next summer . on wednesday though , it was an almost unrecognizable side that took to the field for the friendly game against denmark . löw fielded a team missing stars like michael ballack , miroslav klose and jens lehmann .
in their place , the german coach brought in young stars robert enke , simon rolfes and roberto hibert . including substitutes , a total of seven players wore the national team colors for the first time ever in the friendly against denmark in duisburg as löw experimented without the pressure of a qualifying match . danes rob löw of undefeated title bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niclas bendtner , right , ended löw 's unbeaten run but the undefeated coach paid the price in the end , with his first reverse in charge of the national side .
danish striker niclas bendtner scored the only goal in the 82nd minute after connecting with a good cross from jesper groenkjar . however , löw was happy with his fledgling stars . " we are always being told to support young players in germany , and that is what we are doing , " he told ard television .
" we talked about it last october and have pretty quickly put it into practice . " it was down to experience , " the coach added .
" there were a lot of young players out there and it was a very important game for their development .

but when it comes to those who ca n't communicate a so-called living will can help . the german parliament will debate the sensitive issue on thursday when parliamentarians consider draft legal guidelines that would apply to living wills .
more than 30 members of parliament have signed up to speak , three times more than usually do during bundestag debates . an estimated 8 million germans have made out a living will , setting out how they wish to be treated by medical staff in case of an accident or terminal illness .
for example , in a living will , a person might specify that her life-support machines should be turned off if they are still necessary four weeks after a bad accident . currently the legal framework around living wills is unclear and open to multiple interpretations .
many have read a 2003 decision by germany 's federal court as ruling that a stipulation to end medical treatment is only binding if the illness or injury will inevitably lead to death .
however , others have read the ruling differently . a draft guideline introduced by wolfgang bosbach of the conservative union bloc of parties would make patient stipulations regarding treatment or resuscitation only valid in the case of irreversible , terminal illness or injury . an alternative draft , presented by social democratic parliamentarian joachim stünker , gives the wishes of the patient highest priority . new guidelines needed ? according to urban wiesing of germany 's federal chamber of physicians , doctors are acting correctly if they follow instructions given in a living will now , even if the patient dies .
" it is the will of the patient that counts , " wiesing said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could pass a law on living wills later this year however , wiesing stressed that doctors are still required to follow german law .
" if a patient asks for medically assisted suicide , a doctor ca n't do that because that 's illegal , " he said . his group , along with the marburger bund doctors ' federation , has come out against putting new legal guidelines in place , saying that patients need only to be better informed about what goes into making a living will . " we are solving a problem here that was only created through politicians ' debate of the issue , " frank ulrich montgomery , head of the marburger bund , told the passauer neue presse newspaper . call for regulation at the moment there is no legal framework setting out how a living will should be made . that means medical staff are bound to consider even a couple of lines that a patient scribbled on a scrap of paper .
but such information can lead to more uncertainty about a person 's wishes , because their instructions are often too nebulous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal chamber of physicians is against regulating living wills " it needs to be more detailed , " said wolfgang kramer from the german hospice foundation .
" in our experience , people write something down , but it ca n't be used in a concrete situation because it 's too unspecific . " the german hospice foundation offers consultations on how to make a living will .
because there are so many topics to cover , the appointments usually last more than 90 minutes , and the result is a seven-page document . " at the beginning there are wishes such as ' i do n't want to suffer ' or ' i do n't want to end up attached to a tube , " ' kramer said .
" but when you explain the different possibilities and the kinds of conditions that come with certain illnesses , then people make completely different decisions . " wiesing from the federal chamber of physicians was hesitant about calling for government regulation of living wills . " currently , the situation is n't that clear - both for patients and doctors , " he said .

but when it comes to those who ca n't communicate a so-called living will can help . the german parliament will debate the sensitive issue on thursday when parliamentarians consider draft legal guidelines that would apply to living wills .
more than 30 members of parliament have signed up to speak , three times more than usually do during bundestag debates . an estimated 8 million germans have made out a living will , setting out how they wish to be treated by medical staff in case of an accident or terminal illness .
for example , in a living will , a person might specify that her life-support machines should be turned off if they are still necessary four weeks after a bad accident . currently the legal framework around living wills is unclear and open to multiple interpretations .
many have read a 2003 decision by germany 's federal court as ruling that a stipulation to end medical treatment is only binding if the illness or injury will inevitably lead to death .
however , others have read the ruling differently . a draft guideline introduced by wolfgang bosbach of the conservative union bloc of parties would make patient stipulations regarding treatment or resuscitation only valid in the case of irreversible , terminal illness or injury . an alternative draft , presented by social democratic parliamentarian joachim stünker , gives the wishes of the patient highest priority . new guidelines needed ? according to urban wiesing of germany 's federal chamber of physicians , doctors are acting correctly if they follow instructions given in a living will now , even if the patient dies .
" it is the will of the patient that counts , " wiesing said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could pass a law on living wills later this year however , wiesing stressed that doctors are still required to follow german law .
" if a patient asks for medically assisted suicide , a doctor ca n't do that because that 's illegal , " he said . his group , along with the marburger bund doctors ' federation , has come out against putting new legal guidelines in place , saying that patients need only to be better informed about what goes into making a living will . " we are solving a problem here that was only created through politicians ' debate of the issue , " frank ulrich montgomery , head of the marburger bund , told the passauer neue presse newspaper . call for regulation at the moment there is no legal framework setting out how a living will should be made . that means medical staff are bound to consider even a couple of lines that a patient scribbled on a scrap of paper .
but such information can lead to more uncertainty about a person 's wishes , because their instructions are often too nebulous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal chamber of physicians is against regulating living wills " it needs to be more detailed , " said wolfgang kramer from the german hospice foundation .
" in our experience , people write something down , but it ca n't be used in a concrete situation because it 's too unspecific . " the german hospice foundation offers consultations on how to make a living will .
because there are so many topics to cover , the appointments usually last more than 90 minutes , and the result is a seven-page document . " at the beginning there are wishes such as ' i do n't want to suffer ' or ' i do n't want to end up attached to a tube , " ' kramer said .
" but when you explain the different possibilities and the kinds of conditions that come with certain illnesses , then people make completely different decisions . " wiesing from the federal chamber of physicians was hesitant about calling for government regulation of living wills . " currently , the situation is n't that clear - both for patients and doctors , " he said .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily defended the former government 's handing of the kurnaz case schily took some of the pressure of german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was schröder 's chief of staff at the time of kurnaz 's imprisonment . " steinmeier had to rely on the proper , careful analysis of the facts carried out by the interior ministry and the intelligence services , " schily said , adding that the government 's conduct had been " perfectly correct . " no charges against kurnaz kurnaz was arrested in pakistan just weeks after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks and handed over to us authorities .
he eventually landed in the us detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba , where he says he was tortured until his release in august 2006 . the bnd secret service parliamentary investigative committee is looking at whether the former government turned down an offer to release kurnaz in 2002 after us officials found he posed no danger - as is claimed by kurnaz . schily said the former government made the decision not to let kurnaz travel back into germany because he was a security risk . " he might have been misguided by people around him , but he was n't harmless , " schily said . he added there were indications that when kurnaz was arrested in 2001 , he was actually on his way to train as a terrorist in afghanistan .
schily said it was the duty of the secret service to do everything possible to avert the danger of terrorism . he also said the government had supported kurnaz ' repatriation to turkey .
but at the same time , schily said , he was n't aware of an offer from the usa in 2002 to set kurnaz free . criticism of the us the former interior minister also stressed that the responsibility for guantanamo rested firmly with the united states .
criticism , therefore , had to be directed at the us government and not at the german government , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has been heavily criticized for its handing of inmates at guantanamo " the american 's responsibility is clear , " schily told the committee .
" i wo n't allow the blame for what happened in guantanamo to be laid at the door of the -lrb- social democratic-green -rrb- government , " schily said . kurnaz was eventually freed after chancellor angela merkel came to power due to a lack of proof that he belonged to a terrorist group .
he lives in the northern german city of bremen . steinmeier faces questioning steinmeier is to speak before the committee later on thursday afternoon , in his second appearance before the investigative committee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz was released after the intervention of current chancellor angela merkel free democratic party chairman max stadler , who heads the bnd committee , has accused steinmeier of contradictory behavior .
stadler said he wants steinmeier to explain why he was actively against the return of kurnaz while chief of staff , but then pushed for his release as foreign minister . the human rights organization amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- said the former social democratic-green government had a " clear co-responsibility " for kurnaz ' lengthy detention . " the government did n't push for the early release of kurnaz from his nearly five-years of degrading detention even though he was n't proven guilty , " the head of ai 's german branch , barbara lochbihler said . the german government should pay kurnaz damages because it was responsible for delaying the man 's release , the united nation 's special investigator on torture , manfred nowak , told german broadcaster bayerische runkfunk . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ex-spy chief defends labeling guantanamo inmate security risk as chancellery chief of staff , current foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was aware of the interior ministry 's plans to keep a german-born guantanamo bay prisoner out of the country , a high-ranking official said .

without a number of established stars , the debutants gave a good account of themselves . germany 's soccer stars were the toast of the nation after their winning in prague at the weekend .

but when it comes to those who ca n't communicate a so-called living will can help . the german parliament will debate the sensitive issue on thursday when parliamentarians consider draft legal guidelines that would apply to living wills .
more than 30 members of parliament have signed up to speak , three times more than usually do during bundestag debates . an estimated 8 million germans have made out a living will , setting out how they wish to be treated by medical staff in case of an accident or terminal illness .
for example , in a living will , a person might specify that her life-support machines should be turned off if they are still necessary four weeks after a bad accident . currently the legal framework around living wills is unclear and open to multiple interpretations .
many have read a 2003 decision by germany 's federal court as ruling that a stipulation to end medical treatment is only binding if the illness or injury will inevitably lead to death .
however , others have read the ruling differently . a draft guideline introduced by wolfgang bosbach of the conservative union bloc of parties would make patient stipulations regarding treatment or resuscitation only valid in the case of irreversible , terminal illness or injury . an alternative draft , presented by social democratic parliamentarian joachim stünker , gives the wishes of the patient highest priority . new guidelines needed ? according to urban wiesing of germany 's federal chamber of physicians , doctors are acting correctly if they follow instructions given in a living will now , even if the patient dies .
" it is the will of the patient that counts , " wiesing said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could pass a law on living wills later this year however , wiesing stressed that doctors are still required to follow german law .
" if a patient asks for medically assisted suicide , a doctor ca n't do that because that 's illegal , " he said . his group , along with the marburger bund doctors ' federation , has come out against putting new legal guidelines in place , saying that patients need only to be better informed about what goes into making a living will . " we are solving a problem here that was only created through politicians ' debate of the issue , " frank ulrich montgomery , head of the marburger bund , told the passauer neue presse newspaper . call for regulation at the moment there is no legal framework setting out how a living will should be made . that means medical staff are bound to consider even a couple of lines that a patient scribbled on a scrap of paper .
but such information can lead to more uncertainty about a person 's wishes , because their instructions are often too nebulous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal chamber of physicians is against regulating living wills " it needs to be more detailed , " said wolfgang kramer from the german hospice foundation .
" in our experience , people write something down , but it ca n't be used in a concrete situation because it 's too unspecific . " the german hospice foundation offers consultations on how to make a living will .
because there are so many topics to cover , the appointments usually last more than 90 minutes , and the result is a seven-page document . " at the beginning there are wishes such as ' i do n't want to suffer ' or ' i do n't want to end up attached to a tube , " ' kramer said .
" but when you explain the different possibilities and the kinds of conditions that come with certain illnesses , then people make completely different decisions . " wiesing from the federal chamber of physicians was hesitant about calling for government regulation of living wills . " currently , the situation is n't that clear - both for patients and doctors , " he said .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily defended the former government 's handing of the kurnaz case schily took some of the pressure of german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was schröder 's chief of staff at the time of kurnaz 's imprisonment . " steinmeier had to rely on the proper , careful analysis of the facts carried out by the interior ministry and the intelligence services , " schily said , adding that the government 's conduct had been " perfectly correct . " no charges against kurnaz kurnaz was arrested in pakistan just weeks after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks and handed over to us authorities .
he eventually landed in the us detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba , where he says he was tortured until his release in august 2006 . the bnd secret service parliamentary investigative committee is looking at whether the former government turned down an offer to release kurnaz in 2002 after us officials found he posed no danger - as is claimed by kurnaz . schily said the former government made the decision not to let kurnaz travel back into germany because he was a security risk . " he might have been misguided by people around him , but he was n't harmless , " schily said . he added there were indications that when kurnaz was arrested in 2001 , he was actually on his way to train as a terrorist in afghanistan .
schily said it was the duty of the secret service to do everything possible to avert the danger of terrorism . he also said the government had supported kurnaz ' repatriation to turkey .
but at the same time , schily said , he was n't aware of an offer from the usa in 2002 to set kurnaz free . criticism of the us the former interior minister also stressed that the responsibility for guantanamo rested firmly with the united states .

without a number of established stars , the debutants gave a good account of themselves . germany 's soccer stars were the toast of the nation after their winning in prague at the weekend .
the victory over the czech republic left joachim löw 's men top of their european championship qualifying group and the team is now the favorite to reach the final stages next summer . on wednesday though , it was an almost unrecognizable side that took to the field for the friendly game against denmark . löw fielded a team missing stars like michael ballack , miroslav klose and jens lehmann .
in their place , the german coach brought in young stars robert enke , simon rolfes and roberto hibert . including substitutes , a total of seven players wore the national team colors for the first time ever in the friendly against denmark in duisburg as löw experimented without the pressure of a qualifying match . danes rob löw of undefeated title bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niclas bendtner , right , ended löw 's unbeaten run but the undefeated coach paid the price in the end , with his first reverse in charge of the national side .
danish striker niclas bendtner scored the only goal in the 82nd minute after connecting with a good cross from jesper groenkjar . however , löw was happy with his fledgling stars . " we are always being told to support young players in germany , and that is what we are doing , " he told ard television .
" we talked about it last october and have pretty quickly put it into practice . " it was down to experience , " the coach added .
" there were a lot of young players out there and it was a very important game for their development .
one day they will have to replace frings , ballack or klose .
we took the risk that we might lose the game , but it was great experience for the youngsters . " the most impressive of the debutants does n't even play top-flight soccer .
patrick helmes , from second division cologne , had three great chances to score despite only coming on late in the game . " it was a great feeling and a great honor , " helmes said .
" but on the other hand , i 'm disappointed because we did n't win .
a goal for me would have been the crowning glory but it was n't to be .
i 'll just have to try again against koblenz on sunday . " composed first-half per formance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's youngsters held their own until the 82nd minute it was the first international game to be played in duisburg since 1933 , and although the fans were a little disappointed at not seeing their heroes from the world cup , the new , young team did inspire the crowd in the first half with some neat passing movements . however the tempo dropped a little after the restart as both teams took the game 's " friendly " label rather too literally as neither side looked intent on challenging or fighting for the ball in a very gentlemanly opening . denmark , fielding their strongest side , had the better of the chances in the second half but , despite some signs of dissatisfaction from the supporters , a very young and inexperienced germany side certainly held their own on the international stage . even in defeat , it was a promising sign for the future . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de löw to blood german youngsters much to denmark 's chagrin germany 's coach joachim löw will ring the changes for wednesday night 's friendly against denmark by announcing an inexperienced 16-man squad aimed at blooding some of his rising stars .

-lrb- 25.03.2007 -rrb- " young players are good for us " national coach joachim löw has called up four newcomers for germany 's euro 2008 qualifier in prague on saturday .
that 's due to injuries , but it also reflects the plethora of young talent he has at his disposal .

without a number of established stars , the debutants gave a good account of themselves . germany 's soccer stars were the toast of the nation after their winning in prague at the weekend .
the victory over the czech republic left joachim löw 's men top of their european championship qualifying group and the team is now the favorite to reach the final stages next summer . on wednesday though , it was an almost unrecognizable side that took to the field for the friendly game against denmark . löw fielded a team missing stars like michael ballack , miroslav klose and jens lehmann .
in their place , the german coach brought in young stars robert enke , simon rolfes and roberto hibert . including substitutes , a total of seven players wore the national team colors for the first time ever in the friendly against denmark in duisburg as löw experimented without the pressure of a qualifying match . danes rob löw of undefeated title bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niclas bendtner , right , ended löw 's unbeaten run but the undefeated coach paid the price in the end , with his first reverse in charge of the national side .
danish striker niclas bendtner scored the only goal in the 82nd minute after connecting with a good cross from jesper groenkjar . however , löw was happy with his fledgling stars . " we are always being told to support young players in germany , and that is what we are doing , " he told ard television .
" we talked about it last october and have pretty quickly put it into practice . " it was down to experience , " the coach added .
" there were a lot of young players out there and it was a very important game for their development .
one day they will have to replace frings , ballack or klose .
we took the risk that we might lose the game , but it was great experience for the youngsters . " the most impressive of the debutants does n't even play top-flight soccer .
patrick helmes , from second division cologne , had three great chances to score despite only coming on late in the game . " it was a great feeling and a great honor , " helmes said .
" but on the other hand , i 'm disappointed because we did n't win .
a goal for me would have been the crowning glory but it was n't to be .
i 'll just have to try again against koblenz on sunday . " composed first-half per formance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's youngsters held their own until the 82nd minute it was the first international game to be played in duisburg since 1933 , and although the fans were a little disappointed at not seeing their heroes from the world cup , the new , young team did inspire the crowd in the first half with some neat passing movements . however the tempo dropped a little after the restart as both teams took the game 's " friendly " label rather too literally as neither side looked intent on challenging or fighting for the ball in a very gentlemanly opening . denmark , fielding their strongest side , had the better of the chances in the second half but , despite some signs of dissatisfaction from the supporters , a very young and inexperienced germany side certainly held their own on the international stage . even in defeat , it was a promising sign for the future . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de löw to blood german youngsters much to denmark 's chagrin germany 's coach joachim löw will ring the changes for wednesday night 's friendly against denmark by announcing an inexperienced 16-man squad aimed at blooding some of his rising stars .

that 's due to injuries , but it also reflects the plethora of young talent he has at his disposal .

" germany has an alcohol problem , " said rolf huellinghorst , general manager of the german headquarters for dependency issues .
he pointed out that europe 's most populous nation has one of the highest levels of alcohol consumption in the industrialized world . germans consume an average of 10 liters -lrb- 2.6 gallons -rrb- of pure alcohol each year , he said , adding that around 12 percent of the 82 million population was " at risk " because of their drinking habits . a survey published earlier this month by the european union showed that one in 10 europeans confesses to regular binge-drinking , with the irish leading the way , followed by finns and britons . germans up there with the brits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beer makers complain that drinkers are going for spirits and wine with higher alcohol content germany was lower down the list in the study published by the eu pollsters eurobarometer , but another survey conducted by britain 's datamonitor last year showed that germans drink more on a night out than in any other western european country , except the united kingdom . in germany , the legal age to drink beer , wine and champagne is 16 , but for stronger drinks such as vodka , brandy and other spirits it is 18 . the government on wednesday rejected calls to tighten laws governing the sale of alcohol in a bid to clamp down on binge-drinking . a stricter application of the laws already in place would suffice , said bätzing , pointing out that bar and club owners should be held accountable for serving under-age drinkers and those who are drunk . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians call for increasing drinking age to 18 numerous politicians have demanded that alcohol be banned from minors in germany .

11 attacks in 2001 . there were " good reasons " why kurnaz had been categorized as a possible radical-islamist " sleeper " and a security risk , steinmeier told the committee , which is investigating cooperation between the former social democratic-green party coalition under gerhard schröder with the unites states ' " war on terror . " kurnaz was arrested in pakistan just weeks after sept .
11 and handed over to us authorities .
he eventually landed in the us detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba , where he says he was tortured until his release without charges in august 2006 . vote against kurnaz ' return in october 2002 , steinmeier - who was then schröder 's chief of staff - led a committee of german secret service officials which voted against allowing kurnaz to return to germany .
steinmeier has denied the united states offered to release kurnaz in 2002 , as has been alleged by german media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz says he was tortured in guantanamo " the us never considered releasing him , " steinmeier said . he also stressed that the government had " tried many times to intervene " in the case , but the plan was to return kurnaz to turkey , where he had citizenship , rather than to germany , where kurnaz had been born but for which he only had a residence permit . " in october 2002 , germany was considered to be a direct target for attacks , " the foreign minister said . " attack warnings came on a weekly basis . we reckoned with an estimated 3,000 sleepers , " he said .
" top secret service officers described mr. kurnaz in october 2002 as a security risk , and i had no reason to doubt these assessments . " steinmeier said that even today , he believed the decision was " justified . " interior ministry responsible earlier on thursday , germany 's former interior minister , otto schily , claimed political responsibility for the handling of the kurnaz case , taking some of the pressure off steinmeier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official documents given to the inquiry show the interior ministry drew up a five-point plan to prevent kurnaz return schily , who was interior minister under the schröder , told the committee he was responsible for all government " actions and omissions . " schily said there was no doubt that the interior ministry - and not the chancellery or the foreign ministry - had " the core responsibility for the valuation of security cases . " " steinmeier had to rely on the proper , careful analysis of the facts carried out by the interior ministry and the intelligence services , " schily said , adding that the government 's conduct had been " perfectly correct . " kurnaz was freed after chancellor angela merkel came to power due to a lack of proof that he belonged to a terrorist group .
he lives in the northern german city of bremen . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ex-interior minister takes political responsibility for kurnaz case germany 's former interior minister otto schily has said he was " politically responsible " for the case of a german-born turk who languished in guantanamo bay for nearly five years before being released without charge .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.03.2007 germans fear new far-left union could threaten establishment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left offers a haven for german left wingers who feel underserved a new , far-left german political party , called simply the left , was recently made official .
some say it could seriously damage the country 's ruling center-left social democrats . when delegates from germany 's two biggest far-left parties overwhelmingly backed a formal merger on sunday , it was a penultimate step toward establishing " dielinke " -lrb- the left -rrb- as the country 's fourth-largest political party . observers say the party poses a credible threat to the social democratic party , the traditional home of germany 's left wing .
the spd is currently part of the uneasy " grand coalition " government that rules together with angela merkel 's center-right christian democratic union / christian socialist union bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its official : party delegates vote in favor of a wasg-pds union on sunday , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , a successor to the communist party of east germany , and the labor and social justice party -lrb- wasg -rrb- , a western splinter group led by former spd chairman oskar lafontaine , officially approved the merger .
the new party , dielinke . -lrb- period included -rrb- will be formally called into life at a conference in june . heavy losses at the spd the pds and wasg first campaigned under one banner in the snap national elections in 2005 , where they got a respectable 8.7 percent of the vote .
that result landed them the fourth slot on the national political scene . now , political watchers are warning that the the new party poses an additional threat to the established spd , which has already seen its membership drop by over 40 percent since it gained national power under gerhard schröder , in 1998 .
the new party is now serving as a catch-all for those who feel the spd has moved too far to the center , observers say . the von der leyen problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister von der leyen pleases right and left alike one big problem for the spd : it lost support from its traditional trade-union voter base after it took measures to reform the ailing social-welfare state .
meanwhile , the right , traditionally conservative on social issues , seems to have recently discovered the glories of progressive social policy , particulary around women 's and family issues . " the most popular politician these days is -lrb- cdu -rrb- family minister ursula von der leyen , who advocates all-day schools and a woman 's right to work , " said arnold schölzel , editor-in-chief of the far-left newspaper junge welt .
" meanwhile the spd came up with the idea of pushing back retirement to 67 , essentially shortening retirement .
this has left lafontaine a wide-open field . " part of the spd 's problem is simply that it moved from having the freedom of being an opposition party to actually governing the country , said uwe andersen , a professor emeritus of political science at the university of bochum . " as a party in government , the spd is responsible for policy measures that are not always liked by the public , " andersen said .
" it 's especially interesting that the -lrb- new left -rrb- is pitching this anti-war movement , because even the green party , when they were in government with the spd , sent german troops abroad . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi , of the pds -lrb- left -rrb- , with his new partner , wasg 's lafontaine he said the new left-wing party could benefit from the difficult position the spd finds itself in , trying to strike a balance between holding on to disgruntled left-wing voters , while not losing the middle , where elections are generally decided . spd : what problem ? the spd response has been to play down the affair and deny the new party poses any real threat . " i think it is absurd to believe the left will get political momentum out of this new fusion , " spd steering committee member andrea nahles told berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper . and a member of the spd executive committee , niels annen , likewise told reporters he did n't expect to lose members to the far left - although he did caution trade unions not to let the workers ' movement become " fragmented . " spd spokesmen also took care to stress that the party continues to represent the interests of workers - most recently , in a public push to create a minimum wage . yet some critics say this response is not enough . local elections as indicator " the spd 's only chance is to leave the government and go look at its ideas again , " said junge welt 's schölzel .
" it is inevitable that they will have to leave the coalition before the next regular election . "
german voters will go to the polls in the general election in 2009 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under schröder , spd membership tumbled schölzel and others agree that upcoming parliamentary elections in some german states will be a good indicator of the relative weakness , or strength , of the spd and the left . meanwhile , political scientist andersen said he sees the advent of a fourth major political party as heralding a wider change in national politics , almost a balkanization of the german political landscape , which used to be dominated by the two big parties , the cdu / csu and the spd . " but now there is a tendency where a bigger part of the electorate is ready to vote for smaller parties - even extremist parties , " he said .
" it makes it more difficult to form a government .

-lrb- 27.03.2007 -rrb- social democrat leader warns against too many reforms the chairman of germany 's social democratic party , kurt beck , said that the painful social and economic reforms introduced by chancellor angela merkel had hurt germans badly and that people wouldn ’ t accept more .

11 attacks in 2001 . there were " good reasons " why kurnaz had been categorized as a possible radical-islamist " sleeper " and a security risk , steinmeier told the committee , which is investigating cooperation between the former social democratic-green party coalition under gerhard schröder with the unites states ' " war on terror . " kurnaz was arrested in pakistan just weeks after sept .
11 and handed over to us authorities .
he eventually landed in the us detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba , where he says he was tortured until his release without charges in august 2006 . vote against kurnaz ' return in october 2002 , steinmeier - who was then schröder 's chief of staff - led a committee of german secret service officials which voted against allowing kurnaz to return to germany .
steinmeier has denied the united states offered to release kurnaz in 2002 , as has been alleged by german media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz says he was tortured in guantanamo " the us never considered releasing him , " steinmeier said . he also stressed that the government had " tried many times to intervene " in the case , but the plan was to return kurnaz to turkey , where he had citizenship , rather than to germany , where kurnaz had been born but for which he only had a residence permit . " in october 2002 , germany was considered to be a direct target for attacks , " the foreign minister said . " attack warnings came on a weekly basis . we reckoned with an estimated 3,000 sleepers , " he said .
" top secret service officers described mr. kurnaz in october 2002 as a security risk , and i had no reason to doubt these assessments . " steinmeier said that even today , he believed the decision was " justified . " interior ministry responsible earlier on thursday , germany 's former interior minister , otto schily , claimed political responsibility for the handling of the kurnaz case , taking some of the pressure off steinmeier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official documents given to the inquiry show the interior ministry drew up a five-point plan to prevent kurnaz return schily , who was interior minister under the schröder , told the committee he was responsible for all government " actions and omissions . " schily said there was no doubt that the interior ministry - and not the chancellery or the foreign ministry - had " the core responsibility for the valuation of security cases . " " steinmeier had to rely on the proper , careful analysis of the facts carried out by the interior ministry and the intelligence services , " schily said , adding that the government 's conduct had been " perfectly correct . " kurnaz was freed after chancellor angela merkel came to power due to a lack of proof that he belonged to a terrorist group .
he lives in the northern german city of bremen . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ex-interior minister takes political responsibility for kurnaz case germany 's former interior minister otto schily has said he was " politically responsible " for the case of a german-born turk who languished in guantanamo bay for nearly five years before being released without charge .

without a number of established stars , the debutants gave a good account of themselves . germany 's soccer stars were the toast of the nation after their winning in prague at the weekend .
the victory over the czech republic left joachim löw 's men top of their european championship qualifying group and the team is now the favorite to reach the final stages next summer . on wednesday though , it was an almost unrecognizable side that took to the field for the friendly game against denmark . löw fielded a team missing stars like michael ballack , miroslav klose and jens lehmann .
in their place , the german coach brought in young stars robert enke , simon rolfes and roberto hibert . including substitutes , a total of seven players wore the national team colors for the first time ever in the friendly against denmark in duisburg as löw experimented without the pressure of a qualifying match . danes rob löw of undefeated title bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niclas bendtner , right , ended löw 's unbeaten run but the undefeated coach paid the price in the end , with his first reverse in charge of the national side .
danish striker niclas bendtner scored the only goal in the 82nd minute after connecting with a good cross from jesper groenkjar . however , löw was happy with his fledgling stars . " we are always being told to support young players in germany , and that is what we are doing , " he told ard television .
" we talked about it last october and have pretty quickly put it into practice . " it was down to experience , " the coach added .
" there were a lot of young players out there and it was a very important game for their development .
one day they will have to replace frings , ballack or klose .
we took the risk that we might lose the game , but it was great experience for the youngsters . " the most impressive of the debutants does n't even play top-flight soccer .
patrick helmes , from second division cologne , had three great chances to score despite only coming on late in the game . " it was a great feeling and a great honor , " helmes said .
" but on the other hand , i 'm disappointed because we did n't win .
a goal for me would have been the crowning glory but it was n't to be .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.03.2007 german parliament debates living wills for the dying großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors face uncertainty over living wills germany 's parliament debates the issue of living wills on thursday , as those involved in caring for the terminally ill demand a legal framework for patients to set out their treatment wishes . it is unconstitutional in germany for a doctor to treat a person against his or her will , even if the patient is at risk of dying .
but when it comes to those who ca n't communicate a so-called living will can help . the german parliament will debate the sensitive issue on thursday when parliamentarians consider draft legal guidelines that would apply to living wills .
more than 30 members of parliament have signed up to speak , three times more than usually do during bundestag debates . an estimated 8 million germans have made out a living will , setting out how they wish to be treated by medical staff in case of an accident or terminal illness .
for example , in a living will , a person might specify that her life-support machines should be turned off if they are still necessary four weeks after a bad accident . currently the legal framework around living wills is unclear and open to multiple interpretations .
many have read a 2003 decision by germany 's federal court as ruling that a stipulation to end medical treatment is only binding if the illness or injury will inevitably lead to death .
however , others have read the ruling differently . a draft guideline introduced by wolfgang bosbach of the conservative union bloc of parties would make patient stipulations regarding treatment or resuscitation only valid in the case of irreversible , terminal illness or injury . an alternative draft , presented by social democratic parliamentarian joachim stünker , gives the wishes of the patient highest priority . new guidelines needed ? according to urban wiesing of germany 's federal chamber of physicians , doctors are acting correctly if they follow instructions given in a living will now , even if the patient dies .
" it is the will of the patient that counts , " wiesing said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could pass a law on living wills later this year however , wiesing stressed that doctors are still required to follow german law .
" if a patient asks for medically assisted suicide , a doctor ca n't do that because that 's illegal , " he said . his group , along with the marburger bund doctors ' federation , has come out against putting new legal guidelines in place , saying that patients need only to be better informed about what goes into making a living will . " we are solving a problem here that was only created through politicians ' debate of the issue , " frank ulrich montgomery , head of the marburger bund , told the passauer neue presse newspaper . call for regulation at the moment there is no legal framework setting out how a living will should be made . that means medical staff are bound to consider even a couple of lines that a patient scribbled on a scrap of paper .
but such information can lead to more uncertainty about a person 's wishes , because their instructions are often too nebulous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal chamber of physicians is against regulating living wills " it needs to be more detailed , " said wolfgang kramer from the german hospice foundation .
" in our experience , people write something down , but it ca n't be used in a concrete situation because it 's too unspecific . " the german hospice foundation offers consultations on how to make a living will .
because there are so many topics to cover , the appointments usually last more than 90 minutes , and the result is a seven-page document . " at the beginning there are wishes such as ' i do n't want to suffer ' or ' i do n't want to end up attached to a tube , " ' kramer said .
" but when you explain the different possibilities and the kinds of conditions that come with certain illnesses , then people make completely different decisions . " wiesing from the federal chamber of physicians was hesitant about calling for government regulation of living wills . " currently , the situation is n't that clear - both for patients and doctors , " he said .
" we should all try to reduce this uncertainty but not at the cost of individual rights .

11 attacks in 2001 . there were " good reasons " why kurnaz had been categorized as a possible radical-islamist " sleeper " and a security risk , steinmeier told the committee , which is investigating cooperation between the former social democratic-green party coalition under gerhard schröder with the unites states ' " war on terror . " kurnaz was arrested in pakistan just weeks after sept .
11 and handed over to us authorities .
he eventually landed in the us detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba , where he says he was tortured until his release without charges in august 2006 . vote against kurnaz ' return in october 2002 , steinmeier - who was then schröder 's chief of staff - led a committee of german secret service officials which voted against allowing kurnaz to return to germany .
steinmeier has denied the united states offered to release kurnaz in 2002 , as has been alleged by german media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz says he was tortured in guantanamo " the us never considered releasing him , " steinmeier said . he also stressed that the government had " tried many times to intervene " in the case , but the plan was to return kurnaz to turkey , where he had citizenship , rather than to germany , where kurnaz had been born but for which he only had a residence permit . " in october 2002 , germany was considered to be a direct target for attacks , " the foreign minister said . " attack warnings came on a weekly basis . we reckoned with an estimated 3,000 sleepers , " he said .

" obviously we trespassed in the waters , " she said .
" they were friendly , very hospitable , very thoughtful .
nice people , " she said of her captors . access denied the british embassy in tehran said it still had no news about the location of the sailors and had not been able to visit them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says the britons were in iranian waters at six different points " we have no information for the moment about a consular visit with the 15 sailors and the release of faye turney , " a british diplomat told afp .

without a number of established stars , the debutants gave a good account of themselves . germany 's soccer stars were the toast of the nation after their winning in prague at the weekend .
the victory over the czech republic left joachim löw 's men top of their european championship qualifying group and the team is now the favorite to reach the final stages next summer . on wednesday though , it was an almost unrecognizable side that took to the field for the friendly game against denmark . löw fielded a team missing stars like michael ballack , miroslav klose and jens lehmann .
in their place , the german coach brought in young stars robert enke , simon rolfes and roberto hibert . including substitutes , a total of seven players wore the national team colors for the first time ever in the friendly against denmark in duisburg as löw experimented without the pressure of a qualifying match . danes rob löw of undefeated title bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niclas bendtner , right , ended löw 's unbeaten run but the undefeated coach paid the price in the end , with his first reverse in charge of the national side .
danish striker niclas bendtner scored the only goal in the 82nd minute after connecting with a good cross from jesper groenkjar . however , löw was happy with his fledgling stars . " we are always being told to support young players in germany , and that is what we are doing , " he told ard television .
" we talked about it last october and have pretty quickly put it into practice . " it was down to experience , " the coach added .
" there were a lot of young players out there and it was a very important game for their development .
one day they will have to replace frings , ballack or klose .
we took the risk that we might lose the game , but it was great experience for the youngsters . " the most impressive of the debutants does n't even play top-flight soccer .
patrick helmes , from second division cologne , had three great chances to score despite only coming on late in the game . " it was a great feeling and a great honor , " helmes said .
" but on the other hand , i 'm disappointed because we did n't win .
a goal for me would have been the crowning glory but it was n't to be .
i 'll just have to try again against koblenz on sunday . " composed first-half per formance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's youngsters held their own until the 82nd minute it was the first international game to be played in duisburg since 1933 , and although the fans were a little disappointed at not seeing their heroes from the world cup , the new , young team did inspire the crowd in the first half with some neat passing movements . however the tempo dropped a little after the restart as both teams took the game 's " friendly " label rather too literally as neither side looked intent on challenging or fighting for the ball in a very gentlemanly opening . denmark , fielding their strongest side , had the better of the chances in the second half but , despite some signs of dissatisfaction from the supporters , a very young and inexperienced germany side certainly held their own on the international stage . even in defeat , it was a promising sign for the future . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de löw to blood german youngsters much to denmark 's chagrin germany 's coach joachim löw will ring the changes for wednesday night 's friendly against denmark by announcing an inexperienced 16-man squad aimed at blooding some of his rising stars .
-lrb- 28.03.2007 -rrb- kuranyi double sinks czechs and keeps germany in command striker kevin kuranyi ensured germany stay top of their euro 2008 qualifying group with two headed goals either side of half-time as his side poached a 2-1 win over the czech republic on saturday .
-lrb- 25.03.2007 -rrb- " young players are good for us " national coach joachim löw has called up four newcomers for germany 's euro 2008 qualifier in prague on saturday .
that 's due to injuries , but it also reflects the plethora of young talent he has at his disposal .

some say it could seriously damage the country 's ruling center-left social democrats . when delegates from germany 's two biggest far-left parties overwhelmingly backed a formal merger on sunday , it was a penultimate step toward establishing " dielinke " -lrb- the left -rrb- as the country 's fourth-largest political party . observers say the party poses a credible threat to the social democratic party , the traditional home of germany 's left wing .
the spd is currently part of the uneasy " grand coalition " government that rules together with angela merkel 's center-right christian democratic union / christian socialist union bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its official : party delegates vote in favor of a wasg-pds union on sunday , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , a successor to the communist party of east germany , and the labor and social justice party -lrb- wasg -rrb- , a western splinter group led by former spd chairman oskar lafontaine , officially approved the merger .
the new party , dielinke . -lrb- period included -rrb- will be formally called into life at a conference in june . heavy losses at the spd the pds and wasg first campaigned under one banner in the snap national elections in 2005 , where they got a respectable 8.7 percent of the vote .
that result landed them the fourth slot on the national political scene . now , political watchers are warning that the the new party poses an additional threat to the established spd , which has already seen its membership drop by over 40 percent since it gained national power under gerhard schröder , in 1998 .
the new party is now serving as a catch-all for those who feel the spd has moved too far to the center , observers say . the von der leyen problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister von der leyen pleases right and left alike one big problem for the spd : it lost support from its traditional trade-union voter base after it took measures to reform the ailing social-welfare state .
meanwhile , the right , traditionally conservative on social issues , seems to have recently discovered the glories of progressive social policy , particulary around women 's and family issues . " the most popular politician these days is -lrb- cdu -rrb- family minister ursula von der leyen , who advocates all-day schools and a woman 's right to work , " said arnold schölzel , editor-in-chief of the far-left newspaper junge welt .
" meanwhile the spd came up with the idea of pushing back retirement to 67 , essentially shortening retirement .
this has left lafontaine a wide-open field . " part of the spd 's problem is simply that it moved from having the freedom of being an opposition party to actually governing the country , said uwe andersen , a professor emeritus of political science at the university of bochum . " as a party in government , the spd is responsible for policy measures that are not always liked by the public , " andersen said .
" it 's especially interesting that the -lrb- new left -rrb- is pitching this anti-war movement , because even the green party , when they were in government with the spd , sent german troops abroad . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi , of the pds -lrb- left -rrb- , with his new partner , wasg 's lafontaine he said the new left-wing party could benefit from the difficult position the spd finds itself in , trying to strike a balance between holding on to disgruntled left-wing voters , while not losing the middle , where elections are generally decided . spd : what problem ? the spd response has been to play down the affair and deny the new party poses any real threat . " i think it is absurd to believe the left will get political momentum out of this new fusion , " spd steering committee member andrea nahles told berlin 's der tagesspiegel newspaper . and a member of the spd executive committee , niels annen , likewise told reporters he did n't expect to lose members to the far left - although he did caution trade unions not to let the workers ' movement become " fragmented . " spd spokesmen also took care to stress that the party continues to represent the interests of workers - most recently , in a public push to create a minimum wage . yet some critics say this response is not enough . local elections as indicator " the spd 's only chance is to leave the government and go look at its ideas again , " said junge welt 's schölzel .
" it is inevitable that they will have to leave the coalition before the next regular election . "
german voters will go to the polls in the general election in 2009 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under schröder , spd membership tumbled schölzel and others agree that upcoming parliamentary elections in some german states will be a good indicator of the relative weakness , or strength , of the spd and the left . meanwhile , political scientist andersen said he sees the advent of a fourth major political party as heralding a wider change in national politics , almost a balkanization of the german political landscape , which used to be dominated by the two big parties , the cdu / csu and the spd . " but now there is a tendency where a bigger part of the electorate is ready to vote for smaller parties - even extremist parties , " he said .
" it makes it more difficult to form a government .

-lrb- 27.03.2007 -rrb- social democrat leader warns against too many reforms the chairman of germany 's social democratic party , kurt beck , said that the painful social and economic reforms introduced by chancellor angela merkel had hurt germans badly and that people wouldn ’ t accept more .
-lrb- 29.12.2006 -rrb- most germans find grand coalition government ineffective polls showed that germans tend to be pleased with their country 's - and their own - economic future but remain split on which political parties should be leading the nation and how well they are performing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.03.2007 german parliament debates living wills for the dying großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors face uncertainty over living wills germany 's parliament debates the issue of living wills on thursday , as those involved in caring for the terminally ill demand a legal framework for patients to set out their treatment wishes . it is unconstitutional in germany for a doctor to treat a person against his or her will , even if the patient is at risk of dying .
but when it comes to those who ca n't communicate a so-called living will can help . the german parliament will debate the sensitive issue on thursday when parliamentarians consider draft legal guidelines that would apply to living wills .
more than 30 members of parliament have signed up to speak , three times more than usually do during bundestag debates . an estimated 8 million germans have made out a living will , setting out how they wish to be treated by medical staff in case of an accident or terminal illness .
for example , in a living will , a person might specify that her life-support machines should be turned off if they are still necessary four weeks after a bad accident . currently the legal framework around living wills is unclear and open to multiple interpretations .
many have read a 2003 decision by germany 's federal court as ruling that a stipulation to end medical treatment is only binding if the illness or injury will inevitably lead to death .
however , others have read the ruling differently . a draft guideline introduced by wolfgang bosbach of the conservative union bloc of parties would make patient stipulations regarding treatment or resuscitation only valid in the case of irreversible , terminal illness or injury . an alternative draft , presented by social democratic parliamentarian joachim stünker , gives the wishes of the patient highest priority . new guidelines needed ? according to urban wiesing of germany 's federal chamber of physicians , doctors are acting correctly if they follow instructions given in a living will now , even if the patient dies .
" it is the will of the patient that counts , " wiesing said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could pass a law on living wills later this year however , wiesing stressed that doctors are still required to follow german law .
" if a patient asks for medically assisted suicide , a doctor ca n't do that because that 's illegal , " he said . his group , along with the marburger bund doctors ' federation , has come out against putting new legal guidelines in place , saying that patients need only to be better informed about what goes into making a living will . " we are solving a problem here that was only created through politicians ' debate of the issue , " frank ulrich montgomery , head of the marburger bund , told the passauer neue presse newspaper . call for regulation at the moment there is no legal framework setting out how a living will should be made . that means medical staff are bound to consider even a couple of lines that a patient scribbled on a scrap of paper .
but such information can lead to more uncertainty about a person 's wishes , because their instructions are often too nebulous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal chamber of physicians is against regulating living wills " it needs to be more detailed , " said wolfgang kramer from the german hospice foundation .
" in our experience , people write something down , but it ca n't be used in a concrete situation because it 's too unspecific . " the german hospice foundation offers consultations on how to make a living will .
because there are so many topics to cover , the appointments usually last more than 90 minutes , and the result is a seven-page document . " at the beginning there are wishes such as ' i do n't want to suffer ' or ' i do n't want to end up attached to a tube , " ' kramer said .
" but when you explain the different possibilities and the kinds of conditions that come with certain illnesses , then people make completely different decisions . " wiesing from the federal chamber of physicians was hesitant about calling for government regulation of living wills . " currently , the situation is n't that clear - both for patients and doctors , " he said .
" we should all try to reduce this uncertainty but not at the cost of individual rights .

but when it comes to those who ca n't communicate a so-called living will can help . the german parliament will debate the sensitive issue on thursday when parliamentarians consider draft legal guidelines that would apply to living wills .
more than 30 members of parliament have signed up to speak , three times more than usually do during bundestag debates . an estimated 8 million germans have made out a living will , setting out how they wish to be treated by medical staff in case of an accident or terminal illness .
for example , in a living will , a person might specify that her life-support machines should be turned off if they are still necessary four weeks after a bad accident . currently the legal framework around living wills is unclear and open to multiple interpretations .
many have read a 2003 decision by germany 's federal court as ruling that a stipulation to end medical treatment is only binding if the illness or injury will inevitably lead to death .
however , others have read the ruling differently . a draft guideline introduced by wolfgang bosbach of the conservative union bloc of parties would make patient stipulations regarding treatment or resuscitation only valid in the case of irreversible , terminal illness or injury . an alternative draft , presented by social democratic parliamentarian joachim stünker , gives the wishes of the patient highest priority . new guidelines needed ? according to urban wiesing of germany 's federal chamber of physicians , doctors are acting correctly if they follow instructions given in a living will now , even if the patient dies .
" it is the will of the patient that counts , " wiesing said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could pass a law on living wills later this year however , wiesing stressed that doctors are still required to follow german law .
" if a patient asks for medically assisted suicide , a doctor ca n't do that because that 's illegal , " he said . his group , along with the marburger bund doctors ' federation , has come out against putting new legal guidelines in place , saying that patients need only to be better informed about what goes into making a living will . " we are solving a problem here that was only created through politicians ' debate of the issue , " frank ulrich montgomery , head of the marburger bund , told the passauer neue presse newspaper . call for regulation at the moment there is no legal framework setting out how a living will should be made . that means medical staff are bound to consider even a couple of lines that a patient scribbled on a scrap of paper .
but such information can lead to more uncertainty about a person 's wishes , because their instructions are often too nebulous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal chamber of physicians is against regulating living wills " it needs to be more detailed , " said wolfgang kramer from the german hospice foundation .
" in our experience , people write something down , but it ca n't be used in a concrete situation because it 's too unspecific . " the german hospice foundation offers consultations on how to make a living will .
because there are so many topics to cover , the appointments usually last more than 90 minutes , and the result is a seven-page document . " at the beginning there are wishes such as ' i do n't want to suffer ' or ' i do n't want to end up attached to a tube , " ' kramer said .
" but when you explain the different possibilities and the kinds of conditions that come with certain illnesses , then people make completely different decisions . " wiesing from the federal chamber of physicians was hesitant about calling for government regulation of living wills . " currently , the situation is n't that clear - both for patients and doctors , " he said .
" we should all try to reduce this uncertainty but not at the cost of individual rights .

" he might have been misguided by people around him , but he was n't harmless , " schily said . he added there were indications that when kurnaz was arrested in 2001 , he was actually on his way to train as a terrorist in afghanistan .
schily said it was the duty of the secret service to do everything possible to avert the danger of terrorism . he also said the government had supported kurnaz ' repatriation to turkey .

11 attacks in 2001 . there were " good reasons " why kurnaz had been categorized as a possible radical-islamist " sleeper " and a security risk , steinmeier told the committee , which is investigating cooperation between the former social democratic-green party coalition under gerhard schröder with the unites states ' " war on terror . " kurnaz was arrested in pakistan just weeks after sept .

he eventually landed in the us detention center in guantanamo bay , cuba , where he says he was tortured until his release without charges in august 2006 . vote against kurnaz ' return in october 2002 , steinmeier - who was then schröder 's chief of staff - led a committee of german secret service officials which voted against allowing kurnaz to return to germany .

" attack warnings came on a weekly basis . we reckoned with an estimated 3,000 sleepers , " he said .

" " steinmeier had to rely on the proper , careful analysis of the facts carried out by the interior ministry and the intelligence services , " schily said , adding that the government 's conduct had been " perfectly correct .

but when it comes to those who ca n't communicate a so-called living will can help . the german parliament will debate the sensitive issue on thursday when parliamentarians consider draft legal guidelines that would apply to living wills .
more than 30 members of parliament have signed up to speak , three times more than usually do during bundestag debates . an estimated 8 million germans have made out a living will , setting out how they wish to be treated by medical staff in case of an accident or terminal illness .
for example , in a living will , a person might specify that her life-support machines should be turned off if they are still necessary four weeks after a bad accident . currently the legal framework around living wills is unclear and open to multiple interpretations .
many have read a 2003 decision by germany 's federal court as ruling that a stipulation to end medical treatment is only binding if the illness or injury will inevitably lead to death .
however , others have read the ruling differently . a draft guideline introduced by wolfgang bosbach of the conservative union bloc of parties would make patient stipulations regarding treatment or resuscitation only valid in the case of irreversible , terminal illness or injury . an alternative draft , presented by social democratic parliamentarian joachim stünker , gives the wishes of the patient highest priority . new guidelines needed ? according to urban wiesing of germany 's federal chamber of physicians , doctors are acting correctly if they follow instructions given in a living will now , even if the patient dies .
" it is the will of the patient that counts , " wiesing said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could pass a law on living wills later this year however , wiesing stressed that doctors are still required to follow german law .
" if a patient asks for medically assisted suicide , a doctor ca n't do that because that 's illegal , " he said . his group , along with the marburger bund doctors ' federation , has come out against putting new legal guidelines in place , saying that patients need only to be better informed about what goes into making a living will . " we are solving a problem here that was only created through politicians ' debate of the issue , " frank ulrich montgomery , head of the marburger bund , told the passauer neue presse newspaper . call for regulation at the moment there is no legal framework setting out how a living will should be made . that means medical staff are bound to consider even a couple of lines that a patient scribbled on a scrap of paper .
but such information can lead to more uncertainty about a person 's wishes , because their instructions are often too nebulous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal chamber of physicians is against regulating living wills " it needs to be more detailed , " said wolfgang kramer from the german hospice foundation .
" in our experience , people write something down , but it ca n't be used in a concrete situation because it 's too unspecific . " the german hospice foundation offers consultations on how to make a living will .
because there are so many topics to cover , the appointments usually last more than 90 minutes , and the result is a seven-page document . " at the beginning there are wishes such as ' i do n't want to suffer ' or ' i do n't want to end up attached to a tube , " ' kramer said .
" but when you explain the different possibilities and the kinds of conditions that come with certain illnesses , then people make completely different decisions . " wiesing from the federal chamber of physicians was hesitant about calling for government regulation of living wills . " currently , the situation is n't that clear - both for patients and doctors , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.03.2007 german parliament debates living wills for the dying großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors face uncertainty over living wills germany 's parliament debates the issue of living wills on thursday , as those involved in caring for the terminally ill demand a legal framework for patients to set out their treatment wishes . it is unconstitutional in germany for a doctor to treat a person against his or her will , even if the patient is at risk of dying .
but when it comes to those who ca n't communicate a so-called living will can help . the german parliament will debate the sensitive issue on thursday when parliamentarians consider draft legal guidelines that would apply to living wills .
more than 30 members of parliament have signed up to speak , three times more than usually do during bundestag debates . an estimated 8 million germans have made out a living will , setting out how they wish to be treated by medical staff in case of an accident or terminal illness .
for example , in a living will , a person might specify that her life-support machines should be turned off if they are still necessary four weeks after a bad accident . currently the legal framework around living wills is unclear and open to multiple interpretations .
many have read a 2003 decision by germany 's federal court as ruling that a stipulation to end medical treatment is only binding if the illness or injury will inevitably lead to death .
however , others have read the ruling differently . a draft guideline introduced by wolfgang bosbach of the conservative union bloc of parties would make patient stipulations regarding treatment or resuscitation only valid in the case of irreversible , terminal illness or injury . an alternative draft , presented by social democratic parliamentarian joachim stünker , gives the wishes of the patient highest priority . new guidelines needed ? according to urban wiesing of germany 's federal chamber of physicians , doctors are acting correctly if they follow instructions given in a living will now , even if the patient dies .
" it is the will of the patient that counts , " wiesing said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could pass a law on living wills later this year however , wiesing stressed that doctors are still required to follow german law .
" if a patient asks for medically assisted suicide , a doctor ca n't do that because that 's illegal , " he said . his group , along with the marburger bund doctors ' federation , has come out against putting new legal guidelines in place , saying that patients need only to be better informed about what goes into making a living will . " we are solving a problem here that was only created through politicians ' debate of the issue , " frank ulrich montgomery , head of the marburger bund , told the passauer neue presse newspaper . call for regulation at the moment there is no legal framework setting out how a living will should be made . that means medical staff are bound to consider even a couple of lines that a patient scribbled on a scrap of paper .
but such information can lead to more uncertainty about a person 's wishes , because their instructions are often too nebulous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal chamber of physicians is against regulating living wills " it needs to be more detailed , " said wolfgang kramer from the german hospice foundation .
" in our experience , people write something down , but it ca n't be used in a concrete situation because it 's too unspecific . " the german hospice foundation offers consultations on how to make a living will .
because there are so many topics to cover , the appointments usually last more than 90 minutes , and the result is a seven-page document . " at the beginning there are wishes such as ' i do n't want to suffer ' or ' i do n't want to end up attached to a tube , " ' kramer said .
" but when you explain the different possibilities and the kinds of conditions that come with certain illnesses , then people make completely different decisions . " wiesing from the federal chamber of physicians was hesitant about calling for government regulation of living wills . " currently , the situation is n't that clear - both for patients and doctors , " he said .
" we should all try to reduce this uncertainty but not at the cost of individual rights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.03.2007 germans fear new far-left union could threaten establishment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left offers a haven for german left wingers who feel underserved a new , far-left german political party , called simply the left , was recently made official .
some say it could seriously damage the country 's ruling center-left social democrats . when delegates from germany 's two biggest far-left parties overwhelmingly backed a formal merger on sunday , it was a penultimate step toward establishing " dielinke " -lrb- the left -rrb- as the country 's fourth-largest political party . observers say the party poses a credible threat to the social democratic party , the traditional home of germany 's left wing .
the spd is currently part of the uneasy " grand coalition " government that rules together with angela merkel 's center-right christian democratic union / christian socialist union bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its official : party delegates vote in favor of a wasg-pds union on sunday , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , a successor to the communist party of east germany , and the labor and social justice party -lrb- wasg -rrb- , a western splinter group led by former spd chairman oskar lafontaine , officially approved the merger .
the new party , dielinke . -lrb- period included -rrb- will be formally called into life at a conference in june . heavy losses at the spd the pds and wasg first campaigned under one banner in the snap national elections in 2005 , where they got a respectable 8.7 percent of the vote .
that result landed them the fourth slot on the national political scene . now , political watchers are warning that the the new party poses an additional threat to the established spd , which has already seen its membership drop by over 40 percent since it gained national power under gerhard schröder , in 1998 .
the new party is now serving as a catch-all for those who feel the spd has moved too far to the center , observers say . the von der leyen problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister von der leyen pleases right and left alike one big problem for the spd : it lost support from its traditional trade-union voter base after it took measures to reform the ailing social-welfare state .
meanwhile , the right , traditionally conservative on social issues , seems to have recently discovered the glories of progressive social policy , particulary around women 's and family issues . " the most popular politician these days is -lrb- cdu -rrb- family minister ursula von der leyen , who advocates all-day schools and a woman 's right to work , " said arnold schölzel , editor-in-chief of the far-left newspaper junge welt .
" meanwhile the spd came up with the idea of pushing back retirement to 67 , essentially shortening retirement .
this has left lafontaine a wide-open field . " part of the spd 's problem is simply that it moved from having the freedom of being an opposition party to actually governing the country , said uwe andersen , a professor emeritus of political science at the university of bochum . " as a party in government , the spd is responsible for policy measures that are not always liked by the public , " andersen said .
" it 's especially interesting that the -lrb- new left -rrb- is pitching this anti-war movement , because even the green party , when they were in government with the spd , sent german troops abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.03.2007 german parliament debates living wills for the dying großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors face uncertainty over living wills germany 's parliament debates the issue of living wills on thursday , as those involved in caring for the terminally ill demand a legal framework for patients to set out their treatment wishes . it is unconstitutional in germany for a doctor to treat a person against his or her will , even if the patient is at risk of dying .
but when it comes to those who ca n't communicate a so-called living will can help . the german parliament will debate the sensitive issue on thursday when parliamentarians consider draft legal guidelines that would apply to living wills .
more than 30 members of parliament have signed up to speak , three times more than usually do during bundestag debates . an estimated 8 million germans have made out a living will , setting out how they wish to be treated by medical staff in case of an accident or terminal illness .
for example , in a living will , a person might specify that her life-support machines should be turned off if they are still necessary four weeks after a bad accident . currently the legal framework around living wills is unclear and open to multiple interpretations .
many have read a 2003 decision by germany 's federal court as ruling that a stipulation to end medical treatment is only binding if the illness or injury will inevitably lead to death .
however , others have read the ruling differently . a draft guideline introduced by wolfgang bosbach of the conservative union bloc of parties would make patient stipulations regarding treatment or resuscitation only valid in the case of irreversible , terminal illness or injury . an alternative draft , presented by social democratic parliamentarian joachim stünker , gives the wishes of the patient highest priority . new guidelines needed ? according to urban wiesing of germany 's federal chamber of physicians , doctors are acting correctly if they follow instructions given in a living will now , even if the patient dies .
" it is the will of the patient that counts , " wiesing said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could pass a law on living wills later this year however , wiesing stressed that doctors are still required to follow german law .

but when it comes to those who ca n't communicate a so-called living will can help . the german parliament will debate the sensitive issue on thursday when parliamentarians consider draft legal guidelines that would apply to living wills .
more than 30 members of parliament have signed up to speak , three times more than usually do during bundestag debates . an estimated 8 million germans have made out a living will , setting out how they wish to be treated by medical staff in case of an accident or terminal illness .
for example , in a living will , a person might specify that her life-support machines should be turned off if they are still necessary four weeks after a bad accident . currently the legal framework around living wills is unclear and open to multiple interpretations .
many have read a 2003 decision by germany 's federal court as ruling that a stipulation to end medical treatment is only binding if the illness or injury will inevitably lead to death .
however , others have read the ruling differently . a draft guideline introduced by wolfgang bosbach of the conservative union bloc of parties would make patient stipulations regarding treatment or resuscitation only valid in the case of irreversible , terminal illness or injury . an alternative draft , presented by social democratic parliamentarian joachim stünker , gives the wishes of the patient highest priority . new guidelines needed ? according to urban wiesing of germany 's federal chamber of physicians , doctors are acting correctly if they follow instructions given in a living will now , even if the patient dies .
" it is the will of the patient that counts , " wiesing said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could pass a law on living wills later this year however , wiesing stressed that doctors are still required to follow german law .
" if a patient asks for medically assisted suicide , a doctor ca n't do that because that 's illegal , " he said . his group , along with the marburger bund doctors ' federation , has come out against putting new legal guidelines in place , saying that patients need only to be better informed about what goes into making a living will .

without a number of established stars , the debutants gave a good account of themselves . germany 's soccer stars were the toast of the nation after their winning in prague at the weekend .
the victory over the czech republic left joachim löw 's men top of their european championship qualifying group and the team is now the favorite to reach the final stages next summer . on wednesday though , it was an almost unrecognizable side that took to the field for the friendly game against denmark . löw fielded a team missing stars like michael ballack , miroslav klose and jens lehmann .
in their place , the german coach brought in young stars robert enke , simon rolfes and roberto hibert . including substitutes , a total of seven players wore the national team colors for the first time ever in the friendly against denmark in duisburg as löw experimented without the pressure of a qualifying match . danes rob löw of undefeated title bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niclas bendtner , right , ended löw 's unbeaten run but the undefeated coach paid the price in the end , with his first reverse in charge of the national side .
danish striker niclas bendtner scored the only goal in the 82nd minute after connecting with a good cross from jesper groenkjar . however , löw was happy with his fledgling stars . " we are always being told to support young players in germany , and that is what we are doing , " he told ard television .
" we talked about it last october and have pretty quickly put it into practice . " it was down to experience , " the coach added .
" there were a lot of young players out there and it was a very important game for their development .
one day they will have to replace frings , ballack or klose .
we took the risk that we might lose the game , but it was great experience for the youngsters . " the most impressive of the debutants does n't even play top-flight soccer .
patrick helmes , from second division cologne , had three great chances to score despite only coming on late in the game . " it was a great feeling and a great honor , " helmes said .
" but on the other hand , i 'm disappointed because we did n't win .
a goal for me would have been the crowning glory but it was n't to be .
i 'll just have to try again against koblenz on sunday . " composed first-half per formance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's youngsters held their own until the 82nd minute it was the first international game to be played in duisburg since 1933 , and although the fans were a little disappointed at not seeing their heroes from the world cup , the new , young team did inspire the crowd in the first half with some neat passing movements . however the tempo dropped a little after the restart as both teams took the game 's " friendly " label rather too literally as neither side looked intent on challenging or fighting for the ball in a very gentlemanly opening . denmark , fielding their strongest side , had the better of the chances in the second half but , despite some signs of dissatisfaction from the supporters , a very young and inexperienced germany side certainly held their own on the international stage . even in defeat , it was a promising sign for the future . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de löw to blood german youngsters much to denmark 's chagrin germany 's coach joachim löw will ring the changes for wednesday night 's friendly against denmark by announcing an inexperienced 16-man squad aimed at blooding some of his rising stars .

provincial judge juan ramirez issued an injunction blocking the 7 march move by an electoral tribunal which unseated more than half the country 's lawmakers .
but the tribunal has now fired him , saying he acted illegally .
the sacked lawmakers oppose a referendum on constitutional change backed by president rafael correa .
mr correa has been embroiled in a bitter conflict with the opposition congress since he took power in january .
he has argued that congress is corrupt and the cause of many of the country 's problems .
the referendum , set for 15 april , will ask ecuadoreans if they want a national assembly to look at constitutional reform .
mr correa 's opponents fear he will use the assembly to try and weaken the power of the legislature .
the lawmakers have already failed in one attempt to seek an injunction from another provincial judge .
jorge acosta , head of ecuador 's electoral tribunal , told the bbc that removing judge ramirez was justified .
" anyone who tries to interfere in any way in the electoral process or any of the electoral tribunal 's decisions is opening themselves up to being removed from office and deprived of their political privileges in accordance with the country 's electoral laws , " he said .

oliver jufer , 57 , was arrested last december after drunkenly spray-painting posters of king bhumibol adulyadej in the northern city of chiang mai .
earlier this month he pleaded guilty to five charges under thailand 's draconian lese majeste law .
judge phitsanu tanbukalee said that jufer received a reduced sentence because he had admitted his guilt .
" this is a serious crime , and he was sentenced to four years for each of five counts , for a total of 20 years , " he said .

king bhumibol , the world 's longest-serving current head of state , is a very popular figure in thailand .
the case has highlighted strict laws in thailand which forbid any criticism of the monarchy .
such is the sensitivity of the issue , says the bbc 's jonathan head in bangkok , that it is receiving little attention in the thai media .
most thais feel a deep reverence for their monarch .
but they also fear discussing the institution because of the severe penalties for criticising members of the royal family .

king bhumibol , the world 's longest-serving current head of state , is a very popular figure in thailand .
the case has highlighted strict laws in thailand which forbid any criticism of the monarchy .
such is the sensitivity of the issue , says the bbc 's jonathan head in bangkok , that it is receiving little attention in the thai media .
most thais feel a deep reverence for their monarch .
but they also fear discussing the institution because of the severe penalties for criticising members of the royal family .
jufer has a month to lodge an appeal against the sentence , our correspondent adds , but his best hope now is probably a royal pardon .

jordan mintz , ex-general counsel for enron 's global finance group and rex rogers , former associate general counsel are the two men charged .
the sec says they helped misrepresent deals in enron 's accounting .
lawyers for the men deny the charges .
the case comes more than five years after enron collapsed .
brazilian scheme the sec said the men were involved in a scheme to hide the true value of accounts , including one of enron 's off-the-books partnerships in brazil .
former enron finance executive andrew fastow , who is now in prison , has been accused of organising one of his partnerships to pay $ 11.3m for enron 's share in cuiaba , the name of the brazilian scheme .
but the transaction was deemed a sham because the project was not independent of enron .
the financial watchdog also said mr rogers played a part in enabling kenneth lay - the firm 's founder and chairman - to hide millions of sales of shares in the firm between 2000 and 2001 .
mr lay was convicted last year on 10 counts of criminal fraud and conspiracy as well as lying to banks .
he died soon after .
the sec is demanding fines from mr rogers and mr mintz and also wants to bar them from acting as directors of any public firm .
a lawyer for mr rogers defended his client saying he was : " a person of great integrity and the highest moral character .
" we look forward to vigorously defending against these baseless allegations , " he added .

residents and fans have complained to the club about the length of time it takes to get away from the new emirates stadium in north london .
the committee was set up as part of the club 's move to its new 60,000 seat home in ashburton grove last summer .
invited to the meeting are resident and business groups , islington council , police , and transport officials .
' too expensive ' some supporters have complained it can take up to an hour to get away after matches .
islington council , which granted planning approval for the stadium , previously said transport links were not adequate .
the main tube stops for the stadium , arsenal , finsbury park and highbury & islington , are considered to have insufficient capacity .
the council and fans said a decision not to invest in upgrading holloway road and drayton park , a local railway station , had been a mistake .
plans to upgrade holloway road , which has a limited service on match-days , were scrapped after studies found the cost of enlargement was too expensive .
drayton park , the closest station to the stadium , is closed on weekends when most arsenal home matches take place - because of insufficient demand according to the train operator .

the committee was set up as part of the club 's move to its new 60,000 seat home in ashburton grove last summer .
invited to the meeting are resident and business groups , islington council , police , and transport officials .
' too expensive ' some supporters have complained it can take up to an hour to get away after matches .
islington council , which granted planning approval for the stadium , previously said transport links were not adequate .
the main tube stops for the stadium , arsenal , finsbury park and highbury & islington , are considered to have insufficient capacity .
the council and fans said a decision not to invest in upgrading holloway road and drayton park , a local railway station , had been a mistake .
plans to upgrade holloway road , which has a limited service on match-days , were scrapped after studies found the cost of enlargement was too expensive .
drayton park , the closest station to the stadium , is closed on weekends when most arsenal home matches take place - because of insufficient demand according to the train operator .
arsenal said it would turn its attention to transport after tackling stadium management issues .

in the second of his series , bbc world affairs correspondent mark doyle analyses the state of food production across the globe .
on his farm just outside the punjabi city of ludhiana in northern india , jagjit singh hara showed off his collection of old photos .
one of the farmer 's most prized snaps is of him with the norwegian-american agronomist norman borlaug , the man popularly known as the father of the green revolution .
" here we are when we were both young men , " says mr singh hara with smile .
" i said to him : ' dr borlaug , i want to put my hand in your pocket .
but i do n't want to take out the dollars , i want to take out the wheat seeds you have . " '
punjab state , the breadbasket of india , is one of the places where the green revolution began .
it more than doubled aggregate production here of wheat and rice .
india , a country that will probably soon overtake china as the most populous nation in the world , went from being a food-aid " basket case " to being largely self-sufficient in food .
the benefits - and costs - of the green revolution in india are reflected in other parts of the developing world .
in punjab , i was looking for clues about whether output could be boosted further to cope with the rising demand that will be required to feed a world population set to rise from 6.6 billion today to more than nine billion people by 2050 .
food output across the world increased considerably in the last four decades of the 20th century , largely as a result of the intensive farming techniques introduced by the green revolution .
the new techniques involved distributing hybrid grain seeds - mainly wheat , rice and corn .
the hybrids grow with a shorter stalk .
this maximises the process of photosynthesis , which nourishes the grain because less energy goes into the stem .
the hybrid seeds were combined with the intensive use of fertilisers and irrigation .
population v production after successfully being introduced in india , the green revolution was rolled out in other parts of asia , latin america and the middle east .
it was so successful in terms of production increases that it defied the gloomy malthusian predictions of the 1960s , which said hundreds of millions would starve as population outstripped farm output .
the revolution was a technological success .
" before the 1960s , the population of india was multiplying like rats in a barn , " said jagjit singh hara , " but we did n't have the grain to feed them .
after the green revolution , we doubled our yield and now we have proved that india can feed the world " .
but the process has limits and they may have been reached .
population , on the other hand , has continued to rise in poor parts of the world .
the graph , compiled for the bbc by the un food and agriculture organization , shows that while yield per hectare has increased , the amount of land used for the major staple grains has remained fairly constant ; this is because the amount of good farmland is finite .
given the shortage of land suitable for growing more food , the obvious answer would be a new green revolution , or another hike in yields .
but this may not be possible .
" the difficulty is that we are now pressing against the photosynthetic limits of plants , " says the influential environmentalist lester brown of the earth policy institute in the united states .
brown draws an analogy with human performance on the running track ; " in the first modern olympics in 1896 , we were running the mile in under five minutes .
by 1954 , roger bannister had broken the four-minute mile .
but now , more than half a century later , no-one is talking about a three minute mile . "
" plants are not that different from people in this sense " , says brown " you can get gains up to a point and then it becomes much more difficult - i do n't know of any scientists who are predicting potential advances in grain yields that are comparable with those we saw in the last half century " .
there are other limits to the green revolution .
some of the poorer villagers i spoke to in rural punjab said they had fallen into debt as they were unable to keep up with the rising cost of the inputs - fertilisers , irrigation pumps and regular fresh supplies of seed - which intensive agriculture requires .
one elderly man in the village of lehragaga , jasram singh , sat on an old iron bedstead in his yard and recounted the unbearable pain he had suffered when two of his sons had committed suicide .
they had fallen into debt , been forced to sell their land , and felt irreconcilable shame .
a local community activist , jagdish papra , said the case was typical of many families who had seen loved ones kill themselves because they could not keep up with the financial cost of inputs .
" in the old days we practiced subsistence agriculture and we felt a sense of control , " said papra .
" now everything is more complicated and lots of people are desperately in debt . "
human cost amrita chaudhry , an agriculture correspondent with the indian express newspaper , stood in a neat , almost manicured field of young green wheat ; " the balance sheet of the green revolution is that , yes , we are feeding the mouths .
india no longer has to ask for food aid from other nations .
but the fact is we are paying a very heavy price for agriculture at this present moment . "
" punjab is one of the biggest user of pesticides in india , " mr chaudhry continued , " and they have leached into our subsoil water . "
" there are health costs .
we have had babies born blue because they are not breathing .
some of them have mental health problems .
in the south-western belt , we have entire villages where each family has at least one or two cancer cases .
all this is all because of this intensive agriculture that we have been doing . "
in the final part of the series , i will be looking at how changing patterns of food consumption mean there are now more overweight people than hungry in the world .

the lush paddy fields of india in the second of his series , bbc world affairs correspondent mark doyle analyses the state of food production across the globe .
on his farm just outside the punjabi city of ludhiana in northern india , jagjit singh hara showed off his collection of old photos .
one of the farmer 's most prized snaps is of him with the norwegian-american agronomist norman borlaug , the man popularly known as the father of the green revolution .
" here we are when we were both young men , " says mr singh hara with smile .
" i said to him : ' dr borlaug , i want to put my hand in your pocket .
but i do n't want to take out the dollars , i want to take out the wheat seeds you have . " '
punjab state , the breadbasket of india , is one of the places where the green revolution began .
it more than doubled aggregate production here of wheat and rice .
india , a country that will probably soon overtake china as the most populous nation in the world , went from being a food-aid " basket case " to being largely self-sufficient in food .
jagjit singh hara says india can feed the world the benefits - and costs - of the green revolution in india are reflected in other parts of the developing world .
in punjab , i was looking for clues about whether output could be boosted further to cope with the rising demand that will be required to feed a world population set to rise from 6.6 billion today to more than nine billion people by 2050 .
food output across the world increased considerably in the last four decades of the 20th century , largely as a result of the intensive farming techniques introduced by the green revolution .
the new techniques involved distributing hybrid grain seeds - mainly wheat , rice and corn .
the hybrids grow with a shorter stalk .
this maximises the process of photosynthesis , which nourishes the grain because less energy goes into the stem .
the hybrid seeds were combined with the intensive use of fertilisers and irrigation .
population v production after successfully being introduced in india , the green revolution was rolled out in other parts of asia , latin america and the middle east .
it was so successful in terms of production increases that it defied the gloomy malthusian predictions of the 1960s , which said hundreds of millions would starve as population outstripped farm output .
the revolution was a technological success .
" before the 1960s , the population of india was multiplying like rats in a barn , " said jagjit singh hara , " but we did n't have the grain to feed them .
after the green revolution , we doubled our yield and now we have proved that india can feed the world " .
but the process has limits and they may have been reached .
population , on the other hand , has continued to rise in poor parts of the world .
the graph , compiled for the bbc by the un food and agriculture organization , shows that while yield per hectare has increased , the amount of land used for the major staple grains has remained fairly constant ; this is because the amount of good farmland is finite .
given the shortage of land suitable for growing more food , the obvious answer would be a new green revolution , or another hike in yields .
but this may not be possible .
" the difficulty is that we are now pressing against the photosynthetic limits of plants , " says the influential environmentalist lester brown of the earth policy institute in the united states .
brown draws an analogy with human performance on the running track ; " in the first modern olympics in 1896 , we were running the mile in under five minutes .
by 1954 , roger bannister had broken the four-minute mile .
but now , more than half a century later , no-one is talking about a three minute mile . "
lester brown : we are reaching the limits of what plants can do " plants are not that different from people in this sense " , says brown " you can get gains up to a point and then it becomes much more difficult - i do n't know of any scientists who are predicting potential advances in grain yields that are comparable with those we saw in the last half century " .
there are other limits to the green revolution .
some of the poorer villagers i spoke to in rural punjab said they had fallen into debt as they were unable to keep up with the rising cost of the inputs - fertilisers , irrigation pumps and regular fresh supplies of seed - which intensive agriculture requires .
one elderly man in the village of lehragaga , jasram singh , sat on an old iron bedstead in his yard and recounted the unbearable pain he had suffered when two of his sons had committed suicide .
they had fallen into debt , been forced to sell their land , and felt irreconcilable shame .
a local community activist , jagdish papra , said the case was typical of many families who had seen loved ones kill themselves because they could not keep up with the financial cost of inputs .
" in the old days we practiced subsistence agriculture and we felt a sense of control , " said papra .
" now everything is more complicated and lots of people are desperately in debt . "
human cost amrita chaudhry , an agriculture correspondent with the indian express newspaper , stood in a neat , almost manicured field of young green wheat ; " the balance sheet of the green revolution is that , yes , we are feeding the mouths .
india no longer has to ask for food aid from other nations .
but the fact is we are paying a very heavy price for agriculture at this present moment . "
" punjab is one of the biggest user of pesticides in india , " mr chaudhry continued , " and they have leached into our subsoil water . "
" there are health costs .
we have had babies born blue because they are not breathing .
some of them have mental health problems .
in the south-western belt , we have entire villages where each family has at least one or two cancer cases .
all this is all because of this intensive agriculture that we have been doing . "
in the final part of the series , i will be looking at how changing patterns of food consumption mean there are now more overweight people than hungry in the world .

two hundred years after the british parliament voted to abolish the trade , the effects on africa are still being felt .
head to a village in northern ghana or indeed many villages in west africa and at times you might wonder what century you are in .
even though ghana has achieved impressive growth rates in recent years , the scene in many rural areas appears to have changed little with grass thatched mud walled huts .
there is often no electricity and yes , the water is collected in plastic containers these days but it is still quite an effort to fetch it .
' a very long effect ' the ghanaian historian and lawyer , mohamed shaibu abdulai , says africa 's loss of millions of the strongest men and women during the slave trade is one reason for this underdevelopment .
" the slave trade actually prevented the coming into being of an agrarian revolution in ghana , and likewise an industrial revolution .
because before you can industrialise you need to have stable agricultural production .
so slavery has a very long effect . "
some estimate that without slavery the population of africa would have been double the 25m it had reached by 1850 .
" during slavery many of the able-bodied people , between 18 and 40 , were taken out so society 's ability to reproduce itself economically , socially and culturally was impaired , " says zagba oyortey a ghanaian cultural historian .
gold or slaves ?
another legacy of the trans-atlantic slave trade was the fuelling of conflicts and long lasting rifts between communities which in some cases remain .
interactive map follow dynamic trails across africa , the caribbean and the uk with text , images and audio to explore the abolition of british slavery interactive map the european demand for slaves provided a lucrative business for the african slave raiders in the interior .
many of the slaves were prisoners of war , and enslaving an enemy soon became a motive for going to war .
" european traders found it hard to get slaves during times of peace .
however , when there was war , gold was scarce and slaves were widely available , " says doctor akosua adoma perbi , the head of the history department at ghana 's legon university .
" one traveller wrote in his memoirs that in 1681 he had got only eight slaves after combing the whole of ghana 's coast from west to east .
but when he asked why that was , he was told the people were at peace .
so warfare was a major source of slaves .
period of great demand a trader named bosman wrote , " wars make gold scarce but negroes plenty , " says doctor perbi .
doctor perbi has written a book on the history of indigenous slavery in ghana which , she says , was affected by the trans-atlantic slave trade .
" the greater demand for slaves for the external market resulted in an increased tapping of the indigenous sources of slave supply .
this period of great demand for slaves also coincided with the introduction of guns and gunpowder into ghana .
incessant wars of conquest , expansion , aggression and retaliation became a feature of the ghanaian experience , " she writes .
the slave ships continued to ply the african coastline many years after the 1807 abolition bill was passed in britain 's parliament .
but after the slave ships left , it was not long before the africa was divided up and colonised by european countries .
' a bit suppressed ' " the devastation left by the slave trade , and the absence of able-bodied people , made it easy for european powers to move in and colonise .
africa 's ability to defend itself was seriously compromised , " says zagba oyortey a ghanaian cultural historian .
there has also been an impact on african culture .
to mark the 200th anniversary of the abolition of slavery , the south african musician hugh masekela , recently performed inside elmina slave fort alongside musicians from britain , the caribbean and across africa .
he says there is a need for african culture to be revived seeing as it was looked down upon and discouraged for so long .
" africa is the only society which imitates other cultures .
in other parts of the world culture is put at the forefront every day .
but we only do it at ceremonies , " masekela says .
many young ghanaians do not study their own history in any great depth as the subject is optional at secondary schools .
" the history of slavery should be taught in order for people to understand the effect it has had and continues to have , " says elizabeth ama asare who has taught history at accra 's labone secondary school for many years .
" even today black people feel a bit suppressed when we come into contact with the whites and that is an effect of slave trade .
it has put us in a second class position which should n't be so . "

even though ghana has achieved impressive growth rates in recent years , the scene in many rural areas appears to have changed little with grass thatched mud walled huts .
there is often no electricity and yes , the water is collected in plastic containers these days but it is still quite an effort to fetch it .
' a very long effect ' the ghanaian historian and lawyer , mohamed shaibu abdulai , says africa 's loss of millions of the strongest men and women during the slave trade is one reason for this underdevelopment .
" the slave trade actually prevented the coming into being of an agrarian revolution in ghana , and likewise an industrial revolution .
because before you can industrialise you need to have stable agricultural production .
so slavery has a very long effect . "
some estimate that without slavery the population of africa would have been double the 25m it had reached by 1850 .
" during slavery many of the able-bodied people , between 18 and 40 , were taken out so society 's ability to reproduce itself economically , socially and culturally was impaired , " says zagba oyortey a ghanaian cultural historian .
gold or slaves ?
another legacy of the trans-atlantic slave trade was the fuelling of conflicts and long lasting rifts between communities which in some cases remain .

many of the slaves were prisoners of war , and enslaving an enemy soon became a motive for going to war .
" european traders found it hard to get slaves during times of peace .
however , when there was war , gold was scarce and slaves were widely available , " says doctor akosua adoma perbi , the head of the history department at ghana 's legon university .
" one traveller wrote in his memoirs that in 1681 he had got only eight slaves after combing the whole of ghana 's coast from west to east .
but when he asked why that was , he was told the people were at peace .
so warfare was a major source of slaves .
period of great demand a trader named bosman wrote , " wars make gold scarce but negroes plenty , " says doctor perbi .
doctor perbi has written a book on the history of indigenous slavery in ghana which , she says , was affected by the trans-atlantic slave trade .
" the greater demand for slaves for the external market resulted in an increased tapping of the indigenous sources of slave supply .
this period of great demand for slaves also coincided with the introduction of guns and gunpowder into ghana .
incessant wars of conquest , expansion , aggression and retaliation became a feature of the ghanaian experience , " she writes .
the slave ships continued to ply the african coastline many years after the 1807 abolition bill was passed in britain 's parliament .
but after the slave ships left , it was not long before the africa was divided up and colonised by european countries .
' a bit suppressed ' " the devastation left by the slave trade , and the absence of able-bodied people , made it easy for european powers to move in and colonise .
africa 's ability to defend itself was seriously compromised , " says zagba oyortey a ghanaian cultural historian .
there has also been an impact on african culture .
to mark the 200th anniversary of the abolition of slavery , the south african musician hugh masekela , recently performed inside elmina slave fort alongside musicians from britain , the caribbean and across africa .
he says there is a need for african culture to be revived seeing as it was looked down upon and discouraged for so long .
" africa is the only society which imitates other cultures .
in other parts of the world culture is put at the forefront every day .
but we only do it at ceremonies , " masekela says .
many young ghanaians do not study their own history in any great depth as the subject is optional at secondary schools .
" the history of slavery should be taught in order for people to understand the effect it has had and continues to have , " says elizabeth ama asare who has taught history at accra 's labone secondary school for many years .
" even today black people feel a bit suppressed when we come into contact with the whites and that is an effect of slave trade .
it has put us in a second class position which should n't be so . "

ministers say using more wood for energy could provide new rural jobs and help britain meet its climate targets .
the new strategy , developed by the forestry commission , aims to source an extra two million tonnes of wood a year by 2020 for burning in boilers .
environment minister barry gardiner says if this is taken from properly managed woodlands it should save 400,000 tonnes of carbon annually .
" it also has huge benefits in terms of biodiversity and improvement of habitats for all the species we want to preserve within the countryside , " he told the bbc .
burning wood is considered broadly carbon neutral because the co2 released in combustion matches that absorbed by the trees as they grew - provided the woodland it is taken from is restocked , and that harvesting and processing does not itself use too much fossil fuel .
biomass , such as woodfuel , currently supplies 3 % of total uk energy .
' waste ' resource the forestry commission strategy recommends provision of capital investment and technical advice and support for the supply chain , and highlights the need for new ways of engaging with the estimated 50-80,000 owners of woodland in england .
" over half of england 's woodlands are currently under-managed .
this is a significant and sustainable resource that we want to tap into , " said fc chairman lord clark of windermere .
" using wood to substitute for fossil fuels means that well managed woodland can help to combat climate change . "
if its targets are met , the commission claims the amount of carbon saved annually would be equivalent to taking 550,000 cars off the road .
the plan was launched in bristol , at the blaise plant nursery .
its boiler uses clean recovered wood from the city 's parks to heat greenhouses , saving £ 19,000 a year on fuel bills .
" we 've got resources of wood - trimmings from parks and from trees in streets , " paul isbell , energy manager for bristol city council , told bbc news .
" in the past we 've treated this as waste , but now we 're using it to heat a nursery .
before , we were using oil or bottled gas , which was not only expensive but also added a lot of carbon to the atmosphere . "

dsg international said police were investigating the malpractice at a paris warehouse owned by internet firm fotovista and arrests had been made .
dsg gave no details of the financial cost of the incident but analysts said the impact could be in the region of £ 8m to £ 10m -lrb- 14.7m euros ; $ 19.6m -rrb- .
fotovista , bought by dsg last year , is a small part of its overall business .
dsg , formerly known as dixons , made a £ 303m profit last year .
' isolated incident ' dsg said it had discovered the fraud through its internal security and financial control procedures .
it said losses from the incident could wipe out profits from its new business division this year , which analysts are forecasting could be up to £ 10m .
" management has reacted promptly to this isolated incident and is confident that the immediate issues have been resolved , " the firm said .
fotovista was established in the 1950s as a photo processing business but has recently diversified into selling a range of consumer electronics and entertainment products , mainly over the internet .
separately , dsg has agreed to sell two businesses owned by fotovista to a private equity firm for £ 15.2m.
