was lafontaine effectively saying goodbye to fidel castro ? wolfgang gehrcke : first and foremost , lafontaine is keen to see how the country is evolving , to explore its potential for further development and the current state of the european-cuban relationship .
germany 's position on the eu 's restrictive policy towards cuba is not a constructive one .

oskar lafontaine is visiting a number of initiatives providing humanitarian aid in the country , such as supplying children with milk everyday .
the visit to cuba is oskar lafontaine 's first port of call on his tour of latin america 's new , left-wing governments .
as far as i am aware , fidel castro is in good health and there is no reason to say goodbye to him . as the left party 's foreign policy spokesman , what do you think of the german government 's stance on latin america ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : change has swept venezuela berlin 's policies towards latin america are based on positions that range from indifference to outright hostility towards south america 's recent shift to the left .
the government is of the opinion that germany has few interests in latin america outside of sao paulo , brazil 's economic center , and mexico .
it 's happy to leave the continent to the us .
broadly speaking , the government shares washington 's political aims there , which define neo-liberalism as the only viable option for economic development .
but neo-liberalism has failed in latin america , leaving a trail of destruction within the continent 's social structures .
this form of dogma has made only the very few wealthy while the majority of the population as well as parts of the middle classes have become poorer .

regardless of whether they continue to promote socialist values or are more interested in pushing for greater national independence and sovereignty , what they have in common is a political interest in social change on behalf of marginalized , disadvantaged groups .
as in venezuela , the goal of the various campaigns initiated by the government is to improve life for the country 's poor , create jobs and improve education and health .

a german woman has realized there 's a lot to be said for the hair of the dog .
she 's started a business making clothes for customers from the fur of their pet dogs . bearded collies are not the perfect pets for fastidious housekeepers .
throughout the year , they tend to shed their hair on carpets , beds and sofas .
it 's enough to make their owners sick as a dog .
but 50-year-old bettina menkhoff , a primary school teacher who lives in stoetze in the lüneberger heide with four such four-footed friends , decided that all that lovely fur should n't go to waste .
three years ago , she taught herself how to turn it into yarn , and has been making scarves , gloves and other clothes ever since .
her internet business now attracts customers from across the country , all putting a stylish new spin on the proverbial hair shirt .
" it only works when the hair is longer than four centimetres , " she explained .
" i regularly brush my dogs and keep the hair for processing .
it 's warmer than sheep wool . "
as fabric , pet hair appears to be a lot more emotionally charged than anything lagerfeld or lacroix ever work with .
these days , menkhoff can barely keep up with demand .
fortunately , she 's found a new supplier - a local dog salon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one day , he 'll be a scarf " some clients specifically want me to use hair from other animals too , " said menkhoff .
" they dread the day their pet dies and all they 're left with is a scarf hanging in the closet . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 30.08.2007 merkel proposes new blueprint to fight global warming großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , here on a recent visit to greenland , is serious about combating global warming german chancellor merkel 's proposed new plan to curb climate change foresees linking caps on co2 emissions to the population of a country .
it could be of particular interest to large emerging nations china and india . in a speech during her first visit to japan as german chancellor , angela merkel said thursday both developing and industrialized nations need to agree on specific targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions .
" we have to assume that emerging nations naturally do n't want the same responsibility " as industrialized nations , the chancellor said , speaking at a symposium organized by japan 's nikkei media group in tokyo .
a more palatable pact for emerging nations developing countries such as india and china , experiencing skyrocketing growth rates , are worried that strict environmental regulations will dent their economic boom .
they want industrialized nations , the chief polluters , to bear the brunt of emission cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's rapid economic boom is taking a heavy toll on its environment merkel suggested that as a compromise , developing countries should be allowed to increase their emissions per capita while industrialized nations cut theirs , until both sides reach the same level .
the model is said to be based on a proposal by indian prime minister manmohan singh at the g-8 summit in june in germany .
that conference , hosted by merkel , set a non-binding goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 within the eu .
merkel also underlined the need to forge a successor climate pact to the kyoto protocol which expires at the end of 2012 and which she helped draw up as germany 's environment minister in 1997 .
she however voiced caution about the carbon market , part of the kyoto protocol that allows countries that emit gas beyond their allowance to buy credits from companies or countries below their target levels .
the system also exists for companies in the european union .
" it is a wise , market-oriented measure but we need to be careful as it can go in the wrong direction , " merkel said .
" for example , if a coal factory merely moves from europe to a foreign country because it can sell the carbon credit , that 's meaningless , " she said .
merkel wants us on board merkel said detailed targets needed to be set soon if the world wants to slow global warming .
" the question is , how do we distribute -lrb- reduction targets -rrb- in the world ?
i do n't believe that it 's enough to just agree that everyone will do their best .
i do n't believe that would yield an impressive result , " she said .
time is running out in the fight against global warming , she said , adding that the united states must be part of any global deal to slash carbon dioxide emissions .
" i think america will cooperate - america must cooperate .
if we ca n't find a regulatory regime that is accepted by the usa , then china and india will never agree to reduction targets , " merkel said .
the fight against climate change is the overarching theme of merkel 's visit to japan .
japan is to host the next g8 summit in hokkaido in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look no ties !
merkel with abe honoring japan 's " cool biz " campaign on wednesday , merkel and japanese prime minister shinzo abe went into talks to map out ways to work with major polluters to achieve goals for greenhouse gas reductions by pointing out that no one in their delegations was wearing a tie , in honor of japan 's " cool biz " campaign to dress lighter in summer and reduce air conditioning use .
japanese opposition skeptical of afghanistan mission separately , merkel ruffled feathers among japan 's opposition on thursday by urging the country to maintain its support for the " war on terror " in afghanistan .
" you do n't have to follow the unilateral opinion of the united states , " main opposition leader ichiro ozawa told merkel in a meeting , as quoted by tsuyoshi yamaguchi , the opposition 's shadow foreign minister .
germany is heavily involved in afghanistan , where it has contributed some 3,000 troops to the nato-led international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and has six tornado reconnaissance planes helping to spot taliban hideouts . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german embassy has " already received several enquiries about the location of so-called no-go areas for foreign visitors to germany , " kauder told german daily rheinischen post .
kauder , who is parliamentary leader of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , admitted that all indians who had anything to do either economically or politically with germany had taken note of the incident in eastern germany .
" even the reactions in germany -lrb- to the incident -rrb- are being carefully followed -lrb- in india -rrb- , " kauder said .
the politician pointed out that indians , however , are making an effort not to play up the incident .
" the indians recognize that these events in mügeln are not the rule in germany , " he said , adding that chancellor merkel 's condemnation of the attacks had done much to calm the situation .
a hate crime ?
the incident took place ten days ago during a village festival in the eastern german state of saxony .
a german mob of over 50 people chased and attacked a group of eight indians who took refuge in a pizzeria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer patrols the area near the pizzeria owned by a pakistani the frenzied mob broke down the door and assaulted the indians .
police forces eventually arrived on the scene , but it took a while for the large squad of 70 police officers to force back the crowd .
the attack left 14 people wounded , including four of the attackers , two police officers and the eight indians , some of whom were beaten so badly they needed medical attention .
according to saxony 's state prosecutor , 82 witnesses have so far been interviewed in connection with the attack .
the police confirmed on tuesday that they are investigating seven suspects . state police chief , bernd merbitz , told the associated press that the actions had not been committed by a particular extreme-right group .
nonetheless , he said , the chanting of slogans such as " foreigners out ! " and " germany for germans " constituted a xenophobic criminal offence .
heated debate in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quiet town of mügeln was turned into a riot-zone the incident has triggered outrage in germany after photos of the bruised and wounded indians were splashed on the front pages of all major media in the country .
the attack has also prompted a heated debate about the need to counter racism and xenophobia , which statistics show is more widespread in former communist east germany .
it has also led to renewed calls by some politicians to ban the far-right , anti-immigrant npd party which is represented in two state parliaments in eastern germany . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it could be of particular interest to large emerging nations china and india . in a speech during her first visit to japan as german chancellor , angela merkel said thursday both developing and industrialized nations need to agree on specific targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions .
" we have to assume that emerging nations naturally do n't want the same responsibility " as industrialized nations , the chancellor said , speaking at a symposium organized by japan 's nikkei media group in tokyo .
a more palatable pact for emerging nations developing countries such as india and china , experiencing skyrocketing growth rates , are worried that strict environmental regulations will dent their economic boom .
they want industrialized nations , the chief polluters , to bear the brunt of emission cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's rapid economic boom is taking a heavy toll on its environment merkel suggested that as a compromise , developing countries should be allowed to increase their emissions per capita while industrialized nations cut theirs , until both sides reach the same level .
the model is said to be based on a proposal by indian prime minister manmohan singh at the g-8 summit in june in germany .
that conference , hosted by merkel , set a non-binding goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 within the eu .
merkel also underlined the need to forge a successor climate pact to the kyoto protocol which expires at the end of 2012 and which she helped draw up as germany 's environment minister in 1997 .
she however voiced caution about the carbon market , part of the kyoto protocol that allows countries that emit gas beyond their allowance to buy credits from companies or countries below their target levels .
the system also exists for companies in the european union .
" it is a wise , market-oriented measure but we need to be careful as it can go in the wrong direction , " merkel said .
" for example , if a coal factory merely moves from europe to a foreign country because it can sell the carbon credit , that 's meaningless , " she said .
merkel wants us on board merkel said detailed targets needed to be set soon if the world wants to slow global warming .
" the question is , how do we distribute -lrb- reduction targets -rrb- in the world ?
i do n't believe that it 's enough to just agree that everyone will do their best .
i do n't believe that would yield an impressive result , " she said .
time is running out in the fight against global warming , she said , adding that the united states must be part of any global deal to slash carbon dioxide emissions .
" i think america will cooperate - america must cooperate .
if we ca n't find a regulatory regime that is accepted by the usa , then china and india will never agree to reduction targets , " merkel said .
the fight against climate change is the overarching theme of merkel 's visit to japan .
japan is to host the next g8 summit in hokkaido in 2008 .

japanese opposition skeptical of afghanistan mission separately , merkel ruffled feathers among japan 's opposition on thursday by urging the country to maintain its support for the " war on terror " in afghanistan .

" in the overall interest of the community , " there are grounds to leave the possibility of continuing these anti-dumping measures for up to another year , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger told journalists .
" we have to balance environmental interests with the interest of fair trade , " he added .
" this is a rapid-changing market reality and so some transitional measures were warranted . "
unfair competition the commission introduced the anti-dumping tariffs of up to 66 percent in 2001 after an investigation concluded that competition between eu and chinese manufacturers was unfair .
the duties on the power-saving light bulbs made in china raise prices for european customers by up to two-thirds .
for now , less than 20 percent of power-saving bulbs are made in europe , while over two-thirds are imported from china .
but at the end of july , a majority of the experts gave backing to a proposal from mandelson to let the duties lapse .
afp news service reported that according to mandelson 's spokesman , only one out of four european producers had been keen to retain the trade charges .
german lighting company osram , a subsidiary of siemens , had led calls to renew the duties because they hit dutch rival philips harder than osram , though both companies produce in china .
impeding green progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eco-friendly bulbs will soon be mandatory this week 's decision , which contravenes the eu 's intention to reduce its growing energy bill , has triggered outrage among environmentalists , who feel the brussels ' contradiction is deeply hypocritical .
earlier this year , eu leaders proposed that traditional , but inefficient , incandescent bulbs be phased out across the bloc by 2009 , as one of a series of measures aimed at reducing carbon emissions .
environmentalists argue that the continued duties will restrict european consumers ' access to cheaper , low-energy technology .
" -lrb- this proposal -rrb- is disappointing , unfair and seriously inconsistent with the ambitious eu targets to improve energy efficiency in europe and to curb climate change , " the conservation organization wwf said in a press release , quoted by afp .
" on the one hand , europe has committed to an ambitious energy efficiency objective , and on the other hand it continues to impose taxes on imports of green products , " the group 's trade and investment specialist eivind hoff said .

" the commission needs to put the environment before the narrow self-interests of a minority of member countries and scrap import duties on chinese bulbs , " the head of the british retail consortium , kevin hawkins , told the independent newspaper .
according to afp , the conservative british eu lawmaker syed kamall described the decision as " farcical and indefensible . "
" the light bulb industry wants the duties scrapped , consumers want them scrapped and common sense says they should be scrapped ; yet the european commission has once again bowed to protectionist pressures , " he said .

earlier this year , eu leaders proposed that traditional , but inefficient , incandescent bulbs be phased out across the bloc by 2009 , as one of a series of measures aimed at reducing carbon emissions .
environmentalists argue that the continued duties will restrict european consumers ' access to cheaper , low-energy technology .
" -lrb- this proposal -rrb- is disappointing , unfair and seriously inconsistent with the ambitious eu targets to improve energy efficiency in europe and to curb climate change , " the conservation organization wwf said in a press release , quoted by afp .
" on the one hand , europe has committed to an ambitious energy efficiency objective , and on the other hand it continues to impose taxes on imports of green products , " the group 's trade and investment specialist eivind hoff said .
retailer resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osram wanted the charges to stay in place further resistance is expected to come from retailers , who may well see it as a means of protecting major eu producers .
" the commission needs to put the environment before the narrow self-interests of a minority of member countries and scrap import duties on chinese bulbs , " the head of the british retail consortium , kevin hawkins , told the independent newspaper .
according to afp , the conservative british eu lawmaker syed kamall described the decision as " farcical and indefensible . "
" the light bulb industry wants the duties scrapped , consumers want them scrapped and common sense says they should be scrapped ; yet the european commission has once again bowed to protectionist pressures , " he said .
the decision still has to be approved by anti-dumping experts from the european union 's member states . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german embassy has " already received several enquiries about the location of so-called no-go areas for foreign visitors to germany , " kauder told german daily rheinischen post .
kauder , who is parliamentary leader of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , admitted that all indians who had anything to do either economically or politically with germany had taken note of the incident in eastern germany .
" even the reactions in germany -lrb- to the incident -rrb- are being carefully followed -lrb- in india -rrb- , " kauder said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 30.08.2007 merkel proposes new blueprint to fight global warming großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , here on a recent visit to greenland , is serious about combating global warming german chancellor merkel 's proposed new plan to curb climate change foresees linking caps on co2 emissions to the population of a country .
it could be of particular interest to large emerging nations china and india . in a speech during her first visit to japan as german chancellor , angela merkel said thursday both developing and industrialized nations need to agree on specific targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions .
" we have to assume that emerging nations naturally do n't want the same responsibility " as industrialized nations , the chancellor said , speaking at a symposium organized by japan 's nikkei media group in tokyo .
a more palatable pact for emerging nations developing countries such as india and china , experiencing skyrocketing growth rates , are worried that strict environmental regulations will dent their economic boom .
they want industrialized nations , the chief polluters , to bear the brunt of emission cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's rapid economic boom is taking a heavy toll on its environment merkel suggested that as a compromise , developing countries should be allowed to increase their emissions per capita while industrialized nations cut theirs , until both sides reach the same level .
the model is said to be based on a proposal by indian prime minister manmohan singh at the g-8 summit in june in germany .
that conference , hosted by merkel , set a non-binding goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 within the eu .
merkel also underlined the need to forge a successor climate pact to the kyoto protocol which expires at the end of 2012 and which she helped draw up as germany 's environment minister in 1997 .
she however voiced caution about the carbon market , part of the kyoto protocol that allows countries that emit gas beyond their allowance to buy credits from companies or countries below their target levels .
the system also exists for companies in the european union .
" it is a wise , market-oriented measure but we need to be careful as it can go in the wrong direction , " merkel said .
" for example , if a coal factory merely moves from europe to a foreign country because it can sell the carbon credit , that 's meaningless , " she said .
merkel wants us on board merkel said detailed targets needed to be set soon if the world wants to slow global warming .
" the question is , how do we distribute -lrb- reduction targets -rrb- in the world ?
i do n't believe that it 's enough to just agree that everyone will do their best .
i do n't believe that would yield an impressive result , " she said .
time is running out in the fight against global warming , she said , adding that the united states must be part of any global deal to slash carbon dioxide emissions .
" i think america will cooperate - america must cooperate .
if we ca n't find a regulatory regime that is accepted by the usa , then china and india will never agree to reduction targets , " merkel said .
the fight against climate change is the overarching theme of merkel 's visit to japan .
japan is to host the next g8 summit in hokkaido in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look no ties !
merkel with abe honoring japan 's " cool biz " campaign on wednesday , merkel and japanese prime minister shinzo abe went into talks to map out ways to work with major polluters to achieve goals for greenhouse gas reductions by pointing out that no one in their delegations was wearing a tie , in honor of japan 's " cool biz " campaign to dress lighter in summer and reduce air conditioning use .
japanese opposition skeptical of afghanistan mission separately , merkel ruffled feathers among japan 's opposition on thursday by urging the country to maintain its support for the " war on terror " in afghanistan .
" you do n't have to follow the unilateral opinion of the united states , " main opposition leader ichiro ozawa told merkel in a meeting , as quoted by tsuyoshi yamaguchi , the opposition 's shadow foreign minister .
germany is heavily involved in afghanistan , where it has contributed some 3,000 troops to the nato-led international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and has six tornado reconnaissance planes helping to spot taliban hideouts . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it could be of particular interest to large emerging nations china and india . in a speech during her first visit to japan as german chancellor , angela merkel said thursday both developing and industrialized nations need to agree on specific targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions .
" we have to assume that emerging nations naturally do n't want the same responsibility " as industrialized nations , the chancellor said , speaking at a symposium organized by japan 's nikkei media group in tokyo .
a more palatable pact for emerging nations developing countries such as india and china , experiencing skyrocketing growth rates , are worried that strict environmental regulations will dent their economic boom .
they want industrialized nations , the chief polluters , to bear the brunt of emission cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's rapid economic boom is taking a heavy toll on its environment merkel suggested that as a compromise , developing countries should be allowed to increase their emissions per capita while industrialized nations cut theirs , until both sides reach the same level .
the model is said to be based on a proposal by indian prime minister manmohan singh at the g-8 summit in june in germany .
that conference , hosted by merkel , set a non-binding goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 within the eu .
merkel also underlined the need to forge a successor climate pact to the kyoto protocol which expires at the end of 2012 and which she helped draw up as germany 's environment minister in 1997 .
she however voiced caution about the carbon market , part of the kyoto protocol that allows countries that emit gas beyond their allowance to buy credits from companies or countries below their target levels .
the system also exists for companies in the european union .
" it is a wise , market-oriented measure but we need to be careful as it can go in the wrong direction , " merkel said .
" for example , if a coal factory merely moves from europe to a foreign country because it can sell the carbon credit , that 's meaningless , " she said .
merkel wants us on board merkel said detailed targets needed to be set soon if the world wants to slow global warming .
" the question is , how do we distribute -lrb- reduction targets -rrb- in the world ?
i do n't believe that it 's enough to just agree that everyone will do their best .
i do n't believe that would yield an impressive result , " she said .
time is running out in the fight against global warming , she said , adding that the united states must be part of any global deal to slash carbon dioxide emissions .
" i think america will cooperate - america must cooperate .
if we ca n't find a regulatory regime that is accepted by the usa , then china and india will never agree to reduction targets , " merkel said .
the fight against climate change is the overarching theme of merkel 's visit to japan .
japan is to host the next g8 summit in hokkaido in 2008 .

a german woman has realized there 's a lot to be said for the hair of the dog .
she 's started a business making clothes for customers from the fur of their pet dogs . bearded collies are not the perfect pets for fastidious housekeepers .
throughout the year , they tend to shed their hair on carpets , beds and sofas .
it 's enough to make their owners sick as a dog .
but 50-year-old bettina menkhoff , a primary school teacher who lives in stoetze in the lüneberger heide with four such four-footed friends , decided that all that lovely fur should n't go to waste .
three years ago , she taught herself how to turn it into yarn , and has been making scarves , gloves and other clothes ever since .
her internet business now attracts customers from across the country , all putting a stylish new spin on the proverbial hair shirt .
" it only works when the hair is longer than four centimetres , " she explained .
" i regularly brush my dogs and keep the hair for processing .
it 's warmer than sheep wool . "
as fabric , pet hair appears to be a lot more emotionally charged than anything lagerfeld or lacroix ever work with .
these days , menkhoff can barely keep up with demand .
fortunately , she 's found a new supplier - a local dog salon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one day , he 'll be a scarf " some clients specifically want me to use hair from other animals too , " said menkhoff .
" they dread the day their pet dies and all they 're left with is a scarf hanging in the closet . "
for others , meanwhile , it 's precisely this sort of sentimental souvenir that they 're after .
but if business continues to boom , they 'll be more people than ever having bad hair days . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 30.08.2007 merkel proposes new blueprint to fight global warming großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , here on a recent visit to greenland , is serious about combating global warming german chancellor merkel 's proposed new plan to curb climate change foresees linking caps on co2 emissions to the population of a country .
it could be of particular interest to large emerging nations china and india . in a speech during her first visit to japan as german chancellor , angela merkel said thursday both developing and industrialized nations need to agree on specific targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions .
" we have to assume that emerging nations naturally do n't want the same responsibility " as industrialized nations , the chancellor said , speaking at a symposium organized by japan 's nikkei media group in tokyo .
a more palatable pact for emerging nations developing countries such as india and china , experiencing skyrocketing growth rates , are worried that strict environmental regulations will dent their economic boom .
they want industrialized nations , the chief polluters , to bear the brunt of emission cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's rapid economic boom is taking a heavy toll on its environment merkel suggested that as a compromise , developing countries should be allowed to increase their emissions per capita while industrialized nations cut theirs , until both sides reach the same level .
the model is said to be based on a proposal by indian prime minister manmohan singh at the g-8 summit in june in germany .
that conference , hosted by merkel , set a non-binding goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 within the eu .
merkel also underlined the need to forge a successor climate pact to the kyoto protocol which expires at the end of 2012 and which she helped draw up as germany 's environment minister in 1997 .
she however voiced caution about the carbon market , part of the kyoto protocol that allows countries that emit gas beyond their allowance to buy credits from companies or countries below their target levels .
the system also exists for companies in the european union .
" it is a wise , market-oriented measure but we need to be careful as it can go in the wrong direction , " merkel said .
" for example , if a coal factory merely moves from europe to a foreign country because it can sell the carbon credit , that 's meaningless , " she said .
merkel wants us on board merkel said detailed targets needed to be set soon if the world wants to slow global warming .
" the question is , how do we distribute -lrb- reduction targets -rrb- in the world ?
i do n't believe that it 's enough to just agree that everyone will do their best .
i do n't believe that would yield an impressive result , " she said .
time is running out in the fight against global warming , she said , adding that the united states must be part of any global deal to slash carbon dioxide emissions .
" i think america will cooperate - america must cooperate .
if we ca n't find a regulatory regime that is accepted by the usa , then china and india will never agree to reduction targets , " merkel said .
the fight against climate change is the overarching theme of merkel 's visit to japan .
japan is to host the next g8 summit in hokkaido in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look no ties !
merkel with abe honoring japan 's " cool biz " campaign on wednesday , merkel and japanese prime minister shinzo abe went into talks to map out ways to work with major polluters to achieve goals for greenhouse gas reductions by pointing out that no one in their delegations was wearing a tie , in honor of japan 's " cool biz " campaign to dress lighter in summer and reduce air conditioning use .
japanese opposition skeptical of afghanistan mission separately , merkel ruffled feathers among japan 's opposition on thursday by urging the country to maintain its support for the " war on terror " in afghanistan .
" you do n't have to follow the unilateral opinion of the united states , " main opposition leader ichiro ozawa told merkel in a meeting , as quoted by tsuyoshi yamaguchi , the opposition 's shadow foreign minister .
germany is heavily involved in afghanistan , where it has contributed some 3,000 troops to the nato-led international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and has six tornado reconnaissance planes helping to spot taliban hideouts . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany , japan close ranks on efforts to fight climate change kicking off her three-day tour of japan , german chancellor merkel told prime minister abe that japan must help germany in combating climate change .
the two leaders also discussed their involvement in afghanistan .
-lrb- 29.08.2007 -rrb- merkel seeks climate protection allies in china , japan chancellor angela merkel says she 's serious about the commitments to climate protection agreed upon at the june g8 summit .
she can prove her earnestness soon as she tries to recruit allies in china and japan this month .
-lrb- 10.08.2007 -rrb- merkel : g8 reaches compromise to curb climate change german chancellor angela merkel said thursday that g8 leaders struck a " very successful " agreement aiming to halve greenhouse gases by 2050 , adding the accord was " a clear commitment to continue the un climate process .

it could be of particular interest to large emerging nations china and india . in a speech during her first visit to japan as german chancellor , angela merkel said thursday both developing and industrialized nations need to agree on specific targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions .
" we have to assume that emerging nations naturally do n't want the same responsibility " as industrialized nations , the chancellor said , speaking at a symposium organized by japan 's nikkei media group in tokyo .
a more palatable pact for emerging nations developing countries such as india and china , experiencing skyrocketing growth rates , are worried that strict environmental regulations will dent their economic boom .
they want industrialized nations , the chief polluters , to bear the brunt of emission cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's rapid economic boom is taking a heavy toll on its environment merkel suggested that as a compromise , developing countries should be allowed to increase their emissions per capita while industrialized nations cut theirs , until both sides reach the same level .
the model is said to be based on a proposal by indian prime minister manmohan singh at the g-8 summit in june in germany .
that conference , hosted by merkel , set a non-binding goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 within the eu .
merkel also underlined the need to forge a successor climate pact to the kyoto protocol which expires at the end of 2012 and which she helped draw up as germany 's environment minister in 1997 .
she however voiced caution about the carbon market , part of the kyoto protocol that allows countries that emit gas beyond their allowance to buy credits from companies or countries below their target levels .
the system also exists for companies in the european union .
" it is a wise , market-oriented measure but we need to be careful as it can go in the wrong direction , " merkel said .
" for example , if a coal factory merely moves from europe to a foreign country because it can sell the carbon credit , that 's meaningless , " she said .
merkel wants us on board merkel said detailed targets needed to be set soon if the world wants to slow global warming .
" the question is , how do we distribute -lrb- reduction targets -rrb- in the world ?
i do n't believe that it 's enough to just agree that everyone will do their best .
i do n't believe that would yield an impressive result , " she said .

a german woman has realized there 's a lot to be said for the hair of the dog .
she 's started a business making clothes for customers from the fur of their pet dogs . bearded collies are not the perfect pets for fastidious housekeepers .
throughout the year , they tend to shed their hair on carpets , beds and sofas .
it 's enough to make their owners sick as a dog .
but 50-year-old bettina menkhoff , a primary school teacher who lives in stoetze in the lüneberger heide with four such four-footed friends , decided that all that lovely fur should n't go to waste .
three years ago , she taught herself how to turn it into yarn , and has been making scarves , gloves and other clothes ever since .
her internet business now attracts customers from across the country , all putting a stylish new spin on the proverbial hair shirt .
" it only works when the hair is longer than four centimetres , " she explained .
" i regularly brush my dogs and keep the hair for processing .
it 's warmer than sheep wool . "
as fabric , pet hair appears to be a lot more emotionally charged than anything lagerfeld or lacroix ever work with .
these days , menkhoff can barely keep up with demand .
fortunately , she 's found a new supplier - a local dog salon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one day , he 'll be a scarf " some clients specifically want me to use hair from other animals too , " said menkhoff .

was lafontaine effectively saying goodbye to fidel castro ? wolfgang gehrcke : first and foremost , lafontaine is keen to see how the country is evolving , to explore its potential for further development and the current state of the european-cuban relationship .
germany 's position on the eu 's restrictive policy towards cuba is not a constructive one .
unfortunately , berlin has not taken sides with the spanish and italian governments who want to see the eu lift sanctions against cuba .
oskar lafontaine is visiting a number of initiatives providing humanitarian aid in the country , such as supplying children with milk everyday .
the visit to cuba is oskar lafontaine 's first port of call on his tour of latin america 's new , left-wing governments .

the government is of the opinion that germany has few interests in latin america outside of sao paulo , brazil 's economic center , and mexico .
it 's happy to leave the continent to the us .
broadly speaking , the government shares washington 's political aims there , which define neo-liberalism as the only viable option for economic development .
but neo-liberalism has failed in latin america , leaving a trail of destruction within the continent 's social structures .
this form of dogma has made only the very few wealthy while the majority of the population as well as parts of the middle classes have become poorer .
no one in latin america still believes that neo-liberalism and globalization can deliver wealth for all .

in many countries , these developments have resulted in victories for the left or progressive , anti-neo liberal forces in parliamentary and presidential elections .
regardless of whether they continue to promote socialist values or are more interested in pushing for greater national independence and sovereignty , what they have in common is a political interest in social change on behalf of marginalized , disadvantaged groups .
as in venezuela , the goal of the various campaigns initiated by the government is to improve life for the country 's poor , create jobs and improve education and health .

left party leader oskar lafontaine is in cuba this week for a three-day visit .
dw-world.de talked to the party 's foreign policy spokesman wolfgang gehrcke about the new latin american left . dw-world.de : what was the political significance of this visit ?
was lafontaine effectively saying goodbye to fidel castro ? wolfgang gehrcke : first and foremost , lafontaine is keen to see how the country is evolving , to explore its potential for further development and the current state of the european-cuban relationship .
germany 's position on the eu 's restrictive policy towards cuba is not a constructive one .
unfortunately , berlin has not taken sides with the spanish and italian governments who want to see the eu lift sanctions against cuba .
oskar lafontaine is visiting a number of initiatives providing humanitarian aid in the country , such as supplying children with milk everyday .
the visit to cuba is oskar lafontaine 's first port of call on his tour of latin america 's new , left-wing governments .
as far as i am aware , fidel castro is in good health and there is no reason to say goodbye to him . as the left party 's foreign policy spokesman , what do you think of the german government 's stance on latin america ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : change has swept venezuela berlin 's policies towards latin america are based on positions that range from indifference to outright hostility towards south america 's recent shift to the left .
the government is of the opinion that germany has few interests in latin america outside of sao paulo , brazil 's economic center , and mexico .
it 's happy to leave the continent to the us .
broadly speaking , the government shares washington 's political aims there , which define neo-liberalism as the only viable option for economic development .
but neo-liberalism has failed in latin america , leaving a trail of destruction within the continent 's social structures .
this form of dogma has made only the very few wealthy while the majority of the population as well as parts of the middle classes have become poorer .
no one in latin america still believes that neo-liberalism and globalization can deliver wealth for all .
in a number of countries , democratic votes have resulted in the election of various forms of left-wing alternatives to neo-liberalism .
europe should be joining forces with latin america to develop cooperation 's that prioritize public political interests on both continents , and push for a better world .
we propose that europe builds up economic ties to latin america that are based on co-operations and the respective countries ' own agenda for development .
this includes banishing poverty by developing domestic markets .
latin america needs debt relief as well as a transfer of technology in order to boost its economic performance . what does the german left party think about the " new latin american left " ? across latin america , we are seeing broad-based movements fighting against the consequences of neo-liberalism .
in many countries , these developments have resulted in victories for the left or progressive , anti-neo liberal forces in parliamentary and presidential elections .
regardless of whether they continue to promote socialist values or are more interested in pushing for greater national independence and sovereignty , what they have in common is a political interest in social change on behalf of marginalized , disadvantaged groups .
as in venezuela , the goal of the various campaigns initiated by the government is to improve life for the country 's poor , create jobs and improve education and health .
latin america 's left-wing governments are backed by various groups .
these include , along with politicians and parties , unions and various social movements as well as independent intellectuals , local entrepreneurs and representatives of the church . who represents this new left ?
bachelet , chavez or evo morales ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chilean president michelle bachelet in terms of society transforming , this process is best embodied by bolivian president evo morales und hugo chavez in venezuela .
but in terms of a new political direction , geared towards greater social equality in latin america and away from neo-liberalism , then the process is spearheaded by figures such as chilean president michelle bachelet and nestor kirchner in argentina .
they all stand for more socially aware policies geared towards a stronger , more interventionist state . which challenges do left-wing organizations in latin america and germany share ? we need to aim for a world based on greater solidarity which leaves our children with a future .
our world and our future are seriously jeopardized by war and impending hunger crises due to ever dwindling food supplies caused by environmental disaster .
we also need to overcome illiteracy , endemic disease , poverty and water shortages .
these are tasks we can only meet if we in europe all pull together and with the developing world . how can the left party help contribute to continued existence of the latin american left ? for the time being we need to learn from them .
the most important developments are happening there , and the left is currently very successful .
the latin american left has been a motivating force for a new left-wing culture and is currently helping to revitalize the socialist option .
we can help by achieving similar success . according to the latest surveys , oskar lafontaine is one of the best-known and most popular politicians in germany .

one of the so-called " response modules " already identified as a key need is a forest fire-fighting unit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been a series of disasters this summer " the costs of not doing enough in a coordinated way far outweigh the costs of doing it ... in a coordinated , better way , " said helfferich . the european commission has been coordinating the response to the greek forest fires through its brussels-based monitoring and information centre -lrb- mic -rrb- . last friday , greece asked its european partners to provide water-bombing aircraft to help fight the fires which have been affecting the country since the beginning of the summer but have dramatically increased in intensity in the past six days . massive coordination effort the mic co-ordination of the greece crisis is , according to helfferich , its " biggest effort ever " since the center was set up in 2001 .

" in the overall interest of the community , " there are grounds to leave the possibility of continuing these anti-dumping measures for up to another year , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger told journalists .
" we have to balance environmental interests with the interest of fair trade , " he added .
" this is a rapid-changing market reality and so some transitional measures were warranted . "
unfair competition the commission introduced the anti-dumping tariffs of up to 66 percent in 2001 after an investigation concluded that competition between eu and chinese manufacturers was unfair .
the duties on the power-saving light bulbs made in china raise prices for european customers by up to two-thirds .
for now , less than 20 percent of power-saving bulbs are made in europe , while over two-thirds are imported from china .
but at the end of july , a majority of the experts gave backing to a proposal from mandelson to let the duties lapse .
afp news service reported that according to mandelson 's spokesman , only one out of four european producers had been keen to retain the trade charges .
german lighting company osram , a subsidiary of siemens , had led calls to renew the duties because they hit dutch rival philips harder than osram , though both companies produce in china .
impeding green progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eco-friendly bulbs will soon be mandatory this week 's decision , which contravenes the eu 's intention to reduce its growing energy bill , has triggered outrage among environmentalists , who feel the brussels ' contradiction is deeply hypocritical .
earlier this year , eu leaders proposed that traditional , but inefficient , incandescent bulbs be phased out across the bloc by 2009 , as one of a series of measures aimed at reducing carbon emissions .
environmentalists argue that the continued duties will restrict european consumers ' access to cheaper , low-energy technology .
" -lrb- this proposal -rrb- is disappointing , unfair and seriously inconsistent with the ambitious eu targets to improve energy efficiency in europe and to curb climate change , " the conservation organization wwf said in a press release , quoted by afp .
" on the one hand , europe has committed to an ambitious energy efficiency objective , and on the other hand it continues to impose taxes on imports of green products , " the group 's trade and investment specialist eivind hoff said .
retailer resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osram wanted the charges to stay in place further resistance is expected to come from retailers , who may well see it as a means of protecting major eu producers .
" the commission needs to put the environment before the narrow self-interests of a minority of member countries and scrap import duties on chinese bulbs , " the head of the british retail consortium , kevin hawkins , told the independent newspaper .
according to afp , the conservative british eu lawmaker syed kamall described the decision as " farcical and indefensible . "
" the light bulb industry wants the duties scrapped , consumers want them scrapped and common sense says they should be scrapped ; yet the european commission has once again bowed to protectionist pressures , " he said .
the decision still has to be approved by anti-dumping experts from the european union 's member states . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 30.08.2007 german left party touches base with latin american comrades großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can germany 's left party learn from latin american countries , including cuba ?
left party leader oskar lafontaine is in cuba this week for a three-day visit .
dw-world.de talked to the party 's foreign policy spokesman wolfgang gehrcke about the new latin american left . dw-world.de : what was the political significance of this visit ?
was lafontaine effectively saying goodbye to fidel castro ? wolfgang gehrcke : first and foremost , lafontaine is keen to see how the country is evolving , to explore its potential for further development and the current state of the european-cuban relationship .
germany 's position on the eu 's restrictive policy towards cuba is not a constructive one .
unfortunately , berlin has not taken sides with the spanish and italian governments who want to see the eu lift sanctions against cuba .
oskar lafontaine is visiting a number of initiatives providing humanitarian aid in the country , such as supplying children with milk everyday .
the visit to cuba is oskar lafontaine 's first port of call on his tour of latin america 's new , left-wing governments .
as far as i am aware , fidel castro is in good health and there is no reason to say goodbye to him . as the left party 's foreign policy spokesman , what do you think of the german government 's stance on latin america ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : change has swept venezuela berlin 's policies towards latin america are based on positions that range from indifference to outright hostility towards south america 's recent shift to the left .
the government is of the opinion that germany has few interests in latin america outside of sao paulo , brazil 's economic center , and mexico .
it 's happy to leave the continent to the us .
broadly speaking , the government shares washington 's political aims there , which define neo-liberalism as the only viable option for economic development .
but neo-liberalism has failed in latin america , leaving a trail of destruction within the continent 's social structures .
this form of dogma has made only the very few wealthy while the majority of the population as well as parts of the middle classes have become poorer .
no one in latin america still believes that neo-liberalism and globalization can deliver wealth for all .
in a number of countries , democratic votes have resulted in the election of various forms of left-wing alternatives to neo-liberalism .
europe should be joining forces with latin america to develop cooperation 's that prioritize public political interests on both continents , and push for a better world .
we propose that europe builds up economic ties to latin america that are based on co-operations and the respective countries ' own agenda for development .
this includes banishing poverty by developing domestic markets .
latin america needs debt relief as well as a transfer of technology in order to boost its economic performance . what does the german left party think about the " new latin american left " ? across latin america , we are seeing broad-based movements fighting against the consequences of neo-liberalism .
in many countries , these developments have resulted in victories for the left or progressive , anti-neo liberal forces in parliamentary and presidential elections .
regardless of whether they continue to promote socialist values or are more interested in pushing for greater national independence and sovereignty , what they have in common is a political interest in social change on behalf of marginalized , disadvantaged groups .
as in venezuela , the goal of the various campaigns initiated by the government is to improve life for the country 's poor , create jobs and improve education and health .
latin america 's left-wing governments are backed by various groups .
these include , along with politicians and parties , unions and various social movements as well as independent intellectuals , local entrepreneurs and representatives of the church . who represents this new left ?
bachelet , chavez or evo morales ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chilean president michelle bachelet in terms of society transforming , this process is best embodied by bolivian president evo morales und hugo chavez in venezuela .
but in terms of a new political direction , geared towards greater social equality in latin america and away from neo-liberalism , then the process is spearheaded by figures such as chilean president michelle bachelet and nestor kirchner in argentina .
they all stand for more socially aware policies geared towards a stronger , more interventionist state . which challenges do left-wing organizations in latin america and germany share ? we need to aim for a world based on greater solidarity which leaves our children with a future .
our world and our future are seriously jeopardized by war and impending hunger crises due to ever dwindling food supplies caused by environmental disaster .
we also need to overcome illiteracy , endemic disease , poverty and water shortages .
these are tasks we can only meet if we in europe all pull together and with the developing world . how can the left party help contribute to continued existence of the latin american left ? for the time being we need to learn from them .
the most important developments are happening there , and the left is currently very successful .
the latin american left has been a motivating force for a new left-wing culture and is currently helping to revitalize the socialist option .
we can help by achieving similar success . according to the latest surveys , oskar lafontaine is one of the best-known and most popular politicians in germany .
why is this ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trustworthy or populist ?
oskar lafontaine oskar lafontaine stands for credibility .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 30.08.2007 german left party touches base with latin american comrades großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can germany 's left party learn from latin american countries , including cuba ?
left party leader oskar lafontaine is in cuba this week for a three-day visit .
dw-world.de talked to the party 's foreign policy spokesman wolfgang gehrcke about the new latin american left . dw-world.de : what was the political significance of this visit ?
was lafontaine effectively saying goodbye to fidel castro ? wolfgang gehrcke : first and foremost , lafontaine is keen to see how the country is evolving , to explore its potential for further development and the current state of the european-cuban relationship .
germany 's position on the eu 's restrictive policy towards cuba is not a constructive one .
unfortunately , berlin has not taken sides with the spanish and italian governments who want to see the eu lift sanctions against cuba .
oskar lafontaine is visiting a number of initiatives providing humanitarian aid in the country , such as supplying children with milk everyday .
the visit to cuba is oskar lafontaine 's first port of call on his tour of latin america 's new , left-wing governments .
as far as i am aware , fidel castro is in good health and there is no reason to say goodbye to him . as the left party 's foreign policy spokesman , what do you think of the german government 's stance on latin america ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : change has swept venezuela berlin 's policies towards latin america are based on positions that range from indifference to outright hostility towards south america 's recent shift to the left .
the government is of the opinion that germany has few interests in latin america outside of sao paulo , brazil 's economic center , and mexico .
it 's happy to leave the continent to the us .
broadly speaking , the government shares washington 's political aims there , which define neo-liberalism as the only viable option for economic development .
but neo-liberalism has failed in latin america , leaving a trail of destruction within the continent 's social structures .
this form of dogma has made only the very few wealthy while the majority of the population as well as parts of the middle classes have become poorer .
no one in latin america still believes that neo-liberalism and globalization can deliver wealth for all .
in a number of countries , democratic votes have resulted in the election of various forms of left-wing alternatives to neo-liberalism .
europe should be joining forces with latin america to develop cooperation 's that prioritize public political interests on both continents , and push for a better world .
we propose that europe builds up economic ties to latin america that are based on co-operations and the respective countries ' own agenda for development .
this includes banishing poverty by developing domestic markets .
latin america needs debt relief as well as a transfer of technology in order to boost its economic performance . what does the german left party think about the " new latin american left " ? across latin america , we are seeing broad-based movements fighting against the consequences of neo-liberalism .
in many countries , these developments have resulted in victories for the left or progressive , anti-neo liberal forces in parliamentary and presidential elections .
regardless of whether they continue to promote socialist values or are more interested in pushing for greater national independence and sovereignty , what they have in common is a political interest in social change on behalf of marginalized , disadvantaged groups .
as in venezuela , the goal of the various campaigns initiated by the government is to improve life for the country 's poor , create jobs and improve education and health .
latin america 's left-wing governments are backed by various groups .
these include , along with politicians and parties , unions and various social movements as well as independent intellectuals , local entrepreneurs and representatives of the church . who represents this new left ?
bachelet , chavez or evo morales ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chilean president michelle bachelet in terms of society transforming , this process is best embodied by bolivian president evo morales und hugo chavez in venezuela .
but in terms of a new political direction , geared towards greater social equality in latin america and away from neo-liberalism , then the process is spearheaded by figures such as chilean president michelle bachelet and nestor kirchner in argentina .
they all stand for more socially aware policies geared towards a stronger , more interventionist state . which challenges do left-wing organizations in latin america and germany share ? we need to aim for a world based on greater solidarity which leaves our children with a future .
our world and our future are seriously jeopardized by war and impending hunger crises due to ever dwindling food supplies caused by environmental disaster .
we also need to overcome illiteracy , endemic disease , poverty and water shortages .
these are tasks we can only meet if we in europe all pull together and with the developing world . how can the left party help contribute to continued existence of the latin american left ? for the time being we need to learn from them .
the most important developments are happening there , and the left is currently very successful .
the latin american left has been a motivating force for a new left-wing culture and is currently helping to revitalize the socialist option .
we can help by achieving similar success . according to the latest surveys , oskar lafontaine is one of the best-known and most popular politicians in germany .
why is this ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trustworthy or populist ?
oskar lafontaine oskar lafontaine stands for credibility .
he gave up his office and left his party when it turned its back on social democracy in favor of neo-liberalism under gerhard schröder .
he gives voice to people 's fear of unrestrained capitalism - the tidal wave of neo-liberalism and globalization bearing down on them . enrique lopez magallon interviewed wolfgang gehrcke -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german embassy has " already received several enquiries about the location of so-called no-go areas for foreign visitors to germany , " kauder told german daily rheinischen post .
kauder , who is parliamentary leader of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , admitted that all indians who had anything to do either economically or politically with germany had taken note of the incident in eastern germany .
" even the reactions in germany -lrb- to the incident -rrb- are being carefully followed -lrb- in india -rrb- , " kauder said .
the politician pointed out that indians , however , are making an effort not to play up the incident .
" the indians recognize that these events in mügeln are not the rule in germany , " he said , adding that chancellor merkel 's condemnation of the attacks had done much to calm the situation .
a hate crime ?
the incident took place ten days ago during a village festival in the eastern german state of saxony .
a german mob of over 50 people chased and attacked a group of eight indians who took refuge in a pizzeria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer patrols the area near the pizzeria owned by a pakistani the frenzied mob broke down the door and assaulted the indians .
police forces eventually arrived on the scene , but it took a while for the large squad of 70 police officers to force back the crowd .
the attack left 14 people wounded , including four of the attackers , two police officers and the eight indians , some of whom were beaten so badly they needed medical attention .
according to saxony 's state prosecutor , 82 witnesses have so far been interviewed in connection with the attack .
the police confirmed on tuesday that they are investigating seven suspects . state police chief , bernd merbitz , told the associated press that the actions had not been committed by a particular extreme-right group .
nonetheless , he said , the chanting of slogans such as " foreigners out ! " and " germany for germans " constituted a xenophobic criminal offence .

" in the overall interest of the community , " there are grounds to leave the possibility of continuing these anti-dumping measures for up to another year , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger told journalists .
" we have to balance environmental interests with the interest of fair trade , " he added .
" this is a rapid-changing market reality and so some transitional measures were warranted . "
unfair competition the commission introduced the anti-dumping tariffs of up to 66 percent in 2001 after an investigation concluded that competition between eu and chinese manufacturers was unfair .
the duties on the power-saving light bulbs made in china raise prices for european customers by up to two-thirds .
for now , less than 20 percent of power-saving bulbs are made in europe , while over two-thirds are imported from china .
but at the end of july , a majority of the experts gave backing to a proposal from mandelson to let the duties lapse .
afp news service reported that according to mandelson 's spokesman , only one out of four european producers had been keen to retain the trade charges .
german lighting company osram , a subsidiary of siemens , had led calls to renew the duties because they hit dutch rival philips harder than osram , though both companies produce in china .
impeding green progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eco-friendly bulbs will soon be mandatory this week 's decision , which contravenes the eu 's intention to reduce its growing energy bill , has triggered outrage among environmentalists , who feel the brussels ' contradiction is deeply hypocritical .
earlier this year , eu leaders proposed that traditional , but inefficient , incandescent bulbs be phased out across the bloc by 2009 , as one of a series of measures aimed at reducing carbon emissions .
environmentalists argue that the continued duties will restrict european consumers ' access to cheaper , low-energy technology .
" -lrb- this proposal -rrb- is disappointing , unfair and seriously inconsistent with the ambitious eu targets to improve energy efficiency in europe and to curb climate change , " the conservation organization wwf said in a press release , quoted by afp .
" on the one hand , europe has committed to an ambitious energy efficiency objective , and on the other hand it continues to impose taxes on imports of green products , " the group 's trade and investment specialist eivind hoff said .
retailer resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osram wanted the charges to stay in place further resistance is expected to come from retailers , who may well see it as a means of protecting major eu producers .
" the commission needs to put the environment before the narrow self-interests of a minority of member countries and scrap import duties on chinese bulbs , " the head of the british retail consortium , kevin hawkins , told the independent newspaper .
according to afp , the conservative british eu lawmaker syed kamall described the decision as " farcical and indefensible . "
" the light bulb industry wants the duties scrapped , consumers want them scrapped and common sense says they should be scrapped ; yet the european commission has once again bowed to protectionist pressures , " he said .

according to afp , the conservative british eu lawmaker syed kamall described the decision as " farcical and indefensible . "
" the light bulb industry wants the duties scrapped , consumers want them scrapped and common sense says they should be scrapped ; yet the european commission has once again bowed to protectionist pressures , " he said .

none of the three german representatives face an easy passage . the teams on the long road to moscow and the 2007/08 champions league final took another small step thursday when the draw for the group stages of europe 's premier club competition were made in monaco .
uefa president michel platini oversaw the placing of 32 teams into eight groups during the spectacular event in the principality .
each group was headed by one of the eight seeded teams from around europe , including holders ac milan , last year 's beaten finalists liverpool and 2006 winners barcelona .
germany was fielding three teams in the draw : champions vfb stuttgart , runners-up schalke 04 and third-placed werder bremen , who qualified on wednesday night after a tough night in zagreb .
bundesliga champions stuttgart , who qualified automatically , will have to be well-prepared to progress from group e after being drawn against 2006 winners barcelona , perennial french champions olympique lyon and glasgow rangers .
schalke 04 , who spectacularly blew the chance to win the german title in the final stages of last season , will be hoping to keep their nerve in group b , despite the presence of chelsea , valencia and norwegian champions rosenberg .
both chelsea and valencia reached the knock-out stages last year with chelsea reaching the semi-finals after beating bremen in the group stages .
werder bremen , who reached the group stage for a fourth consecutive season following a hard-fought 3-2 victory at dynamo zagreb , with brazilian midfielder diego scoring a brace of penalties , were rewarded with a tough group c placing .

" the taliban 's " extortionate demands " appeared to have been met all along the line , he told the berlin radio station rbb . on thursday , the taliban freed the remaining seven south korean aid workers they had been holding .
twelve other hostages were released on wednesday . nachtwei said the outcome was bad for the government of afghan president hamid karzai , " which did not play any part " in the release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the south korean government is also facing criticism at home the south korean government said it had confirmed to the taliban it would withdraw its 200 soldiers from afghanistan by year 's end . the aghan foreign minister rangin dadfar spanta emphasized on thursday that south korea had already made its decision before the missionaries were kidnapped . " it is a very dangerous message when we give the impression that the international community and the afghan government can be blackmailed , " dadfar said on thursday on rbb radio . afghan government bypassed the day before , afghan commerce minister amin farhang had also criticized the south korean government for bypassing the afghan government and dealing directly with the taliban . " this release under these conditions will make our difficulties in afghanistan even bigger , " farhand told german public radio bayerischer rundfunk . " we fear that this decision could become a precedent .
the taliban will continue trying to take hostages to attain their aims in afghanistan . " south korea also said it had promised to send no more " christian missionaries " into the muslim country .
for its part , the taliban dropped their demands for the release of prisoners . speculation is rife that the south korean government paid a ransom for the hostages , a charge denied by both south korean and taliban officials . taliban gains credibility after initial joy at the release of the hostages , the korean newspaper korea times added its voice to the volley of criticism . " even if the taliban did n't manage to assert their demands for a prisoner exchange that they have had direct negotiations with a foreign state on ' their territory ' greatly adds to their political credibility , " the paper said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ambulance transports the dead body of one of two germans kidnapped in afghanistan one german national who was kidnapped around the same time as the south koreans is still being held in afghanistan .

" the federal government is trying hard to obtain the release of the hostages we have in afghanistan , " merkel said wednesday during a visit to japan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in japan , german chancellor angela merkel emphasised that germany would n't be blackmailed by the taliban " the situation concerning the south korean hostages will not change in the way we are dealing with it , " she said . the taliban originally kidnapped 23 south koreans as they traveled from kabul to kandahar on july 19 .

" the taliban 's " extortionate demands " appeared to have been met all along the line , he told the berlin radio station rbb . on thursday , the taliban freed the remaining seven south korean aid workers they had been holding .
twelve other hostages were released on wednesday . nachtwei said the outcome was bad for the government of afghan president hamid karzai , " which did not play any part " in the release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the south korean government is also facing criticism at home the south korean government said it had confirmed to the taliban it would withdraw its 200 soldiers from afghanistan by year 's end . the aghan foreign minister rangin dadfar spanta emphasized on thursday that south korea had already made its decision before the missionaries were kidnapped . " it is a very dangerous message when we give the impression that the international community and the afghan government can be blackmailed , " dadfar said on thursday on rbb radio . afghan government bypassed the day before , afghan commerce minister amin farhang had also criticized the south korean government for bypassing the afghan government and dealing directly with the taliban . " this release under these conditions will make our difficulties in afghanistan even bigger , " farhand told german public radio bayerischer rundfunk . " we fear that this decision could become a precedent .
the taliban will continue trying to take hostages to attain their aims in afghanistan . " south korea also said it had promised to send no more " christian missionaries " into the muslim country .
for its part , the taliban dropped their demands for the release of prisoners . speculation is rife that the south korean government paid a ransom for the hostages , a charge denied by both south korean and taliban officials . taliban gains credibility after initial joy at the release of the hostages , the korean newspaper korea times added its voice to the volley of criticism . " even if the taliban did n't manage to assert their demands for a prisoner exchange that they have had direct negotiations with a foreign state on ' their territory ' greatly adds to their political credibility , " the paper said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ambulance transports the dead body of one of two germans kidnapped in afghanistan one german national who was kidnapped around the same time as the south koreans is still being held in afghanistan .
another german national , who was seized with him , was killed while in captivity . the taliban are demanding that germany withdraw its troops from afghanistan in exchange for his release , something which german government refuses to do . german chancellor angela merkel said her government would not change its strategy in light of the release of the korean hostages . " the federal government is trying hard to obtain the release of the hostages we have in afghanistan , " merkel said wednesday during a visit to japan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in japan , german chancellor angela merkel emphasised that germany would n't be blackmailed by the taliban " the situation concerning the south korean hostages will not change in the way we are dealing with it , " she said . the taliban originally kidnapped 23 south koreans as they traveled from kabul to kandahar on july 19 .
in late july , the militants killed two male hostages , and they released two women earlier this month as gesture of goodwill . two men were killed after the expiration of taliban-set deadlines for the afghan authorities to meet their demands , and two female hostages who fell ill were released on aug .

" in the overall interest of the community , " there are grounds to leave the possibility of continuing these anti-dumping measures for up to another year , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger told journalists .
" we have to balance environmental interests with the interest of fair trade , " he added .
" this is a rapid-changing market reality and so some transitional measures were warranted . "
unfair competition the commission introduced the anti-dumping tariffs of up to 66 percent in 2001 after an investigation concluded that competition between eu and chinese manufacturers was unfair .
the duties on the power-saving light bulbs made in china raise prices for european customers by up to two-thirds .
for now , less than 20 percent of power-saving bulbs are made in europe , while over two-thirds are imported from china .
but at the end of july , a majority of the experts gave backing to a proposal from mandelson to let the duties lapse .
afp news service reported that according to mandelson 's spokesman , only one out of four european producers had been keen to retain the trade charges .
german lighting company osram , a subsidiary of siemens , had led calls to renew the duties because they hit dutch rival philips harder than osram , though both companies produce in china .
impeding green progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eco-friendly bulbs will soon be mandatory this week 's decision , which contravenes the eu 's intention to reduce its growing energy bill , has triggered outrage among environmentalists , who feel the brussels ' contradiction is deeply hypocritical .
earlier this year , eu leaders proposed that traditional , but inefficient , incandescent bulbs be phased out across the bloc by 2009 , as one of a series of measures aimed at reducing carbon emissions .
environmentalists argue that the continued duties will restrict european consumers ' access to cheaper , low-energy technology .
" -lrb- this proposal -rrb- is disappointing , unfair and seriously inconsistent with the ambitious eu targets to improve energy efficiency in europe and to curb climate change , " the conservation organization wwf said in a press release , quoted by afp .
" on the one hand , europe has committed to an ambitious energy efficiency objective , and on the other hand it continues to impose taxes on imports of green products , " the group 's trade and investment specialist eivind hoff said .
retailer resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osram wanted the charges to stay in place further resistance is expected to come from retailers , who may well see it as a means of protecting major eu producers .
" the commission needs to put the environment before the narrow self-interests of a minority of member countries and scrap import duties on chinese bulbs , " the head of the british retail consortium , kevin hawkins , told the independent newspaper .
according to afp , the conservative british eu lawmaker syed kamall described the decision as " farcical and indefensible . "
" the light bulb industry wants the duties scrapped , consumers want them scrapped and common sense says they should be scrapped ; yet the european commission has once again bowed to protectionist pressures , " he said .

" in the overall interest of the community , " there are grounds to leave the possibility of continuing these anti-dumping measures for up to another year , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger told journalists .
" we have to balance environmental interests with the interest of fair trade , " he added .
" this is a rapid-changing market reality and so some transitional measures were warranted . "
unfair competition the commission introduced the anti-dumping tariffs of up to 66 percent in 2001 after an investigation concluded that competition between eu and chinese manufacturers was unfair .
the duties on the power-saving light bulbs made in china raise prices for european customers by up to two-thirds .
for now , less than 20 percent of power-saving bulbs are made in europe , while over two-thirds are imported from china .
but at the end of july , a majority of the experts gave backing to a proposal from mandelson to let the duties lapse .
afp news service reported that according to mandelson 's spokesman , only one out of four european producers had been keen to retain the trade charges .
german lighting company osram , a subsidiary of siemens , had led calls to renew the duties because they hit dutch rival philips harder than osram , though both companies produce in china .
impeding green progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eco-friendly bulbs will soon be mandatory this week 's decision , which contravenes the eu 's intention to reduce its growing energy bill , has triggered outrage among environmentalists , who feel the brussels ' contradiction is deeply hypocritical .
earlier this year , eu leaders proposed that traditional , but inefficient , incandescent bulbs be phased out across the bloc by 2009 , as one of a series of measures aimed at reducing carbon emissions .
environmentalists argue that the continued duties will restrict european consumers ' access to cheaper , low-energy technology .
" -lrb- this proposal -rrb- is disappointing , unfair and seriously inconsistent with the ambitious eu targets to improve energy efficiency in europe and to curb climate change , " the conservation organization wwf said in a press release , quoted by afp .
" on the one hand , europe has committed to an ambitious energy efficiency objective , and on the other hand it continues to impose taxes on imports of green products , " the group 's trade and investment specialist eivind hoff said .
retailer resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osram wanted the charges to stay in place further resistance is expected to come from retailers , who may well see it as a means of protecting major eu producers .
" the commission needs to put the environment before the narrow self-interests of a minority of member countries and scrap import duties on chinese bulbs , " the head of the british retail consortium , kevin hawkins , told the independent newspaper .
according to afp , the conservative british eu lawmaker syed kamall described the decision as " farcical and indefensible . "
" the light bulb industry wants the duties scrapped , consumers want them scrapped and common sense says they should be scrapped ; yet the european commission has once again bowed to protectionist pressures , " he said .
the decision still has to be approved by anti-dumping experts from the european union 's member states . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german embassy has " already received several enquiries about the location of so-called no-go areas for foreign visitors to germany , " kauder told german daily rheinischen post .
kauder , who is parliamentary leader of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , admitted that all indians who had anything to do either economically or politically with germany had taken note of the incident in eastern germany .
" even the reactions in germany -lrb- to the incident -rrb- are being carefully followed -lrb- in india -rrb- , " kauder said .
the politician pointed out that indians , however , are making an effort not to play up the incident .
" the indians recognize that these events in mügeln are not the rule in germany , " he said , adding that chancellor merkel 's condemnation of the attacks had done much to calm the situation .

the incident took place ten days ago during a village festival in the eastern german state of saxony .
a german mob of over 50 people chased and attacked a group of eight indians who took refuge in a pizzeria .

police forces eventually arrived on the scene , but it took a while for the large squad of 70 police officers to force back the crowd .
the attack left 14 people wounded , including four of the attackers , two police officers and the eight indians , some of whom were beaten so badly they needed medical attention .
according to saxony 's state prosecutor , 82 witnesses have so far been interviewed in connection with the attack .
the police confirmed on tuesday that they are investigating seven suspects . state police chief , bernd merbitz , told the associated press that the actions had not been committed by a particular extreme-right group .
nonetheless , he said , the chanting of slogans such as " foreigners out ! " and " germany for germans " constituted a xenophobic criminal offence .

the german embassy has " already received several enquiries about the location of so-called no-go areas for foreign visitors to germany , " kauder told german daily rheinischen post .
kauder , who is parliamentary leader of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , admitted that all indians who had anything to do either economically or politically with germany had taken note of the incident in eastern germany .
" even the reactions in germany -lrb- to the incident -rrb- are being carefully followed -lrb- in india -rrb- , " kauder said .
the politician pointed out that indians , however , are making an effort not to play up the incident .
" the indians recognize that these events in mügeln are not the rule in germany , " he said , adding that chancellor merkel 's condemnation of the attacks had done much to calm the situation .

the attack left 14 people wounded , including four of the attackers , two police officers and the eight indians , some of whom were beaten so badly they needed medical attention .
according to saxony 's state prosecutor , 82 witnesses have so far been interviewed in connection with the attack .
the police confirmed on tuesday that they are investigating seven suspects . state police chief , bernd merbitz , told the associated press that the actions had not been committed by a particular extreme-right group .

left party leader oskar lafontaine is in cuba this week for a three-day visit .
dw-world.de talked to the party 's foreign policy spokesman wolfgang gehrcke about the new latin american left . dw-world.de : what was the political significance of this visit ?
was lafontaine effectively saying goodbye to fidel castro ? wolfgang gehrcke : first and foremost , lafontaine is keen to see how the country is evolving , to explore its potential for further development and the current state of the european-cuban relationship .
germany 's position on the eu 's restrictive policy towards cuba is not a constructive one .
unfortunately , berlin has not taken sides with the spanish and italian governments who want to see the eu lift sanctions against cuba .
oskar lafontaine is visiting a number of initiatives providing humanitarian aid in the country , such as supplying children with milk everyday .
the visit to cuba is oskar lafontaine 's first port of call on his tour of latin america 's new , left-wing governments .
as far as i am aware , fidel castro is in good health and there is no reason to say goodbye to him . as the left party 's foreign policy spokesman , what do you think of the german government 's stance on latin america ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : change has swept venezuela berlin 's policies towards latin america are based on positions that range from indifference to outright hostility towards south america 's recent shift to the left .
the government is of the opinion that germany has few interests in latin america outside of sao paulo , brazil 's economic center , and mexico .
it 's happy to leave the continent to the us .
broadly speaking , the government shares washington 's political aims there , which define neo-liberalism as the only viable option for economic development .
but neo-liberalism has failed in latin america , leaving a trail of destruction within the continent 's social structures .
this form of dogma has made only the very few wealthy while the majority of the population as well as parts of the middle classes have become poorer .
no one in latin america still believes that neo-liberalism and globalization can deliver wealth for all .
in a number of countries , democratic votes have resulted in the election of various forms of left-wing alternatives to neo-liberalism .
europe should be joining forces with latin america to develop cooperation 's that prioritize public political interests on both continents , and push for a better world .
we propose that europe builds up economic ties to latin america that are based on co-operations and the respective countries ' own agenda for development .
this includes banishing poverty by developing domestic markets .
latin america needs debt relief as well as a transfer of technology in order to boost its economic performance . what does the german left party think about the " new latin american left " ? across latin america , we are seeing broad-based movements fighting against the consequences of neo-liberalism .
in many countries , these developments have resulted in victories for the left or progressive , anti-neo liberal forces in parliamentary and presidential elections .
regardless of whether they continue to promote socialist values or are more interested in pushing for greater national independence and sovereignty , what they have in common is a political interest in social change on behalf of marginalized , disadvantaged groups .
as in venezuela , the goal of the various campaigns initiated by the government is to improve life for the country 's poor , create jobs and improve education and health .
latin america 's left-wing governments are backed by various groups .
these include , along with politicians and parties , unions and various social movements as well as independent intellectuals , local entrepreneurs and representatives of the church . who represents this new left ?
bachelet , chavez or evo morales ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chilean president michelle bachelet in terms of society transforming , this process is best embodied by bolivian president evo morales und hugo chavez in venezuela .
but in terms of a new political direction , geared towards greater social equality in latin america and away from neo-liberalism , then the process is spearheaded by figures such as chilean president michelle bachelet and nestor kirchner in argentina .
they all stand for more socially aware policies geared towards a stronger , more interventionist state . which challenges do left-wing organizations in latin america and germany share ? we need to aim for a world based on greater solidarity which leaves our children with a future .
our world and our future are seriously jeopardized by war and impending hunger crises due to ever dwindling food supplies caused by environmental disaster .
we also need to overcome illiteracy , endemic disease , poverty and water shortages .
these are tasks we can only meet if we in europe all pull together and with the developing world . how can the left party help contribute to continued existence of the latin american left ? for the time being we need to learn from them .
the most important developments are happening there , and the left is currently very successful .
the latin american left has been a motivating force for a new left-wing culture and is currently helping to revitalize the socialist option .
we can help by achieving similar success . according to the latest surveys , oskar lafontaine is one of the best-known and most popular politicians in germany .
why is this ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trustworthy or populist ?
oskar lafontaine oskar lafontaine stands for credibility .
he gave up his office and left his party when it turned its back on social democracy in favor of neo-liberalism under gerhard schröder .

left party leader oskar lafontaine is in cuba this week for a three-day visit .
dw-world.de talked to the party 's foreign policy spokesman wolfgang gehrcke about the new latin american left . dw-world.de : what was the political significance of this visit ?
was lafontaine effectively saying goodbye to fidel castro ? wolfgang gehrcke : first and foremost , lafontaine is keen to see how the country is evolving , to explore its potential for further development and the current state of the european-cuban relationship .
germany 's position on the eu 's restrictive policy towards cuba is not a constructive one .
unfortunately , berlin has not taken sides with the spanish and italian governments who want to see the eu lift sanctions against cuba .
oskar lafontaine is visiting a number of initiatives providing humanitarian aid in the country , such as supplying children with milk everyday .
the visit to cuba is oskar lafontaine 's first port of call on his tour of latin america 's new , left-wing governments .
as far as i am aware , fidel castro is in good health and there is no reason to say goodbye to him . as the left party 's foreign policy spokesman , what do you think of the german government 's stance on latin america ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : change has swept venezuela berlin 's policies towards latin america are based on positions that range from indifference to outright hostility towards south america 's recent shift to the left .
the government is of the opinion that germany has few interests in latin america outside of sao paulo , brazil 's economic center , and mexico .
it 's happy to leave the continent to the us .
broadly speaking , the government shares washington 's political aims there , which define neo-liberalism as the only viable option for economic development .
but neo-liberalism has failed in latin america , leaving a trail of destruction within the continent 's social structures .
this form of dogma has made only the very few wealthy while the majority of the population as well as parts of the middle classes have become poorer .
no one in latin america still believes that neo-liberalism and globalization can deliver wealth for all .
in a number of countries , democratic votes have resulted in the election of various forms of left-wing alternatives to neo-liberalism .
europe should be joining forces with latin america to develop cooperation 's that prioritize public political interests on both continents , and push for a better world .
we propose that europe builds up economic ties to latin america that are based on co-operations and the respective countries ' own agenda for development .
this includes banishing poverty by developing domestic markets .
latin america needs debt relief as well as a transfer of technology in order to boost its economic performance . what does the german left party think about the " new latin american left " ? across latin america , we are seeing broad-based movements fighting against the consequences of neo-liberalism .
in many countries , these developments have resulted in victories for the left or progressive , anti-neo liberal forces in parliamentary and presidential elections .
regardless of whether they continue to promote socialist values or are more interested in pushing for greater national independence and sovereignty , what they have in common is a political interest in social change on behalf of marginalized , disadvantaged groups .
as in venezuela , the goal of the various campaigns initiated by the government is to improve life for the country 's poor , create jobs and improve education and health .
latin america 's left-wing governments are backed by various groups .
these include , along with politicians and parties , unions and various social movements as well as independent intellectuals , local entrepreneurs and representatives of the church . who represents this new left ?
bachelet , chavez or evo morales ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chilean president michelle bachelet in terms of society transforming , this process is best embodied by bolivian president evo morales und hugo chavez in venezuela .
but in terms of a new political direction , geared towards greater social equality in latin america and away from neo-liberalism , then the process is spearheaded by figures such as chilean president michelle bachelet and nestor kirchner in argentina .
they all stand for more socially aware policies geared towards a stronger , more interventionist state . which challenges do left-wing organizations in latin america and germany share ? we need to aim for a world based on greater solidarity which leaves our children with a future .
our world and our future are seriously jeopardized by war and impending hunger crises due to ever dwindling food supplies caused by environmental disaster .
we also need to overcome illiteracy , endemic disease , poverty and water shortages .
these are tasks we can only meet if we in europe all pull together and with the developing world . how can the left party help contribute to continued existence of the latin american left ? for the time being we need to learn from them .
the most important developments are happening there , and the left is currently very successful .
the latin american left has been a motivating force for a new left-wing culture and is currently helping to revitalize the socialist option .
we can help by achieving similar success . according to the latest surveys , oskar lafontaine is one of the best-known and most popular politicians in germany .
why is this ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trustworthy or populist ?
oskar lafontaine oskar lafontaine stands for credibility .
he gave up his office and left his party when it turned its back on social democracy in favor of neo-liberalism under gerhard schröder .
he gives voice to people 's fear of unrestrained capitalism - the tidal wave of neo-liberalism and globalization bearing down on them . enrique lopez magallon interviewed wolfgang gehrcke -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german woman has realized there 's a lot to be said for the hair of the dog .
she 's started a business making clothes for customers from the fur of their pet dogs . bearded collies are not the perfect pets for fastidious housekeepers .
throughout the year , they tend to shed their hair on carpets , beds and sofas .
it 's enough to make their owners sick as a dog .
but 50-year-old bettina menkhoff , a primary school teacher who lives in stoetze in the lüneberger heide with four such four-footed friends , decided that all that lovely fur should n't go to waste .
three years ago , she taught herself how to turn it into yarn , and has been making scarves , gloves and other clothes ever since .
her internet business now attracts customers from across the country , all putting a stylish new spin on the proverbial hair shirt .
" it only works when the hair is longer than four centimetres , " she explained .
" i regularly brush my dogs and keep the hair for processing .
it 's warmer than sheep wool . "
as fabric , pet hair appears to be a lot more emotionally charged than anything lagerfeld or lacroix ever work with .
these days , menkhoff can barely keep up with demand .
fortunately , she 's found a new supplier - a local dog salon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one day , he 'll be a scarf " some clients specifically want me to use hair from other animals too , " said menkhoff .
" they dread the day their pet dies and all they 're left with is a scarf hanging in the closet . "

a german woman has realized there 's a lot to be said for the hair of the dog .
she 's started a business making clothes for customers from the fur of their pet dogs . bearded collies are not the perfect pets for fastidious housekeepers .
throughout the year , they tend to shed their hair on carpets , beds and sofas .
it 's enough to make their owners sick as a dog .
but 50-year-old bettina menkhoff , a primary school teacher who lives in stoetze in the lüneberger heide with four such four-footed friends , decided that all that lovely fur should n't go to waste .
three years ago , she taught herself how to turn it into yarn , and has been making scarves , gloves and other clothes ever since .
her internet business now attracts customers from across the country , all putting a stylish new spin on the proverbial hair shirt .
" it only works when the hair is longer than four centimetres , " she explained .
" i regularly brush my dogs and keep the hair for processing .
it 's warmer than sheep wool . "
as fabric , pet hair appears to be a lot more emotionally charged than anything lagerfeld or lacroix ever work with .
these days , menkhoff can barely keep up with demand .
fortunately , she 's found a new supplier - a local dog salon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one day , he 'll be a scarf " some clients specifically want me to use hair from other animals too , " said menkhoff .
" they dread the day their pet dies and all they 're left with is a scarf hanging in the closet . "
for others , meanwhile , it 's precisely this sort of sentimental souvenir that they 're after .

it could be of particular interest to large emerging nations china and india . in a speech during her first visit to japan as german chancellor , angela merkel said thursday both developing and industrialized nations need to agree on specific targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions .
" we have to assume that emerging nations naturally do n't want the same responsibility " as industrialized nations , the chancellor said , speaking at a symposium organized by japan 's nikkei media group in tokyo .
a more palatable pact for emerging nations developing countries such as india and china , experiencing skyrocketing growth rates , are worried that strict environmental regulations will dent their economic boom .
they want industrialized nations , the chief polluters , to bear the brunt of emission cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's rapid economic boom is taking a heavy toll on its environment merkel suggested that as a compromise , developing countries should be allowed to increase their emissions per capita while industrialized nations cut theirs , until both sides reach the same level .
the model is said to be based on a proposal by indian prime minister manmohan singh at the g-8 summit in june in germany .
that conference , hosted by merkel , set a non-binding goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 within the eu .
merkel also underlined the need to forge a successor climate pact to the kyoto protocol which expires at the end of 2012 and which she helped draw up as germany 's environment minister in 1997 .
she however voiced caution about the carbon market , part of the kyoto protocol that allows countries that emit gas beyond their allowance to buy credits from companies or countries below their target levels .
the system also exists for companies in the european union .
" it is a wise , market-oriented measure but we need to be careful as it can go in the wrong direction , " merkel said .
" for example , if a coal factory merely moves from europe to a foreign country because it can sell the carbon credit , that 's meaningless , " she said .
merkel wants us on board merkel said detailed targets needed to be set soon if the world wants to slow global warming .
" the question is , how do we distribute -lrb- reduction targets -rrb- in the world ?
i do n't believe that it 's enough to just agree that everyone will do their best .
i do n't believe that would yield an impressive result , " she said .
time is running out in the fight against global warming , she said , adding that the united states must be part of any global deal to slash carbon dioxide emissions .
" i think america will cooperate - america must cooperate .
if we ca n't find a regulatory regime that is accepted by the usa , then china and india will never agree to reduction targets , " merkel said .
the fight against climate change is the overarching theme of merkel 's visit to japan .
japan is to host the next g8 summit in hokkaido in 2008 .

it could be of particular interest to large emerging nations china and india . in a speech during her first visit to japan as german chancellor , angela merkel said thursday both developing and industrialized nations need to agree on specific targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions .
" we have to assume that emerging nations naturally do n't want the same responsibility " as industrialized nations , the chancellor said , speaking at a symposium organized by japan 's nikkei media group in tokyo .
a more palatable pact for emerging nations developing countries such as india and china , experiencing skyrocketing growth rates , are worried that strict environmental regulations will dent their economic boom .
they want industrialized nations , the chief polluters , to bear the brunt of emission cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's rapid economic boom is taking a heavy toll on its environment merkel suggested that as a compromise , developing countries should be allowed to increase their emissions per capita while industrialized nations cut theirs , until both sides reach the same level .
the model is said to be based on a proposal by indian prime minister manmohan singh at the g-8 summit in june in germany .
that conference , hosted by merkel , set a non-binding goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 within the eu .
merkel also underlined the need to forge a successor climate pact to the kyoto protocol which expires at the end of 2012 and which she helped draw up as germany 's environment minister in 1997 .
she however voiced caution about the carbon market , part of the kyoto protocol that allows countries that emit gas beyond their allowance to buy credits from companies or countries below their target levels .
the system also exists for companies in the european union .
" it is a wise , market-oriented measure but we need to be careful as it can go in the wrong direction , " merkel said .
" for example , if a coal factory merely moves from europe to a foreign country because it can sell the carbon credit , that 's meaningless , " she said .
merkel wants us on board merkel said detailed targets needed to be set soon if the world wants to slow global warming .
" the question is , how do we distribute -lrb- reduction targets -rrb- in the world ?
i do n't believe that it 's enough to just agree that everyone will do their best .
i do n't believe that would yield an impressive result , " she said .
time is running out in the fight against global warming , she said , adding that the united states must be part of any global deal to slash carbon dioxide emissions .
" i think america will cooperate - america must cooperate .
if we ca n't find a regulatory regime that is accepted by the usa , then china and india will never agree to reduction targets , " merkel said .
the fight against climate change is the overarching theme of merkel 's visit to japan .
japan is to host the next g8 summit in hokkaido in 2008 .

" the taliban 's " extortionate demands " appeared to have been met all along the line , he told the berlin radio station rbb . on thursday , the taliban freed the remaining seven south korean aid workers they had been holding .
twelve other hostages were released on wednesday . nachtwei said the outcome was bad for the government of afghan president hamid karzai , " which did not play any part " in the release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the south korean government is also facing criticism at home the south korean government said it had confirmed to the taliban it would withdraw its 200 soldiers from afghanistan by year 's end . the aghan foreign minister rangin dadfar spanta emphasized on thursday that south korea had already made its decision before the missionaries were kidnapped . " it is a very dangerous message when we give the impression that the international community and the afghan government can be blackmailed , " dadfar said on thursday on rbb radio . afghan government bypassed the day before , afghan commerce minister amin farhang had also criticized the south korean government for bypassing the afghan government and dealing directly with the taliban . " this release under these conditions will make our difficulties in afghanistan even bigger , " farhand told german public radio bayerischer rundfunk . " we fear that this decision could become a precedent .
the taliban will continue trying to take hostages to attain their aims in afghanistan . " south korea also said it had promised to send no more " christian missionaries " into the muslim country .
for its part , the taliban dropped their demands for the release of prisoners . speculation is rife that the south korean government paid a ransom for the hostages , a charge denied by both south korean and taliban officials . taliban gains credibility after initial joy at the release of the hostages , the korean newspaper korea times added its voice to the volley of criticism . " even if the taliban did n't manage to assert their demands for a prisoner exchange that they have had direct negotiations with a foreign state on ' their territory ' greatly adds to their political credibility , " the paper said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ambulance transports the dead body of one of two germans kidnapped in afghanistan one german national who was kidnapped around the same time as the south koreans is still being held in afghanistan .
another german national , who was seized with him , was killed while in captivity . the taliban are demanding that germany withdraw its troops from afghanistan in exchange for his release , something which german government refuses to do . german chancellor angela merkel said her government would not change its strategy in light of the release of the korean hostages . " the federal government is trying hard to obtain the release of the hostages we have in afghanistan , " merkel said wednesday during a visit to japan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in japan , german chancellor angela merkel emphasised that germany would n't be blackmailed by the taliban " the situation concerning the south korean hostages will not change in the way we are dealing with it , " she said . the taliban originally kidnapped 23 south koreans as they traveled from kabul to kandahar on july 19 .
in late july , the militants killed two male hostages , and they released two women earlier this month as gesture of goodwill . two men were killed after the expiration of taliban-set deadlines for the afghan authorities to meet their demands , and two female hostages who fell ill were released on aug .

" in the overall interest of the community , " there are grounds to leave the possibility of continuing these anti-dumping measures for up to another year , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger told journalists .
" we have to balance environmental interests with the interest of fair trade , " he added .
" this is a rapid-changing market reality and so some transitional measures were warranted . "
unfair competition the commission introduced the anti-dumping tariffs of up to 66 percent in 2001 after an investigation concluded that competition between eu and chinese manufacturers was unfair .
the duties on the power-saving light bulbs made in china raise prices for european customers by up to two-thirds .
for now , less than 20 percent of power-saving bulbs are made in europe , while over two-thirds are imported from china .
but at the end of july , a majority of the experts gave backing to a proposal from mandelson to let the duties lapse .
afp news service reported that according to mandelson 's spokesman , only one out of four european producers had been keen to retain the trade charges .
german lighting company osram , a subsidiary of siemens , had led calls to renew the duties because they hit dutch rival philips harder than osram , though both companies produce in china .
impeding green progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eco-friendly bulbs will soon be mandatory this week 's decision , which contravenes the eu 's intention to reduce its growing energy bill , has triggered outrage among environmentalists , who feel the brussels ' contradiction is deeply hypocritical .
earlier this year , eu leaders proposed that traditional , but inefficient , incandescent bulbs be phased out across the bloc by 2009 , as one of a series of measures aimed at reducing carbon emissions .
environmentalists argue that the continued duties will restrict european consumers ' access to cheaper , low-energy technology .
" -lrb- this proposal -rrb- is disappointing , unfair and seriously inconsistent with the ambitious eu targets to improve energy efficiency in europe and to curb climate change , " the conservation organization wwf said in a press release , quoted by afp .
" on the one hand , europe has committed to an ambitious energy efficiency objective , and on the other hand it continues to impose taxes on imports of green products , " the group 's trade and investment specialist eivind hoff said .
retailer resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osram wanted the charges to stay in place further resistance is expected to come from retailers , who may well see it as a means of protecting major eu producers .
" the commission needs to put the environment before the narrow self-interests of a minority of member countries and scrap import duties on chinese bulbs , " the head of the british retail consortium , kevin hawkins , told the independent newspaper .
according to afp , the conservative british eu lawmaker syed kamall described the decision as " farcical and indefensible . "
" the light bulb industry wants the duties scrapped , consumers want them scrapped and common sense says they should be scrapped ; yet the european commission has once again bowed to protectionist pressures , " he said .

one of the so-called " response modules " already identified as a key need is a forest fire-fighting unit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been a series of disasters this summer " the costs of not doing enough in a coordinated way far outweigh the costs of doing it ... in a coordinated , better way , " said helfferich . the european commission has been coordinating the response to the greek forest fires through its brussels-based monitoring and information centre -lrb- mic -rrb- . last friday , greece asked its european partners to provide water-bombing aircraft to help fight the fires which have been affecting the country since the beginning of the summer but have dramatically increased in intensity in the past six days . massive coordination effort the mic co-ordination of the greece crisis is , according to helfferich , its " biggest effort ever " since the center was set up in 2001 .
nine member states responded to greece 's calls for help . the commission on wednesday confirmed that greece intends to ask for financial support from the eu 's solidarity fund in the wake of the forest fires .
it can take up to eight months , however , for the funds to be released , a spokesperson said . the solidarity fund was established in 2002 to support eu members who have suffered from natural disasters .
a country can ask for its help when the damage from a disaster exceeds 0.6 per cent of gross national income , or 1.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.45 billion -rrb- in the case of greece . thousands of people rushed to banks to claim a 3,000 euro initial greek government compensation handout . fires easing meanwhile , greek firefighters indicated that the battle against the fires was being won . " at the moment no populated areas are under threat , " fire service spokesman nikos diamantis said at a press conference on wednesday , adding that while the fires had eased somewhat , it was still too early for the all-clear to be issued . bildunterschrift : eu states have sent aircraft and firefights to help fires were still burning in 29 regions on the peloponnese peninsula and the island of euboea , compared to 36 the previous day , but better weather has helped crews stop the fires from spreading rapidly through parched forests some 110 villages are estimated to have been wholly or partially burnt .
the flames have also destroyed 4.5 million olive trees , and 60,000 sheep and goats have died . there has been widespread criticism of the greek government 's handling of the fires , which many believe were started by arsonists on behalf of property developers . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 30.08.2007 german left party touches base with latin american comrades großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can germany 's left party learn from latin american countries , including cuba ?
left party leader oskar lafontaine is in cuba this week for a three-day visit .
dw-world.de talked to the party 's foreign policy spokesman wolfgang gehrcke about the new latin american left . dw-world.de : what was the political significance of this visit ?
was lafontaine effectively saying goodbye to fidel castro ? wolfgang gehrcke : first and foremost , lafontaine is keen to see how the country is evolving , to explore its potential for further development and the current state of the european-cuban relationship .
germany 's position on the eu 's restrictive policy towards cuba is not a constructive one .
unfortunately , berlin has not taken sides with the spanish and italian governments who want to see the eu lift sanctions against cuba .
oskar lafontaine is visiting a number of initiatives providing humanitarian aid in the country , such as supplying children with milk everyday .
the visit to cuba is oskar lafontaine 's first port of call on his tour of latin america 's new , left-wing governments .
as far as i am aware , fidel castro is in good health and there is no reason to say goodbye to him . as the left party 's foreign policy spokesman , what do you think of the german government 's stance on latin america ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : change has swept venezuela berlin 's policies towards latin america are based on positions that range from indifference to outright hostility towards south america 's recent shift to the left .
the government is of the opinion that germany has few interests in latin america outside of sao paulo , brazil 's economic center , and mexico .
it 's happy to leave the continent to the us .
broadly speaking , the government shares washington 's political aims there , which define neo-liberalism as the only viable option for economic development .
but neo-liberalism has failed in latin america , leaving a trail of destruction within the continent 's social structures .
this form of dogma has made only the very few wealthy while the majority of the population as well as parts of the middle classes have become poorer .
no one in latin america still believes that neo-liberalism and globalization can deliver wealth for all .
in a number of countries , democratic votes have resulted in the election of various forms of left-wing alternatives to neo-liberalism .
europe should be joining forces with latin america to develop cooperation 's that prioritize public political interests on both continents , and push for a better world .
we propose that europe builds up economic ties to latin america that are based on co-operations and the respective countries ' own agenda for development .
this includes banishing poverty by developing domestic markets .
latin america needs debt relief as well as a transfer of technology in order to boost its economic performance . what does the german left party think about the " new latin american left " ? across latin america , we are seeing broad-based movements fighting against the consequences of neo-liberalism .
in many countries , these developments have resulted in victories for the left or progressive , anti-neo liberal forces in parliamentary and presidential elections .
regardless of whether they continue to promote socialist values or are more interested in pushing for greater national independence and sovereignty , what they have in common is a political interest in social change on behalf of marginalized , disadvantaged groups .
as in venezuela , the goal of the various campaigns initiated by the government is to improve life for the country 's poor , create jobs and improve education and health .
latin america 's left-wing governments are backed by various groups .
these include , along with politicians and parties , unions and various social movements as well as independent intellectuals , local entrepreneurs and representatives of the church . who represents this new left ?
bachelet , chavez or evo morales ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chilean president michelle bachelet in terms of society transforming , this process is best embodied by bolivian president evo morales und hugo chavez in venezuela .
but in terms of a new political direction , geared towards greater social equality in latin america and away from neo-liberalism , then the process is spearheaded by figures such as chilean president michelle bachelet and nestor kirchner in argentina .
they all stand for more socially aware policies geared towards a stronger , more interventionist state . which challenges do left-wing organizations in latin america and germany share ? we need to aim for a world based on greater solidarity which leaves our children with a future .
our world and our future are seriously jeopardized by war and impending hunger crises due to ever dwindling food supplies caused by environmental disaster .
we also need to overcome illiteracy , endemic disease , poverty and water shortages .
these are tasks we can only meet if we in europe all pull together and with the developing world . how can the left party help contribute to continued existence of the latin american left ? for the time being we need to learn from them .
the most important developments are happening there , and the left is currently very successful .
the latin american left has been a motivating force for a new left-wing culture and is currently helping to revitalize the socialist option .
we can help by achieving similar success . according to the latest surveys , oskar lafontaine is one of the best-known and most popular politicians in germany .
why is this ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trustworthy or populist ?
oskar lafontaine oskar lafontaine stands for credibility .
he gave up his office and left his party when it turned its back on social democracy in favor of neo-liberalism under gerhard schröder .
he gives voice to people 's fear of unrestrained capitalism - the tidal wave of neo-liberalism and globalization bearing down on them . enrique lopez magallon interviewed wolfgang gehrcke -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it could be of particular interest to large emerging nations china and india . in a speech during her first visit to japan as german chancellor , angela merkel said thursday both developing and industrialized nations need to agree on specific targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions .
" we have to assume that emerging nations naturally do n't want the same responsibility " as industrialized nations , the chancellor said , speaking at a symposium organized by japan 's nikkei media group in tokyo .
a more palatable pact for emerging nations developing countries such as india and china , experiencing skyrocketing growth rates , are worried that strict environmental regulations will dent their economic boom .
they want industrialized nations , the chief polluters , to bear the brunt of emission cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's rapid economic boom is taking a heavy toll on its environment merkel suggested that as a compromise , developing countries should be allowed to increase their emissions per capita while industrialized nations cut theirs , until both sides reach the same level .
the model is said to be based on a proposal by indian prime minister manmohan singh at the g-8 summit in june in germany .
that conference , hosted by merkel , set a non-binding goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 within the eu .
merkel also underlined the need to forge a successor climate pact to the kyoto protocol which expires at the end of 2012 and which she helped draw up as germany 's environment minister in 1997 .
she however voiced caution about the carbon market , part of the kyoto protocol that allows countries that emit gas beyond their allowance to buy credits from companies or countries below their target levels .
the system also exists for companies in the european union .
" it is a wise , market-oriented measure but we need to be careful as it can go in the wrong direction , " merkel said .
" for example , if a coal factory merely moves from europe to a foreign country because it can sell the carbon credit , that 's meaningless , " she said .
merkel wants us on board merkel said detailed targets needed to be set soon if the world wants to slow global warming .
" the question is , how do we distribute -lrb- reduction targets -rrb- in the world ?
i do n't believe that it 's enough to just agree that everyone will do their best .
i do n't believe that would yield an impressive result , " she said .
time is running out in the fight against global warming , she said , adding that the united states must be part of any global deal to slash carbon dioxide emissions .
" i think america will cooperate - america must cooperate .
if we ca n't find a regulatory regime that is accepted by the usa , then china and india will never agree to reduction targets , " merkel said .
the fight against climate change is the overarching theme of merkel 's visit to japan .
japan is to host the next g8 summit in hokkaido in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look no ties !
merkel with abe honoring japan 's " cool biz " campaign on wednesday , merkel and japanese prime minister shinzo abe went into talks to map out ways to work with major polluters to achieve goals for greenhouse gas reductions by pointing out that no one in their delegations was wearing a tie , in honor of japan 's " cool biz " campaign to dress lighter in summer and reduce air conditioning use .
japanese opposition skeptical of afghanistan mission separately , merkel ruffled feathers among japan 's opposition on thursday by urging the country to maintain its support for the " war on terror " in afghanistan .
" you do n't have to follow the unilateral opinion of the united states , " main opposition leader ichiro ozawa told merkel in a meeting , as quoted by tsuyoshi yamaguchi , the opposition 's shadow foreign minister .
germany is heavily involved in afghanistan , where it has contributed some 3,000 troops to the nato-led international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and has six tornado reconnaissance planes helping to spot taliban hideouts . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german embassy has " already received several enquiries about the location of so-called no-go areas for foreign visitors to germany , " kauder told german daily rheinischen post .

a german woman has realized there 's a lot to be said for the hair of the dog .
she 's started a business making clothes for customers from the fur of their pet dogs . bearded collies are not the perfect pets for fastidious housekeepers .

it 's enough to make their owners sick as a dog .
but 50-year-old bettina menkhoff , a primary school teacher who lives in stoetze in the lüneberger heide with four such four-footed friends , decided that all that lovely fur should n't go to waste .
three years ago , she taught herself how to turn it into yarn , and has been making scarves , gloves and other clothes ever since .
her internet business now attracts customers from across the country , all putting a stylish new spin on the proverbial hair shirt .
" it only works when the hair is longer than four centimetres , " she explained .
" i regularly brush my dogs and keep the hair for processing .
it 's warmer than sheep wool . "

left party leader oskar lafontaine is in cuba this week for a three-day visit .
dw-world.de talked to the party 's foreign policy spokesman wolfgang gehrcke about the new latin american left . dw-world.de : what was the political significance of this visit ?
was lafontaine effectively saying goodbye to fidel castro ? wolfgang gehrcke : first and foremost , lafontaine is keen to see how the country is evolving , to explore its potential for further development and the current state of the european-cuban relationship .
germany 's position on the eu 's restrictive policy towards cuba is not a constructive one .
unfortunately , berlin has not taken sides with the spanish and italian governments who want to see the eu lift sanctions against cuba .
oskar lafontaine is visiting a number of initiatives providing humanitarian aid in the country , such as supplying children with milk everyday .
the visit to cuba is oskar lafontaine 's first port of call on his tour of latin america 's new , left-wing governments .
as far as i am aware , fidel castro is in good health and there is no reason to say goodbye to him . as the left party 's foreign policy spokesman , what do you think of the german government 's stance on latin america ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : change has swept venezuela berlin 's policies towards latin america are based on positions that range from indifference to outright hostility towards south america 's recent shift to the left .
the government is of the opinion that germany has few interests in latin america outside of sao paulo , brazil 's economic center , and mexico .
it 's happy to leave the continent to the us .
broadly speaking , the government shares washington 's political aims there , which define neo-liberalism as the only viable option for economic development .
but neo-liberalism has failed in latin america , leaving a trail of destruction within the continent 's social structures .
this form of dogma has made only the very few wealthy while the majority of the population as well as parts of the middle classes have become poorer .
no one in latin america still believes that neo-liberalism and globalization can deliver wealth for all .
in a number of countries , democratic votes have resulted in the election of various forms of left-wing alternatives to neo-liberalism .
europe should be joining forces with latin america to develop cooperation 's that prioritize public political interests on both continents , and push for a better world .
we propose that europe builds up economic ties to latin america that are based on co-operations and the respective countries ' own agenda for development .
this includes banishing poverty by developing domestic markets .
latin america needs debt relief as well as a transfer of technology in order to boost its economic performance . what does the german left party think about the " new latin american left " ? across latin america , we are seeing broad-based movements fighting against the consequences of neo-liberalism .
in many countries , these developments have resulted in victories for the left or progressive , anti-neo liberal forces in parliamentary and presidential elections .
regardless of whether they continue to promote socialist values or are more interested in pushing for greater national independence and sovereignty , what they have in common is a political interest in social change on behalf of marginalized , disadvantaged groups .
as in venezuela , the goal of the various campaigns initiated by the government is to improve life for the country 's poor , create jobs and improve education and health .
latin america 's left-wing governments are backed by various groups .
these include , along with politicians and parties , unions and various social movements as well as independent intellectuals , local entrepreneurs and representatives of the church . who represents this new left ?

but in terms of a new political direction , geared towards greater social equality in latin america and away from neo-liberalism , then the process is spearheaded by figures such as chilean president michelle bachelet and nestor kirchner in argentina .
they all stand for more socially aware policies geared towards a stronger , more interventionist state . which challenges do left-wing organizations in latin america and germany share ? we need to aim for a world based on greater solidarity which leaves our children with a future .
our world and our future are seriously jeopardized by war and impending hunger crises due to ever dwindling food supplies caused by environmental disaster .
we also need to overcome illiteracy , endemic disease , poverty and water shortages .
these are tasks we can only meet if we in europe all pull together and with the developing world . how can the left party help contribute to continued existence of the latin american left ? for the time being we need to learn from them .
the most important developments are happening there , and the left is currently very successful .
the latin american left has been a motivating force for a new left-wing culture and is currently helping to revitalize the socialist option .

but 50-year-old bettina menkhoff , a primary school teacher who lives in stoetze in the lüneberger heide with four such four-footed friends , decided that all that lovely fur should n't go to waste .
three years ago , she taught herself how to turn it into yarn , and has been making scarves , gloves and other clothes ever since .
her internet business now attracts customers from across the country , all putting a stylish new spin on the proverbial hair shirt .
" it only works when the hair is longer than four centimetres , " she explained .
" i regularly brush my dogs and keep the hair for processing .
it 's warmer than sheep wool . "
as fabric , pet hair appears to be a lot more emotionally charged than anything lagerfeld or lacroix ever work with .
these days , menkhoff can barely keep up with demand .
fortunately , she 's found a new supplier - a local dog salon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one day , he 'll be a scarf " some clients specifically want me to use hair from other animals too , " said menkhoff .
" they dread the day their pet dies and all they 're left with is a scarf hanging in the closet . "
for others , meanwhile , it 's precisely this sort of sentimental souvenir that they 're after .
but if business continues to boom , they 'll be more people than ever having bad hair days . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it could be of particular interest to large emerging nations china and india . in a speech during her first visit to japan as german chancellor , angela merkel said thursday both developing and industrialized nations need to agree on specific targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions .
" we have to assume that emerging nations naturally do n't want the same responsibility " as industrialized nations , the chancellor said , speaking at a symposium organized by japan 's nikkei media group in tokyo .
a more palatable pact for emerging nations developing countries such as india and china , experiencing skyrocketing growth rates , are worried that strict environmental regulations will dent their economic boom .
they want industrialized nations , the chief polluters , to bear the brunt of emission cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's rapid economic boom is taking a heavy toll on its environment merkel suggested that as a compromise , developing countries should be allowed to increase their emissions per capita while industrialized nations cut theirs , until both sides reach the same level .
the model is said to be based on a proposal by indian prime minister manmohan singh at the g-8 summit in june in germany .
that conference , hosted by merkel , set a non-binding goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 within the eu .
merkel also underlined the need to forge a successor climate pact to the kyoto protocol which expires at the end of 2012 and which she helped draw up as germany 's environment minister in 1997 .
she however voiced caution about the carbon market , part of the kyoto protocol that allows countries that emit gas beyond their allowance to buy credits from companies or countries below their target levels .
the system also exists for companies in the european union .
" it is a wise , market-oriented measure but we need to be careful as it can go in the wrong direction , " merkel said .
" for example , if a coal factory merely moves from europe to a foreign country because it can sell the carbon credit , that 's meaningless , " she said .
merkel wants us on board merkel said detailed targets needed to be set soon if the world wants to slow global warming .
" the question is , how do we distribute -lrb- reduction targets -rrb- in the world ?
i do n't believe that it 's enough to just agree that everyone will do their best .
i do n't believe that would yield an impressive result , " she said .
time is running out in the fight against global warming , she said , adding that the united states must be part of any global deal to slash carbon dioxide emissions .
" i think america will cooperate - america must cooperate .
if we ca n't find a regulatory regime that is accepted by the usa , then china and india will never agree to reduction targets , " merkel said .
the fight against climate change is the overarching theme of merkel 's visit to japan .
japan is to host the next g8 summit in hokkaido in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look no ties !
merkel with abe honoring japan 's " cool biz " campaign on wednesday , merkel and japanese prime minister shinzo abe went into talks to map out ways to work with major polluters to achieve goals for greenhouse gas reductions by pointing out that no one in their delegations was wearing a tie , in honor of japan 's " cool biz " campaign to dress lighter in summer and reduce air conditioning use .
japanese opposition skeptical of afghanistan mission separately , merkel ruffled feathers among japan 's opposition on thursday by urging the country to maintain its support for the " war on terror " in afghanistan .
" you do n't have to follow the unilateral opinion of the united states , " main opposition leader ichiro ozawa told merkel in a meeting , as quoted by tsuyoshi yamaguchi , the opposition 's shadow foreign minister .
germany is heavily involved in afghanistan , where it has contributed some 3,000 troops to the nato-led international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and has six tornado reconnaissance planes helping to spot taliban hideouts . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in the overall interest of the community , " there are grounds to leave the possibility of continuing these anti-dumping measures for up to another year , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger told journalists .
" we have to balance environmental interests with the interest of fair trade , " he added .
" this is a rapid-changing market reality and so some transitional measures were warranted . "
unfair competition the commission introduced the anti-dumping tariffs of up to 66 percent in 2001 after an investigation concluded that competition between eu and chinese manufacturers was unfair .
the duties on the power-saving light bulbs made in china raise prices for european customers by up to two-thirds .
for now , less than 20 percent of power-saving bulbs are made in europe , while over two-thirds are imported from china .
but at the end of july , a majority of the experts gave backing to a proposal from mandelson to let the duties lapse .
afp news service reported that according to mandelson 's spokesman , only one out of four european producers had been keen to retain the trade charges .
german lighting company osram , a subsidiary of siemens , had led calls to renew the duties because they hit dutch rival philips harder than osram , though both companies produce in china .
impeding green progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eco-friendly bulbs will soon be mandatory this week 's decision , which contravenes the eu 's intention to reduce its growing energy bill , has triggered outrage among environmentalists , who feel the brussels ' contradiction is deeply hypocritical .
earlier this year , eu leaders proposed that traditional , but inefficient , incandescent bulbs be phased out across the bloc by 2009 , as one of a series of measures aimed at reducing carbon emissions .
environmentalists argue that the continued duties will restrict european consumers ' access to cheaper , low-energy technology .
" -lrb- this proposal -rrb- is disappointing , unfair and seriously inconsistent with the ambitious eu targets to improve energy efficiency in europe and to curb climate change , " the conservation organization wwf said in a press release , quoted by afp .
" on the one hand , europe has committed to an ambitious energy efficiency objective , and on the other hand it continues to impose taxes on imports of green products , " the group 's trade and investment specialist eivind hoff said .
retailer resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osram wanted the charges to stay in place further resistance is expected to come from retailers , who may well see it as a means of protecting major eu producers .
" the commission needs to put the environment before the narrow self-interests of a minority of member countries and scrap import duties on chinese bulbs , " the head of the british retail consortium , kevin hawkins , told the independent newspaper .
according to afp , the conservative british eu lawmaker syed kamall described the decision as " farcical and indefensible . "
" the light bulb industry wants the duties scrapped , consumers want them scrapped and common sense says they should be scrapped ; yet the european commission has once again bowed to protectionist pressures , " he said .

" in the overall interest of the community , " there are grounds to leave the possibility of continuing these anti-dumping measures for up to another year , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger told journalists .
" we have to balance environmental interests with the interest of fair trade , " he added .
" this is a rapid-changing market reality and so some transitional measures were warranted . "
unfair competition the commission introduced the anti-dumping tariffs of up to 66 percent in 2001 after an investigation concluded that competition between eu and chinese manufacturers was unfair .
the duties on the power-saving light bulbs made in china raise prices for european customers by up to two-thirds .
for now , less than 20 percent of power-saving bulbs are made in europe , while over two-thirds are imported from china .
but at the end of july , a majority of the experts gave backing to a proposal from mandelson to let the duties lapse .
afp news service reported that according to mandelson 's spokesman , only one out of four european producers had been keen to retain the trade charges .
german lighting company osram , a subsidiary of siemens , had led calls to renew the duties because they hit dutch rival philips harder than osram , though both companies produce in china .
impeding green progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eco-friendly bulbs will soon be mandatory this week 's decision , which contravenes the eu 's intention to reduce its growing energy bill , has triggered outrage among environmentalists , who feel the brussels ' contradiction is deeply hypocritical .
earlier this year , eu leaders proposed that traditional , but inefficient , incandescent bulbs be phased out across the bloc by 2009 , as one of a series of measures aimed at reducing carbon emissions .
environmentalists argue that the continued duties will restrict european consumers ' access to cheaper , low-energy technology .
" -lrb- this proposal -rrb- is disappointing , unfair and seriously inconsistent with the ambitious eu targets to improve energy efficiency in europe and to curb climate change , " the conservation organization wwf said in a press release , quoted by afp .
" on the one hand , europe has committed to an ambitious energy efficiency objective , and on the other hand it continues to impose taxes on imports of green products , " the group 's trade and investment specialist eivind hoff said .
retailer resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osram wanted the charges to stay in place further resistance is expected to come from retailers , who may well see it as a means of protecting major eu producers .
" the commission needs to put the environment before the narrow self-interests of a minority of member countries and scrap import duties on chinese bulbs , " the head of the british retail consortium , kevin hawkins , told the independent newspaper .
according to afp , the conservative british eu lawmaker syed kamall described the decision as " farcical and indefensible . "

a german woman has realized there 's a lot to be said for the hair of the dog .
she 's started a business making clothes for customers from the fur of their pet dogs . bearded collies are not the perfect pets for fastidious housekeepers .
throughout the year , they tend to shed their hair on carpets , beds and sofas .
it 's enough to make their owners sick as a dog .
but 50-year-old bettina menkhoff , a primary school teacher who lives in stoetze in the lüneberger heide with four such four-footed friends , decided that all that lovely fur should n't go to waste .
three years ago , she taught herself how to turn it into yarn , and has been making scarves , gloves and other clothes ever since .
her internet business now attracts customers from across the country , all putting a stylish new spin on the proverbial hair shirt .
" it only works when the hair is longer than four centimetres , " she explained .
" i regularly brush my dogs and keep the hair for processing .
it 's warmer than sheep wool . "
as fabric , pet hair appears to be a lot more emotionally charged than anything lagerfeld or lacroix ever work with .
these days , menkhoff can barely keep up with demand .
fortunately , she 's found a new supplier - a local dog salon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one day , he 'll be a scarf " some clients specifically want me to use hair from other animals too , " said menkhoff .
" they dread the day their pet dies and all they 're left with is a scarf hanging in the closet . "
for others , meanwhile , it 's precisely this sort of sentimental souvenir that they 're after .
but if business continues to boom , they 'll be more people than ever having bad hair days . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german embassy has " already received several enquiries about the location of so-called no-go areas for foreign visitors to germany , " kauder told german daily rheinischen post .
kauder , who is parliamentary leader of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , admitted that all indians who had anything to do either economically or politically with germany had taken note of the incident in eastern germany .
" even the reactions in germany -lrb- to the incident -rrb- are being carefully followed -lrb- in india -rrb- , " kauder said .
the politician pointed out that indians , however , are making an effort not to play up the incident .
" the indians recognize that these events in mügeln are not the rule in germany , " he said , adding that chancellor merkel 's condemnation of the attacks had done much to calm the situation .
a hate crime ?
the incident took place ten days ago during a village festival in the eastern german state of saxony .
a german mob of over 50 people chased and attacked a group of eight indians who took refuge in a pizzeria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer patrols the area near the pizzeria owned by a pakistani the frenzied mob broke down the door and assaulted the indians .
police forces eventually arrived on the scene , but it took a while for the large squad of 70 police officers to force back the crowd .
the attack left 14 people wounded , including four of the attackers , two police officers and the eight indians , some of whom were beaten so badly they needed medical attention .
according to saxony 's state prosecutor , 82 witnesses have so far been interviewed in connection with the attack .
the police confirmed on tuesday that they are investigating seven suspects . state police chief , bernd merbitz , told the associated press that the actions had not been committed by a particular extreme-right group .
nonetheless , he said , the chanting of slogans such as " foreigners out ! " and " germany for germans " constituted a xenophobic criminal offence .
heated debate in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quiet town of mügeln was turned into a riot-zone the incident has triggered outrage in germany after photos of the bruised and wounded indians were splashed on the front pages of all major media in the country .
the attack has also prompted a heated debate about the need to counter racism and xenophobia , which statistics show is more widespread in former communist east germany .
it has also led to renewed calls by some politicians to ban the far-right , anti-immigrant npd party which is represented in two state parliaments in eastern germany . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it could be of particular interest to large emerging nations china and india . in a speech during her first visit to japan as german chancellor , angela merkel said thursday both developing and industrialized nations need to agree on specific targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions .
" we have to assume that emerging nations naturally do n't want the same responsibility " as industrialized nations , the chancellor said , speaking at a symposium organized by japan 's nikkei media group in tokyo .
a more palatable pact for emerging nations developing countries such as india and china , experiencing skyrocketing growth rates , are worried that strict environmental regulations will dent their economic boom .
they want industrialized nations , the chief polluters , to bear the brunt of emission cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's rapid economic boom is taking a heavy toll on its environment merkel suggested that as a compromise , developing countries should be allowed to increase their emissions per capita while industrialized nations cut theirs , until both sides reach the same level .
the model is said to be based on a proposal by indian prime minister manmohan singh at the g-8 summit in june in germany .
that conference , hosted by merkel , set a non-binding goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 within the eu .
merkel also underlined the need to forge a successor climate pact to the kyoto protocol which expires at the end of 2012 and which she helped draw up as germany 's environment minister in 1997 .
she however voiced caution about the carbon market , part of the kyoto protocol that allows countries that emit gas beyond their allowance to buy credits from companies or countries below their target levels .
the system also exists for companies in the european union .
" it is a wise , market-oriented measure but we need to be careful as it can go in the wrong direction , " merkel said .
" for example , if a coal factory merely moves from europe to a foreign country because it can sell the carbon credit , that 's meaningless , " she said .
merkel wants us on board merkel said detailed targets needed to be set soon if the world wants to slow global warming .
" the question is , how do we distribute -lrb- reduction targets -rrb- in the world ?
i do n't believe that it 's enough to just agree that everyone will do their best .
i do n't believe that would yield an impressive result , " she said .
time is running out in the fight against global warming , she said , adding that the united states must be part of any global deal to slash carbon dioxide emissions .
" i think america will cooperate - america must cooperate .
if we ca n't find a regulatory regime that is accepted by the usa , then china and india will never agree to reduction targets , " merkel said .
the fight against climate change is the overarching theme of merkel 's visit to japan .
japan is to host the next g8 summit in hokkaido in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look no ties !
merkel with abe honoring japan 's " cool biz " campaign on wednesday , merkel and japanese prime minister shinzo abe went into talks to map out ways to work with major polluters to achieve goals for greenhouse gas reductions by pointing out that no one in their delegations was wearing a tie , in honor of japan 's " cool biz " campaign to dress lighter in summer and reduce air conditioning use .
japanese opposition skeptical of afghanistan mission separately , merkel ruffled feathers among japan 's opposition on thursday by urging the country to maintain its support for the " war on terror " in afghanistan .
" you do n't have to follow the unilateral opinion of the united states , " main opposition leader ichiro ozawa told merkel in a meeting , as quoted by tsuyoshi yamaguchi , the opposition 's shadow foreign minister .
germany is heavily involved in afghanistan , where it has contributed some 3,000 troops to the nato-led international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and has six tornado reconnaissance planes helping to spot taliban hideouts . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german woman has realized there 's a lot to be said for the hair of the dog .
she 's started a business making clothes for customers from the fur of their pet dogs . bearded collies are not the perfect pets for fastidious housekeepers .
throughout the year , they tend to shed their hair on carpets , beds and sofas .
it 's enough to make their owners sick as a dog .
but 50-year-old bettina menkhoff , a primary school teacher who lives in stoetze in the lüneberger heide with four such four-footed friends , decided that all that lovely fur should n't go to waste .
three years ago , she taught herself how to turn it into yarn , and has been making scarves , gloves and other clothes ever since .
her internet business now attracts customers from across the country , all putting a stylish new spin on the proverbial hair shirt .
" it only works when the hair is longer than four centimetres , " she explained .
" i regularly brush my dogs and keep the hair for processing .
it 's warmer than sheep wool . "
as fabric , pet hair appears to be a lot more emotionally charged than anything lagerfeld or lacroix ever work with .
these days , menkhoff can barely keep up with demand .
fortunately , she 's found a new supplier - a local dog salon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one day , he 'll be a scarf " some clients specifically want me to use hair from other animals too , " said menkhoff .
" they dread the day their pet dies and all they 're left with is a scarf hanging in the closet . "
for others , meanwhile , it 's precisely this sort of sentimental souvenir that they 're after .
but if business continues to boom , they 'll be more people than ever having bad hair days . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 30.08.2007 merkel proposes new blueprint to fight global warming großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , here on a recent visit to greenland , is serious about combating global warming german chancellor merkel 's proposed new plan to curb climate change foresees linking caps on co2 emissions to the population of a country .
it could be of particular interest to large emerging nations china and india . in a speech during her first visit to japan as german chancellor , angela merkel said thursday both developing and industrialized nations need to agree on specific targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions .
" we have to assume that emerging nations naturally do n't want the same responsibility " as industrialized nations , the chancellor said , speaking at a symposium organized by japan 's nikkei media group in tokyo .
a more palatable pact for emerging nations developing countries such as india and china , experiencing skyrocketing growth rates , are worried that strict environmental regulations will dent their economic boom .
they want industrialized nations , the chief polluters , to bear the brunt of emission cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's rapid economic boom is taking a heavy toll on its environment merkel suggested that as a compromise , developing countries should be allowed to increase their emissions per capita while industrialized nations cut theirs , until both sides reach the same level .
the model is said to be based on a proposal by indian prime minister manmohan singh at the g-8 summit in june in germany .
that conference , hosted by merkel , set a non-binding goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 within the eu .
merkel also underlined the need to forge a successor climate pact to the kyoto protocol which expires at the end of 2012 and which she helped draw up as germany 's environment minister in 1997 .
she however voiced caution about the carbon market , part of the kyoto protocol that allows countries that emit gas beyond their allowance to buy credits from companies or countries below their target levels .
the system also exists for companies in the european union .
" it is a wise , market-oriented measure but we need to be careful as it can go in the wrong direction , " merkel said .
" for example , if a coal factory merely moves from europe to a foreign country because it can sell the carbon credit , that 's meaningless , " she said .
merkel wants us on board merkel said detailed targets needed to be set soon if the world wants to slow global warming .
" the question is , how do we distribute -lrb- reduction targets -rrb- in the world ?
i do n't believe that it 's enough to just agree that everyone will do their best .
i do n't believe that would yield an impressive result , " she said .
time is running out in the fight against global warming , she said , adding that the united states must be part of any global deal to slash carbon dioxide emissions .
" i think america will cooperate - america must cooperate .
if we ca n't find a regulatory regime that is accepted by the usa , then china and india will never agree to reduction targets , " merkel said .
the fight against climate change is the overarching theme of merkel 's visit to japan .
japan is to host the next g8 summit in hokkaido in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look no ties !
merkel with abe honoring japan 's " cool biz " campaign on wednesday , merkel and japanese prime minister shinzo abe went into talks to map out ways to work with major polluters to achieve goals for greenhouse gas reductions by pointing out that no one in their delegations was wearing a tie , in honor of japan 's " cool biz " campaign to dress lighter in summer and reduce air conditioning use .
japanese opposition skeptical of afghanistan mission separately , merkel ruffled feathers among japan 's opposition on thursday by urging the country to maintain its support for the " war on terror " in afghanistan .
" you do n't have to follow the unilateral opinion of the united states , " main opposition leader ichiro ozawa told merkel in a meeting , as quoted by tsuyoshi yamaguchi , the opposition 's shadow foreign minister .
germany is heavily involved in afghanistan , where it has contributed some 3,000 troops to the nato-led international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and has six tornado reconnaissance planes helping to spot taliban hideouts . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the taliban 's " extortionate demands " appeared to have been met all along the line , he told the berlin radio station rbb . on thursday , the taliban freed the remaining seven south korean aid workers they had been holding .
twelve other hostages were released on wednesday . nachtwei said the outcome was bad for the government of afghan president hamid karzai , " which did not play any part " in the release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the south korean government is also facing criticism at home the south korean government said it had confirmed to the taliban it would withdraw its 200 soldiers from afghanistan by year 's end . the aghan foreign minister rangin dadfar spanta emphasized on thursday that south korea had already made its decision before the missionaries were kidnapped . " it is a very dangerous message when we give the impression that the international community and the afghan government can be blackmailed , " dadfar said on thursday on rbb radio . afghan government bypassed the day before , afghan commerce minister amin farhang had also criticized the south korean government for bypassing the afghan government and dealing directly with the taliban . " this release under these conditions will make our difficulties in afghanistan even bigger , " farhand told german public radio bayerischer rundfunk . " we fear that this decision could become a precedent .
the taliban will continue trying to take hostages to attain their aims in afghanistan . " south korea also said it had promised to send no more " christian missionaries " into the muslim country .
for its part , the taliban dropped their demands for the release of prisoners . speculation is rife that the south korean government paid a ransom for the hostages , a charge denied by both south korean and taliban officials . taliban gains credibility after initial joy at the release of the hostages , the korean newspaper korea times added its voice to the volley of criticism . " even if the taliban did n't manage to assert their demands for a prisoner exchange that they have had direct negotiations with a foreign state on ' their territory ' greatly adds to their political credibility , " the paper said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ambulance transports the dead body of one of two germans kidnapped in afghanistan one german national who was kidnapped around the same time as the south koreans is still being held in afghanistan .
another german national , who was seized with him , was killed while in captivity . the taliban are demanding that germany withdraw its troops from afghanistan in exchange for his release , something which german government refuses to do . german chancellor angela merkel said her government would not change its strategy in light of the release of the korean hostages . " the federal government is trying hard to obtain the release of the hostages we have in afghanistan , " merkel said wednesday during a visit to japan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in japan , german chancellor angela merkel emphasised that germany would n't be blackmailed by the taliban " the situation concerning the south korean hostages will not change in the way we are dealing with it , " she said . the taliban originally kidnapped 23 south koreans as they traveled from kabul to kandahar on july 19 .
in late july , the militants killed two male hostages , and they released two women earlier this month as gesture of goodwill . two men were killed after the expiration of taliban-set deadlines for the afghan authorities to meet their demands , and two female hostages who fell ill were released on aug .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 30.08.2007 brussels to retain tariffs on low energy light bulbs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say brussels still has n't seen the light environmentalists are unhappy with a european commission proposal to maintain long-running charges that raise the price on imported low-energy light bulbs from china . despite trade commissioner peter mandelson 's push to let the six-year-old duties lapse when they expire in mid october , eu commissioners caved in to calls from european industry and agreed wednesday that the anti-dumping measures initiated in 2001 should be extended for another year .
" in the overall interest of the community , " there are grounds to leave the possibility of continuing these anti-dumping measures for up to another year , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger told journalists .
" we have to balance environmental interests with the interest of fair trade , " he added .
" this is a rapid-changing market reality and so some transitional measures were warranted . "
unfair competition the commission introduced the anti-dumping tariffs of up to 66 percent in 2001 after an investigation concluded that competition between eu and chinese manufacturers was unfair .
the duties on the power-saving light bulbs made in china raise prices for european customers by up to two-thirds .
for now , less than 20 percent of power-saving bulbs are made in europe , while over two-thirds are imported from china .
but at the end of july , a majority of the experts gave backing to a proposal from mandelson to let the duties lapse .
afp news service reported that according to mandelson 's spokesman , only one out of four european producers had been keen to retain the trade charges .
german lighting company osram , a subsidiary of siemens , had led calls to renew the duties because they hit dutch rival philips harder than osram , though both companies produce in china .
impeding green progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eco-friendly bulbs will soon be mandatory this week 's decision , which contravenes the eu 's intention to reduce its growing energy bill , has triggered outrage among environmentalists , who feel the brussels ' contradiction is deeply hypocritical .
earlier this year , eu leaders proposed that traditional , but inefficient , incandescent bulbs be phased out across the bloc by 2009 , as one of a series of measures aimed at reducing carbon emissions .
environmentalists argue that the continued duties will restrict european consumers ' access to cheaper , low-energy technology .
" -lrb- this proposal -rrb- is disappointing , unfair and seriously inconsistent with the ambitious eu targets to improve energy efficiency in europe and to curb climate change , " the conservation organization wwf said in a press release , quoted by afp .
" on the one hand , europe has committed to an ambitious energy efficiency objective , and on the other hand it continues to impose taxes on imports of green products , " the group 's trade and investment specialist eivind hoff said .
retailer resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osram wanted the charges to stay in place further resistance is expected to come from retailers , who may well see it as a means of protecting major eu producers .
" the commission needs to put the environment before the narrow self-interests of a minority of member countries and scrap import duties on chinese bulbs , " the head of the british retail consortium , kevin hawkins , told the independent newspaper .
according to afp , the conservative british eu lawmaker syed kamall described the decision as " farcical and indefensible . "
" the light bulb industry wants the duties scrapped , consumers want them scrapped and common sense says they should be scrapped ; yet the european commission has once again bowed to protectionist pressures , " he said .

" in the overall interest of the community , " there are grounds to leave the possibility of continuing these anti-dumping measures for up to another year , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger told journalists .
" we have to balance environmental interests with the interest of fair trade , " he added .
" this is a rapid-changing market reality and so some transitional measures were warranted . "
unfair competition the commission introduced the anti-dumping tariffs of up to 66 percent in 2001 after an investigation concluded that competition between eu and chinese manufacturers was unfair .
the duties on the power-saving light bulbs made in china raise prices for european customers by up to two-thirds .
for now , less than 20 percent of power-saving bulbs are made in europe , while over two-thirds are imported from china .
but at the end of july , a majority of the experts gave backing to a proposal from mandelson to let the duties lapse .
afp news service reported that according to mandelson 's spokesman , only one out of four european producers had been keen to retain the trade charges .
german lighting company osram , a subsidiary of siemens , had led calls to renew the duties because they hit dutch rival philips harder than osram , though both companies produce in china .
impeding green progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eco-friendly bulbs will soon be mandatory this week 's decision , which contravenes the eu 's intention to reduce its growing energy bill , has triggered outrage among environmentalists , who feel the brussels ' contradiction is deeply hypocritical .
earlier this year , eu leaders proposed that traditional , but inefficient , incandescent bulbs be phased out across the bloc by 2009 , as one of a series of measures aimed at reducing carbon emissions .
environmentalists argue that the continued duties will restrict european consumers ' access to cheaper , low-energy technology .
" -lrb- this proposal -rrb- is disappointing , unfair and seriously inconsistent with the ambitious eu targets to improve energy efficiency in europe and to curb climate change , " the conservation organization wwf said in a press release , quoted by afp .
" on the one hand , europe has committed to an ambitious energy efficiency objective , and on the other hand it continues to impose taxes on imports of green products , " the group 's trade and investment specialist eivind hoff said .
retailer resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osram wanted the charges to stay in place further resistance is expected to come from retailers , who may well see it as a means of protecting major eu producers .
" the commission needs to put the environment before the narrow self-interests of a minority of member countries and scrap import duties on chinese bulbs , " the head of the british retail consortium , kevin hawkins , told the independent newspaper .
according to afp , the conservative british eu lawmaker syed kamall described the decision as " farcical and indefensible . "
" the light bulb industry wants the duties scrapped , consumers want them scrapped and common sense says they should be scrapped ; yet the european commission has once again bowed to protectionist pressures , " he said .

it could be of particular interest to large emerging nations china and india . in a speech during her first visit to japan as german chancellor , angela merkel said thursday both developing and industrialized nations need to agree on specific targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions .
" we have to assume that emerging nations naturally do n't want the same responsibility " as industrialized nations , the chancellor said , speaking at a symposium organized by japan 's nikkei media group in tokyo .
a more palatable pact for emerging nations developing countries such as india and china , experiencing skyrocketing growth rates , are worried that strict environmental regulations will dent their economic boom .
they want industrialized nations , the chief polluters , to bear the brunt of emission cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's rapid economic boom is taking a heavy toll on its environment merkel suggested that as a compromise , developing countries should be allowed to increase their emissions per capita while industrialized nations cut theirs , until both sides reach the same level .
the model is said to be based on a proposal by indian prime minister manmohan singh at the g-8 summit in june in germany .
that conference , hosted by merkel , set a non-binding goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 within the eu .
merkel also underlined the need to forge a successor climate pact to the kyoto protocol which expires at the end of 2012 and which she helped draw up as germany 's environment minister in 1997 .
she however voiced caution about the carbon market , part of the kyoto protocol that allows countries that emit gas beyond their allowance to buy credits from companies or countries below their target levels .
the system also exists for companies in the european union .
" it is a wise , market-oriented measure but we need to be careful as it can go in the wrong direction , " merkel said .
" for example , if a coal factory merely moves from europe to a foreign country because it can sell the carbon credit , that 's meaningless , " she said .
merkel wants us on board merkel said detailed targets needed to be set soon if the world wants to slow global warming .
" the question is , how do we distribute -lrb- reduction targets -rrb- in the world ?
i do n't believe that it 's enough to just agree that everyone will do their best .
i do n't believe that would yield an impressive result , " she said .
time is running out in the fight against global warming , she said , adding that the united states must be part of any global deal to slash carbon dioxide emissions .
" i think america will cooperate - america must cooperate .
if we ca n't find a regulatory regime that is accepted by the usa , then china and india will never agree to reduction targets , " merkel said .
the fight against climate change is the overarching theme of merkel 's visit to japan .
japan is to host the next g8 summit in hokkaido in 2008 .

japanese opposition skeptical of afghanistan mission separately , merkel ruffled feathers among japan 's opposition on thursday by urging the country to maintain its support for the " war on terror " in afghanistan .
" you do n't have to follow the unilateral opinion of the united states , " main opposition leader ichiro ozawa told merkel in a meeting , as quoted by tsuyoshi yamaguchi , the opposition 's shadow foreign minister .

they want industrialized nations , the chief polluters , to bear the brunt of emission cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's rapid economic boom is taking a heavy toll on its environment merkel suggested that as a compromise , developing countries should be allowed to increase their emissions per capita while industrialized nations cut theirs , until both sides reach the same level .
the model is said to be based on a proposal by indian prime minister manmohan singh at the g-8 summit in june in germany .
that conference , hosted by merkel , set a non-binding goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 within the eu .
merkel also underlined the need to forge a successor climate pact to the kyoto protocol which expires at the end of 2012 and which she helped draw up as germany 's environment minister in 1997 .
she however voiced caution about the carbon market , part of the kyoto protocol that allows countries that emit gas beyond their allowance to buy credits from companies or countries below their target levels .
the system also exists for companies in the european union .
" it is a wise , market-oriented measure but we need to be careful as it can go in the wrong direction , " merkel said .
" for example , if a coal factory merely moves from europe to a foreign country because it can sell the carbon credit , that 's meaningless , " she said .
merkel wants us on board merkel said detailed targets needed to be set soon if the world wants to slow global warming .
" the question is , how do we distribute -lrb- reduction targets -rrb- in the world ?
i do n't believe that it 's enough to just agree that everyone will do their best .
i do n't believe that would yield an impressive result , " she said .
time is running out in the fight against global warming , she said , adding that the united states must be part of any global deal to slash carbon dioxide emissions .
" i think america will cooperate - america must cooperate .
if we ca n't find a regulatory regime that is accepted by the usa , then china and india will never agree to reduction targets , " merkel said .
the fight against climate change is the overarching theme of merkel 's visit to japan .
japan is to host the next g8 summit in hokkaido in 2008 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 30.08.2007 eu plans natural disaster response units großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is coordinating dozens of countries that have responded to greece 's cry for help the european union is considering setting up permanent reaction teams to better deal with natural disasters like the current devastating forest fires in greece , which have killed at least 63 people . eu environment spokesperson barbara helfferich said the european commission had started developing the idea of setting up response units , and hoped to present plans later this year . these civil protection units would consist of readily-deployable , highly-trained personnel backed up with specialized equipment .
one of the so-called " response modules " already identified as a key need is a forest fire-fighting unit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been a series of disasters this summer " the costs of not doing enough in a coordinated way far outweigh the costs of doing it ... in a coordinated , better way , " said helfferich . the european commission has been coordinating the response to the greek forest fires through its brussels-based monitoring and information centre -lrb- mic -rrb- . last friday , greece asked its european partners to provide water-bombing aircraft to help fight the fires which have been affecting the country since the beginning of the summer but have dramatically increased in intensity in the past six days . massive coordination effort the mic co-ordination of the greece crisis is , according to helfferich , its " biggest effort ever " since the center was set up in 2001 .
nine member states responded to greece 's calls for help . the commission on wednesday confirmed that greece intends to ask for financial support from the eu 's solidarity fund in the wake of the forest fires .
it can take up to eight months , however , for the funds to be released , a spokesperson said . the solidarity fund was established in 2002 to support eu members who have suffered from natural disasters .
a country can ask for its help when the damage from a disaster exceeds 0.6 per cent of gross national income , or 1.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.45 billion -rrb- in the case of greece . thousands of people rushed to banks to claim a 3,000 euro initial greek government compensation handout . fires easing meanwhile , greek firefighters indicated that the battle against the fires was being won . " at the moment no populated areas are under threat , " fire service spokesman nikos diamantis said at a press conference on wednesday , adding that while the fires had eased somewhat , it was still too early for the all-clear to be issued . bildunterschrift : eu states have sent aircraft and firefights to help fires were still burning in 29 regions on the peloponnese peninsula and the island of euboea , compared to 36 the previous day , but better weather has helped crews stop the fires from spreading rapidly through parched forests some 110 villages are estimated to have been wholly or partially burnt .
the flames have also destroyed 4.5 million olive trees , and 60,000 sheep and goats have died . there has been widespread criticism of the greek government 's handling of the fires , which many believe were started by arsonists on behalf of property developers . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of the so-called " response modules " already identified as a key need is a forest fire-fighting unit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been a series of disasters this summer " the costs of not doing enough in a coordinated way far outweigh the costs of doing it ... in a coordinated , better way , " said helfferich . the european commission has been coordinating the response to the greek forest fires through its brussels-based monitoring and information centre -lrb- mic -rrb- . last friday , greece asked its european partners to provide water-bombing aircraft to help fight the fires which have been affecting the country since the beginning of the summer but have dramatically increased in intensity in the past six days . massive coordination effort the mic co-ordination of the greece crisis is , according to helfferich , its " biggest effort ever " since the center was set up in 2001 .
nine member states responded to greece 's calls for help . the commission on wednesday confirmed that greece intends to ask for financial support from the eu 's solidarity fund in the wake of the forest fires .
it can take up to eight months , however , for the funds to be released , a spokesperson said . the solidarity fund was established in 2002 to support eu members who have suffered from natural disasters .
a country can ask for its help when the damage from a disaster exceeds 0.6 per cent of gross national income , or 1.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.45 billion -rrb- in the case of greece . thousands of people rushed to banks to claim a 3,000 euro initial greek government compensation handout . fires easing meanwhile , greek firefighters indicated that the battle against the fires was being won . " at the moment no populated areas are under threat , " fire service spokesman nikos diamantis said at a press conference on wednesday , adding that while the fires had eased somewhat , it was still too early for the all-clear to be issued . bildunterschrift : eu states have sent aircraft and firefights to help fires were still burning in 29 regions on the peloponnese peninsula and the island of euboea , compared to 36 the previous day , but better weather has helped crews stop the fires from spreading rapidly through parched forests some 110 villages are estimated to have been wholly or partially burnt .
the flames have also destroyed 4.5 million olive trees , and 60,000 sheep and goats have died . there has been widespread criticism of the greek government 's handling of the fires , which many believe were started by arsonists on behalf of property developers . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the taliban 's " extortionate demands " appeared to have been met all along the line , he told the berlin radio station rbb . on thursday , the taliban freed the remaining seven south korean aid workers they had been holding .
twelve other hostages were released on wednesday . nachtwei said the outcome was bad for the government of afghan president hamid karzai , " which did not play any part " in the release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the south korean government is also facing criticism at home the south korean government said it had confirmed to the taliban it would withdraw its 200 soldiers from afghanistan by year 's end . the aghan foreign minister rangin dadfar spanta emphasized on thursday that south korea had already made its decision before the missionaries were kidnapped . " it is a very dangerous message when we give the impression that the international community and the afghan government can be blackmailed , " dadfar said on thursday on rbb radio . afghan government bypassed the day before , afghan commerce minister amin farhang had also criticized the south korean government for bypassing the afghan government and dealing directly with the taliban . " this release under these conditions will make our difficulties in afghanistan even bigger , " farhand told german public radio bayerischer rundfunk . " we fear that this decision could become a precedent .
the taliban will continue trying to take hostages to attain their aims in afghanistan . " south korea also said it had promised to send no more " christian missionaries " into the muslim country .
for its part , the taliban dropped their demands for the release of prisoners . speculation is rife that the south korean government paid a ransom for the hostages , a charge denied by both south korean and taliban officials . taliban gains credibility after initial joy at the release of the hostages , the korean newspaper korea times added its voice to the volley of criticism . " even if the taliban did n't manage to assert their demands for a prisoner exchange that they have had direct negotiations with a foreign state on ' their territory ' greatly adds to their political credibility , " the paper said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ambulance transports the dead body of one of two germans kidnapped in afghanistan one german national who was kidnapped around the same time as the south koreans is still being held in afghanistan .
another german national , who was seized with him , was killed while in captivity . the taliban are demanding that germany withdraw its troops from afghanistan in exchange for his release , something which german government refuses to do . german chancellor angela merkel said her government would not change its strategy in light of the release of the korean hostages . " the federal government is trying hard to obtain the release of the hostages we have in afghanistan , " merkel said wednesday during a visit to japan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in japan , german chancellor angela merkel emphasised that germany would n't be blackmailed by the taliban " the situation concerning the south korean hostages will not change in the way we are dealing with it , " she said . the taliban originally kidnapped 23 south koreans as they traveled from kabul to kandahar on july 19 .
in late july , the militants killed two male hostages , and they released two women earlier this month as gesture of goodwill . two men were killed after the expiration of taliban-set deadlines for the afghan authorities to meet their demands , and two female hostages who fell ill were released on aug .

a german woman has realized there 's a lot to be said for the hair of the dog .
she 's started a business making clothes for customers from the fur of their pet dogs . bearded collies are not the perfect pets for fastidious housekeepers .
throughout the year , they tend to shed their hair on carpets , beds and sofas .
it 's enough to make their owners sick as a dog .
but 50-year-old bettina menkhoff , a primary school teacher who lives in stoetze in the lüneberger heide with four such four-footed friends , decided that all that lovely fur should n't go to waste .
three years ago , she taught herself how to turn it into yarn , and has been making scarves , gloves and other clothes ever since .
her internet business now attracts customers from across the country , all putting a stylish new spin on the proverbial hair shirt .
" it only works when the hair is longer than four centimetres , " she explained .
" i regularly brush my dogs and keep the hair for processing .
it 's warmer than sheep wool . "
as fabric , pet hair appears to be a lot more emotionally charged than anything lagerfeld or lacroix ever work with .
these days , menkhoff can barely keep up with demand .
fortunately , she 's found a new supplier - a local dog salon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one day , he 'll be a scarf " some clients specifically want me to use hair from other animals too , " said menkhoff .
" they dread the day their pet dies and all they 're left with is a scarf hanging in the closet . "

" at the moment no populated areas are under threat , " fire service spokesman nikos diamantis said at a press conference on wednesday , adding that while the fires had eased somewhat , it was still too early for the all-clear to be issued . bildunterschrift : eu states have sent aircraft and firefights to help fires were still burning in 29 regions on the peloponnese peninsula and the island of euboea , compared to 36 the previous day , but better weather has helped crews stop the fires from spreading rapidly through parched forests some 110 villages are estimated to have been wholly or partially burnt .
the flames have also destroyed 4.5 million olive trees , and 60,000 sheep and goats have died . there has been widespread criticism of the greek government 's handling of the fires , which many believe were started by arsonists on behalf of property developers . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german woman has realized there 's a lot to be said for the hair of the dog .
she 's started a business making clothes for customers from the fur of their pet dogs . bearded collies are not the perfect pets for fastidious housekeepers .
throughout the year , they tend to shed their hair on carpets , beds and sofas .
it 's enough to make their owners sick as a dog .
but 50-year-old bettina menkhoff , a primary school teacher who lives in stoetze in the lüneberger heide with four such four-footed friends , decided that all that lovely fur should n't go to waste .
three years ago , she taught herself how to turn it into yarn , and has been making scarves , gloves and other clothes ever since .
her internet business now attracts customers from across the country , all putting a stylish new spin on the proverbial hair shirt .
" it only works when the hair is longer than four centimetres , " she explained .
" i regularly brush my dogs and keep the hair for processing .
it 's warmer than sheep wool . "
as fabric , pet hair appears to be a lot more emotionally charged than anything lagerfeld or lacroix ever work with .
these days , menkhoff can barely keep up with demand .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 30.08.2007 german left party touches base with latin american comrades großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can germany 's left party learn from latin american countries , including cuba ?
left party leader oskar lafontaine is in cuba this week for a three-day visit .
dw-world.de talked to the party 's foreign policy spokesman wolfgang gehrcke about the new latin american left . dw-world.de : what was the political significance of this visit ?
was lafontaine effectively saying goodbye to fidel castro ? wolfgang gehrcke : first and foremost , lafontaine is keen to see how the country is evolving , to explore its potential for further development and the current state of the european-cuban relationship .
germany 's position on the eu 's restrictive policy towards cuba is not a constructive one .
unfortunately , berlin has not taken sides with the spanish and italian governments who want to see the eu lift sanctions against cuba .
oskar lafontaine is visiting a number of initiatives providing humanitarian aid in the country , such as supplying children with milk everyday .
the visit to cuba is oskar lafontaine 's first port of call on his tour of latin america 's new , left-wing governments .
as far as i am aware , fidel castro is in good health and there is no reason to say goodbye to him . as the left party 's foreign policy spokesman , what do you think of the german government 's stance on latin america ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : change has swept venezuela berlin 's policies towards latin america are based on positions that range from indifference to outright hostility towards south america 's recent shift to the left .
the government is of the opinion that germany has few interests in latin america outside of sao paulo , brazil 's economic center , and mexico .
it 's happy to leave the continent to the us .
broadly speaking , the government shares washington 's political aims there , which define neo-liberalism as the only viable option for economic development .
but neo-liberalism has failed in latin america , leaving a trail of destruction within the continent 's social structures .
this form of dogma has made only the very few wealthy while the majority of the population as well as parts of the middle classes have become poorer .
no one in latin america still believes that neo-liberalism and globalization can deliver wealth for all .
in a number of countries , democratic votes have resulted in the election of various forms of left-wing alternatives to neo-liberalism .
europe should be joining forces with latin america to develop cooperation 's that prioritize public political interests on both continents , and push for a better world .
we propose that europe builds up economic ties to latin america that are based on co-operations and the respective countries ' own agenda for development .
this includes banishing poverty by developing domestic markets .
latin america needs debt relief as well as a transfer of technology in order to boost its economic performance . what does the german left party think about the " new latin american left " ? across latin america , we are seeing broad-based movements fighting against the consequences of neo-liberalism .
in many countries , these developments have resulted in victories for the left or progressive , anti-neo liberal forces in parliamentary and presidential elections .
regardless of whether they continue to promote socialist values or are more interested in pushing for greater national independence and sovereignty , what they have in common is a political interest in social change on behalf of marginalized , disadvantaged groups .
as in venezuela , the goal of the various campaigns initiated by the government is to improve life for the country 's poor , create jobs and improve education and health .
latin america 's left-wing governments are backed by various groups .
these include , along with politicians and parties , unions and various social movements as well as independent intellectuals , local entrepreneurs and representatives of the church . who represents this new left ?
bachelet , chavez or evo morales ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chilean president michelle bachelet in terms of society transforming , this process is best embodied by bolivian president evo morales und hugo chavez in venezuela .
but in terms of a new political direction , geared towards greater social equality in latin america and away from neo-liberalism , then the process is spearheaded by figures such as chilean president michelle bachelet and nestor kirchner in argentina .
they all stand for more socially aware policies geared towards a stronger , more interventionist state . which challenges do left-wing organizations in latin america and germany share ? we need to aim for a world based on greater solidarity which leaves our children with a future .
our world and our future are seriously jeopardized by war and impending hunger crises due to ever dwindling food supplies caused by environmental disaster .
we also need to overcome illiteracy , endemic disease , poverty and water shortages .
these are tasks we can only meet if we in europe all pull together and with the developing world . how can the left party help contribute to continued existence of the latin american left ? for the time being we need to learn from them .
the most important developments are happening there , and the left is currently very successful .
the latin american left has been a motivating force for a new left-wing culture and is currently helping to revitalize the socialist option .
we can help by achieving similar success . according to the latest surveys , oskar lafontaine is one of the best-known and most popular politicians in germany .
why is this ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trustworthy or populist ?
oskar lafontaine oskar lafontaine stands for credibility .
he gave up his office and left his party when it turned its back on social democracy in favor of neo-liberalism under gerhard schröder .
he gives voice to people 's fear of unrestrained capitalism - the tidal wave of neo-liberalism and globalization bearing down on them . enrique lopez magallon interviewed wolfgang gehrcke -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german embassy has " already received several enquiries about the location of so-called no-go areas for foreign visitors to germany , " kauder told german daily rheinischen post .
kauder , who is parliamentary leader of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , admitted that all indians who had anything to do either economically or politically with germany had taken note of the incident in eastern germany .
" even the reactions in germany -lrb- to the incident -rrb- are being carefully followed -lrb- in india -rrb- , " kauder said .
the politician pointed out that indians , however , are making an effort not to play up the incident .
" the indians recognize that these events in mügeln are not the rule in germany , " he said , adding that chancellor merkel 's condemnation of the attacks had done much to calm the situation .
a hate crime ?
the incident took place ten days ago during a village festival in the eastern german state of saxony .
a german mob of over 50 people chased and attacked a group of eight indians who took refuge in a pizzeria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer patrols the area near the pizzeria owned by a pakistani the frenzied mob broke down the door and assaulted the indians .
police forces eventually arrived on the scene , but it took a while for the large squad of 70 police officers to force back the crowd .
the attack left 14 people wounded , including four of the attackers , two police officers and the eight indians , some of whom were beaten so badly they needed medical attention .
according to saxony 's state prosecutor , 82 witnesses have so far been interviewed in connection with the attack .
the police confirmed on tuesday that they are investigating seven suspects . state police chief , bernd merbitz , told the associated press that the actions had not been committed by a particular extreme-right group .
nonetheless , he said , the chanting of slogans such as " foreigners out ! " and " germany for germans " constituted a xenophobic criminal offence .
heated debate in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quiet town of mügeln was turned into a riot-zone the incident has triggered outrage in germany after photos of the bruised and wounded indians were splashed on the front pages of all major media in the country .
the attack has also prompted a heated debate about the need to counter racism and xenophobia , which statistics show is more widespread in former communist east germany .
it has also led to renewed calls by some politicians to ban the far-right , anti-immigrant npd party which is represented in two state parliaments in eastern germany . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german embassy has " already received several enquiries about the location of so-called no-go areas for foreign visitors to germany , " kauder told german daily rheinischen post .

none of the three german representatives face an easy passage . the teams on the long road to moscow and the 2007/08 champions league final took another small step thursday when the draw for the group stages of europe 's premier club competition were made in monaco .
uefa president michel platini oversaw the placing of 32 teams into eight groups during the spectacular event in the principality .
each group was headed by one of the eight seeded teams from around europe , including holders ac milan , last year 's beaten finalists liverpool and 2006 winners barcelona .
germany was fielding three teams in the draw : champions vfb stuttgart , runners-up schalke 04 and third-placed werder bremen , who qualified on wednesday night after a tough night in zagreb .
bundesliga champions stuttgart , who qualified automatically , will have to be well-prepared to progress from group e after being drawn against 2006 winners barcelona , perennial french champions olympique lyon and glasgow rangers .

" the taliban 's " extortionate demands " appeared to have been met all along the line , he told the berlin radio station rbb . on thursday , the taliban freed the remaining seven south korean aid workers they had been holding .
twelve other hostages were released on wednesday . nachtwei said the outcome was bad for the government of afghan president hamid karzai , " which did not play any part " in the release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the south korean government is also facing criticism at home the south korean government said it had confirmed to the taliban it would withdraw its 200 soldiers from afghanistan by year 's end . the aghan foreign minister rangin dadfar spanta emphasized on thursday that south korea had already made its decision before the missionaries were kidnapped . " it is a very dangerous message when we give the impression that the international community and the afghan government can be blackmailed , " dadfar said on thursday on rbb radio . afghan government bypassed the day before , afghan commerce minister amin farhang had also criticized the south korean government for bypassing the afghan government and dealing directly with the taliban . " this release under these conditions will make our difficulties in afghanistan even bigger , " farhand told german public radio bayerischer rundfunk . " we fear that this decision could become a precedent .
the taliban will continue trying to take hostages to attain their aims in afghanistan . " south korea also said it had promised to send no more " christian missionaries " into the muslim country .
for its part , the taliban dropped their demands for the release of prisoners . speculation is rife that the south korean government paid a ransom for the hostages , a charge denied by both south korean and taliban officials . taliban gains credibility after initial joy at the release of the hostages , the korean newspaper korea times added its voice to the volley of criticism . " even if the taliban did n't manage to assert their demands for a prisoner exchange that they have had direct negotiations with a foreign state on ' their territory ' greatly adds to their political credibility , " the paper said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ambulance transports the dead body of one of two germans kidnapped in afghanistan one german national who was kidnapped around the same time as the south koreans is still being held in afghanistan .
another german national , who was seized with him , was killed while in captivity . the taliban are demanding that germany withdraw its troops from afghanistan in exchange for his release , something which german government refuses to do . german chancellor angela merkel said her government would not change its strategy in light of the release of the korean hostages . " the federal government is trying hard to obtain the release of the hostages we have in afghanistan , " merkel said wednesday during a visit to japan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in japan , german chancellor angela merkel emphasised that germany would n't be blackmailed by the taliban " the situation concerning the south korean hostages will not change in the way we are dealing with it , " she said . the taliban originally kidnapped 23 south koreans as they traveled from kabul to kandahar on july 19 .
in late july , the militants killed two male hostages , and they released two women earlier this month as gesture of goodwill . two men were killed after the expiration of taliban-set deadlines for the afghan authorities to meet their demands , and two female hostages who fell ill were released on aug .

" in the overall interest of the community , " there are grounds to leave the possibility of continuing these anti-dumping measures for up to another year , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger told journalists .
" we have to balance environmental interests with the interest of fair trade , " he added .
" this is a rapid-changing market reality and so some transitional measures were warranted . "
unfair competition the commission introduced the anti-dumping tariffs of up to 66 percent in 2001 after an investigation concluded that competition between eu and chinese manufacturers was unfair .
the duties on the power-saving light bulbs made in china raise prices for european customers by up to two-thirds .
for now , less than 20 percent of power-saving bulbs are made in europe , while over two-thirds are imported from china .
but at the end of july , a majority of the experts gave backing to a proposal from mandelson to let the duties lapse .
afp news service reported that according to mandelson 's spokesman , only one out of four european producers had been keen to retain the trade charges .
german lighting company osram , a subsidiary of siemens , had led calls to renew the duties because they hit dutch rival philips harder than osram , though both companies produce in china .
impeding green progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eco-friendly bulbs will soon be mandatory this week 's decision , which contravenes the eu 's intention to reduce its growing energy bill , has triggered outrage among environmentalists , who feel the brussels ' contradiction is deeply hypocritical .
earlier this year , eu leaders proposed that traditional , but inefficient , incandescent bulbs be phased out across the bloc by 2009 , as one of a series of measures aimed at reducing carbon emissions .
environmentalists argue that the continued duties will restrict european consumers ' access to cheaper , low-energy technology .
" -lrb- this proposal -rrb- is disappointing , unfair and seriously inconsistent with the ambitious eu targets to improve energy efficiency in europe and to curb climate change , " the conservation organization wwf said in a press release , quoted by afp .
" on the one hand , europe has committed to an ambitious energy efficiency objective , and on the other hand it continues to impose taxes on imports of green products , " the group 's trade and investment specialist eivind hoff said .
retailer resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osram wanted the charges to stay in place further resistance is expected to come from retailers , who may well see it as a means of protecting major eu producers .
" the commission needs to put the environment before the narrow self-interests of a minority of member countries and scrap import duties on chinese bulbs , " the head of the british retail consortium , kevin hawkins , told the independent newspaper .
according to afp , the conservative british eu lawmaker syed kamall described the decision as " farcical and indefensible . "
" the light bulb industry wants the duties scrapped , consumers want them scrapped and common sense says they should be scrapped ; yet the european commission has once again bowed to protectionist pressures , " he said .
the decision still has to be approved by anti-dumping experts from the european union 's member states . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

left party leader oskar lafontaine is in cuba this week for a three-day visit .
dw-world.de talked to the party 's foreign policy spokesman wolfgang gehrcke about the new latin american left . dw-world.de : what was the political significance of this visit ?
was lafontaine effectively saying goodbye to fidel castro ? wolfgang gehrcke : first and foremost , lafontaine is keen to see how the country is evolving , to explore its potential for further development and the current state of the european-cuban relationship .
germany 's position on the eu 's restrictive policy towards cuba is not a constructive one .
unfortunately , berlin has not taken sides with the spanish and italian governments who want to see the eu lift sanctions against cuba .
oskar lafontaine is visiting a number of initiatives providing humanitarian aid in the country , such as supplying children with milk everyday .
the visit to cuba is oskar lafontaine 's first port of call on his tour of latin america 's new , left-wing governments .
as far as i am aware , fidel castro is in good health and there is no reason to say goodbye to him . as the left party 's foreign policy spokesman , what do you think of the german government 's stance on latin america ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : change has swept venezuela berlin 's policies towards latin america are based on positions that range from indifference to outright hostility towards south america 's recent shift to the left .
the government is of the opinion that germany has few interests in latin america outside of sao paulo , brazil 's economic center , and mexico .
it 's happy to leave the continent to the us .
broadly speaking , the government shares washington 's political aims there , which define neo-liberalism as the only viable option for economic development .
but neo-liberalism has failed in latin america , leaving a trail of destruction within the continent 's social structures .
this form of dogma has made only the very few wealthy while the majority of the population as well as parts of the middle classes have become poorer .
no one in latin america still believes that neo-liberalism and globalization can deliver wealth for all .
in a number of countries , democratic votes have resulted in the election of various forms of left-wing alternatives to neo-liberalism .
europe should be joining forces with latin america to develop cooperation 's that prioritize public political interests on both continents , and push for a better world .
we propose that europe builds up economic ties to latin america that are based on co-operations and the respective countries ' own agenda for development .
this includes banishing poverty by developing domestic markets .
latin america needs debt relief as well as a transfer of technology in order to boost its economic performance . what does the german left party think about the " new latin american left " ? across latin america , we are seeing broad-based movements fighting against the consequences of neo-liberalism .
in many countries , these developments have resulted in victories for the left or progressive , anti-neo liberal forces in parliamentary and presidential elections .
regardless of whether they continue to promote socialist values or are more interested in pushing for greater national independence and sovereignty , what they have in common is a political interest in social change on behalf of marginalized , disadvantaged groups .
as in venezuela , the goal of the various campaigns initiated by the government is to improve life for the country 's poor , create jobs and improve education and health .
latin america 's left-wing governments are backed by various groups .
these include , along with politicians and parties , unions and various social movements as well as independent intellectuals , local entrepreneurs and representatives of the church . who represents this new left ?
bachelet , chavez or evo morales ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chilean president michelle bachelet in terms of society transforming , this process is best embodied by bolivian president evo morales und hugo chavez in venezuela .
but in terms of a new political direction , geared towards greater social equality in latin america and away from neo-liberalism , then the process is spearheaded by figures such as chilean president michelle bachelet and nestor kirchner in argentina .
they all stand for more socially aware policies geared towards a stronger , more interventionist state . which challenges do left-wing organizations in latin america and germany share ? we need to aim for a world based on greater solidarity which leaves our children with a future .
our world and our future are seriously jeopardized by war and impending hunger crises due to ever dwindling food supplies caused by environmental disaster .
we also need to overcome illiteracy , endemic disease , poverty and water shortages .
these are tasks we can only meet if we in europe all pull together and with the developing world . how can the left party help contribute to continued existence of the latin american left ? for the time being we need to learn from them .
the most important developments are happening there , and the left is currently very successful .
the latin american left has been a motivating force for a new left-wing culture and is currently helping to revitalize the socialist option .
we can help by achieving similar success . according to the latest surveys , oskar lafontaine is one of the best-known and most popular politicians in germany .
why is this ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trustworthy or populist ?
oskar lafontaine oskar lafontaine stands for credibility .
he gave up his office and left his party when it turned its back on social democracy in favor of neo-liberalism under gerhard schröder .
he gives voice to people 's fear of unrestrained capitalism - the tidal wave of neo-liberalism and globalization bearing down on them . enrique lopez magallon interviewed wolfgang gehrcke -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german embassy has " already received several enquiries about the location of so-called no-go areas for foreign visitors to germany , " kauder told german daily rheinischen post .
kauder , who is parliamentary leader of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , admitted that all indians who had anything to do either economically or politically with germany had taken note of the incident in eastern germany .
" even the reactions in germany -lrb- to the incident -rrb- are being carefully followed -lrb- in india -rrb- , " kauder said .
the politician pointed out that indians , however , are making an effort not to play up the incident .
" the indians recognize that these events in mügeln are not the rule in germany , " he said , adding that chancellor merkel 's condemnation of the attacks had done much to calm the situation .
a hate crime ?
the incident took place ten days ago during a village festival in the eastern german state of saxony .
a german mob of over 50 people chased and attacked a group of eight indians who took refuge in a pizzeria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer patrols the area near the pizzeria owned by a pakistani the frenzied mob broke down the door and assaulted the indians .
police forces eventually arrived on the scene , but it took a while for the large squad of 70 police officers to force back the crowd .
the attack left 14 people wounded , including four of the attackers , two police officers and the eight indians , some of whom were beaten so badly they needed medical attention .
according to saxony 's state prosecutor , 82 witnesses have so far been interviewed in connection with the attack .
the police confirmed on tuesday that they are investigating seven suspects . state police chief , bernd merbitz , told the associated press that the actions had not been committed by a particular extreme-right group .
nonetheless , he said , the chanting of slogans such as " foreigners out ! " and " germany for germans " constituted a xenophobic criminal offence .
heated debate in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quiet town of mügeln was turned into a riot-zone the incident has triggered outrage in germany after photos of the bruised and wounded indians were splashed on the front pages of all major media in the country .
the attack has also prompted a heated debate about the need to counter racism and xenophobia , which statistics show is more widespread in former communist east germany .
it has also led to renewed calls by some politicians to ban the far-right , anti-immigrant npd party which is represented in two state parliaments in eastern germany . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she 's started a business making clothes for customers from the fur of their pet dogs . bearded collies are not the perfect pets for fastidious housekeepers .
throughout the year , they tend to shed their hair on carpets , beds and sofas .
it 's enough to make their owners sick as a dog .
but 50-year-old bettina menkhoff , a primary school teacher who lives in stoetze in the lüneberger heide with four such four-footed friends , decided that all that lovely fur should n't go to waste .
three years ago , she taught herself how to turn it into yarn , and has been making scarves , gloves and other clothes ever since .
her internet business now attracts customers from across the country , all putting a stylish new spin on the proverbial hair shirt .
" it only works when the hair is longer than four centimetres , " she explained .
" i regularly brush my dogs and keep the hair for processing .
it 's warmer than sheep wool . "
as fabric , pet hair appears to be a lot more emotionally charged than anything lagerfeld or lacroix ever work with .

a german woman has realized there 's a lot to be said for the hair of the dog .
she 's started a business making clothes for customers from the fur of their pet dogs . bearded collies are not the perfect pets for fastidious housekeepers .
throughout the year , they tend to shed their hair on carpets , beds and sofas .
it 's enough to make their owners sick as a dog .
but 50-year-old bettina menkhoff , a primary school teacher who lives in stoetze in the lüneberger heide with four such four-footed friends , decided that all that lovely fur should n't go to waste .
three years ago , she taught herself how to turn it into yarn , and has been making scarves , gloves and other clothes ever since .
her internet business now attracts customers from across the country , all putting a stylish new spin on the proverbial hair shirt .
" it only works when the hair is longer than four centimetres , " she explained .
" i regularly brush my dogs and keep the hair for processing .
it 's warmer than sheep wool . "
as fabric , pet hair appears to be a lot more emotionally charged than anything lagerfeld or lacroix ever work with .
these days , menkhoff can barely keep up with demand .
fortunately , she 's found a new supplier - a local dog salon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one day , he 'll be a scarf " some clients specifically want me to use hair from other animals too , " said menkhoff .
" they dread the day their pet dies and all they 're left with is a scarf hanging in the closet . "

none of the three german representatives face an easy passage . the teams on the long road to moscow and the 2007/08 champions league final took another small step thursday when the draw for the group stages of europe 's premier club competition were made in monaco .
uefa president michel platini oversaw the placing of 32 teams into eight groups during the spectacular event in the principality .
each group was headed by one of the eight seeded teams from around europe , including holders ac milan , last year 's beaten finalists liverpool and 2006 winners barcelona .
germany was fielding three teams in the draw : champions vfb stuttgart , runners-up schalke 04 and third-placed werder bremen , who qualified on wednesday night after a tough night in zagreb .
bundesliga champions stuttgart , who qualified automatically , will have to be well-prepared to progress from group e after being drawn against 2006 winners barcelona , perennial french champions olympique lyon and glasgow rangers .
schalke 04 , who spectacularly blew the chance to win the german title in the final stages of last season , will be hoping to keep their nerve in group b , despite the presence of chelsea , valencia and norwegian champions rosenberg .
both chelsea and valencia reached the knock-out stages last year with chelsea reaching the semi-finals after beating bremen in the group stages .
werder bremen , who reached the group stage for a fourth consecutive season following a hard-fought 3-2 victory at dynamo zagreb , with brazilian midfielder diego scoring a brace of penalties , were rewarded with a tough group c placing .

" the taliban 's " extortionate demands " appeared to have been met all along the line , he told the berlin radio station rbb . on thursday , the taliban freed the remaining seven south korean aid workers they had been holding .
twelve other hostages were released on wednesday . nachtwei said the outcome was bad for the government of afghan president hamid karzai , " which did not play any part " in the release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the south korean government is also facing criticism at home the south korean government said it had confirmed to the taliban it would withdraw its 200 soldiers from afghanistan by year 's end . the aghan foreign minister rangin dadfar spanta emphasized on thursday that south korea had already made its decision before the missionaries were kidnapped . " it is a very dangerous message when we give the impression that the international community and the afghan government can be blackmailed , " dadfar said on thursday on rbb radio . afghan government bypassed the day before , afghan commerce minister amin farhang had also criticized the south korean government for bypassing the afghan government and dealing directly with the taliban .

the taliban will continue trying to take hostages to attain their aims in afghanistan . " south korea also said it had promised to send no more " christian missionaries " into the muslim country .
for its part , the taliban dropped their demands for the release of prisoners . speculation is rife that the south korean government paid a ransom for the hostages , a charge denied by both south korean and taliban officials . taliban gains credibility after initial joy at the release of the hostages , the korean newspaper korea times added its voice to the volley of criticism .

the german embassy has " already received several enquiries about the location of so-called no-go areas for foreign visitors to germany , " kauder told german daily rheinischen post .
kauder , who is parliamentary leader of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , admitted that all indians who had anything to do either economically or politically with germany had taken note of the incident in eastern germany .
" even the reactions in germany -lrb- to the incident -rrb- are being carefully followed -lrb- in india -rrb- , " kauder said .
the politician pointed out that indians , however , are making an effort not to play up the incident .
" the indians recognize that these events in mügeln are not the rule in germany , " he said , adding that chancellor merkel 's condemnation of the attacks had done much to calm the situation .
a hate crime ?
the incident took place ten days ago during a village festival in the eastern german state of saxony .
a german mob of over 50 people chased and attacked a group of eight indians who took refuge in a pizzeria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer patrols the area near the pizzeria owned by a pakistani the frenzied mob broke down the door and assaulted the indians .
police forces eventually arrived on the scene , but it took a while for the large squad of 70 police officers to force back the crowd .
the attack left 14 people wounded , including four of the attackers , two police officers and the eight indians , some of whom were beaten so badly they needed medical attention .
according to saxony 's state prosecutor , 82 witnesses have so far been interviewed in connection with the attack .
the police confirmed on tuesday that they are investigating seven suspects . state police chief , bernd merbitz , told the associated press that the actions had not been committed by a particular extreme-right group .
nonetheless , he said , the chanting of slogans such as " foreigners out ! " and " germany for germans " constituted a xenophobic criminal offence .
heated debate in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quiet town of mügeln was turned into a riot-zone the incident has triggered outrage in germany after photos of the bruised and wounded indians were splashed on the front pages of all major media in the country .
the attack has also prompted a heated debate about the need to counter racism and xenophobia , which statistics show is more widespread in former communist east germany .
it has also led to renewed calls by some politicians to ban the far-right , anti-immigrant npd party which is represented in two state parliaments in eastern germany . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it could be of particular interest to large emerging nations china and india . in a speech during her first visit to japan as german chancellor , angela merkel said thursday both developing and industrialized nations need to agree on specific targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions .
" we have to assume that emerging nations naturally do n't want the same responsibility " as industrialized nations , the chancellor said , speaking at a symposium organized by japan 's nikkei media group in tokyo .
a more palatable pact for emerging nations developing countries such as india and china , experiencing skyrocketing growth rates , are worried that strict environmental regulations will dent their economic boom .
they want industrialized nations , the chief polluters , to bear the brunt of emission cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's rapid economic boom is taking a heavy toll on its environment merkel suggested that as a compromise , developing countries should be allowed to increase their emissions per capita while industrialized nations cut theirs , until both sides reach the same level .
the model is said to be based on a proposal by indian prime minister manmohan singh at the g-8 summit in june in germany .
that conference , hosted by merkel , set a non-binding goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 within the eu .
merkel also underlined the need to forge a successor climate pact to the kyoto protocol which expires at the end of 2012 and which she helped draw up as germany 's environment minister in 1997 .
she however voiced caution about the carbon market , part of the kyoto protocol that allows countries that emit gas beyond their allowance to buy credits from companies or countries below their target levels .
the system also exists for companies in the european union .
" it is a wise , market-oriented measure but we need to be careful as it can go in the wrong direction , " merkel said .
" for example , if a coal factory merely moves from europe to a foreign country because it can sell the carbon credit , that 's meaningless , " she said .
merkel wants us on board merkel said detailed targets needed to be set soon if the world wants to slow global warming .
" the question is , how do we distribute -lrb- reduction targets -rrb- in the world ?
i do n't believe that it 's enough to just agree that everyone will do their best .
i do n't believe that would yield an impressive result , " she said .
time is running out in the fight against global warming , she said , adding that the united states must be part of any global deal to slash carbon dioxide emissions .
" i think america will cooperate - america must cooperate .
if we ca n't find a regulatory regime that is accepted by the usa , then china and india will never agree to reduction targets , " merkel said .
the fight against climate change is the overarching theme of merkel 's visit to japan .
japan is to host the next g8 summit in hokkaido in 2008 .

merkel with abe honoring japan 's " cool biz " campaign on wednesday , merkel and japanese prime minister shinzo abe went into talks to map out ways to work with major polluters to achieve goals for greenhouse gas reductions by pointing out that no one in their delegations was wearing a tie , in honor of japan 's " cool biz " campaign to dress lighter in summer and reduce air conditioning use .
japanese opposition skeptical of afghanistan mission separately , merkel ruffled feathers among japan 's opposition on thursday by urging the country to maintain its support for the " war on terror " in afghanistan .
" you do n't have to follow the unilateral opinion of the united states , " main opposition leader ichiro ozawa told merkel in a meeting , as quoted by tsuyoshi yamaguchi , the opposition 's shadow foreign minister .

left party leader oskar lafontaine is in cuba this week for a three-day visit .
dw-world.de talked to the party 's foreign policy spokesman wolfgang gehrcke about the new latin american left . dw-world.de : what was the political significance of this visit ?
was lafontaine effectively saying goodbye to fidel castro ? wolfgang gehrcke : first and foremost , lafontaine is keen to see how the country is evolving , to explore its potential for further development and the current state of the european-cuban relationship .
germany 's position on the eu 's restrictive policy towards cuba is not a constructive one .
unfortunately , berlin has not taken sides with the spanish and italian governments who want to see the eu lift sanctions against cuba .
oskar lafontaine is visiting a number of initiatives providing humanitarian aid in the country , such as supplying children with milk everyday .

left party leader oskar lafontaine is in cuba this week for a three-day visit .
dw-world.de talked to the party 's foreign policy spokesman wolfgang gehrcke about the new latin american left . dw-world.de : what was the political significance of this visit ?
was lafontaine effectively saying goodbye to fidel castro ? wolfgang gehrcke : first and foremost , lafontaine is keen to see how the country is evolving , to explore its potential for further development and the current state of the european-cuban relationship .
germany 's position on the eu 's restrictive policy towards cuba is not a constructive one .
unfortunately , berlin has not taken sides with the spanish and italian governments who want to see the eu lift sanctions against cuba .
oskar lafontaine is visiting a number of initiatives providing humanitarian aid in the country , such as supplying children with milk everyday .
the visit to cuba is oskar lafontaine 's first port of call on his tour of latin america 's new , left-wing governments .

left party leader oskar lafontaine is in cuba this week for a three-day visit .
dw-world.de talked to the party 's foreign policy spokesman wolfgang gehrcke about the new latin american left . dw-world.de : what was the political significance of this visit ?
was lafontaine effectively saying goodbye to fidel castro ? wolfgang gehrcke : first and foremost , lafontaine is keen to see how the country is evolving , to explore its potential for further development and the current state of the european-cuban relationship .
germany 's position on the eu 's restrictive policy towards cuba is not a constructive one .
unfortunately , berlin has not taken sides with the spanish and italian governments who want to see the eu lift sanctions against cuba .
oskar lafontaine is visiting a number of initiatives providing humanitarian aid in the country , such as supplying children with milk everyday .
the visit to cuba is oskar lafontaine 's first port of call on his tour of latin america 's new , left-wing governments .
as far as i am aware , fidel castro is in good health and there is no reason to say goodbye to him . as the left party 's foreign policy spokesman , what do you think of the german government 's stance on latin america ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : change has swept venezuela berlin 's policies towards latin america are based on positions that range from indifference to outright hostility towards south america 's recent shift to the left .
the government is of the opinion that germany has few interests in latin america outside of sao paulo , brazil 's economic center , and mexico .
it 's happy to leave the continent to the us .
broadly speaking , the government shares washington 's political aims there , which define neo-liberalism as the only viable option for economic development .
but neo-liberalism has failed in latin america , leaving a trail of destruction within the continent 's social structures .
this form of dogma has made only the very few wealthy while the majority of the population as well as parts of the middle classes have become poorer .
no one in latin america still believes that neo-liberalism and globalization can deliver wealth for all .
in a number of countries , democratic votes have resulted in the election of various forms of left-wing alternatives to neo-liberalism .
europe should be joining forces with latin america to develop cooperation 's that prioritize public political interests on both continents , and push for a better world .
we propose that europe builds up economic ties to latin america that are based on co-operations and the respective countries ' own agenda for development .
this includes banishing poverty by developing domestic markets .
latin america needs debt relief as well as a transfer of technology in order to boost its economic performance . what does the german left party think about the " new latin american left " ? across latin america , we are seeing broad-based movements fighting against the consequences of neo-liberalism .
in many countries , these developments have resulted in victories for the left or progressive , anti-neo liberal forces in parliamentary and presidential elections .
regardless of whether they continue to promote socialist values or are more interested in pushing for greater national independence and sovereignty , what they have in common is a political interest in social change on behalf of marginalized , disadvantaged groups .
as in venezuela , the goal of the various campaigns initiated by the government is to improve life for the country 's poor , create jobs and improve education and health .
latin america 's left-wing governments are backed by various groups .
these include , along with politicians and parties , unions and various social movements as well as independent intellectuals , local entrepreneurs and representatives of the church . who represents this new left ?
bachelet , chavez or evo morales ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chilean president michelle bachelet in terms of society transforming , this process is best embodied by bolivian president evo morales und hugo chavez in venezuela .
but in terms of a new political direction , geared towards greater social equality in latin america and away from neo-liberalism , then the process is spearheaded by figures such as chilean president michelle bachelet and nestor kirchner in argentina .
they all stand for more socially aware policies geared towards a stronger , more interventionist state . which challenges do left-wing organizations in latin america and germany share ? we need to aim for a world based on greater solidarity which leaves our children with a future .
our world and our future are seriously jeopardized by war and impending hunger crises due to ever dwindling food supplies caused by environmental disaster .
we also need to overcome illiteracy , endemic disease , poverty and water shortages .
these are tasks we can only meet if we in europe all pull together and with the developing world . how can the left party help contribute to continued existence of the latin american left ? for the time being we need to learn from them .
the most important developments are happening there , and the left is currently very successful .
the latin american left has been a motivating force for a new left-wing culture and is currently helping to revitalize the socialist option .
we can help by achieving similar success . according to the latest surveys , oskar lafontaine is one of the best-known and most popular politicians in germany .
why is this ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trustworthy or populist ?
oskar lafontaine oskar lafontaine stands for credibility .
he gave up his office and left his party when it turned its back on social democracy in favor of neo-liberalism under gerhard schröder .

the german embassy has " already received several enquiries about the location of so-called no-go areas for foreign visitors to germany , " kauder told german daily rheinischen post .
kauder , who is parliamentary leader of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , admitted that all indians who had anything to do either economically or politically with germany had taken note of the incident in eastern germany .
" even the reactions in germany -lrb- to the incident -rrb- are being carefully followed -lrb- in india -rrb- , " kauder said .

" the indians recognize that these events in mügeln are not the rule in germany , " he said , adding that chancellor merkel 's condemnation of the attacks had done much to calm the situation .

the attack left 14 people wounded , including four of the attackers , two police officers and the eight indians , some of whom were beaten so badly they needed medical attention .
according to saxony 's state prosecutor , 82 witnesses have so far been interviewed in connection with the attack .
the police confirmed on tuesday that they are investigating seven suspects . state police chief , bernd merbitz , told the associated press that the actions had not been committed by a particular extreme-right group .
nonetheless , he said , the chanting of slogans such as " foreigners out ! " and " germany for germans " constituted a xenophobic criminal offence .

it could be of particular interest to large emerging nations china and india . in a speech during her first visit to japan as german chancellor , angela merkel said thursday both developing and industrialized nations need to agree on specific targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions .
" we have to assume that emerging nations naturally do n't want the same responsibility " as industrialized nations , the chancellor said , speaking at a symposium organized by japan 's nikkei media group in tokyo .
a more palatable pact for emerging nations developing countries such as india and china , experiencing skyrocketing growth rates , are worried that strict environmental regulations will dent their economic boom .
they want industrialized nations , the chief polluters , to bear the brunt of emission cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's rapid economic boom is taking a heavy toll on its environment merkel suggested that as a compromise , developing countries should be allowed to increase their emissions per capita while industrialized nations cut theirs , until both sides reach the same level .
the model is said to be based on a proposal by indian prime minister manmohan singh at the g-8 summit in june in germany .
that conference , hosted by merkel , set a non-binding goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 within the eu .
merkel also underlined the need to forge a successor climate pact to the kyoto protocol which expires at the end of 2012 and which she helped draw up as germany 's environment minister in 1997 .
she however voiced caution about the carbon market , part of the kyoto protocol that allows countries that emit gas beyond their allowance to buy credits from companies or countries below their target levels .
the system also exists for companies in the european union .
" it is a wise , market-oriented measure but we need to be careful as it can go in the wrong direction , " merkel said .
" for example , if a coal factory merely moves from europe to a foreign country because it can sell the carbon credit , that 's meaningless , " she said .
merkel wants us on board merkel said detailed targets needed to be set soon if the world wants to slow global warming .
" the question is , how do we distribute -lrb- reduction targets -rrb- in the world ?
i do n't believe that it 's enough to just agree that everyone will do their best .
i do n't believe that would yield an impressive result , " she said .
time is running out in the fight against global warming , she said , adding that the united states must be part of any global deal to slash carbon dioxide emissions .
" i think america will cooperate - america must cooperate .
if we ca n't find a regulatory regime that is accepted by the usa , then china and india will never agree to reduction targets , " merkel said .
the fight against climate change is the overarching theme of merkel 's visit to japan .
japan is to host the next g8 summit in hokkaido in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look no ties !
merkel with abe honoring japan 's " cool biz " campaign on wednesday , merkel and japanese prime minister shinzo abe went into talks to map out ways to work with major polluters to achieve goals for greenhouse gas reductions by pointing out that no one in their delegations was wearing a tie , in honor of japan 's " cool biz " campaign to dress lighter in summer and reduce air conditioning use .
japanese opposition skeptical of afghanistan mission separately , merkel ruffled feathers among japan 's opposition on thursday by urging the country to maintain its support for the " war on terror " in afghanistan .
" you do n't have to follow the unilateral opinion of the united states , " main opposition leader ichiro ozawa told merkel in a meeting , as quoted by tsuyoshi yamaguchi , the opposition 's shadow foreign minister .
germany is heavily involved in afghanistan , where it has contributed some 3,000 troops to the nato-led international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and has six tornado reconnaissance planes helping to spot taliban hideouts . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany , japan close ranks on efforts to fight climate change kicking off her three-day tour of japan , german chancellor merkel told prime minister abe that japan must help germany in combating climate change .
the two leaders also discussed their involvement in afghanistan .

she can prove her earnestness soon as she tries to recruit allies in china and japan this month .

a german woman has realized there 's a lot to be said for the hair of the dog .
she 's started a business making clothes for customers from the fur of their pet dogs . bearded collies are not the perfect pets for fastidious housekeepers .
throughout the year , they tend to shed their hair on carpets , beds and sofas .
it 's enough to make their owners sick as a dog .
but 50-year-old bettina menkhoff , a primary school teacher who lives in stoetze in the lüneberger heide with four such four-footed friends , decided that all that lovely fur should n't go to waste .
three years ago , she taught herself how to turn it into yarn , and has been making scarves , gloves and other clothes ever since .
her internet business now attracts customers from across the country , all putting a stylish new spin on the proverbial hair shirt .
" it only works when the hair is longer than four centimetres , " she explained .
" i regularly brush my dogs and keep the hair for processing .
it 's warmer than sheep wool . "
as fabric , pet hair appears to be a lot more emotionally charged than anything lagerfeld or lacroix ever work with .
these days , menkhoff can barely keep up with demand .
fortunately , she 's found a new supplier - a local dog salon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one day , he 'll be a scarf " some clients specifically want me to use hair from other animals too , " said menkhoff .
" they dread the day their pet dies and all they 're left with is a scarf hanging in the closet . "

" in the overall interest of the community , " there are grounds to leave the possibility of continuing these anti-dumping measures for up to another year , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger told journalists .
" we have to balance environmental interests with the interest of fair trade , " he added .
" this is a rapid-changing market reality and so some transitional measures were warranted . "
unfair competition the commission introduced the anti-dumping tariffs of up to 66 percent in 2001 after an investigation concluded that competition between eu and chinese manufacturers was unfair .
the duties on the power-saving light bulbs made in china raise prices for european customers by up to two-thirds .
for now , less than 20 percent of power-saving bulbs are made in europe , while over two-thirds are imported from china .
but at the end of july , a majority of the experts gave backing to a proposal from mandelson to let the duties lapse .
afp news service reported that according to mandelson 's spokesman , only one out of four european producers had been keen to retain the trade charges .
german lighting company osram , a subsidiary of siemens , had led calls to renew the duties because they hit dutch rival philips harder than osram , though both companies produce in china .
impeding green progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eco-friendly bulbs will soon be mandatory this week 's decision , which contravenes the eu 's intention to reduce its growing energy bill , has triggered outrage among environmentalists , who feel the brussels ' contradiction is deeply hypocritical .
earlier this year , eu leaders proposed that traditional , but inefficient , incandescent bulbs be phased out across the bloc by 2009 , as one of a series of measures aimed at reducing carbon emissions .
environmentalists argue that the continued duties will restrict european consumers ' access to cheaper , low-energy technology .
" -lrb- this proposal -rrb- is disappointing , unfair and seriously inconsistent with the ambitious eu targets to improve energy efficiency in europe and to curb climate change , " the conservation organization wwf said in a press release , quoted by afp .
" on the one hand , europe has committed to an ambitious energy efficiency objective , and on the other hand it continues to impose taxes on imports of green products , " the group 's trade and investment specialist eivind hoff said .
retailer resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osram wanted the charges to stay in place further resistance is expected to come from retailers , who may well see it as a means of protecting major eu producers .
" the commission needs to put the environment before the narrow self-interests of a minority of member countries and scrap import duties on chinese bulbs , " the head of the british retail consortium , kevin hawkins , told the independent newspaper .
according to afp , the conservative british eu lawmaker syed kamall described the decision as " farcical and indefensible . "
" the light bulb industry wants the duties scrapped , consumers want them scrapped and common sense says they should be scrapped ; yet the european commission has once again bowed to protectionist pressures , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 30.08.2007 brussels to retain tariffs on low energy light bulbs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists say brussels still has n't seen the light environmentalists are unhappy with a european commission proposal to maintain long-running charges that raise the price on imported low-energy light bulbs from china . despite trade commissioner peter mandelson 's push to let the six-year-old duties lapse when they expire in mid october , eu commissioners caved in to calls from european industry and agreed wednesday that the anti-dumping measures initiated in 2001 should be extended for another year .
" in the overall interest of the community , " there are grounds to leave the possibility of continuing these anti-dumping measures for up to another year , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger told journalists .
" we have to balance environmental interests with the interest of fair trade , " he added .
" this is a rapid-changing market reality and so some transitional measures were warranted . "
unfair competition the commission introduced the anti-dumping tariffs of up to 66 percent in 2001 after an investigation concluded that competition between eu and chinese manufacturers was unfair .
the duties on the power-saving light bulbs made in china raise prices for european customers by up to two-thirds .
for now , less than 20 percent of power-saving bulbs are made in europe , while over two-thirds are imported from china .
but at the end of july , a majority of the experts gave backing to a proposal from mandelson to let the duties lapse .
afp news service reported that according to mandelson 's spokesman , only one out of four european producers had been keen to retain the trade charges .
german lighting company osram , a subsidiary of siemens , had led calls to renew the duties because they hit dutch rival philips harder than osram , though both companies produce in china .
impeding green progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eco-friendly bulbs will soon be mandatory this week 's decision , which contravenes the eu 's intention to reduce its growing energy bill , has triggered outrage among environmentalists , who feel the brussels ' contradiction is deeply hypocritical .
earlier this year , eu leaders proposed that traditional , but inefficient , incandescent bulbs be phased out across the bloc by 2009 , as one of a series of measures aimed at reducing carbon emissions .
environmentalists argue that the continued duties will restrict european consumers ' access to cheaper , low-energy technology .
" -lrb- this proposal -rrb- is disappointing , unfair and seriously inconsistent with the ambitious eu targets to improve energy efficiency in europe and to curb climate change , " the conservation organization wwf said in a press release , quoted by afp .
" on the one hand , europe has committed to an ambitious energy efficiency objective , and on the other hand it continues to impose taxes on imports of green products , " the group 's trade and investment specialist eivind hoff said .
retailer resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osram wanted the charges to stay in place further resistance is expected to come from retailers , who may well see it as a means of protecting major eu producers .
" the commission needs to put the environment before the narrow self-interests of a minority of member countries and scrap import duties on chinese bulbs , " the head of the british retail consortium , kevin hawkins , told the independent newspaper .
according to afp , the conservative british eu lawmaker syed kamall described the decision as " farcical and indefensible . "
" the light bulb industry wants the duties scrapped , consumers want them scrapped and common sense says they should be scrapped ; yet the european commission has once again bowed to protectionist pressures , " he said .
the decision still has to be approved by anti-dumping experts from the european union 's member states . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 30.08.2007 merkel proposes new blueprint to fight global warming großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , here on a recent visit to greenland , is serious about combating global warming german chancellor merkel 's proposed new plan to curb climate change foresees linking caps on co2 emissions to the population of a country .
it could be of particular interest to large emerging nations china and india . in a speech during her first visit to japan as german chancellor , angela merkel said thursday both developing and industrialized nations need to agree on specific targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions .
" we have to assume that emerging nations naturally do n't want the same responsibility " as industrialized nations , the chancellor said , speaking at a symposium organized by japan 's nikkei media group in tokyo .
a more palatable pact for emerging nations developing countries such as india and china , experiencing skyrocketing growth rates , are worried that strict environmental regulations will dent their economic boom .
they want industrialized nations , the chief polluters , to bear the brunt of emission cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's rapid economic boom is taking a heavy toll on its environment merkel suggested that as a compromise , developing countries should be allowed to increase their emissions per capita while industrialized nations cut theirs , until both sides reach the same level .
the model is said to be based on a proposal by indian prime minister manmohan singh at the g-8 summit in june in germany .
that conference , hosted by merkel , set a non-binding goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 within the eu .
merkel also underlined the need to forge a successor climate pact to the kyoto protocol which expires at the end of 2012 and which she helped draw up as germany 's environment minister in 1997 .
she however voiced caution about the carbon market , part of the kyoto protocol that allows countries that emit gas beyond their allowance to buy credits from companies or countries below their target levels .
the system also exists for companies in the european union .
" it is a wise , market-oriented measure but we need to be careful as it can go in the wrong direction , " merkel said .
" for example , if a coal factory merely moves from europe to a foreign country because it can sell the carbon credit , that 's meaningless , " she said .
merkel wants us on board merkel said detailed targets needed to be set soon if the world wants to slow global warming .
" the question is , how do we distribute -lrb- reduction targets -rrb- in the world ?
i do n't believe that it 's enough to just agree that everyone will do their best .
i do n't believe that would yield an impressive result , " she said .
time is running out in the fight against global warming , she said , adding that the united states must be part of any global deal to slash carbon dioxide emissions .
" i think america will cooperate - america must cooperate .
if we ca n't find a regulatory regime that is accepted by the usa , then china and india will never agree to reduction targets , " merkel said .
the fight against climate change is the overarching theme of merkel 's visit to japan .
japan is to host the next g8 summit in hokkaido in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look no ties !
merkel with abe honoring japan 's " cool biz " campaign on wednesday , merkel and japanese prime minister shinzo abe went into talks to map out ways to work with major polluters to achieve goals for greenhouse gas reductions by pointing out that no one in their delegations was wearing a tie , in honor of japan 's " cool biz " campaign to dress lighter in summer and reduce air conditioning use .
japanese opposition skeptical of afghanistan mission separately , merkel ruffled feathers among japan 's opposition on thursday by urging the country to maintain its support for the " war on terror " in afghanistan .
" you do n't have to follow the unilateral opinion of the united states , " main opposition leader ichiro ozawa told merkel in a meeting , as quoted by tsuyoshi yamaguchi , the opposition 's shadow foreign minister .
germany is heavily involved in afghanistan , where it has contributed some 3,000 troops to the nato-led international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- and has six tornado reconnaissance planes helping to spot taliban hideouts . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german embassy has " already received several enquiries about the location of so-called no-go areas for foreign visitors to germany , " kauder told german daily rheinischen post .
kauder , who is parliamentary leader of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , admitted that all indians who had anything to do either economically or politically with germany had taken note of the incident in eastern germany .
" even the reactions in germany -lrb- to the incident -rrb- are being carefully followed -lrb- in india -rrb- , " kauder said .
the politician pointed out that indians , however , are making an effort not to play up the incident .
" the indians recognize that these events in mügeln are not the rule in germany , " he said , adding that chancellor merkel 's condemnation of the attacks had done much to calm the situation .
a hate crime ?
the incident took place ten days ago during a village festival in the eastern german state of saxony .
a german mob of over 50 people chased and attacked a group of eight indians who took refuge in a pizzeria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer patrols the area near the pizzeria owned by a pakistani the frenzied mob broke down the door and assaulted the indians .
police forces eventually arrived on the scene , but it took a while for the large squad of 70 police officers to force back the crowd .
the attack left 14 people wounded , including four of the attackers , two police officers and the eight indians , some of whom were beaten so badly they needed medical attention .
according to saxony 's state prosecutor , 82 witnesses have so far been interviewed in connection with the attack .
the police confirmed on tuesday that they are investigating seven suspects . state police chief , bernd merbitz , told the associated press that the actions had not been committed by a particular extreme-right group .
nonetheless , he said , the chanting of slogans such as " foreigners out ! " and " germany for germans " constituted a xenophobic criminal offence .
heated debate in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quiet town of mügeln was turned into a riot-zone the incident has triggered outrage in germany after photos of the bruised and wounded indians were splashed on the front pages of all major media in the country .
the attack has also prompted a heated debate about the need to counter racism and xenophobia , which statistics show is more widespread in former communist east germany .
it has also led to renewed calls by some politicians to ban the far-right , anti-immigrant npd party which is represented in two state parliaments in eastern germany . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german embassy has " already received several enquiries about the location of so-called no-go areas for foreign visitors to germany , " kauder told german daily rheinischen post .
kauder , who is parliamentary leader of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , admitted that all indians who had anything to do either economically or politically with germany had taken note of the incident in eastern germany .
" even the reactions in germany -lrb- to the incident -rrb- are being carefully followed -lrb- in india -rrb- , " kauder said .
the politician pointed out that indians , however , are making an effort not to play up the incident .
" the indians recognize that these events in mügeln are not the rule in germany , " he said , adding that chancellor merkel 's condemnation of the attacks had done much to calm the situation .
a hate crime ?
the incident took place ten days ago during a village festival in the eastern german state of saxony .
a german mob of over 50 people chased and attacked a group of eight indians who took refuge in a pizzeria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police officer patrols the area near the pizzeria owned by a pakistani the frenzied mob broke down the door and assaulted the indians .
police forces eventually arrived on the scene , but it took a while for the large squad of 70 police officers to force back the crowd .
the attack left 14 people wounded , including four of the attackers , two police officers and the eight indians , some of whom were beaten so badly they needed medical attention .
according to saxony 's state prosecutor , 82 witnesses have so far been interviewed in connection with the attack .
the police confirmed on tuesday that they are investigating seven suspects . state police chief , bernd merbitz , told the associated press that the actions had not been committed by a particular extreme-right group .
nonetheless , he said , the chanting of slogans such as " foreigners out ! " and " germany for germans " constituted a xenophobic criminal offence .
heated debate in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quiet town of mügeln was turned into a riot-zone the incident has triggered outrage in germany after photos of the bruised and wounded indians were splashed on the front pages of all major media in the country .
the attack has also prompted a heated debate about the need to counter racism and xenophobia , which statistics show is more widespread in former communist east germany .
it has also led to renewed calls by some politicians to ban the far-right , anti-immigrant npd party which is represented in two state parliaments in eastern germany . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german woman has realized there 's a lot to be said for the hair of the dog .
she 's started a business making clothes for customers from the fur of their pet dogs . bearded collies are not the perfect pets for fastidious housekeepers .
throughout the year , they tend to shed their hair on carpets , beds and sofas .
it 's enough to make their owners sick as a dog .
but 50-year-old bettina menkhoff , a primary school teacher who lives in stoetze in the lüneberger heide with four such four-footed friends , decided that all that lovely fur should n't go to waste .
three years ago , she taught herself how to turn it into yarn , and has been making scarves , gloves and other clothes ever since .
her internet business now attracts customers from across the country , all putting a stylish new spin on the proverbial hair shirt .
" it only works when the hair is longer than four centimetres , " she explained .
" i regularly brush my dogs and keep the hair for processing .
it 's warmer than sheep wool . "
as fabric , pet hair appears to be a lot more emotionally charged than anything lagerfeld or lacroix ever work with .

the oceanographers will study whether warming in the arctic ocean could have a knock-on effect on the uk climate .
experts estimate the ocean 's ice cover is declining by 38,000 sq miles -lrb- 98,420 sq km -rrb- per year , equivalent to an area five times the size of wales .
the expedition will cross the north pole in an ice-breaker .
the ship will sail from murmansk , in north west russia next week , crossing the laptev and east siberian seas , before heading north through the arctic ocean and across the pole , where at this time of year the ice is under nine metres thick .
dr tom rippeth , from the university 's school of ocean sciences , said : " the arctic is being hit hard by global warming .
the ship sails from murmansk in russia on 5 september " whilst average temperatures globally have risen by less than 1c , in the arctic average temperatures have risen by 3c , in the past few decades . "
two of the university 's oceanographers dr phil wiles and ben powell , originally from cefn mawr near wrexham , will join a multinational team from the uk , usa , canada and russia .
dr rippeth added " whilst the arctic ocean is in nobody 's backyard , it plays a major role in determining our climate through its influence on major ocean currents such as the gulf stream . "
" climate changes occurring there will have a huge , but as yet unknown , impact on the amount of freshwater entering the arctic ocean .
satellite data melting ice dilutes sea water , changing its density , which can impact on ocean currents " we know that the extent of the polar ice cover has shrunk dramatically in the past 30 years , " said dr rippeth .
" the question is how will this affect the atlantic circulation , which is a key determinate of our climate here in the uk . "
the uk team , which also includes scientists from london , cambridge and southampton , will take measurements on board the ship , as well as using satellite data and computer models .
the work is funded by the uk 's natural environment research council and is part of the international polar year , a two-year scientific programme which started in march .

gerard cavlan , an all-ireland medal winner , is a senior figure in a dog fighting operation known as the bulldog sanctuary kennels .
the 17-month investigation , led by reporter mandy mcauley , uncovered 15 illegal dog fighting gangs in ni .
earlier this year , cavlan , from dungannon , was convicted of possessing a dangerous dog and fined £ 650 .
in april , dungannon magistrates court was told that cavlan had merely collected the dog from kennels for a dublin man and was not involved in any other illegal activities .
however , with the aid of a trained undercover operative and secret filming , the spotlight team discovered that this was not true .
during secret filming , after being raided by the uspca , cavlan admitted to spotlight that he still had " a dozen or 15 dogs " .
he also talked about the strength and skill of a pit bull terrier in a fight .
" sure he had him in the chest , and he shook him and he shook him for 25 minutes ... if he had n't got you killed in half an hour ... he was in trouble , you know .
a real hard mouthed dog , " he said .
you could hear the skin and flesh tearing as every wound was inflicted five of the 15 gangs found to be operating in northern ireland are based in belfast and some of these groups have links to international dog fighting organisations .
one of the gangs , the tandragee based farmers boys , was infiltrated by spotlight .
the farmers boys are involved in dog fighting matches both in northern ireland and internationally .
after being taken into the inner circle of group , spotlight 's undercover operator was permitted access to a dog fight in tandragee .
he said the scenes he saw during a fight were horrific .
" the most shocking thing was seeing the dogs being ripped apart and being covered in puncture wounds with gristle coming out of it and bites down to the bone where you could see the white of the bone underneath , " he said .
" you could hear the skin and flesh tearing as every wound was inflicted . "
the spotlight team filmed dog fights using undercover cameras the investigation also led the spotlight team to finland where it uncovered an international dog fighting ring and discovered how illegal pit bulls are transported from europe into northern ireland .
it also uncovered how the dogs were trained and are forced into practice fights or " rolls " from as young as 10-months-old .
while in finland , the spotlight team won the trust of leading pit bull breeder robert gonzales who explained how easily pit bulls could be exported into northern ireland .
when asked if he registered a dog being exported out of the country as a pit bull on its animal passport , gonzales explained that he tricked customs officials by marking it as a mixed breed .
" i 've imported a lot of dogs so i know how to fool , fool the customs ... all you need is a computer and a printer , " he said .
the uspca will be following up on spotlight 's findings .

gerard cavlan , an all-ireland medal winner , is a senior figure in a dog fighting operation known as the bulldog sanctuary kennels .
the 17-month investigation , led by reporter mandy mcauley , uncovered 15 illegal dog fighting gangs in ni .
earlier this year , cavlan , from dungannon , was convicted of possessing a dangerous dog and fined £ 650 .
in april , dungannon magistrates court was told that cavlan had merely collected the dog from kennels for a dublin man and was not involved in any other illegal activities .
however , with the aid of a trained undercover operative and secret filming , the spotlight team discovered that this was not true .
during secret filming , after being raided by the uspca , cavlan admitted to spotlight that he still had " a dozen or 15 dogs " .
he also talked about the strength and skill of a pit bull terrier in a fight .
" sure he had him in the chest , and he shook him and he shook him for 25 minutes ... if he had n't got you killed in half an hour ... he was in trouble , you know .
a real hard mouthed dog , " he said .
you could hear the skin and flesh tearing as every wound was inflicted five of the 15 gangs found to be operating in northern ireland are based in belfast and some of these groups have links to international dog fighting organisations .
one of the gangs , the tandragee based farmers boys , was infiltrated by spotlight .
the farmers boys are involved in dog fighting matches both in northern ireland and internationally .
after being taken into the inner circle of group , spotlight 's undercover operator was permitted access to a dog fight in tandragee .
he said the scenes he saw during a fight were horrific .
" the most shocking thing was seeing the dogs being ripped apart and being covered in puncture wounds with gristle coming out of it and bites down to the bone where you could see the white of the bone underneath , " he said .
" you could hear the skin and flesh tearing as every wound was inflicted . "
the spotlight team filmed dog fights using undercover cameras the investigation also led the spotlight team to finland where it uncovered an international dog fighting ring and discovered how illegal pit bulls are transported from europe into northern ireland .
it also uncovered how the dogs were trained and are forced into practice fights or " rolls " from as young as 10-months-old .
while in finland , the spotlight team won the trust of leading pit bull breeder robert gonzales who explained how easily pit bulls could be exported into northern ireland .
when asked if he registered a dog being exported out of the country as a pit bull on its animal passport , gonzales explained that he tricked customs officials by marking it as a mixed breed .
" i 've imported a lot of dogs so i know how to fool , fool the customs ... all you need is a computer and a printer , " he said .
the uspca will be following up on spotlight 's findings .

the horses are based at randwick racecourse in sydney , the headquarters of racing in new south wales .
the racecourse will be quarantined for 30 days to try to contain the outbreak .
the flu was first detected in recreational horses in sydney last week , forcing a ban on horse movements and the cancellation of race meetings .
the primary industries minister for new south wales , ian macdonald , said the flu could spread quickly through the randwick stables , where some 700 thoroughbreds are based .

all 129 non-private prisons suffered disruption on wednesday after the surprise walkout by some 20,000 staff in a row over pay .
a high court injunction was granted against the prison officers ' association -lrb- poa -rrb- , and union leaders eventually called off the strike .
the government and the poa are due to hold fresh talks on friday .
the poa said justice secretary jack straw had offered " full and meaningful " talks and that it hoped this was " not merely a stalling tactic " .
' point made ' mr straw said : " i am glad that the poa has issued this instruction to return to work . "
a spokeswoman said mr straw had arranged to meet the union 's leadership on friday , before he knew about the strikes .
prison officer salaries auxiliary staff : £ 13,318 storeman : £ 14,942 night patrol : £ 14,084 entry officer min : £ 17,744 prison officer : £ 27,530 senior officer : £ 29.371 principal officer : £ 31,913 recommended top pay in posts source : office for manpower economics , april 2007 q & a : prison officer strike prisoner found dead bbc home affairs correspondent daniel sandford said he thought many members of the poa felt they had " made their point " but that they had not won anything in terms of the negotiations .
poa chairman colin moses told bbc news he could not rule out further strike action .
" those decisions will be made by my membership , " he said .
" what seems to have been forgotten here is that we balloted our membership .
" what we have been asking for specifically since april is for someone to talk to us about the disgraceful way we have been treated .
" for two years running -lsb- we have received -rsb- below inflation pay awards when we have 80,000 prisoners . "
' traumatic times ' david wilson , a former prison governor who is now professor of criminology at the university of central england , told bbc radio 4 's today that the strike had been " undoubtedly illegal " and " potentially very dangerous " .
but he said it had successfully drawn public attention to the prison officers ' situation and the conditions they work in .
" since 1997 , 25,000 more people have been put in jail but the prison officers ' pay has not gone up accordingly , " he said .
" the prison officers ' association have a voice .
i despair of prison governors actually saying anything about the current overcrowding . "
the strike action came after the union pulled out of a no-strike agreement with government .
the poa said the government had failed to deliver on " promise after promise " and it decided to call the strike without prior warning to avoid attracting a court order .
an independent pay review body for prisons has recommended a 2.5 % salary increase but the 28,000-member poa said the value of the rise is reduced to below inflation by being introduced in two stages .
poa general secretary brian caton said : " after a day of what we describe as somewhat traumatic times in the history of the union , we will lead our membership back to work and we will do that in an orderly fashion and that is regardless of any court injunction . "
meanwhile , prime minister gordon brown , speaking on thursday morning , said inflation had been tackled over the past 10 years through " discipline in pay awards " .
" the staging of pay awards is a crucial part of the fight against inflation , " he said .
visitors turned away the government , which described the strike as illegal and unjustified , has denied it failed to address concerns about pay and falling morale among prison staff .
during wednesday 's strike , prisoners were kept locked in their cells , senior managers took charge of duties such as distributing meals and visitors were turned away .
among the prisons affected were : liverpool , where 25 to 30 striking officers temporarily suspended their action to deal with three inmates who had climbed on to a roof birmingham where fire engines attended to deal with two minor blazes frankland high-security prison , county durham , where a handful of striking officers volunteered to go back to work because of the danger posed by inmates wormwood scrubs , manchester , cardiff , dartmoor , exeter and wakefield , where poa officials claimed 745 inmates - including soham killer ian huntley - were guarded by no more than 20 senior managers the association of chief police officers said police cells were used for about 900 inmates who could not return to their normal prison after court appearances and for those newly sentenced .
granting the injunction , high court judge mr justice ramsey said there was an " overwhelming case " that a legally binding agreement had been broken .
mr justice ramsey said any strike would have " particularly difficult consequences " for prisons already filled to capacity .
the prison population in england and wales is close to capacity levels , with about 80,000 people currently held .

all 129 non-private prisons suffered disruption on wednesday after the surprise walkout by some 20,000 staff in a row over pay .
a high court injunction was granted against the prison officers ' association -lrb- poa -rrb- , and union leaders eventually called off the strike .
the government and the poa are due to hold fresh talks on friday .
the poa said justice secretary jack straw had offered " full and meaningful " talks and that it hoped this was " not merely a stalling tactic " .
' point made ' mr straw said : " i am glad that the poa has issued this instruction to return to work . "
a spokeswoman said mr straw had arranged to meet the union 's leadership on friday , before he knew about the strikes .
prison officer salaries auxiliary staff : £ 13,318 storeman : £ 14,942 night patrol : £ 14,084 entry officer min : £ 17,744 prison officer : £ 27,530 senior officer : £ 29.371 principal officer : £ 31,913 recommended top pay in posts source : office for manpower economics , april 2007 q & a : prison officer strike prisoner found dead bbc home affairs correspondent daniel sandford said he thought many members of the poa felt they had " made their point " but that they had not won anything in terms of the negotiations .
poa chairman colin moses told bbc news he could not rule out further strike action .
" those decisions will be made by my membership , " he said .
" what seems to have been forgotten here is that we balloted our membership .
" what we have been asking for specifically since april is for someone to talk to us about the disgraceful way we have been treated .
" for two years running -lsb- we have received -rsb- below inflation pay awards when we have 80,000 prisoners . "
' traumatic times ' david wilson , a former prison governor who is now professor of criminology at the university of central england , told bbc radio 4 's today that the strike had been " undoubtedly illegal " and " potentially very dangerous " .
but he said it had successfully drawn public attention to the prison officers ' situation and the conditions they work in .
" since 1997 , 25,000 more people have been put in jail but the prison officers ' pay has not gone up accordingly , " he said .
" the prison officers ' association have a voice .
i despair of prison governors actually saying anything about the current overcrowding . "
prison officers and their dogs on strike at wormwood scrubs , london the strike action came after the union pulled out of a no-strike agreement with government .
the poa said the government had failed to deliver on " promise after promise " and it decided to call the strike without prior warning to avoid attracting a court order .
an independent pay review body for prisons has recommended a 2.5 % salary increase but the 28,000-member poa said the value of the rise is reduced to below inflation by being introduced in two stages .
poa general secretary brian caton said : " after a day of what we describe as somewhat traumatic times in the history of the union , we will lead our membership back to work and we will do that in an orderly fashion and that is regardless of any court injunction . "
meanwhile , prime minister gordon brown , speaking on thursday morning , said inflation had been tackled over the past 10 years through " discipline in pay awards " .
" the staging of pay awards is a crucial part of the fight against inflation , " he said .
visitors turned away the government , which described the strike as illegal and unjustified , has denied it failed to address concerns about pay and falling morale among prison staff .
during wednesday 's strike , prisoners were kept locked in their cells , senior managers took charge of duties such as distributing meals and visitors were turned away .
among the prisons affected were : liverpool , where 25 to 30 striking officers temporarily suspended their action to deal with three inmates who had climbed on to a roof birmingham where fire engines attended to deal with two minor blazes frankland high-security prison , county durham , where a handful of striking officers volunteered to go back to work because of the danger posed by inmates wormwood scrubs , manchester , cardiff , dartmoor , exeter and wakefield , where poa officials claimed 745 inmates - including soham killer ian huntley - were guarded by no more than 20 senior managers the association of chief police officers said police cells were used for about 900 inmates who could not return to their normal prison after court appearances and for those newly sentenced .
granting the injunction , high court judge mr justice ramsey said there was an " overwhelming case " that a legally binding agreement had been broken .
mr justice ramsey said any strike would have " particularly difficult consequences " for prisons already filled to capacity .
the prison population in england and wales is close to capacity levels , with about 80,000 people currently held .

' traumatic times ' david wilson , a former prison governor who is now professor of criminology at the university of central england , told bbc radio 4 's today that the strike had been " undoubtedly illegal " and " potentially very dangerous " .
but he said it had successfully drawn public attention to the prison officers ' situation and the conditions they work in .

the poa said the government had failed to deliver on " promise after promise " and it decided to call the strike without prior warning to avoid attracting a court order .
an independent pay review body for prisons has recommended a 2.5 % salary increase but the 28,000-member poa said the value of the rise is reduced to below inflation by being introduced in two stages .
poa general secretary brian caton said : " after a day of what we describe as somewhat traumatic times in the history of the union , we will lead our membership back to work and we will do that in an orderly fashion and that is regardless of any court injunction . "
meanwhile , prime minister gordon brown , speaking on thursday morning , said inflation had been tackled over the past 10 years through " discipline in pay awards " .
" the staging of pay awards is a crucial part of the fight against inflation , " he said .
visitors turned away the government , which described the strike as illegal and unjustified , has denied it failed to address concerns about pay and falling morale among prison staff .
during wednesday 's strike , prisoners were kept locked in their cells , senior managers took charge of duties such as distributing meals and visitors were turned away .
among the prisons affected were : liverpool , where 25 to 30 striking officers temporarily suspended their action to deal with three inmates who had climbed on to a roof birmingham where fire engines attended to deal with two minor blazes frankland high-security prison , county durham , where a handful of striking officers volunteered to go back to work because of the danger posed by inmates wormwood scrubs , manchester , cardiff , dartmoor , exeter and wakefield , where poa officials claimed 745 inmates - including soham killer ian huntley - were guarded by no more than 20 senior managers the association of chief police officers said police cells were used for about 900 inmates who could not return to their normal prison after court appearances and for those newly sentenced .
granting the injunction , high court judge mr justice ramsey said there was an " overwhelming case " that a legally binding agreement had been broken .
mr justice ramsey said any strike would have " particularly difficult consequences " for prisons already filled to capacity .
the prison population in england and wales is close to capacity levels , with about 80,000 people currently held .

all 129 non-private prisons suffered disruption on wednesday after the surprise walkout by some 20,000 staff in a row over pay .
a high court injunction was granted against the prison officers ' association -lrb- poa -rrb- , and union leaders eventually called off the strike .
the government and the poa are due to hold fresh talks on friday .
the poa said justice secretary jack straw had offered " full and meaningful " talks and that it hoped this was " not merely a stalling tactic " .
' point made ' mr straw said : " i am glad that the poa has issued this instruction to return to work . "
a spokeswoman said mr straw had arranged to meet the union 's leadership on friday , before he knew about the strikes .

poa chairman colin moses told bbc news he could not rule out further strike action .
" those decisions will be made by my membership , " he said .
" what seems to have been forgotten here is that we balloted our membership .
" what we have been asking for specifically since april is for someone to talk to us about the disgraceful way we have been treated .
" for two years running -lsb- we have received -rsb- below inflation pay awards when we have 80,000 prisoners . "
' traumatic times ' david wilson , a former prison governor who is now professor of criminology at the university of central england , told bbc radio 4 's today that the strike had been " undoubtedly illegal " and " potentially very dangerous " .
but he said it had successfully drawn public attention to the prison officers ' situation and the conditions they work in .
" since 1997 , 25,000 more people have been put in jail but the prison officers ' pay has not gone up accordingly , " he said .
" the prison officers ' association have a voice .
i despair of prison governors actually saying anything about the current overcrowding . "
prison officers and their dogs on strike at wormwood scrubs , london the strike action came after the union pulled out of a no-strike agreement with government .
the poa said the government had failed to deliver on " promise after promise " and it decided to call the strike without prior warning to avoid attracting a court order .
an independent pay review body for prisons has recommended a 2.5 % salary increase but the 28,000-member poa said the value of the rise is reduced to below inflation by being introduced in two stages .
poa general secretary brian caton said : " after a day of what we describe as somewhat traumatic times in the history of the union , we will lead our membership back to work and we will do that in an orderly fashion and that is regardless of any court injunction . "
meanwhile , prime minister gordon brown , speaking on thursday morning , said inflation had been tackled over the past 10 years through " discipline in pay awards " .
" the staging of pay awards is a crucial part of the fight against inflation , " he said .
visitors turned away the government , which described the strike as illegal and unjustified , has denied it failed to address concerns about pay and falling morale among prison staff .
during wednesday 's strike , prisoners were kept locked in their cells , senior managers took charge of duties such as distributing meals and visitors were turned away .
among the prisons affected were : liverpool , where 25 to 30 striking officers temporarily suspended their action to deal with three inmates who had climbed on to a roof birmingham where fire engines attended to deal with two minor blazes frankland high-security prison , county durham , where a handful of striking officers volunteered to go back to work because of the danger posed by inmates wormwood scrubs , manchester , cardiff , dartmoor , exeter and wakefield , where poa officials claimed 745 inmates - including soham killer ian huntley - were guarded by no more than 20 senior managers the association of chief police officers said police cells were used for about 900 inmates who could not return to their normal prison after court appearances and for those newly sentenced .
granting the injunction , high court judge mr justice ramsey said there was an " overwhelming case " that a legally binding agreement had been broken .
mr justice ramsey said any strike would have " particularly difficult consequences " for prisons already filled to capacity .
the prison population in england and wales is close to capacity levels , with about 80,000 people currently held .

the prison officers ' dispute has the potential to be more dangerous .
this is partly because , it is being argued , it is entirely of his own making as it was mr brown who , when chancellor , refused to meet the independently-recommended pay rise in full .
and partly it is because the row throws into sharp focus the problems of overcrowding , alleged under-funding and plunging morale in the country 's jails .
finally the risk is that it might strengthen the resolve of other public sector workers , most notably nurses in england who are also considering industrial action after he similarly staged their recommended rise .
the nurses will decide in a couple of weeks ' time whether to accept a revised government 's pay package after some 95 % had voted to go ahead with a ballot on industrial action over the original pay award .
union movement the way mr brown deals with the prison officers ' dispute will be closely watched by those other workers and the opposition parties alike as they continue to assess just what sort of prime minister gordon brown intends to be .
it will also be a test of the prime minister 's relationship with the wider union movement - still labour 's biggest donors - which has often seen him as more sympathetic towards them than his predecessor .
so far , the prime minister is adamant he will do nothing to undermine economic stability , which has led to union fears there will be no room for improvement in their pay offer .
the tories , meanwhile , lost no time in attacking mr brown over the dispute , claiming he refused cash for more prison places and warning the dispute could compromise security .
inevitably , there will be talk of the possibility of a 1979-style winter of discontent when striking public sector workers effectively brought down the last labour government under jim callaghan .
that is currently premature , but mr brown and ministers like justice secretary jack straw are painfully aware of the importance of the public sector workers to a labour government .
future trouble mr straw acted immediately to win a court injunction against the strikers but the unions also won what they claimed were new talks with the government , with ministers clearly determined to halt this dispute before it escalates dangerously .
but there was even a row over whether that meeting had been planned before the strike or was a result of it .
the unions currently believe they can win public support for their action but that may be short lived , particularly if there is any suggestion safety is being compromised .
any sign of a climb-down by the government may well strengthen the determination of other public sector workers to push their claims or take industrial action .
but too tough a line may well escalate the dispute and spark bitterness and resentment amongst other public sector workers and store up trouble for the future .
what the prime minister will certainly not want is a lengthy , escalating dispute to bring his political honeymoon to a swift end and recall bad memories of past clashes between labour governments and the unions .

the prison officers ' dispute has the potential to be more dangerous .
prison officers have had their pay award staged this is partly because , it is being argued , it is entirely of his own making as it was mr brown who , when chancellor , refused to meet the independently-recommended pay rise in full .
and partly it is because the row throws into sharp focus the problems of overcrowding , alleged under-funding and plunging morale in the country 's jails .
finally the risk is that it might strengthen the resolve of other public sector workers , most notably nurses in england who are also considering industrial action after he similarly staged their recommended rise .
the nurses will decide in a couple of weeks ' time whether to accept a revised government 's pay package after some 95 % had voted to go ahead with a ballot on industrial action over the original pay award .
union movement the way mr brown deals with the prison officers ' dispute will be closely watched by those other workers and the opposition parties alike as they continue to assess just what sort of prime minister gordon brown intends to be .
it will also be a test of the prime minister 's relationship with the wider union movement - still labour 's biggest donors - which has often seen him as more sympathetic towards them than his predecessor .
mr straw has taken a hard line against strike so far , the prime minister is adamant he will do nothing to undermine economic stability , which has led to union fears there will be no room for improvement in their pay offer .
the tories , meanwhile , lost no time in attacking mr brown over the dispute , claiming he refused cash for more prison places and warning the dispute could compromise security .
inevitably , there will be talk of the possibility of a 1979-style winter of discontent when striking public sector workers effectively brought down the last labour government under jim callaghan .
that is currently premature , but mr brown and ministers like justice secretary jack straw are painfully aware of the importance of the public sector workers to a labour government .
future trouble mr straw acted immediately to win a court injunction against the strikers but the unions also won what they claimed were new talks with the government , with ministers clearly determined to halt this dispute before it escalates dangerously .
but there was even a row over whether that meeting had been planned before the strike or was a result of it .
the unions currently believe they can win public support for their action but that may be short lived , particularly if there is any suggestion safety is being compromised .
any sign of a climb-down by the government may well strengthen the determination of other public sector workers to push their claims or take industrial action .
but too tough a line may well escalate the dispute and spark bitterness and resentment amongst other public sector workers and store up trouble for the future .
what the prime minister will certainly not want is a lengthy , escalating dispute to bring his political honeymoon to a swift end and recall bad memories of past clashes between labour governments and the unions .

traders buy legitimate stock from cheaply priced countries , such as greece , and export those medicines to more expensive countries .
the uk is the biggest market for parallel traded drugs .
but critics point out that the selling on and repackaging of these medicines is undermining security and posing a serious risk to patients by allowing counterfeit products to enter the legitimate supply chain .

these were the first cases of their kind in this country .
