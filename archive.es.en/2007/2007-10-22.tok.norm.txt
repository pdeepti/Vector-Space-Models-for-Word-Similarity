it was the best-ever election result gained by a party since 1919 and consolidated its majority . the populist svp 's strengthened its position in parliament after it ran a controversial campaign calling for the expulsion of foreigners who commit serious crimes and for throwing out entire immigrant families .
party president ueli maurer attributed the win primarily to the party 's anti-immigration and anti-crime campaign .
" those who are against the eu , who want lower taxes , who want security and fewer criminal foreigners voted for the svp , " he said . the party was accused of racism and xenophobia for a campaign poster that showed white sheep kicking a black sheep off the swiss flag with the slogan , " for more security . "
it even earned the party condemnation from the united nations .
socialist : svp panders to people 's fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svp president , ueli maurer , was all smiles after hearing the results the swiss socialists suffered a major setback in the elections , losing 3.8 percent of their support and taking 19.5 percent of the vote .
socialist parliamentarian liliane maury pasquier said the svp had played on people 's fears of globalization and feeling of economic and social insecurity .
" the svp dresses all this up in xenophobic and anti-european colors , " she told the afp news agency .
" people think they are defending themselves by voting svp . "
the center-right radicals saw their share of the vote drop slightly and the christian democrats saw a slight gain , taking them to 15.6 percent and 14.6 percent respectively .
greens also a big winner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svp election posters sparked widespread protest at home and abroad the greens , the fifth biggest party , garnered 9.6 percent of the vote , up 2.2 percentage points from four years ago .

the socialists -lrb- sp -rrb- have 43 mandates .
the radicals and the christian democrats both gained 31 seats .
the greens gained six seats and will now be represented by 20 deputies .
this is their best performance in their history and reflects growing fears about climate change .
the country must now await the election of the cabinet in early december to see whether the new division of seats will alter the balance of power there .

schröder is also the deputy head of telekom 's supervisory board . schröder added that the union would fight any plans to cuts jobs .
the magazine did not say when the reported job cuts could take place . jobs outside the company a deutsche telekom spokesman , however , said the company 's calculations did not call for job cuts . " it 's not about dismissals , but employees who will keep their jobs outside of the company , " the spokesman said . deutsche telekom is europe 's biggest telecoms group .

now , they 've started production of a limited edition " strike bike " to prove the company 's viability . without a boss or manager in sight , the bicycles are being assembled by the 135 former employees of the bike systems company in nordhausen in the german state of thuringia .
production started on monday , and by friday , the group hopes to have the limited run of 1,800 pre-ordered bikes ready for shipping throughout germany and europe . " the mood is great , " said one of the occupying workers , eric schillat .
" we really hope that we will be able to continue to produce bikes on a permanent basis . " the group has occupied the bike systems factory since july , after the company was closed down and declared insolvent . but unless the former employers find an investor with several millions to spend , they 'll likely have to pack their tools and go home . us takeover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the workers have occupied the building 24 hours a day since july 10 . us private equity investor lone star acquired bike systems ' parent company , biria back in december 2005 .
once one of europe 's biggest bike manufacturers , it was drowning in debt when lone star took it over .
after shutting down another biria subsidiary at the end of 2006 , production at bike systems was stopped at the end of june .
ten days later , bike systems registered for insolvency . undeterred , the employees came up with the idea of producing the strike bike " we want to show potential investors that we have the capacity cover the costs of production , " schillat said . the three-speed bike , which is available in men 's and women 's models and comes in a symbolic red color , costs 275 euros .
customers needed to pay the sum in advance . " we do n't have any materials here , " schillat said , " you try ringing to order bike parts as a bankrupt firm . " uncertain future andré kegel , who used to supervise one of bike system 's production lines , called the strike bike " a symbolic action .

a microsoft spokesman told the afp news agency that the company would no longer appeal the court decision , signaling the end of a long court battle .
microsoft said its discussions with the commission were constructive and it " will continue to work closely with the commission and the industry to ensure a flourishing and competitive environment for information technology . "
the end of a legal saga the case dates back to march 2004 when the commission ruled after a five-year probe that microsoft was using its 95-percent share of the desktop computer market to bundle other products with the ubiquitous windows operating system .
the commission ordered the us-based multinational corporation to sell a version of their flagship windows operating system without a media player and to share technical information with competitors so that they could more easily create windows-compatible programs .
brussels fined microsoft a further 280 million euros in july last year after it emerged the company had not respected its original ruling . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was the best-ever election result gained by a party since 1919 and consolidated its majority . the populist svp 's strengthened its position in parliament after it ran a controversial campaign calling for the expulsion of foreigners who commit serious crimes and for throwing out entire immigrant families .
party president ueli maurer attributed the win primarily to the party 's anti-immigration and anti-crime campaign .
" those who are against the eu , who want lower taxes , who want security and fewer criminal foreigners voted for the svp , " he said . the party was accused of racism and xenophobia for a campaign poster that showed white sheep kicking a black sheep off the swiss flag with the slogan , " for more security . "
it even earned the party condemnation from the united nations .
socialist : svp panders to people 's fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svp president , ueli maurer , was all smiles after hearing the results the swiss socialists suffered a major setback in the elections , losing 3.8 percent of their support and taking 19.5 percent of the vote .
socialist parliamentarian liliane maury pasquier said the svp had played on people 's fears of globalization and feeling of economic and social insecurity .
" the svp dresses all this up in xenophobic and anti-european colors , " she told the afp news agency .
" people think they are defending themselves by voting svp . "
the center-right radicals saw their share of the vote drop slightly and the christian democrats saw a slight gain , taking them to 15.6 percent and 14.6 percent respectively .
greens also a big winner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svp election posters sparked widespread protest at home and abroad the greens , the fifth biggest party , garnered 9.6 percent of the vote , up 2.2 percentage points from four years ago .
the socialists ' losses were partly due to advances made by the greens .
in parliament in berne , the people 's party now have 62 of the 200 seats .
that is an increase of seven on their previous majority .
the socialists -lrb- sp -rrb- have 43 mandates .
the radicals and the christian democrats both gained 31 seats .
the greens gained six seats and will now be represented by 20 deputies .
this is their best performance in their history and reflects growing fears about climate change .
the country must now await the election of the cabinet in early december to see whether the new division of seats will alter the balance of power there .
the four main parties have shared the cabinet posts in an informal consensus knows as the " concordat " for 50 years .
it remains unclear whether the greens will now be included in the government . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he says the new government will face its toughest challenges at home rather than in the sphere of foreign policy . these were the most important parliamentary elections since the fall of communism 18 years ago .
and since voter turnout topped 50 percent for the first time in 14 years , many poles apparently thought so , too .
the electorate appears to have punished the law and justice party of the two kaczynski brothers severely for poisoning political life in poland , for creating an atmosphere of suspicion and adopting an aggressive tone .
civic platform -lrb- platforma obywatelska -rrb- , a party with a free-market philosophy , emerged as the victor because it understood that the majority could not be won over with the ideology and the language of the kaczynskis .
it has learned to tell voters what they want to hear .
it made attractive electoral pledges and went with the patriotic-conservative flow , hiding its free-market policies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubert wohlan there is a lot of evidence that the polish parliament will be able to live with less populism .
two parties that were part of the governing coalition until recently failed to make it over the 5 percent threshold to get into parliament .
after voters delivered a slap on the wrist to the ultra-roman catholic league of polish families and the radical rural-based self-defense party , there is hope that it is only a question of time before the political landscape recovers .
however , outgoing polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski and his squad will ensure that populism does not disappear from parliament , since their parties will still be represented there .
the true challenges await the victor on the domestic stage and not in the sphere of foreign policy .
the government will probably be made up of a coalition between civic platform and the liberal-conservative peasants ' party .
together they will have to reform the health service and patch up the ailing pension system .
very little was said about that in the election .
german-polish relations look set to benefit from the change of government .
the kaczynski brothers ' party neglected dialogue with germany and at times even refused to sit down at the table .
that is likely to change .

twelve turkish soldiers were killed by the pkk at the weekend . the eu commission has issued a statement sharply condemning the actions of the pkk , the outlawed kurdish workers ' party in southeastern turkey and expressing understanding for turkey 's need to protect its citizens . but enlargement commissioner olli rehn said turkey and iraq had to " solve the problem with cooperation and with regard to international law . " the german government has also appealed to turkey to show restraint .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier telephoned his turkish counterpart ali babacan to urge ankara to refrain from steps which could destabilize the region . government spokesman thomas steg renewed this call . ' sense of proportion ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish rebels operate near the turkish border " now it is important to avoid this fresh provocation leading to a spiral of violence in the region .
i appeal to the turkish government to act with a sense of proportion in this difficult situation and avoid a dangerous destabilization of the region , " steg said . the country 's defense minister , vecdi gönül , has said he will not immediately enter the region .
instead , he said , he will wait for joint action with the us . on sunday afternoon , at least 12 turkish soldiers were reported dead and 32 pkk members were killed in retaliation amid the bloodiest fighting in years between kurdish pkk rebels and turkish soldiers on the northern iraq border . in the wake of the news , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan held an emergency meeting of political and military leaders , including turkish president abdullah gül .
after the meeting gül issued a statement saying , " we will continue on our path of determination in fighting the terrorist organization .
we respect iraq 's national borders .
but -lrb- we -rrb- will not tolerate those who help and harbor terrorists . " according to turkish military reports , on sunday afternoon pkk fighters entered the turkish province hakkari from northern iraq , attacking an army post there .
spokesmen for the kurds say turkish solders have been taken hostage ; and turkish officials told afp news service that eight turkish soldiers are missing . turkish lawmakers allow attack but despite the intense border fighting , turkish defense minister gönül has said he would not immediately conduct a targeted invasion of the region .
he told his us counterpart robert gates at a meeting in kiev that the turkish military is , indeed , planning such an attack , but he prefer that it be led together with the us , news reports said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier condemned pkk attacks last wednesday , the turkish parliament laid the way for a military attack by green-lighting a plan to allow for an invasion , should it come to that .
the turkish government passed the plan following months of pleading for us support in the region .
turkey , the us and the eu all consider the pkk to be a terrorist group . washington hopes to avoid armed conflict in northern iraq , however .
it fears bringing turbulence into the last peaceful region of the country , and also worries about further damage to its own image as an occupying force . moreover , the current regime in teheran supports the underground pjak group , which works together with the pkk . for the past several months , pkk guerrilla fighters have been actively attacking turkish military interests from within northern iraq .
a total of around 100 turkish soldiers have died since the beginning of the year , prompting the turkish army to massively boost the numbers of soldiers in the border region to approximately 60,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan , left , and gül are hoping for us military support the pkk has been fighting for more autonomy in kurdish regions for more than 20 years . oil interests could be involved on saturday , the pkk threatened attacks on oil pipelines in the region if turkey decides in favor of military intervention in northern iraq .
exports of oil produced near the northern iraqi state of kirkuk travel via the turkish port of ceyhan . for its part , the iraqi parliament called for the pkk to leave the country .

some 35,000 jobs could come under the axe at giant deutsche telekom , on top of the tens of thousands already being lost , according to calculations made by german media . sales and restructuring could lead to major job cuts at deutsche telekom , according to a report published monday , oct .
22 , in the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel . the article cited " internal calculations " within the company , which employed some 249,000 people at the end of 2006 , 89,000 of them outside germany , as the reason behind the redundancies . the magazine said deutsche telekom boss rene obermann refused to comment on the figure , while stressing " the need to adapt and restructure " the group he has headed for the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark times could be coming for thousands more telekom employees " i think a job reduction of this size is realistic , " lothar schröder , chairman of the verdi trade union , told the süddeutsche zeitung on sunday .
schröder is also the deputy head of telekom 's supervisory board . schröder added that the union would fight any plans to cuts jobs .
the magazine did not say when the reported job cuts could take place . jobs outside the company a deutsche telekom spokesman , however , said the company 's calculations did not call for job cuts . " it 's not about dismissals , but employees who will keep their jobs outside of the company , " the spokesman said . deutsche telekom is europe 's biggest telecoms group .
it has had problems in its core german market because of heightened competition and has lost numerous clients to rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann took over as head of deutsche telekom in november under obermann , telekom is in the process of cutting 32,000 jobs by the end of 2008 and has shaved off another 50,000 in the service sector . " there are business areas that we will sell or look for partners for - that 's well known , " obermann told der spiegel .
" if we did not do this , the company as a whole would become less and less competitive . " buying and selling to continue the former german telecommunication monopoly has sold off subsidiaries in spain and france , but has also bought a cellular phone company in the united states .
at the beginning of july , telekom upset trade unions by shifting 50,000 jobs in its troubled t-com land-line unit into three independent companies , where employees would be forced to work longer hours for less pay . in an interview sunday , obermann said the group would step up investments in developing nations , where the telecommunications sector is booming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's iphone provider , telekom said rates would be under 50 euros per month " in the long term , i can see us investing in developing countries because there is a dearth of infrastructure in these nations , " he said on the n-tv news channel .
" we are far from achieving our full potential . " earlier this year , obermann had said the company did not have immediate plans to invest in emerging markets , and was accused of falling behind its rivals . since becoming a private company in 1995 , telekom has cut an average of 10,000 jobs per year , according to n-tv . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're looking over a reading list while a professor explains the focus of the upcoming semester .
the students ' surroundings are almost idyllic ; the small campus sits nestled among chestnut trees , the havel river murmurs just steps away , and the sun is shining on the kind of cool , crisp day . but these seven graduate students are embarking on a course of study that will have them focused for the next two years on one of the most horrifying events in the history of mankind , the murder of 6 million jews by the nazis . " i know it will be hard , but i 'm prepared and i think i can handle it , " said student lisa könig-hauff , 38 , who already has a degree in history and politics from cologne university .

in order to keep the holocaust from fading in our public memory , new ways at telling the story are needed , according to andreas nachama , director of touro college 's new holocaust institute . " those who work on holocaust exhibitions often present everything that they know to the visitor , " he said .
" that can overwhelm people , who end up leaving empty-handed .
that 's one of our key points , to find the right amount of information to communicate .

they will research theoretical aspects of memory and remembrance and get practical training , including an eight-week internship program next summer .
they will have a studio at their disposal where they can record interviews with eyewitnesses . " telling the individual stories in my opinion makes more sense than communicating simple facts , " said könig-hauff .
" and we need to learn to use all the new media possibilities in telling about this . " besides looking at new ways of communicating the enormity of the genocide , students will conduct their own research , and college officials and professors hope that new information will be uncovered along the way .
although more than six decades have passed since the liberation of the death camps , there is still much to be learned . " for example , there is the connection between german companies and the exploitation and looting of predominately jewish property , " said ingo loose , a professor who specializes in the economic aspects of the third reich and the holocaust .

but he says the new government will face its toughest challenges at home rather than in the sphere of foreign policy . these were the most important parliamentary elections since the fall of communism 18 years ago .
and since voter turnout topped 50 percent for the first time in 14 years , many poles apparently thought so , too .
the electorate appears to have punished the law and justice party of the two kaczynski brothers severely for poisoning political life in poland , for creating an atmosphere of suspicion and adopting an aggressive tone .
civic platform -lrb- platforma obywatelska -rrb- , a party with a free-market philosophy , emerged as the victor because it understood that the majority could not be won over with the ideology and the language of the kaczynskis .
it has learned to tell voters what they want to hear .
it made attractive electoral pledges and went with the patriotic-conservative flow , hiding its free-market policies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubert wohlan there is a lot of evidence that the polish parliament will be able to live with less populism .
two parties that were part of the governing coalition until recently failed to make it over the 5 percent threshold to get into parliament .
after voters delivered a slap on the wrist to the ultra-roman catholic league of polish families and the radical rural-based self-defense party , there is hope that it is only a question of time before the political landscape recovers .
however , outgoing polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski and his squad will ensure that populism does not disappear from parliament , since their parties will still be represented there .
the true challenges await the victor on the domestic stage and not in the sphere of foreign policy .
the government will probably be made up of a coalition between civic platform and the liberal-conservative peasants ' party .
together they will have to reform the health service and patch up the ailing pension system .
very little was said about that in the election .
german-polish relations look set to benefit from the change of government .
the kaczynski brothers ' party neglected dialogue with germany and at times even refused to sit down at the table .
that is likely to change .

now , they 've started production of a limited edition " strike bike " to prove the company 's viability . without a boss or manager in sight , the bicycles are being assembled by the 135 former employees of the bike systems company in nordhausen in the german state of thuringia .
production started on monday , and by friday , the group hopes to have the limited run of 1,800 pre-ordered bikes ready for shipping throughout germany and europe . " the mood is great , " said one of the occupying workers , eric schillat .
" we really hope that we will be able to continue to produce bikes on a permanent basis .

after shutting down another biria subsidiary at the end of 2006 , production at bike systems was stopped at the end of june .
ten days later , bike systems registered for insolvency . undeterred , the employees came up with the idea of producing the strike bike " we want to show potential investors that we have the capacity cover the costs of production , " schillat said . the three-speed bike , which is available in men 's and women 's models and comes in a symbolic red color , costs 275 euros .
customers needed to pay the sum in advance . " we do n't have any materials here , " schillat said , " you try ringing to order bike parts as a bankrupt firm .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 17-kilo bike only comes in one colour - red .
" you ca n't make any money with the strike bike , " he told the german daily die welt . in order to turn a profit , the nordhausen factory would have to manufacture at least 200,000 bikes a year .
and without an investor , the workers wo n't be able to raise the sums needed to keep the factory open .
according to kegel , for just the parts needed to produce that number , workers would need an advance of 7 to 8 million euros . and according to wolfgang wutzke , the head of the firm in charge of the insolvency , there still is n't an investor in sight . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , to take steps to comply with the bloc 's landmark 2004 antitrust decision against it . in a major turnaround of policy , the world 's largest software maker said it would comply with the eu 's 2004 antitrust ruling that said microsoft was abusing its dominant market position to crush rivals .
that will include making available to open-source software developers information they need so that their programs work smoothly with microsoft window 's operating system for personal computers .
in addition , microsoft will also reduce high royalties it requires from open source software developers for open source software developers to a nominal one-time payment of 10,000 euros , the eu commission said .
office desktop pcs use work group server software made by microsoft and others to sign on to , print and access files .
" a victory for the consumer " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes called the news a " victory for the consumer , " saying microsoft was finally taking concrete steps to comply with the 2004 ruling after several delays , two court decisions and daily penalty payments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroes said the move is good news for consumers kroes said microsoft ceo steve ballmer had assured her in a telephone conversation the company would fulfill all the conditions attached to the antitrust ruling .
" the repercussions of these changes will start now and will continue for years to come , " kroes told a news conference , adding that microsoft 's agreement would have " profound effects " on the software industry .
last month , the european court of first instance confirmed the eu 's 2004 antitrust finding that the world 's largest software maker had used its dominant market position to crush rivals .
it also backed the commission 's imposition of a record fine of 497 million euros -lrb- $ 690 million -rrb- .
a microsoft spokesman told the afp news agency that the company would no longer appeal the court decision , signaling the end of a long court battle .
microsoft said its discussions with the commission were constructive and it " will continue to work closely with the commission and the industry to ensure a flourishing and competitive environment for information technology . "
the end of a legal saga the case dates back to march 2004 when the commission ruled after a five-year probe that microsoft was using its 95-percent share of the desktop computer market to bundle other products with the ubiquitous windows operating system .
the commission ordered the us-based multinational corporation to sell a version of their flagship windows operating system without a media player and to share technical information with competitors so that they could more easily create windows-compatible programs .
brussels fined microsoft a further 280 million euros in july last year after it emerged the company had not respected its original ruling . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he says the new government will face its toughest challenges at home rather than in the sphere of foreign policy . these were the most important parliamentary elections since the fall of communism 18 years ago .
and since voter turnout topped 50 percent for the first time in 14 years , many poles apparently thought so , too .
the electorate appears to have punished the law and justice party of the two kaczynski brothers severely for poisoning political life in poland , for creating an atmosphere of suspicion and adopting an aggressive tone .
civic platform -lrb- platforma obywatelska -rrb- , a party with a free-market philosophy , emerged as the victor because it understood that the majority could not be won over with the ideology and the language of the kaczynskis .
it has learned to tell voters what they want to hear .
it made attractive electoral pledges and went with the patriotic-conservative flow , hiding its free-market policies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubert wohlan there is a lot of evidence that the polish parliament will be able to live with less populism .
two parties that were part of the governing coalition until recently failed to make it over the 5 percent threshold to get into parliament .
after voters delivered a slap on the wrist to the ultra-roman catholic league of polish families and the radical rural-based self-defense party , there is hope that it is only a question of time before the political landscape recovers .
however , outgoing polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski and his squad will ensure that populism does not disappear from parliament , since their parties will still be represented there .
the true challenges await the victor on the domestic stage and not in the sphere of foreign policy .
the government will probably be made up of a coalition between civic platform and the liberal-conservative peasants ' party .
together they will have to reform the health service and patch up the ailing pension system .
very little was said about that in the election .
german-polish relations look set to benefit from the change of government .
the kaczynski brothers ' party neglected dialogue with germany and at times even refused to sit down at the table .
that is likely to change .

it was the best-ever election result gained by a party since 1919 and consolidated its majority . the populist svp 's strengthened its position in parliament after it ran a controversial campaign calling for the expulsion of foreigners who commit serious crimes and for throwing out entire immigrant families .
party president ueli maurer attributed the win primarily to the party 's anti-immigration and anti-crime campaign .
" those who are against the eu , who want lower taxes , who want security and fewer criminal foreigners voted for the svp , " he said . the party was accused of racism and xenophobia for a campaign poster that showed white sheep kicking a black sheep off the swiss flag with the slogan , " for more security . "
it even earned the party condemnation from the united nations .
socialist : svp panders to people 's fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svp president , ueli maurer , was all smiles after hearing the results the swiss socialists suffered a major setback in the elections , losing 3.8 percent of their support and taking 19.5 percent of the vote .
socialist parliamentarian liliane maury pasquier said the svp had played on people 's fears of globalization and feeling of economic and social insecurity .
" the svp dresses all this up in xenophobic and anti-european colors , " she told the afp news agency .
" people think they are defending themselves by voting svp . "
the center-right radicals saw their share of the vote drop slightly and the christian democrats saw a slight gain , taking them to 15.6 percent and 14.6 percent respectively .
greens also a big winner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svp election posters sparked widespread protest at home and abroad the greens , the fifth biggest party , garnered 9.6 percent of the vote , up 2.2 percentage points from four years ago .
the socialists ' losses were partly due to advances made by the greens .
in parliament in berne , the people 's party now have 62 of the 200 seats .
that is an increase of seven on their previous majority .
the socialists -lrb- sp -rrb- have 43 mandates .
the radicals and the christian democrats both gained 31 seats .
the greens gained six seats and will now be represented by 20 deputies .
this is their best performance in their history and reflects growing fears about climate change .
the country must now await the election of the cabinet in early december to see whether the new division of seats will alter the balance of power there .
the four main parties have shared the cabinet posts in an informal consensus knows as the " concordat " for 50 years .
it remains unclear whether the greens will now be included in the government . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , they 've started production of a limited edition " strike bike " to prove the company 's viability . without a boss or manager in sight , the bicycles are being assembled by the 135 former employees of the bike systems company in nordhausen in the german state of thuringia .
production started on monday , and by friday , the group hopes to have the limited run of 1,800 pre-ordered bikes ready for shipping throughout germany and europe . " the mood is great , " said one of the occupying workers , eric schillat .
" we really hope that we will be able to continue to produce bikes on a permanent basis . " the group has occupied the bike systems factory since july , after the company was closed down and declared insolvent . but unless the former employers find an investor with several millions to spend , they 'll likely have to pack their tools and go home . us takeover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the workers have occupied the building 24 hours a day since july 10 . us private equity investor lone star acquired bike systems ' parent company , biria back in december 2005 .
once one of europe 's biggest bike manufacturers , it was drowning in debt when lone star took it over .
after shutting down another biria subsidiary at the end of 2006 , production at bike systems was stopped at the end of june .
ten days later , bike systems registered for insolvency . undeterred , the employees came up with the idea of producing the strike bike " we want to show potential investors that we have the capacity cover the costs of production , " schillat said . the three-speed bike , which is available in men 's and women 's models and comes in a symbolic red color , costs 275 euros .
customers needed to pay the sum in advance . " we do n't have any materials here , " schillat said , " you try ringing to order bike parts as a bankrupt firm . " uncertain future andré kegel , who used to supervise one of bike system 's production lines , called the strike bike " a symbolic action . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 17-kilo bike only comes in one colour - red .
" you ca n't make any money with the strike bike , " he told the german daily die welt . in order to turn a profit , the nordhausen factory would have to manufacture at least 200,000 bikes a year .
and without an investor , the workers wo n't be able to raise the sums needed to keep the factory open .
according to kegel , for just the parts needed to produce that number , workers would need an advance of 7 to 8 million euros . and according to wolfgang wutzke , the head of the firm in charge of the insolvency , there still is n't an investor in sight . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 22.10.2007 a master 's degree in relating past horrors to generations today großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large-format portraits at the information center of the holocaust memorial in berlin as the holocaust recedes further into history and eyewitnesses die , a college in berlin has designed a graduate degree course to teach students how to communicate the nazi genocide to today 's public . seven graduate students sit around a table in a small seminar room at touro college in a residential neighborhood of western berlin .
they 're looking over a reading list while a professor explains the focus of the upcoming semester .
the students ' surroundings are almost idyllic ; the small campus sits nestled among chestnut trees , the havel river murmurs just steps away , and the sun is shining on the kind of cool , crisp day . but these seven graduate students are embarking on a course of study that will have them focused for the next two years on one of the most horrifying events in the history of mankind , the murder of 6 million jews by the nazis . " i know it will be hard , but i 'm prepared and i think i can handle it , " said student lisa könig-hauff , 38 , who already has a degree in history and politics from cologne university .
" it 's important that we make the holocaust accessible to the general public . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exhibition hall at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem the new master 's degree program at touro college is called holocaust communication and tolerance , and aims at teaching people how to best relate the genocide to new generations , and who could later work , for example , in museums , in the media , or for memorial organizations . the 1940s are becoming ever more distant , holocaust survivors and even their children are dying , and a new generation , raised in an age of digital multimedia , is less interested in learning history from dry recitations of facts and figures .
in order to keep the holocaust from fading in our public memory , new ways at telling the story are needed , according to andreas nachama , director of touro college 's new holocaust institute . " those who work on holocaust exhibitions often present everything that they know to the visitor , " he said .
" that can overwhelm people , who end up leaving empty-handed .
that 's one of our key points , to find the right amount of information to communicate . " telling the story in this first seminar , students will learn the factual basics of the holocaust , from the beginnings of anti-jewish laws in the third reich to the workings of industrial murder sites such as auschwitz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : touro college berlin students will later explore strategies to communicate the holocaust in exhibitions , publications and in the media , and study a wide range of holocaust-related material - everything from charlie chaplin 's 1940 hitler-satire " the great dictator " to internet offerings today .
they will research theoretical aspects of memory and remembrance and get practical training , including an eight-week internship program next summer .
they will have a studio at their disposal where they can record interviews with eyewitnesses . " telling the individual stories in my opinion makes more sense than communicating simple facts , " said könig-hauff .
" and we need to learn to use all the new media possibilities in telling about this . " besides looking at new ways of communicating the enormity of the genocide , students will conduct their own research , and college officials and professors hope that new information will be uncovered along the way .
although more than six decades have passed since the liberation of the death camps , there is still much to be learned . " for example , there is the connection between german companies and the exploitation and looting of predominately jewish property , " said ingo loose , a professor who specializes in the economic aspects of the third reich and the holocaust .
" this discussion has begun 10 or 15 years ago and it 's still an open field to be discussed . " bildunterschrift : individual stories are often more effective than a flood of facts and figures he points to the documentary on german television at the end of september that exposed a history of nazi profiteering and the use of slave labor by the quandt family , leading industrialists during the third reich and now major shareholders in carmaker bmw . touro college is a private liberal arts college that was founded in 1970 and named after isaac touro and his son judah , major philanthropists in colonial america .
the college , based in new york , also has campuses in california , israel , russia and berlin .
alongside the new holocaust communication program , the college offers a degree program in business administration that includes courses on american culture and a judaic studies option . holocaust fatigue touro officials began considering the formation of the program several years ago when a discussion began in germany about holocaust fatigue .
some wondered if it was time to put a little less focus on the events that to some seemed so long ago .
a series of books and television programs came out that focused on germans ' role as victims during the war .
and younger people were increasingly finding it harder to relate to the event , according to wolfgang benz , director of the center for anti-semitism research at berlin 's technical university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the auschwitz death camp " you just have to ask students , who 'll immediately say ' yeah , we know all that already , " ' he said .
" there 's a sense among some in the public that on tv you just see things about the holocaust .
there 's a certain defensive attitude now . " still , he said germany 's schools and media handle this darkest part of the country 's history well , in most cases .
he does say one strategy sometimes used in holocaust education - piling guilt on younger generations about events they had nothing to do with - is counterproductive , but he thinks training all teachers in appropriate ways to communicate the genocide would be better than focusing on a handful of specialists . but specialization is exactly the goal of guy band , a 30-year-old israeli starting at touro who also works as a volunteer at berlin 's house of the wannsee conference , where nazi officials planned the " final solution . "
he is interested in learning how the holocaust is perceived in germany and how germans have dealt with their past , since he comes to it from an israeli perspective .
he said he also thinks the holocaust offers lessons for today .

they 're looking over a reading list while a professor explains the focus of the upcoming semester .
the students ' surroundings are almost idyllic ; the small campus sits nestled among chestnut trees , the havel river murmurs just steps away , and the sun is shining on the kind of cool , crisp day . but these seven graduate students are embarking on a course of study that will have them focused for the next two years on one of the most horrifying events in the history of mankind , the murder of 6 million jews by the nazis . " i know it will be hard , but i 'm prepared and i think i can handle it , " said student lisa könig-hauff , 38 , who already has a degree in history and politics from cologne university .
" it 's important that we make the holocaust accessible to the general public . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exhibition hall at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem the new master 's degree program at touro college is called holocaust communication and tolerance , and aims at teaching people how to best relate the genocide to new generations , and who could later work , for example , in museums , in the media , or for memorial organizations . the 1940s are becoming ever more distant , holocaust survivors and even their children are dying , and a new generation , raised in an age of digital multimedia , is less interested in learning history from dry recitations of facts and figures .
in order to keep the holocaust from fading in our public memory , new ways at telling the story are needed , according to andreas nachama , director of touro college 's new holocaust institute . " those who work on holocaust exhibitions often present everything that they know to the visitor , " he said .
" that can overwhelm people , who end up leaving empty-handed .
that 's one of our key points , to find the right amount of information to communicate . " telling the story in this first seminar , students will learn the factual basics of the holocaust , from the beginnings of anti-jewish laws in the third reich to the workings of industrial murder sites such as auschwitz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : touro college berlin students will later explore strategies to communicate the holocaust in exhibitions , publications and in the media , and study a wide range of holocaust-related material - everything from charlie chaplin 's 1940 hitler-satire " the great dictator " to internet offerings today .
they will research theoretical aspects of memory and remembrance and get practical training , including an eight-week internship program next summer .
they will have a studio at their disposal where they can record interviews with eyewitnesses . " telling the individual stories in my opinion makes more sense than communicating simple facts , " said könig-hauff .
" and we need to learn to use all the new media possibilities in telling about this . " besides looking at new ways of communicating the enormity of the genocide , students will conduct their own research , and college officials and professors hope that new information will be uncovered along the way .
although more than six decades have passed since the liberation of the death camps , there is still much to be learned . " for example , there is the connection between german companies and the exploitation and looting of predominately jewish property , " said ingo loose , a professor who specializes in the economic aspects of the third reich and the holocaust .
" this discussion has begun 10 or 15 years ago and it 's still an open field to be discussed . " bildunterschrift : individual stories are often more effective than a flood of facts and figures he points to the documentary on german television at the end of september that exposed a history of nazi profiteering and the use of slave labor by the quandt family , leading industrialists during the third reich and now major shareholders in carmaker bmw . touro college is a private liberal arts college that was founded in 1970 and named after isaac touro and his son judah , major philanthropists in colonial america .
the college , based in new york , also has campuses in california , israel , russia and berlin .
alongside the new holocaust communication program , the college offers a degree program in business administration that includes courses on american culture and a judaic studies option . holocaust fatigue touro officials began considering the formation of the program several years ago when a discussion began in germany about holocaust fatigue .
some wondered if it was time to put a little less focus on the events that to some seemed so long ago .
a series of books and television programs came out that focused on germans ' role as victims during the war .
and younger people were increasingly finding it harder to relate to the event , according to wolfgang benz , director of the center for anti-semitism research at berlin 's technical university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the auschwitz death camp " you just have to ask students , who 'll immediately say ' yeah , we know all that already , " ' he said .
" there 's a sense among some in the public that on tv you just see things about the holocaust .
there 's a certain defensive attitude now . " still , he said germany 's schools and media handle this darkest part of the country 's history well , in most cases .
he does say one strategy sometimes used in holocaust education - piling guilt on younger generations about events they had nothing to do with - is counterproductive , but he thinks training all teachers in appropriate ways to communicate the genocide would be better than focusing on a handful of specialists . but specialization is exactly the goal of guy band , a 30-year-old israeli starting at touro who also works as a volunteer at berlin 's house of the wannsee conference , where nazi officials planned the " final solution . "
he is interested in learning how the holocaust is perceived in germany and how germans have dealt with their past , since he comes to it from an israeli perspective .
he said he also thinks the holocaust offers lessons for today . " we can take examples from the holocaust and compare it to today , " he said , " i think it 's very important to see where things can go wrong , where they can become radicalized and where we have to say stop , we wo n't accept that .

some 35,000 jobs could come under the axe at giant deutsche telekom , on top of the tens of thousands already being lost , according to calculations made by german media . sales and restructuring could lead to major job cuts at deutsche telekom , according to a report published monday , oct .
22 , in the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel . the article cited " internal calculations " within the company , which employed some 249,000 people at the end of 2006 , 89,000 of them outside germany , as the reason behind the redundancies . the magazine said deutsche telekom boss rene obermann refused to comment on the figure , while stressing " the need to adapt and restructure " the group he has headed for the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark times could be coming for thousands more telekom employees " i think a job reduction of this size is realistic , " lothar schröder , chairman of the verdi trade union , told the süddeutsche zeitung on sunday .
schröder is also the deputy head of telekom 's supervisory board . schröder added that the union would fight any plans to cuts jobs .
the magazine did not say when the reported job cuts could take place . jobs outside the company a deutsche telekom spokesman , however , said the company 's calculations did not call for job cuts . " it 's not about dismissals , but employees who will keep their jobs outside of the company , " the spokesman said . deutsche telekom is europe 's biggest telecoms group .
it has had problems in its core german market because of heightened competition and has lost numerous clients to rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann took over as head of deutsche telekom in november under obermann , telekom is in the process of cutting 32,000 jobs by the end of 2008 and has shaved off another 50,000 in the service sector . " there are business areas that we will sell or look for partners for - that 's well known , " obermann told der spiegel .
" if we did not do this , the company as a whole would become less and less competitive . " buying and selling to continue the former german telecommunication monopoly has sold off subsidiaries in spain and france , but has also bought a cellular phone company in the united states .
at the beginning of july , telekom upset trade unions by shifting 50,000 jobs in its troubled t-com land-line unit into three independent companies , where employees would be forced to work longer hours for less pay . in an interview sunday , obermann said the group would step up investments in developing nations , where the telecommunications sector is booming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's iphone provider , telekom said rates would be under 50 euros per month " in the long term , i can see us investing in developing countries because there is a dearth of infrastructure in these nations , " he said on the n-tv news channel .
" we are far from achieving our full potential . " earlier this year , obermann had said the company did not have immediate plans to invest in emerging markets , and was accused of falling behind its rivals . since becoming a private company in 1995 , telekom has cut an average of 10,000 jobs per year , according to n-tv . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some 35,000 jobs could come under the axe at giant deutsche telekom , on top of the tens of thousands already being lost , according to calculations made by german media . sales and restructuring could lead to major job cuts at deutsche telekom , according to a report published monday , oct .
22 , in the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel . the article cited " internal calculations " within the company , which employed some 249,000 people at the end of 2006 , 89,000 of them outside germany , as the reason behind the redundancies . the magazine said deutsche telekom boss rene obermann refused to comment on the figure , while stressing " the need to adapt and restructure " the group he has headed for the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark times could be coming for thousands more telekom employees " i think a job reduction of this size is realistic , " lothar schröder , chairman of the verdi trade union , told the süddeutsche zeitung on sunday .
schröder is also the deputy head of telekom 's supervisory board . schröder added that the union would fight any plans to cuts jobs .
the magazine did not say when the reported job cuts could take place . jobs outside the company a deutsche telekom spokesman , however , said the company 's calculations did not call for job cuts . " it 's not about dismissals , but employees who will keep their jobs outside of the company , " the spokesman said . deutsche telekom is europe 's biggest telecoms group .
it has had problems in its core german market because of heightened competition and has lost numerous clients to rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann took over as head of deutsche telekom in november under obermann , telekom is in the process of cutting 32,000 jobs by the end of 2008 and has shaved off another 50,000 in the service sector . " there are business areas that we will sell or look for partners for - that 's well known , " obermann told der spiegel .
" if we did not do this , the company as a whole would become less and less competitive . " buying and selling to continue the former german telecommunication monopoly has sold off subsidiaries in spain and france , but has also bought a cellular phone company in the united states .
at the beginning of july , telekom upset trade unions by shifting 50,000 jobs in its troubled t-com land-line unit into three independent companies , where employees would be forced to work longer hours for less pay . in an interview sunday , obermann said the group would step up investments in developing nations , where the telecommunications sector is booming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's iphone provider , telekom said rates would be under 50 euros per month " in the long term , i can see us investing in developing countries because there is a dearth of infrastructure in these nations , " he said on the n-tv news channel .
" we are far from achieving our full potential . " earlier this year , obermann had said the company did not have immediate plans to invest in emerging markets , and was accused of falling behind its rivals . since becoming a private company in 1995 , telekom has cut an average of 10,000 jobs per year , according to n-tv . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was the best-ever election result gained by a party since 1919 and consolidated its majority . the populist svp 's strengthened its position in parliament after it ran a controversial campaign calling for the expulsion of foreigners who commit serious crimes and for throwing out entire immigrant families .
party president ueli maurer attributed the win primarily to the party 's anti-immigration and anti-crime campaign .
" those who are against the eu , who want lower taxes , who want security and fewer criminal foreigners voted for the svp , " he said . the party was accused of racism and xenophobia for a campaign poster that showed white sheep kicking a black sheep off the swiss flag with the slogan , " for more security .

" the svp dresses all this up in xenophobic and anti-european colors , " she told the afp news agency .

" the german government followed this election with interest , " government spokesman thomas steg told reporters .
" we have an enormous interest in good , close , neighborly ties with poland and we hope that the offer for dialogue and for readjustment will be seized by the new government in warsaw under donald tusk . " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier monday congratulated donald tusk on the victory of his civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- in the polish parliamentary elections , saying the electorate had given him " a clear mandate for a political change of course . " " this clear result shows one thing in particular : the polish electorate has given you a clear mandate for forming a government and thus for a political change of course , " steinmeier said . undoing the kaczynski damage the po took a projected 208 seats in parliament , routing the conservative law and justice party of prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski and his identical twin brother , president lech kaczynski . the conservatives are expected to get 164 seats .
lech kaczynski still has three years to go in his presidential term , but the poll abruptly ended the brothers ' unusual concentration of power by ousting the prime minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk celebrates his po party 's victory ties between berlin and warsaw remain tinged with bitterness decades after the end of world war ii and took a turn for the worse over the past two years under the kaczynskis , who exploited historical grievances to win popular support . in june , matters hit a low point when the prime minister invoked the carnage wrought by the nazis in the row over eu voting rights , saying that without the war poland would today be a nation of 66 million people instead of 38 million . eu voting rights the treaty negotiation process ended with an agreement at an eu summit in lisbon last week , but warsaw was granted concessions to avert the possibility of a polish veto . steg said germany was hoping for close cooperation between the new polish government and other partners within the 27-member bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : double trouble : the unusual reign of the kaczynskis has ended " we hope that also in european politics the coordination with poland will continue to be very constructive , " he told afp .
" we are now waiting for the election majority to translate into a new government and look forward to working with the new government in warsaw . " speaking to his supporters at election headquarters after the victory was clear , the 50-year-old tusk said : " i thank everyone who ... has helped restore hope among poles . " meanwhile officials in moscow said they were optimistic that warsaw would now reverse its veto on a sweeping eu-russian partnership deal . tusk aims to retrieve expatriates tusk has also promised to cut taxes to stoke the already red-hot economy and lure home the more than one million poles who have moved to britain and ireland seeking jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many poles have left for places where there are jobs - like dublin expatriates as well as young , urban , centrist voters in poland turned out in droves to end the kaczynski duo 's two-year grip on power .
participation reached almost 54 percent - the highest level since the communists ' fall in 1989 . despite his popularity at home , tusk is likely to ruffle feathers in washington because of his pledge to bring home the 900 polish soldiers serving in iraq . " poland 's foreign policy is going to change significantly , " pawel swieboda , a former foreign ministry official who now heads a warsaw think-tank , told the afp news agency .
" po will reinforce its european plank and wo n't take american proposals as they come . " tusk 's iraq promise is highly popular in poland , where opinion polls show more than 80 percent oppose the mission .
warsaw has been one of the closest us allies over iraq , with polish troops taking part in the 2003 invasion . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that will include making available to open-source software developers information they need so that their programs work smoothly with microsoft window 's operating system for personal computers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 22.10.2007 a master 's degree in relating past horrors to generations today großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large-format portraits at the information center of the holocaust memorial in berlin as the holocaust recedes further into history and eyewitnesses die , a college in berlin has designed a graduate degree course to teach students how to communicate the nazi genocide to today 's public . seven graduate students sit around a table in a small seminar room at touro college in a residential neighborhood of western berlin .
they 're looking over a reading list while a professor explains the focus of the upcoming semester .
the students ' surroundings are almost idyllic ; the small campus sits nestled among chestnut trees , the havel river murmurs just steps away , and the sun is shining on the kind of cool , crisp day . but these seven graduate students are embarking on a course of study that will have them focused for the next two years on one of the most horrifying events in the history of mankind , the murder of 6 million jews by the nazis . " i know it will be hard , but i 'm prepared and i think i can handle it , " said student lisa könig-hauff , 38 , who already has a degree in history and politics from cologne university .
" it 's important that we make the holocaust accessible to the general public . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exhibition hall at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem the new master 's degree program at touro college is called holocaust communication and tolerance , and aims at teaching people how to best relate the genocide to new generations , and who could later work , for example , in museums , in the media , or for memorial organizations . the 1940s are becoming ever more distant , holocaust survivors and even their children are dying , and a new generation , raised in an age of digital multimedia , is less interested in learning history from dry recitations of facts and figures .
in order to keep the holocaust from fading in our public memory , new ways at telling the story are needed , according to andreas nachama , director of touro college 's new holocaust institute . " those who work on holocaust exhibitions often present everything that they know to the visitor , " he said .
" that can overwhelm people , who end up leaving empty-handed .
that 's one of our key points , to find the right amount of information to communicate . " telling the story in this first seminar , students will learn the factual basics of the holocaust , from the beginnings of anti-jewish laws in the third reich to the workings of industrial murder sites such as auschwitz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : touro college berlin students will later explore strategies to communicate the holocaust in exhibitions , publications and in the media , and study a wide range of holocaust-related material - everything from charlie chaplin 's 1940 hitler-satire " the great dictator " to internet offerings today .
they will research theoretical aspects of memory and remembrance and get practical training , including an eight-week internship program next summer .

some 35,000 jobs could come under the axe at giant deutsche telekom , on top of the tens of thousands already being lost , according to calculations made by german media . sales and restructuring could lead to major job cuts at deutsche telekom , according to a report published monday , oct .
22 , in the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel . the article cited " internal calculations " within the company , which employed some 249,000 people at the end of 2006 , 89,000 of them outside germany , as the reason behind the redundancies . the magazine said deutsche telekom boss rene obermann refused to comment on the figure , while stressing " the need to adapt and restructure " the group he has headed for the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark times could be coming for thousands more telekom employees " i think a job reduction of this size is realistic , " lothar schröder , chairman of the verdi trade union , told the süddeutsche zeitung on sunday .
schröder is also the deputy head of telekom 's supervisory board . schröder added that the union would fight any plans to cuts jobs .
the magazine did not say when the reported job cuts could take place . jobs outside the company a deutsche telekom spokesman , however , said the company 's calculations did not call for job cuts . " it 's not about dismissals , but employees who will keep their jobs outside of the company , " the spokesman said . deutsche telekom is europe 's biggest telecoms group .
it has had problems in its core german market because of heightened competition and has lost numerous clients to rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann took over as head of deutsche telekom in november under obermann , telekom is in the process of cutting 32,000 jobs by the end of 2008 and has shaved off another 50,000 in the service sector . " there are business areas that we will sell or look for partners for - that 's well known , " obermann told der spiegel .
" if we did not do this , the company as a whole would become less and less competitive . " buying and selling to continue the former german telecommunication monopoly has sold off subsidiaries in spain and france , but has also bought a cellular phone company in the united states .
at the beginning of july , telekom upset trade unions by shifting 50,000 jobs in its troubled t-com land-line unit into three independent companies , where employees would be forced to work longer hours for less pay . in an interview sunday , obermann said the group would step up investments in developing nations , where the telecommunications sector is booming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's iphone provider , telekom said rates would be under 50 euros per month " in the long term , i can see us investing in developing countries because there is a dearth of infrastructure in these nations , " he said on the n-tv news channel .
" we are far from achieving our full potential . " earlier this year , obermann had said the company did not have immediate plans to invest in emerging markets , and was accused of falling behind its rivals . since becoming a private company in 1995 , telekom has cut an average of 10,000 jobs per year , according to n-tv . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're looking over a reading list while a professor explains the focus of the upcoming semester .
the students ' surroundings are almost idyllic ; the small campus sits nestled among chestnut trees , the havel river murmurs just steps away , and the sun is shining on the kind of cool , crisp day . but these seven graduate students are embarking on a course of study that will have them focused for the next two years on one of the most horrifying events in the history of mankind , the murder of 6 million jews by the nazis . " i know it will be hard , but i 'm prepared and i think i can handle it , " said student lisa könig-hauff , 38 , who already has a degree in history and politics from cologne university .
" it 's important that we make the holocaust accessible to the general public . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exhibition hall at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem the new master 's degree program at touro college is called holocaust communication and tolerance , and aims at teaching people how to best relate the genocide to new generations , and who could later work , for example , in museums , in the media , or for memorial organizations . the 1940s are becoming ever more distant , holocaust survivors and even their children are dying , and a new generation , raised in an age of digital multimedia , is less interested in learning history from dry recitations of facts and figures .
in order to keep the holocaust from fading in our public memory , new ways at telling the story are needed , according to andreas nachama , director of touro college 's new holocaust institute . " those who work on holocaust exhibitions often present everything that they know to the visitor , " he said .
" that can overwhelm people , who end up leaving empty-handed .
that 's one of our key points , to find the right amount of information to communicate . " telling the story in this first seminar , students will learn the factual basics of the holocaust , from the beginnings of anti-jewish laws in the third reich to the workings of industrial murder sites such as auschwitz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : touro college berlin students will later explore strategies to communicate the holocaust in exhibitions , publications and in the media , and study a wide range of holocaust-related material - everything from charlie chaplin 's 1940 hitler-satire " the great dictator " to internet offerings today .
they will research theoretical aspects of memory and remembrance and get practical training , including an eight-week internship program next summer .
they will have a studio at their disposal where they can record interviews with eyewitnesses . " telling the individual stories in my opinion makes more sense than communicating simple facts , " said könig-hauff .
" and we need to learn to use all the new media possibilities in telling about this . " besides looking at new ways of communicating the enormity of the genocide , students will conduct their own research , and college officials and professors hope that new information will be uncovered along the way .
although more than six decades have passed since the liberation of the death camps , there is still much to be learned . " for example , there is the connection between german companies and the exploitation and looting of predominately jewish property , " said ingo loose , a professor who specializes in the economic aspects of the third reich and the holocaust .
" this discussion has begun 10 or 15 years ago and it 's still an open field to be discussed . " bildunterschrift : individual stories are often more effective than a flood of facts and figures he points to the documentary on german television at the end of september that exposed a history of nazi profiteering and the use of slave labor by the quandt family , leading industrialists during the third reich and now major shareholders in carmaker bmw . touro college is a private liberal arts college that was founded in 1970 and named after isaac touro and his son judah , major philanthropists in colonial america .
the college , based in new york , also has campuses in california , israel , russia and berlin .
alongside the new holocaust communication program , the college offers a degree program in business administration that includes courses on american culture and a judaic studies option . holocaust fatigue touro officials began considering the formation of the program several years ago when a discussion began in germany about holocaust fatigue .
some wondered if it was time to put a little less focus on the events that to some seemed so long ago .
a series of books and television programs came out that focused on germans ' role as victims during the war .
and younger people were increasingly finding it harder to relate to the event , according to wolfgang benz , director of the center for anti-semitism research at berlin 's technical university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the auschwitz death camp " you just have to ask students , who 'll immediately say ' yeah , we know all that already , " ' he said .
" there 's a sense among some in the public that on tv you just see things about the holocaust .
there 's a certain defensive attitude now . " still , he said germany 's schools and media handle this darkest part of the country 's history well , in most cases .
he does say one strategy sometimes used in holocaust education - piling guilt on younger generations about events they had nothing to do with - is counterproductive , but he thinks training all teachers in appropriate ways to communicate the genocide would be better than focusing on a handful of specialists . but specialization is exactly the goal of guy band , a 30-year-old israeli starting at touro who also works as a volunteer at berlin 's house of the wannsee conference , where nazi officials planned the " final solution .

the students ' surroundings are almost idyllic ; the small campus sits nestled among chestnut trees , the havel river murmurs just steps away , and the sun is shining on the kind of cool , crisp day . but these seven graduate students are embarking on a course of study that will have them focused for the next two years on one of the most horrifying events in the history of mankind , the murder of 6 million jews by the nazis . " i know it will be hard , but i 'm prepared and i think i can handle it , " said student lisa könig-hauff , 38 , who already has a degree in history and politics from cologne university .
" it 's important that we make the holocaust accessible to the general public . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exhibition hall at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem the new master 's degree program at touro college is called holocaust communication and tolerance , and aims at teaching people how to best relate the genocide to new generations , and who could later work , for example , in museums , in the media , or for memorial organizations . the 1940s are becoming ever more distant , holocaust survivors and even their children are dying , and a new generation , raised in an age of digital multimedia , is less interested in learning history from dry recitations of facts and figures .
in order to keep the holocaust from fading in our public memory , new ways at telling the story are needed , according to andreas nachama , director of touro college 's new holocaust institute . " those who work on holocaust exhibitions often present everything that they know to the visitor , " he said .
" that can overwhelm people , who end up leaving empty-handed .
that 's one of our key points , to find the right amount of information to communicate . " telling the story in this first seminar , students will learn the factual basics of the holocaust , from the beginnings of anti-jewish laws in the third reich to the workings of industrial murder sites such as auschwitz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : touro college berlin students will later explore strategies to communicate the holocaust in exhibitions , publications and in the media , and study a wide range of holocaust-related material - everything from charlie chaplin 's 1940 hitler-satire " the great dictator " to internet offerings today .
they will research theoretical aspects of memory and remembrance and get practical training , including an eight-week internship program next summer .
they will have a studio at their disposal where they can record interviews with eyewitnesses . " telling the individual stories in my opinion makes more sense than communicating simple facts , " said könig-hauff .
" and we need to learn to use all the new media possibilities in telling about this . " besides looking at new ways of communicating the enormity of the genocide , students will conduct their own research , and college officials and professors hope that new information will be uncovered along the way .
although more than six decades have passed since the liberation of the death camps , there is still much to be learned . " for example , there is the connection between german companies and the exploitation and looting of predominately jewish property , " said ingo loose , a professor who specializes in the economic aspects of the third reich and the holocaust .
" this discussion has begun 10 or 15 years ago and it 's still an open field to be discussed . " bildunterschrift : individual stories are often more effective than a flood of facts and figures he points to the documentary on german television at the end of september that exposed a history of nazi profiteering and the use of slave labor by the quandt family , leading industrialists during the third reich and now major shareholders in carmaker bmw . touro college is a private liberal arts college that was founded in 1970 and named after isaac touro and his son judah , major philanthropists in colonial america .
the college , based in new york , also has campuses in california , israel , russia and berlin .
alongside the new holocaust communication program , the college offers a degree program in business administration that includes courses on american culture and a judaic studies option . holocaust fatigue touro officials began considering the formation of the program several years ago when a discussion began in germany about holocaust fatigue .
some wondered if it was time to put a little less focus on the events that to some seemed so long ago .
a series of books and television programs came out that focused on germans ' role as victims during the war .
and younger people were increasingly finding it harder to relate to the event , according to wolfgang benz , director of the center for anti-semitism research at berlin 's technical university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the auschwitz death camp " you just have to ask students , who 'll immediately say ' yeah , we know all that already , " ' he said .

some 35,000 jobs could come under the axe at giant deutsche telekom , on top of the tens of thousands already being lost , according to calculations made by german media . sales and restructuring could lead to major job cuts at deutsche telekom , according to a report published monday , oct .
22 , in the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel . the article cited " internal calculations " within the company , which employed some 249,000 people at the end of 2006 , 89,000 of them outside germany , as the reason behind the redundancies . the magazine said deutsche telekom boss rene obermann refused to comment on the figure , while stressing " the need to adapt and restructure " the group he has headed for the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark times could be coming for thousands more telekom employees " i think a job reduction of this size is realistic , " lothar schröder , chairman of the verdi trade union , told the süddeutsche zeitung on sunday .
schröder is also the deputy head of telekom 's supervisory board . schröder added that the union would fight any plans to cuts jobs .
the magazine did not say when the reported job cuts could take place . jobs outside the company a deutsche telekom spokesman , however , said the company 's calculations did not call for job cuts . " it 's not about dismissals , but employees who will keep their jobs outside of the company , " the spokesman said . deutsche telekom is europe 's biggest telecoms group .
it has had problems in its core german market because of heightened competition and has lost numerous clients to rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann took over as head of deutsche telekom in november under obermann , telekom is in the process of cutting 32,000 jobs by the end of 2008 and has shaved off another 50,000 in the service sector . " there are business areas that we will sell or look for partners for - that 's well known , " obermann told der spiegel .
" if we did not do this , the company as a whole would become less and less competitive . " buying and selling to continue the former german telecommunication monopoly has sold off subsidiaries in spain and france , but has also bought a cellular phone company in the united states .
at the beginning of july , telekom upset trade unions by shifting 50,000 jobs in its troubled t-com land-line unit into three independent companies , where employees would be forced to work longer hours for less pay . in an interview sunday , obermann said the group would step up investments in developing nations , where the telecommunications sector is booming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's iphone provider , telekom said rates would be under 50 euros per month " in the long term , i can see us investing in developing countries because there is a dearth of infrastructure in these nations , " he said on the n-tv news channel .
" we are far from achieving our full potential . " earlier this year , obermann had said the company did not have immediate plans to invest in emerging markets , and was accused of falling behind its rivals . since becoming a private company in 1995 , telekom has cut an average of 10,000 jobs per year , according to n-tv . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 22.10.2007 right-wing people 's party win swiss elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right and the greens were the biggest winners the right-wing people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- emerged as the victor in the swiss elections , taking 29 percent of the vote .
it was the best-ever election result gained by a party since 1919 and consolidated its majority . the populist svp 's strengthened its position in parliament after it ran a controversial campaign calling for the expulsion of foreigners who commit serious crimes and for throwing out entire immigrant families .
party president ueli maurer attributed the win primarily to the party 's anti-immigration and anti-crime campaign .
" those who are against the eu , who want lower taxes , who want security and fewer criminal foreigners voted for the svp , " he said . the party was accused of racism and xenophobia for a campaign poster that showed white sheep kicking a black sheep off the swiss flag with the slogan , " for more security . "
it even earned the party condemnation from the united nations .
socialist : svp panders to people 's fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svp president , ueli maurer , was all smiles after hearing the results the swiss socialists suffered a major setback in the elections , losing 3.8 percent of their support and taking 19.5 percent of the vote .
socialist parliamentarian liliane maury pasquier said the svp had played on people 's fears of globalization and feeling of economic and social insecurity .
" the svp dresses all this up in xenophobic and anti-european colors , " she told the afp news agency .
" people think they are defending themselves by voting svp . "
the center-right radicals saw their share of the vote drop slightly and the christian democrats saw a slight gain , taking them to 15.6 percent and 14.6 percent respectively .
greens also a big winner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svp election posters sparked widespread protest at home and abroad the greens , the fifth biggest party , garnered 9.6 percent of the vote , up 2.2 percentage points from four years ago .
the socialists ' losses were partly due to advances made by the greens .
in parliament in berne , the people 's party now have 62 of the 200 seats .
that is an increase of seven on their previous majority .
the socialists -lrb- sp -rrb- have 43 mandates .
the radicals and the christian democrats both gained 31 seats .
the greens gained six seats and will now be represented by 20 deputies .
this is their best performance in their history and reflects growing fears about climate change .
the country must now await the election of the cabinet in early december to see whether the new division of seats will alter the balance of power there .
the four main parties have shared the cabinet posts in an informal consensus knows as the " concordat " for 50 years .
it remains unclear whether the greens will now be included in the government . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was the best-ever election result gained by a party since 1919 and consolidated its majority . the populist svp 's strengthened its position in parliament after it ran a controversial campaign calling for the expulsion of foreigners who commit serious crimes and for throwing out entire immigrant families .
party president ueli maurer attributed the win primarily to the party 's anti-immigration and anti-crime campaign .
" those who are against the eu , who want lower taxes , who want security and fewer criminal foreigners voted for the svp , " he said . the party was accused of racism and xenophobia for a campaign poster that showed white sheep kicking a black sheep off the swiss flag with the slogan , " for more security . "
it even earned the party condemnation from the united nations .
socialist : svp panders to people 's fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svp president , ueli maurer , was all smiles after hearing the results the swiss socialists suffered a major setback in the elections , losing 3.8 percent of their support and taking 19.5 percent of the vote .
socialist parliamentarian liliane maury pasquier said the svp had played on people 's fears of globalization and feeling of economic and social insecurity .
" the svp dresses all this up in xenophobic and anti-european colors , " she told the afp news agency .
" people think they are defending themselves by voting svp . "
the center-right radicals saw their share of the vote drop slightly and the christian democrats saw a slight gain , taking them to 15.6 percent and 14.6 percent respectively .
greens also a big winner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svp election posters sparked widespread protest at home and abroad the greens , the fifth biggest party , garnered 9.6 percent of the vote , up 2.2 percentage points from four years ago .
the socialists ' losses were partly due to advances made by the greens .
in parliament in berne , the people 's party now have 62 of the 200 seats .
that is an increase of seven on their previous majority .
the socialists -lrb- sp -rrb- have 43 mandates .
the radicals and the christian democrats both gained 31 seats .
the greens gained six seats and will now be represented by 20 deputies .
this is their best performance in their history and reflects growing fears about climate change .
the country must now await the election of the cabinet in early december to see whether the new division of seats will alter the balance of power there .
the four main parties have shared the cabinet posts in an informal consensus knows as the " concordat " for 50 years .
it remains unclear whether the greens will now be included in the government . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the electorate appears to have punished the law and justice party of the two kaczynski brothers severely for poisoning political life in poland , for creating an atmosphere of suspicion and adopting an aggressive tone .
civic platform -lrb- platforma obywatelska -rrb- , a party with a free-market philosophy , emerged as the victor because it understood that the majority could not be won over with the ideology and the language of the kaczynskis .
it has learned to tell voters what they want to hear .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubert wohlan there is a lot of evidence that the polish parliament will be able to live with less populism .
two parties that were part of the governing coalition until recently failed to make it over the 5 percent threshold to get into parliament .
after voters delivered a slap on the wrist to the ultra-roman catholic league of polish families and the radical rural-based self-defense party , there is hope that it is only a question of time before the political landscape recovers .
however , outgoing polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski and his squad will ensure that populism does not disappear from parliament , since their parties will still be represented there .
the true challenges await the victor on the domestic stage and not in the sphere of foreign policy .
the government will probably be made up of a coalition between civic platform and the liberal-conservative peasants ' party .
together they will have to reform the health service and patch up the ailing pension system .
very little was said about that in the election .

after voters delivered a slap on the wrist to the ultra-roman catholic league of polish families and the radical rural-based self-defense party , there is hope that it is only a question of time before the political landscape recovers .

twelve turkish soldiers were killed by the pkk at the weekend . the eu commission has issued a statement sharply condemning the actions of the pkk , the outlawed kurdish workers ' party in southeastern turkey and expressing understanding for turkey 's need to protect its citizens . but enlargement commissioner olli rehn said turkey and iraq had to " solve the problem with cooperation and with regard to international law . " the german government has also appealed to turkey to show restraint .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier telephoned his turkish counterpart ali babacan to urge ankara to refrain from steps which could destabilize the region . government spokesman thomas steg renewed this call . ' sense of proportion ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish rebels operate near the turkish border " now it is important to avoid this fresh provocation leading to a spiral of violence in the region .
i appeal to the turkish government to act with a sense of proportion in this difficult situation and avoid a dangerous destabilization of the region , " steg said . the country 's defense minister , vecdi gönül , has said he will not immediately enter the region .
instead , he said , he will wait for joint action with the us . on sunday afternoon , at least 12 turkish soldiers were reported dead and 32 pkk members were killed in retaliation amid the bloodiest fighting in years between kurdish pkk rebels and turkish soldiers on the northern iraq border . in the wake of the news , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan held an emergency meeting of political and military leaders , including turkish president abdullah gül .

we respect iraq 's national borders .
but -lrb- we -rrb- will not tolerate those who help and harbor terrorists . " according to turkish military reports , on sunday afternoon pkk fighters entered the turkish province hakkari from northern iraq , attacking an army post there .
spokesmen for the kurds say turkish solders have been taken hostage ; and turkish officials told afp news service that eight turkish soldiers are missing . turkish lawmakers allow attack but despite the intense border fighting , turkish defense minister gönül has said he would not immediately conduct a targeted invasion of the region .
he told his us counterpart robert gates at a meeting in kiev that the turkish military is , indeed , planning such an attack , but he prefer that it be led together with the us , news reports said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier condemned pkk attacks last wednesday , the turkish parliament laid the way for a military attack by green-lighting a plan to allow for an invasion , should it come to that .
the turkish government passed the plan following months of pleading for us support in the region .
turkey , the us and the eu all consider the pkk to be a terrorist group . washington hopes to avoid armed conflict in northern iraq , however .
it fears bringing turbulence into the last peaceful region of the country , and also worries about further damage to its own image as an occupying force . moreover , the current regime in teheran supports the underground pjak group , which works together with the pkk . for the past several months , pkk guerrilla fighters have been actively attacking turkish military interests from within northern iraq .
a total of around 100 turkish soldiers have died since the beginning of the year , prompting the turkish army to massively boost the numbers of soldiers in the border region to approximately 60,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan , left , and gül are hoping for us military support the pkk has been fighting for more autonomy in kurdish regions for more than 20 years . oil interests could be involved on saturday , the pkk threatened attacks on oil pipelines in the region if turkey decides in favor of military intervention in northern iraq .
exports of oil produced near the northern iraqi state of kirkuk travel via the turkish port of ceyhan . for its part , the iraqi parliament called for the pkk to leave the country .
news reports quoted iraqi parliament president mahmud al-maschhadani as saying : " we denounce attacks on neighboring states and we call for armed pkk members to leave iraqi sovereignty . " but in a follow up to a meeting with the president of the autonomous kurdish region in northern iraq , iraqi president jalal talabani , who is kurdish , said his government could not combat the pkk .
he reiterated iraq 's demand that pkk rebels lay down their arms and restated calls for a diplomatic solution ; he wants the pkk to turn itself into a political organization . talabani : ' not even a cat ' will be handed over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi president talabani still hopes for a political solution talabani angered turks further on sunday by saying , " we will not hand any kurd over to turkey , not even a kurdish cat , " according to media reports . northern iraq is home to some 3,500 pkk fighters , according to turkish estimates . turkish pm erdogan wants to sit down together with us president bush on nov .

twelve turkish soldiers were killed by the pkk at the weekend . the eu commission has issued a statement sharply condemning the actions of the pkk , the outlawed kurdish workers ' party in southeastern turkey and expressing understanding for turkey 's need to protect its citizens . but enlargement commissioner olli rehn said turkey and iraq had to " solve the problem with cooperation and with regard to international law . " the german government has also appealed to turkey to show restraint .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier telephoned his turkish counterpart ali babacan to urge ankara to refrain from steps which could destabilize the region . government spokesman thomas steg renewed this call .

i appeal to the turkish government to act with a sense of proportion in this difficult situation and avoid a dangerous destabilization of the region , " steg said . the country 's defense minister , vecdi gönül , has said he will not immediately enter the region .
instead , he said , he will wait for joint action with the us . on sunday afternoon , at least 12 turkish soldiers were reported dead and 32 pkk members were killed in retaliation amid the bloodiest fighting in years between kurdish pkk rebels and turkish soldiers on the northern iraq border . in the wake of the news , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan held an emergency meeting of political and military leaders , including turkish president abdullah gül .
after the meeting gül issued a statement saying , " we will continue on our path of determination in fighting the terrorist organization .
we respect iraq 's national borders .
but -lrb- we -rrb- will not tolerate those who help and harbor terrorists . " according to turkish military reports , on sunday afternoon pkk fighters entered the turkish province hakkari from northern iraq , attacking an army post there .
spokesmen for the kurds say turkish solders have been taken hostage ; and turkish officials told afp news service that eight turkish soldiers are missing . turkish lawmakers allow attack but despite the intense border fighting , turkish defense minister gönül has said he would not immediately conduct a targeted invasion of the region .

the turkish government passed the plan following months of pleading for us support in the region .
turkey , the us and the eu all consider the pkk to be a terrorist group . washington hopes to avoid armed conflict in northern iraq , however .
it fears bringing turbulence into the last peaceful region of the country , and also worries about further damage to its own image as an occupying force . moreover , the current regime in teheran supports the underground pjak group , which works together with the pkk . for the past several months , pkk guerrilla fighters have been actively attacking turkish military interests from within northern iraq .
a total of around 100 turkish soldiers have died since the beginning of the year , prompting the turkish army to massively boost the numbers of soldiers in the border region to approximately 60,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan , left , and gül are hoping for us military support the pkk has been fighting for more autonomy in kurdish regions for more than 20 years . oil interests could be involved on saturday , the pkk threatened attacks on oil pipelines in the region if turkey decides in favor of military intervention in northern iraq .
exports of oil produced near the northern iraqi state of kirkuk travel via the turkish port of ceyhan . for its part , the iraqi parliament called for the pkk to leave the country .
news reports quoted iraqi parliament president mahmud al-maschhadani as saying : " we denounce attacks on neighboring states and we call for armed pkk members to leave iraqi sovereignty . " but in a follow up to a meeting with the president of the autonomous kurdish region in northern iraq , iraqi president jalal talabani , who is kurdish , said his government could not combat the pkk .
he reiterated iraq 's demand that pkk rebels lay down their arms and restated calls for a diplomatic solution ; he wants the pkk to turn itself into a political organization . talabani : ' not even a cat ' will be handed over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi president talabani still hopes for a political solution talabani angered turks further on sunday by saying , " we will not hand any kurd over to turkey , not even a kurdish cat , " according to media reports . northern iraq is home to some 3,500 pkk fighters , according to turkish estimates . turkish pm erdogan wants to sit down together with us president bush on nov .

now , they 've started production of a limited edition " strike bike " to prove the company 's viability . without a boss or manager in sight , the bicycles are being assembled by the 135 former employees of the bike systems company in nordhausen in the german state of thuringia .
production started on monday , and by friday , the group hopes to have the limited run of 1,800 pre-ordered bikes ready for shipping throughout germany and europe . " the mood is great , " said one of the occupying workers , eric schillat .
" we really hope that we will be able to continue to produce bikes on a permanent basis . " the group has occupied the bike systems factory since july , after the company was closed down and declared insolvent . but unless the former employers find an investor with several millions to spend , they 'll likely have to pack their tools and go home . us takeover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the workers have occupied the building 24 hours a day since july 10 . us private equity investor lone star acquired bike systems ' parent company , biria back in december 2005 .
once one of europe 's biggest bike manufacturers , it was drowning in debt when lone star took it over .
after shutting down another biria subsidiary at the end of 2006 , production at bike systems was stopped at the end of june .
ten days later , bike systems registered for insolvency . undeterred , the employees came up with the idea of producing the strike bike " we want to show potential investors that we have the capacity cover the costs of production , " schillat said . the three-speed bike , which is available in men 's and women 's models and comes in a symbolic red color , costs 275 euros .
customers needed to pay the sum in advance . " we do n't have any materials here , " schillat said , " you try ringing to order bike parts as a bankrupt firm .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 17-kilo bike only comes in one colour - red .
" you ca n't make any money with the strike bike , " he told the german daily die welt . in order to turn a profit , the nordhausen factory would have to manufacture at least 200,000 bikes a year .
and without an investor , the workers wo n't be able to raise the sums needed to keep the factory open .
according to kegel , for just the parts needed to produce that number , workers would need an advance of 7 to 8 million euros . and according to wolfgang wutzke , the head of the firm in charge of the insolvency , there still is n't an investor in sight . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the students ' surroundings are almost idyllic ; the small campus sits nestled among chestnut trees , the havel river murmurs just steps away , and the sun is shining on the kind of cool , crisp day . but these seven graduate students are embarking on a course of study that will have them focused for the next two years on one of the most horrifying events in the history of mankind , the murder of 6 million jews by the nazis . " i know it will be hard , but i 'm prepared and i think i can handle it , " said student lisa könig-hauff , 38 , who already has a degree in history and politics from cologne university .
" it 's important that we make the holocaust accessible to the general public . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exhibition hall at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem the new master 's degree program at touro college is called holocaust communication and tolerance , and aims at teaching people how to best relate the genocide to new generations , and who could later work , for example , in museums , in the media , or for memorial organizations . the 1940s are becoming ever more distant , holocaust survivors and even their children are dying , and a new generation , raised in an age of digital multimedia , is less interested in learning history from dry recitations of facts and figures .
in order to keep the holocaust from fading in our public memory , new ways at telling the story are needed , according to andreas nachama , director of touro college 's new holocaust institute . " those who work on holocaust exhibitions often present everything that they know to the visitor , " he said .
" that can overwhelm people , who end up leaving empty-handed .
that 's one of our key points , to find the right amount of information to communicate . " telling the story in this first seminar , students will learn the factual basics of the holocaust , from the beginnings of anti-jewish laws in the third reich to the workings of industrial murder sites such as auschwitz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : touro college berlin students will later explore strategies to communicate the holocaust in exhibitions , publications and in the media , and study a wide range of holocaust-related material - everything from charlie chaplin 's 1940 hitler-satire " the great dictator " to internet offerings today .
they will research theoretical aspects of memory and remembrance and get practical training , including an eight-week internship program next summer .
they will have a studio at their disposal where they can record interviews with eyewitnesses . " telling the individual stories in my opinion makes more sense than communicating simple facts , " said könig-hauff .
" and we need to learn to use all the new media possibilities in telling about this . " besides looking at new ways of communicating the enormity of the genocide , students will conduct their own research , and college officials and professors hope that new information will be uncovered along the way .
although more than six decades have passed since the liberation of the death camps , there is still much to be learned . " for example , there is the connection between german companies and the exploitation and looting of predominately jewish property , " said ingo loose , a professor who specializes in the economic aspects of the third reich and the holocaust .
" this discussion has begun 10 or 15 years ago and it 's still an open field to be discussed . " bildunterschrift : individual stories are often more effective than a flood of facts and figures he points to the documentary on german television at the end of september that exposed a history of nazi profiteering and the use of slave labor by the quandt family , leading industrialists during the third reich and now major shareholders in carmaker bmw . touro college is a private liberal arts college that was founded in 1970 and named after isaac touro and his son judah , major philanthropists in colonial america .
the college , based in new york , also has campuses in california , israel , russia and berlin .
alongside the new holocaust communication program , the college offers a degree program in business administration that includes courses on american culture and a judaic studies option . holocaust fatigue touro officials began considering the formation of the program several years ago when a discussion began in germany about holocaust fatigue .
some wondered if it was time to put a little less focus on the events that to some seemed so long ago .
a series of books and television programs came out that focused on germans ' role as victims during the war .
and younger people were increasingly finding it harder to relate to the event , according to wolfgang benz , director of the center for anti-semitism research at berlin 's technical university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the auschwitz death camp " you just have to ask students , who 'll immediately say ' yeah , we know all that already , " ' he said .
" there 's a sense among some in the public that on tv you just see things about the holocaust .
there 's a certain defensive attitude now . " still , he said germany 's schools and media handle this darkest part of the country 's history well , in most cases .
he does say one strategy sometimes used in holocaust education - piling guilt on younger generations about events they had nothing to do with - is counterproductive , but he thinks training all teachers in appropriate ways to communicate the genocide would be better than focusing on a handful of specialists . but specialization is exactly the goal of guy band , a 30-year-old israeli starting at touro who also works as a volunteer at berlin 's house of the wannsee conference , where nazi officials planned the " final solution . "
he is interested in learning how the holocaust is perceived in germany and how germans have dealt with their past , since he comes to it from an israeli perspective .
he said he also thinks the holocaust offers lessons for today . " we can take examples from the holocaust and compare it to today , " he said , " i think it 's very important to see where things can go wrong , where they can become radicalized and where we have to say stop , we wo n't accept that .

" the svp dresses all this up in xenophobic and anti-european colors , " she told the afp news agency .
" people think they are defending themselves by voting svp . "
the center-right radicals saw their share of the vote drop slightly and the christian democrats saw a slight gain , taking them to 15.6 percent and 14.6 percent respectively .
greens also a big winner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svp election posters sparked widespread protest at home and abroad the greens , the fifth biggest party , garnered 9.6 percent of the vote , up 2.2 percentage points from four years ago .
the socialists ' losses were partly due to advances made by the greens .
in parliament in berne , the people 's party now have 62 of the 200 seats .
that is an increase of seven on their previous majority .
the socialists -lrb- sp -rrb- have 43 mandates .
the radicals and the christian democrats both gained 31 seats .
the greens gained six seats and will now be represented by 20 deputies .
this is their best performance in their history and reflects growing fears about climate change .
the country must now await the election of the cabinet in early december to see whether the new division of seats will alter the balance of power there .
the four main parties have shared the cabinet posts in an informal consensus knows as the " concordat " for 50 years .
it remains unclear whether the greens will now be included in the government . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

twelve turkish soldiers were killed by the pkk at the weekend . the eu commission has issued a statement sharply condemning the actions of the pkk , the outlawed kurdish workers ' party in southeastern turkey and expressing understanding for turkey 's need to protect its citizens . but enlargement commissioner olli rehn said turkey and iraq had to " solve the problem with cooperation and with regard to international law . " the german government has also appealed to turkey to show restraint .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier telephoned his turkish counterpart ali babacan to urge ankara to refrain from steps which could destabilize the region . government spokesman thomas steg renewed this call . ' sense of proportion ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish rebels operate near the turkish border " now it is important to avoid this fresh provocation leading to a spiral of violence in the region .
i appeal to the turkish government to act with a sense of proportion in this difficult situation and avoid a dangerous destabilization of the region , " steg said . the country 's defense minister , vecdi gönül , has said he will not immediately enter the region .
instead , he said , he will wait for joint action with the us . on sunday afternoon , at least 12 turkish soldiers were reported dead and 32 pkk members were killed in retaliation amid the bloodiest fighting in years between kurdish pkk rebels and turkish soldiers on the northern iraq border . in the wake of the news , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan held an emergency meeting of political and military leaders , including turkish president abdullah gül .
after the meeting gül issued a statement saying , " we will continue on our path of determination in fighting the terrorist organization .
we respect iraq 's national borders .
but -lrb- we -rrb- will not tolerate those who help and harbor terrorists . " according to turkish military reports , on sunday afternoon pkk fighters entered the turkish province hakkari from northern iraq , attacking an army post there .
spokesmen for the kurds say turkish solders have been taken hostage ; and turkish officials told afp news service that eight turkish soldiers are missing . turkish lawmakers allow attack but despite the intense border fighting , turkish defense minister gönül has said he would not immediately conduct a targeted invasion of the region .
he told his us counterpart robert gates at a meeting in kiev that the turkish military is , indeed , planning such an attack , but he prefer that it be led together with the us , news reports said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier condemned pkk attacks last wednesday , the turkish parliament laid the way for a military attack by green-lighting a plan to allow for an invasion , should it come to that .
the turkish government passed the plan following months of pleading for us support in the region .
turkey , the us and the eu all consider the pkk to be a terrorist group . washington hopes to avoid armed conflict in northern iraq , however .
it fears bringing turbulence into the last peaceful region of the country , and also worries about further damage to its own image as an occupying force . moreover , the current regime in teheran supports the underground pjak group , which works together with the pkk . for the past several months , pkk guerrilla fighters have been actively attacking turkish military interests from within northern iraq .
a total of around 100 turkish soldiers have died since the beginning of the year , prompting the turkish army to massively boost the numbers of soldiers in the border region to approximately 60,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan , left , and gül are hoping for us military support the pkk has been fighting for more autonomy in kurdish regions for more than 20 years . oil interests could be involved on saturday , the pkk threatened attacks on oil pipelines in the region if turkey decides in favor of military intervention in northern iraq .
exports of oil produced near the northern iraqi state of kirkuk travel via the turkish port of ceyhan . for its part , the iraqi parliament called for the pkk to leave the country .
news reports quoted iraqi parliament president mahmud al-maschhadani as saying : " we denounce attacks on neighboring states and we call for armed pkk members to leave iraqi sovereignty . " but in a follow up to a meeting with the president of the autonomous kurdish region in northern iraq , iraqi president jalal talabani , who is kurdish , said his government could not combat the pkk .
he reiterated iraq 's demand that pkk rebels lay down their arms and restated calls for a diplomatic solution ; he wants the pkk to turn itself into a political organization . talabani : ' not even a cat ' will be handed over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi president talabani still hopes for a political solution talabani angered turks further on sunday by saying , " we will not hand any kurd over to turkey , not even a kurdish cat , " according to media reports . northern iraq is home to some 3,500 pkk fighters , according to turkish estimates . turkish pm erdogan wants to sit down together with us president bush on nov .

they 're looking over a reading list while a professor explains the focus of the upcoming semester .
the students ' surroundings are almost idyllic ; the small campus sits nestled among chestnut trees , the havel river murmurs just steps away , and the sun is shining on the kind of cool , crisp day . but these seven graduate students are embarking on a course of study that will have them focused for the next two years on one of the most horrifying events in the history of mankind , the murder of 6 million jews by the nazis . " i know it will be hard , but i 'm prepared and i think i can handle it , " said student lisa könig-hauff , 38 , who already has a degree in history and politics from cologne university .

in order to keep the holocaust from fading in our public memory , new ways at telling the story are needed , according to andreas nachama , director of touro college 's new holocaust institute . " those who work on holocaust exhibitions often present everything that they know to the visitor , " he said .

they will research theoretical aspects of memory and remembrance and get practical training , including an eight-week internship program next summer .
they will have a studio at their disposal where they can record interviews with eyewitnesses . " telling the individual stories in my opinion makes more sense than communicating simple facts , " said könig-hauff .
" and we need to learn to use all the new media possibilities in telling about this . " besides looking at new ways of communicating the enormity of the genocide , students will conduct their own research , and college officials and professors hope that new information will be uncovered along the way .
although more than six decades have passed since the liberation of the death camps , there is still much to be learned . " for example , there is the connection between german companies and the exploitation and looting of predominately jewish property , " said ingo loose , a professor who specializes in the economic aspects of the third reich and the holocaust .

they 're looking over a reading list while a professor explains the focus of the upcoming semester .
the students ' surroundings are almost idyllic ; the small campus sits nestled among chestnut trees , the havel river murmurs just steps away , and the sun is shining on the kind of cool , crisp day . but these seven graduate students are embarking on a course of study that will have them focused for the next two years on one of the most horrifying events in the history of mankind , the murder of 6 million jews by the nazis . " i know it will be hard , but i 'm prepared and i think i can handle it , " said student lisa könig-hauff , 38 , who already has a degree in history and politics from cologne university .
" it 's important that we make the holocaust accessible to the general public . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exhibition hall at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem the new master 's degree program at touro college is called holocaust communication and tolerance , and aims at teaching people how to best relate the genocide to new generations , and who could later work , for example , in museums , in the media , or for memorial organizations . the 1940s are becoming ever more distant , holocaust survivors and even their children are dying , and a new generation , raised in an age of digital multimedia , is less interested in learning history from dry recitations of facts and figures .
in order to keep the holocaust from fading in our public memory , new ways at telling the story are needed , according to andreas nachama , director of touro college 's new holocaust institute . " those who work on holocaust exhibitions often present everything that they know to the visitor , " he said .
" that can overwhelm people , who end up leaving empty-handed .
that 's one of our key points , to find the right amount of information to communicate . " telling the story in this first seminar , students will learn the factual basics of the holocaust , from the beginnings of anti-jewish laws in the third reich to the workings of industrial murder sites such as auschwitz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : touro college berlin students will later explore strategies to communicate the holocaust in exhibitions , publications and in the media , and study a wide range of holocaust-related material - everything from charlie chaplin 's 1940 hitler-satire " the great dictator " to internet offerings today .
they will research theoretical aspects of memory and remembrance and get practical training , including an eight-week internship program next summer .
they will have a studio at their disposal where they can record interviews with eyewitnesses . " telling the individual stories in my opinion makes more sense than communicating simple facts , " said könig-hauff .
" and we need to learn to use all the new media possibilities in telling about this . " besides looking at new ways of communicating the enormity of the genocide , students will conduct their own research , and college officials and professors hope that new information will be uncovered along the way .
although more than six decades have passed since the liberation of the death camps , there is still much to be learned . " for example , there is the connection between german companies and the exploitation and looting of predominately jewish property , " said ingo loose , a professor who specializes in the economic aspects of the third reich and the holocaust .
" this discussion has begun 10 or 15 years ago and it 's still an open field to be discussed . " bildunterschrift : individual stories are often more effective than a flood of facts and figures he points to the documentary on german television at the end of september that exposed a history of nazi profiteering and the use of slave labor by the quandt family , leading industrialists during the third reich and now major shareholders in carmaker bmw . touro college is a private liberal arts college that was founded in 1970 and named after isaac touro and his son judah , major philanthropists in colonial america .
the college , based in new york , also has campuses in california , israel , russia and berlin .
alongside the new holocaust communication program , the college offers a degree program in business administration that includes courses on american culture and a judaic studies option . holocaust fatigue touro officials began considering the formation of the program several years ago when a discussion began in germany about holocaust fatigue .
some wondered if it was time to put a little less focus on the events that to some seemed so long ago .
a series of books and television programs came out that focused on germans ' role as victims during the war .
and younger people were increasingly finding it harder to relate to the event , according to wolfgang benz , director of the center for anti-semitism research at berlin 's technical university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the auschwitz death camp " you just have to ask students , who 'll immediately say ' yeah , we know all that already , " ' he said .
" there 's a sense among some in the public that on tv you just see things about the holocaust .
there 's a certain defensive attitude now . " still , he said germany 's schools and media handle this darkest part of the country 's history well , in most cases .
he does say one strategy sometimes used in holocaust education - piling guilt on younger generations about events they had nothing to do with - is counterproductive , but he thinks training all teachers in appropriate ways to communicate the genocide would be better than focusing on a handful of specialists . but specialization is exactly the goal of guy band , a 30-year-old israeli starting at touro who also works as a volunteer at berlin 's house of the wannsee conference , where nazi officials planned the " final solution . "
he is interested in learning how the holocaust is perceived in germany and how germans have dealt with their past , since he comes to it from an israeli perspective .
he said he also thinks the holocaust offers lessons for today . " we can take examples from the holocaust and compare it to today , " he said , " i think it 's very important to see where things can go wrong , where they can become radicalized and where we have to say stop , we wo n't accept that .

but he says the new government will face its toughest challenges at home rather than in the sphere of foreign policy . these were the most important parliamentary elections since the fall of communism 18 years ago .
and since voter turnout topped 50 percent for the first time in 14 years , many poles apparently thought so , too .
the electorate appears to have punished the law and justice party of the two kaczynski brothers severely for poisoning political life in poland , for creating an atmosphere of suspicion and adopting an aggressive tone .
civic platform -lrb- platforma obywatelska -rrb- , a party with a free-market philosophy , emerged as the victor because it understood that the majority could not be won over with the ideology and the language of the kaczynskis .
it has learned to tell voters what they want to hear .
it made attractive electoral pledges and went with the patriotic-conservative flow , hiding its free-market policies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubert wohlan there is a lot of evidence that the polish parliament will be able to live with less populism .
two parties that were part of the governing coalition until recently failed to make it over the 5 percent threshold to get into parliament .
after voters delivered a slap on the wrist to the ultra-roman catholic league of polish families and the radical rural-based self-defense party , there is hope that it is only a question of time before the political landscape recovers .
however , outgoing polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski and his squad will ensure that populism does not disappear from parliament , since their parties will still be represented there .
the true challenges await the victor on the domestic stage and not in the sphere of foreign policy .
the government will probably be made up of a coalition between civic platform and the liberal-conservative peasants ' party .
together they will have to reform the health service and patch up the ailing pension system .
very little was said about that in the election .
german-polish relations look set to benefit from the change of government .
the kaczynski brothers ' party neglected dialogue with germany and at times even refused to sit down at the table .
that is likely to change .

some 35,000 jobs could come under the axe at giant deutsche telekom , on top of the tens of thousands already being lost , according to calculations made by german media . sales and restructuring could lead to major job cuts at deutsche telekom , according to a report published monday , oct .
22 , in the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel . the article cited " internal calculations " within the company , which employed some 249,000 people at the end of 2006 , 89,000 of them outside germany , as the reason behind the redundancies . the magazine said deutsche telekom boss rene obermann refused to comment on the figure , while stressing " the need to adapt and restructure " the group he has headed for the past year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark times could be coming for thousands more telekom employees " i think a job reduction of this size is realistic , " lothar schröder , chairman of the verdi trade union , told the süddeutsche zeitung on sunday .
schröder is also the deputy head of telekom 's supervisory board . schröder added that the union would fight any plans to cuts jobs .
the magazine did not say when the reported job cuts could take place . jobs outside the company a deutsche telekom spokesman , however , said the company 's calculations did not call for job cuts . " it 's not about dismissals , but employees who will keep their jobs outside of the company , " the spokesman said . deutsche telekom is europe 's biggest telecoms group .
it has had problems in its core german market because of heightened competition and has lost numerous clients to rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann took over as head of deutsche telekom in november under obermann , telekom is in the process of cutting 32,000 jobs by the end of 2008 and has shaved off another 50,000 in the service sector . " there are business areas that we will sell or look for partners for - that 's well known , " obermann told der spiegel .
" if we did not do this , the company as a whole would become less and less competitive . " buying and selling to continue the former german telecommunication monopoly has sold off subsidiaries in spain and france , but has also bought a cellular phone company in the united states .
at the beginning of july , telekom upset trade unions by shifting 50,000 jobs in its troubled t-com land-line unit into three independent companies , where employees would be forced to work longer hours for less pay . in an interview sunday , obermann said the group would step up investments in developing nations , where the telecommunications sector is booming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's iphone provider , telekom said rates would be under 50 euros per month " in the long term , i can see us investing in developing countries because there is a dearth of infrastructure in these nations , " he said on the n-tv news channel .
" we are far from achieving our full potential . " earlier this year , obermann had said the company did not have immediate plans to invest in emerging markets , and was accused of falling behind its rivals . since becoming a private company in 1995 , telekom has cut an average of 10,000 jobs per year , according to n-tv . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're looking over a reading list while a professor explains the focus of the upcoming semester .
the students ' surroundings are almost idyllic ; the small campus sits nestled among chestnut trees , the havel river murmurs just steps away , and the sun is shining on the kind of cool , crisp day . but these seven graduate students are embarking on a course of study that will have them focused for the next two years on one of the most horrifying events in the history of mankind , the murder of 6 million jews by the nazis . " i know it will be hard , but i 'm prepared and i think i can handle it , " said student lisa könig-hauff , 38 , who already has a degree in history and politics from cologne university .
" it 's important that we make the holocaust accessible to the general public . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exhibition hall at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem the new master 's degree program at touro college is called holocaust communication and tolerance , and aims at teaching people how to best relate the genocide to new generations , and who could later work , for example , in museums , in the media , or for memorial organizations . the 1940s are becoming ever more distant , holocaust survivors and even their children are dying , and a new generation , raised in an age of digital multimedia , is less interested in learning history from dry recitations of facts and figures .
in order to keep the holocaust from fading in our public memory , new ways at telling the story are needed , according to andreas nachama , director of touro college 's new holocaust institute . " those who work on holocaust exhibitions often present everything that they know to the visitor , " he said .
" that can overwhelm people , who end up leaving empty-handed .
that 's one of our key points , to find the right amount of information to communicate . " telling the story in this first seminar , students will learn the factual basics of the holocaust , from the beginnings of anti-jewish laws in the third reich to the workings of industrial murder sites such as auschwitz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : touro college berlin students will later explore strategies to communicate the holocaust in exhibitions , publications and in the media , and study a wide range of holocaust-related material - everything from charlie chaplin 's 1940 hitler-satire " the great dictator " to internet offerings today .
they will research theoretical aspects of memory and remembrance and get practical training , including an eight-week internship program next summer .
they will have a studio at their disposal where they can record interviews with eyewitnesses . " telling the individual stories in my opinion makes more sense than communicating simple facts , " said könig-hauff .
" and we need to learn to use all the new media possibilities in telling about this . " besides looking at new ways of communicating the enormity of the genocide , students will conduct their own research , and college officials and professors hope that new information will be uncovered along the way .
although more than six decades have passed since the liberation of the death camps , there is still much to be learned . " for example , there is the connection between german companies and the exploitation and looting of predominately jewish property , " said ingo loose , a professor who specializes in the economic aspects of the third reich and the holocaust .
" this discussion has begun 10 or 15 years ago and it 's still an open field to be discussed . " bildunterschrift : individual stories are often more effective than a flood of facts and figures he points to the documentary on german television at the end of september that exposed a history of nazi profiteering and the use of slave labor by the quandt family , leading industrialists during the third reich and now major shareholders in carmaker bmw . touro college is a private liberal arts college that was founded in 1970 and named after isaac touro and his son judah , major philanthropists in colonial america .
the college , based in new york , also has campuses in california , israel , russia and berlin .
alongside the new holocaust communication program , the college offers a degree program in business administration that includes courses on american culture and a judaic studies option . holocaust fatigue touro officials began considering the formation of the program several years ago when a discussion began in germany about holocaust fatigue .
some wondered if it was time to put a little less focus on the events that to some seemed so long ago .
a series of books and television programs came out that focused on germans ' role as victims during the war .
and younger people were increasingly finding it harder to relate to the event , according to wolfgang benz , director of the center for anti-semitism research at berlin 's technical university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the auschwitz death camp " you just have to ask students , who 'll immediately say ' yeah , we know all that already , " ' he said .
" there 's a sense among some in the public that on tv you just see things about the holocaust .
there 's a certain defensive attitude now . " still , he said germany 's schools and media handle this darkest part of the country 's history well , in most cases .
he does say one strategy sometimes used in holocaust education - piling guilt on younger generations about events they had nothing to do with - is counterproductive , but he thinks training all teachers in appropriate ways to communicate the genocide would be better than focusing on a handful of specialists . but specialization is exactly the goal of guy band , a 30-year-old israeli starting at touro who also works as a volunteer at berlin 's house of the wannsee conference , where nazi officials planned the " final solution . "
he is interested in learning how the holocaust is perceived in germany and how germans have dealt with their past , since he comes to it from an israeli perspective .
he said he also thinks the holocaust offers lessons for today . " we can take examples from the holocaust and compare it to today , " he said , " i think it 's very important to see where things can go wrong , where they can become radicalized and where we have to say stop , we wo n't accept that .

they 're looking over a reading list while a professor explains the focus of the upcoming semester .
the students ' surroundings are almost idyllic ; the small campus sits nestled among chestnut trees , the havel river murmurs just steps away , and the sun is shining on the kind of cool , crisp day . but these seven graduate students are embarking on a course of study that will have them focused for the next two years on one of the most horrifying events in the history of mankind , the murder of 6 million jews by the nazis . " i know it will be hard , but i 'm prepared and i think i can handle it , " said student lisa könig-hauff , 38 , who already has a degree in history and politics from cologne university .
" it 's important that we make the holocaust accessible to the general public . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exhibition hall at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem the new master 's degree program at touro college is called holocaust communication and tolerance , and aims at teaching people how to best relate the genocide to new generations , and who could later work , for example , in museums , in the media , or for memorial organizations . the 1940s are becoming ever more distant , holocaust survivors and even their children are dying , and a new generation , raised in an age of digital multimedia , is less interested in learning history from dry recitations of facts and figures .
in order to keep the holocaust from fading in our public memory , new ways at telling the story are needed , according to andreas nachama , director of touro college 's new holocaust institute . " those who work on holocaust exhibitions often present everything that they know to the visitor , " he said .
" that can overwhelm people , who end up leaving empty-handed .
that 's one of our key points , to find the right amount of information to communicate . " telling the story in this first seminar , students will learn the factual basics of the holocaust , from the beginnings of anti-jewish laws in the third reich to the workings of industrial murder sites such as auschwitz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : touro college berlin students will later explore strategies to communicate the holocaust in exhibitions , publications and in the media , and study a wide range of holocaust-related material - everything from charlie chaplin 's 1940 hitler-satire " the great dictator " to internet offerings today .
they will research theoretical aspects of memory and remembrance and get practical training , including an eight-week internship program next summer .
they will have a studio at their disposal where they can record interviews with eyewitnesses . " telling the individual stories in my opinion makes more sense than communicating simple facts , " said könig-hauff .
" and we need to learn to use all the new media possibilities in telling about this . " besides looking at new ways of communicating the enormity of the genocide , students will conduct their own research , and college officials and professors hope that new information will be uncovered along the way .
although more than six decades have passed since the liberation of the death camps , there is still much to be learned . " for example , there is the connection between german companies and the exploitation and looting of predominately jewish property , " said ingo loose , a professor who specializes in the economic aspects of the third reich and the holocaust .
" this discussion has begun 10 or 15 years ago and it 's still an open field to be discussed .

twelve turkish soldiers were killed by the pkk at the weekend . the eu commission has issued a statement sharply condemning the actions of the pkk , the outlawed kurdish workers ' party in southeastern turkey and expressing understanding for turkey 's need to protect its citizens . but enlargement commissioner olli rehn said turkey and iraq had to " solve the problem with cooperation and with regard to international law .

instead , he said , he will wait for joint action with the us . on sunday afternoon , at least 12 turkish soldiers were reported dead and 32 pkk members were killed in retaliation amid the bloodiest fighting in years between kurdish pkk rebels and turkish soldiers on the northern iraq border . in the wake of the news , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan held an emergency meeting of political and military leaders , including turkish president abdullah gül .

the turkish government passed the plan following months of pleading for us support in the region .
turkey , the us and the eu all consider the pkk to be a terrorist group . washington hopes to avoid armed conflict in northern iraq , however .
it fears bringing turbulence into the last peaceful region of the country , and also worries about further damage to its own image as an occupying force . moreover , the current regime in teheran supports the underground pjak group , which works together with the pkk . for the past several months , pkk guerrilla fighters have been actively attacking turkish military interests from within northern iraq .
a total of around 100 turkish soldiers have died since the beginning of the year , prompting the turkish army to massively boost the numbers of soldiers in the border region to approximately 60,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan , left , and gül are hoping for us military support the pkk has been fighting for more autonomy in kurdish regions for more than 20 years . oil interests could be involved on saturday , the pkk threatened attacks on oil pipelines in the region if turkey decides in favor of military intervention in northern iraq .
exports of oil produced near the northern iraqi state of kirkuk travel via the turkish port of ceyhan . for its part , the iraqi parliament called for the pkk to leave the country .
news reports quoted iraqi parliament president mahmud al-maschhadani as saying : " we denounce attacks on neighboring states and we call for armed pkk members to leave iraqi sovereignty . " but in a follow up to a meeting with the president of the autonomous kurdish region in northern iraq , iraqi president jalal talabani , who is kurdish , said his government could not combat the pkk .
he reiterated iraq 's demand that pkk rebels lay down their arms and restated calls for a diplomatic solution ; he wants the pkk to turn itself into a political organization . talabani : ' not even a cat ' will be handed over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi president talabani still hopes for a political solution talabani angered turks further on sunday by saying , " we will not hand any kurd over to turkey , not even a kurdish cat , " according to media reports . northern iraq is home to some 3,500 pkk fighters , according to turkish estimates . turkish pm erdogan wants to sit down together with us president bush on nov .

it was the best-ever election result gained by a party since 1919 and consolidated its majority . the populist svp 's strengthened its position in parliament after it ran a controversial campaign calling for the expulsion of foreigners who commit serious crimes and for throwing out entire immigrant families .
party president ueli maurer attributed the win primarily to the party 's anti-immigration and anti-crime campaign .
" those who are against the eu , who want lower taxes , who want security and fewer criminal foreigners voted for the svp , " he said . the party was accused of racism and xenophobia for a campaign poster that showed white sheep kicking a black sheep off the swiss flag with the slogan , " for more security . "
it even earned the party condemnation from the united nations .
socialist : svp panders to people 's fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svp president , ueli maurer , was all smiles after hearing the results the swiss socialists suffered a major setback in the elections , losing 3.8 percent of their support and taking 19.5 percent of the vote .
socialist parliamentarian liliane maury pasquier said the svp had played on people 's fears of globalization and feeling of economic and social insecurity .
" the svp dresses all this up in xenophobic and anti-european colors , " she told the afp news agency .
" people think they are defending themselves by voting svp . "
the center-right radicals saw their share of the vote drop slightly and the christian democrats saw a slight gain , taking them to 15.6 percent and 14.6 percent respectively .
greens also a big winner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : svp election posters sparked widespread protest at home and abroad the greens , the fifth biggest party , garnered 9.6 percent of the vote , up 2.2 percentage points from four years ago .
the socialists ' losses were partly due to advances made by the greens .
in parliament in berne , the people 's party now have 62 of the 200 seats .
that is an increase of seven on their previous majority .
the socialists -lrb- sp -rrb- have 43 mandates .
the radicals and the christian democrats both gained 31 seats .
the greens gained six seats and will now be represented by 20 deputies .
this is their best performance in their history and reflects growing fears about climate change .
the country must now await the election of the cabinet in early december to see whether the new division of seats will alter the balance of power there .
the four main parties have shared the cabinet posts in an informal consensus knows as the " concordat " for 50 years .
it remains unclear whether the greens will now be included in the government . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he says the new government will face its toughest challenges at home rather than in the sphere of foreign policy . these were the most important parliamentary elections since the fall of communism 18 years ago .
and since voter turnout topped 50 percent for the first time in 14 years , many poles apparently thought so , too .
the electorate appears to have punished the law and justice party of the two kaczynski brothers severely for poisoning political life in poland , for creating an atmosphere of suspicion and adopting an aggressive tone .
civic platform -lrb- platforma obywatelska -rrb- , a party with a free-market philosophy , emerged as the victor because it understood that the majority could not be won over with the ideology and the language of the kaczynskis .
it has learned to tell voters what they want to hear .
it made attractive electoral pledges and went with the patriotic-conservative flow , hiding its free-market policies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubert wohlan there is a lot of evidence that the polish parliament will be able to live with less populism .
two parties that were part of the governing coalition until recently failed to make it over the 5 percent threshold to get into parliament .
after voters delivered a slap on the wrist to the ultra-roman catholic league of polish families and the radical rural-based self-defense party , there is hope that it is only a question of time before the political landscape recovers .
however , outgoing polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski and his squad will ensure that populism does not disappear from parliament , since their parties will still be represented there .
the true challenges await the victor on the domestic stage and not in the sphere of foreign policy .
the government will probably be made up of a coalition between civic platform and the liberal-conservative peasants ' party .
together they will have to reform the health service and patch up the ailing pension system .
very little was said about that in the election .
german-polish relations look set to benefit from the change of government .
the kaczynski brothers ' party neglected dialogue with germany and at times even refused to sit down at the table .

they 're looking over a reading list while a professor explains the focus of the upcoming semester .
the students ' surroundings are almost idyllic ; the small campus sits nestled among chestnut trees , the havel river murmurs just steps away , and the sun is shining on the kind of cool , crisp day . but these seven graduate students are embarking on a course of study that will have them focused for the next two years on one of the most horrifying events in the history of mankind , the murder of 6 million jews by the nazis . " i know it will be hard , but i 'm prepared and i think i can handle it , " said student lisa könig-hauff , 38 , who already has a degree in history and politics from cologne university .
" it 's important that we make the holocaust accessible to the general public . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exhibition hall at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem the new master 's degree program at touro college is called holocaust communication and tolerance , and aims at teaching people how to best relate the genocide to new generations , and who could later work , for example , in museums , in the media , or for memorial organizations . the 1940s are becoming ever more distant , holocaust survivors and even their children are dying , and a new generation , raised in an age of digital multimedia , is less interested in learning history from dry recitations of facts and figures .
in order to keep the holocaust from fading in our public memory , new ways at telling the story are needed , according to andreas nachama , director of touro college 's new holocaust institute . " those who work on holocaust exhibitions often present everything that they know to the visitor , " he said .
" that can overwhelm people , who end up leaving empty-handed .
that 's one of our key points , to find the right amount of information to communicate . " telling the story in this first seminar , students will learn the factual basics of the holocaust , from the beginnings of anti-jewish laws in the third reich to the workings of industrial murder sites such as auschwitz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : touro college berlin students will later explore strategies to communicate the holocaust in exhibitions , publications and in the media , and study a wide range of holocaust-related material - everything from charlie chaplin 's 1940 hitler-satire " the great dictator " to internet offerings today .
they will research theoretical aspects of memory and remembrance and get practical training , including an eight-week internship program next summer .

" and we need to learn to use all the new media possibilities in telling about this . " besides looking at new ways of communicating the enormity of the genocide , students will conduct their own research , and college officials and professors hope that new information will be uncovered along the way .
although more than six decades have passed since the liberation of the death camps , there is still much to be learned .

they 're looking over a reading list while a professor explains the focus of the upcoming semester .
the students ' surroundings are almost idyllic ; the small campus sits nestled among chestnut trees , the havel river murmurs just steps away , and the sun is shining on the kind of cool , crisp day . but these seven graduate students are embarking on a course of study that will have them focused for the next two years on one of the most horrifying events in the history of mankind , the murder of 6 million jews by the nazis . " i know it will be hard , but i 'm prepared and i think i can handle it , " said student lisa könig-hauff , 38 , who already has a degree in history and politics from cologne university .
" it 's important that we make the holocaust accessible to the general public . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exhibition hall at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem the new master 's degree program at touro college is called holocaust communication and tolerance , and aims at teaching people how to best relate the genocide to new generations , and who could later work , for example , in museums , in the media , or for memorial organizations . the 1940s are becoming ever more distant , holocaust survivors and even their children are dying , and a new generation , raised in an age of digital multimedia , is less interested in learning history from dry recitations of facts and figures .
in order to keep the holocaust from fading in our public memory , new ways at telling the story are needed , according to andreas nachama , director of touro college 's new holocaust institute . " those who work on holocaust exhibitions often present everything that they know to the visitor , " he said .
" that can overwhelm people , who end up leaving empty-handed .
that 's one of our key points , to find the right amount of information to communicate . " telling the story in this first seminar , students will learn the factual basics of the holocaust , from the beginnings of anti-jewish laws in the third reich to the workings of industrial murder sites such as auschwitz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : touro college berlin students will later explore strategies to communicate the holocaust in exhibitions , publications and in the media , and study a wide range of holocaust-related material - everything from charlie chaplin 's 1940 hitler-satire " the great dictator " to internet offerings today .
they will research theoretical aspects of memory and remembrance and get practical training , including an eight-week internship program next summer .
they will have a studio at their disposal where they can record interviews with eyewitnesses . " telling the individual stories in my opinion makes more sense than communicating simple facts , " said könig-hauff .

22 , to take steps to comply with the bloc 's landmark 2004 antitrust decision against it . in a major turnaround of policy , the world 's largest software maker said it would comply with the eu 's 2004 antitrust ruling that said microsoft was abusing its dominant market position to crush rivals .
that will include making available to open-source software developers information they need so that their programs work smoothly with microsoft window 's operating system for personal computers .
in addition , microsoft will also reduce high royalties it requires from open source software developers for open source software developers to a nominal one-time payment of 10,000 euros , the eu commission said .
office desktop pcs use work group server software made by microsoft and others to sign on to , print and access files .
" a victory for the consumer " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes called the news a " victory for the consumer , " saying microsoft was finally taking concrete steps to comply with the 2004 ruling after several delays , two court decisions and daily penalty payments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroes said the move is good news for consumers kroes said microsoft ceo steve ballmer had assured her in a telephone conversation the company would fulfill all the conditions attached to the antitrust ruling .
" the repercussions of these changes will start now and will continue for years to come , " kroes told a news conference , adding that microsoft 's agreement would have " profound effects " on the software industry .
last month , the european court of first instance confirmed the eu 's 2004 antitrust finding that the world 's largest software maker had used its dominant market position to crush rivals .
it also backed the commission 's imposition of a record fine of 497 million euros -lrb- $ 690 million -rrb- .
a microsoft spokesman told the afp news agency that the company would no longer appeal the court decision , signaling the end of a long court battle .
microsoft said its discussions with the commission were constructive and it " will continue to work closely with the commission and the industry to ensure a flourishing and competitive environment for information technology . "
the end of a legal saga the case dates back to march 2004 when the commission ruled after a five-year probe that microsoft was using its 95-percent share of the desktop computer market to bundle other products with the ubiquitous windows operating system .
the commission ordered the us-based multinational corporation to sell a version of their flagship windows operating system without a media player and to share technical information with competitors so that they could more easily create windows-compatible programs .
brussels fined microsoft a further 280 million euros in july last year after it emerged the company had not respected its original ruling . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

developers st modwen properties want to turn the land where stoke city 's former victoria ground was into housing .
however , local residents have said they would prefer to see the former ground turned into a park .

children in england are currently measured at the ages of five and 10 , but parents are informed of the results only if they request them .
the new plan may see parents getting results automatically .
the department of health said ministers were prepared to go further and faster in the fight against childhood obesity , but no firm decisions had been made .
between a quarter and a third of children are thought to be overweight , and doctors fear there will be an epidemic of poor health related to obesity in coming decades . "
the most success you can possibly have is being vigilant in both what you 're eating and how much of it you are eating " dr terry dovey an obese person dies on average nine years earlier than somebody of normal weight , while a very obese person 's life is cut short by an average of 13 years .
under the proposals being considered , information obtained under the measurement programme could be given automatically to parents , and involvement may become compulsory unless people choose to opt out of the measurement scheme .
early education tam fry , from the national obesity forum , said child obesity was a " huge problem to overcome " .
he said : " it 's a good thing in the sense that if the government expects parents to -lsb- have -rsb- prime responsibility for the raising of their children , it is absolutely essential that they should know what the healthy range of weight is .
have your say " why should tax payers pay for parents that do n't feed their children correctly ? "
georgina , camberley send us your comments " we would think , in fact , this whole thing has got to start earlier .
" if you start earlier , around the age of two and three from nursery , then you 've got the time to start to implant the healthy eating , healthy exercise education , which will then carry them through school . "
mr fry added that the forum would even like to start to promote this mode of lifestyle " from conception " .
' key stages ' but dr terry dovey , a psychologist at the university of staffordshire who specialises in childhood obesity , said " stigmatising " children and parents for having an overweight child was not the way forward .
he said : " the most success you can possibly have is being vigilant in both what you 're eating and how much of it you are eating .
" if you 're wanting to target specific groups then you have to have the key stages in the process to help the child and parents . "
a recent report by the foresight programme argued that dramatic and comprehensive action was required to stop the majority of us becoming obese by 2050 .

children in england are currently measured at the ages of five and 10 , but parents are informed of the results only if they request them .
the new plan may see parents getting results automatically .
the department of health said ministers were prepared to go further and faster in the fight against childhood obesity , but no firm decisions had been made .
between a quarter and a third of children are thought to be overweight , and doctors fear there will be an epidemic of poor health related to obesity in coming decades .

under the proposals being considered , information obtained under the measurement programme could be given automatically to parents , and involvement may become compulsory unless people choose to opt out of the measurement scheme .
early education tam fry , from the national obesity forum , said child obesity was a " huge problem to overcome " .
he said : " it 's a good thing in the sense that if the government expects parents to -lsb- have -rsb- prime responsibility for the raising of their children , it is absolutely essential that they should know what the healthy range of weight is .

children in england are currently measured at the ages of five and 10 , but parents are informed of the results only if they request them .
the new plan may see parents getting results automatically .
the department of health said ministers were prepared to go further and faster in the fight against childhood obesity , but no firm decisions had been made .
between a quarter and a third of children are thought to be overweight , and doctors fear there will be an epidemic of poor health related to obesity in coming decades .
the most success you can possibly have is being vigilant in both what you 're eating and how much of it you are eating dr terry dovey an obese person dies on average nine years earlier than somebody of normal weight , while a very obese person 's life is cut short by an average of 13 years .
under the proposals being considered , information obtained under the measurement programme could be given automatically to parents , and involvement may become compulsory unless people choose to opt out of the measurement scheme .
early education tam fry , from the national obesity forum , said child obesity was a " huge problem to overcome " .
he said : " it 's a good thing in the sense that if the government expects parents to -lsb- have -rsb- prime responsibility for the raising of their children , it is absolutely essential that they should know what the healthy range of weight is .
have your say why should tax payers pay for parents that do n't feed their children correctly ?
georgina , camberley send us your comments " we would think , in fact , this whole thing has got to start earlier .
" if you start earlier , around the age of two and three from nursery , then you 've got the time to start to implant the healthy eating , healthy exercise education , which will then carry them through school . "
mr fry added that the forum would even like to start to promote this mode of lifestyle " from conception " .
' key stages ' but dr terry dovey , a psychologist at the university of staffordshire who specialises in childhood obesity , said " stigmatising " children and parents for having an overweight child was not the way forward .
he said : " the most success you can possibly have is being vigilant in both what you 're eating and how much of it you are eating .
" if you 're wanting to target specific groups then you have to have the key stages in the process to help the child and parents . "
a recent report by the foresight programme argued that dramatic and comprehensive action was required to stop the majority of us becoming obese by 2050 .
its authors predicted that if current trends continue , in that year , 60 % of men and half of women will be obese and cases of type 2 diabetes will rise by 70 % .
the report also suggested that cases of stroke will rise by 30 % by the middle of the century and cases of coronary heart disease will rise by 20 % .

children in england are currently measured at the ages of five and 10 , but parents are informed of the results only if they request them .
the new plan may see parents getting results automatically .
the department of health said ministers were prepared to go further and faster in the fight against childhood obesity , but no firm decisions had been made .
between a quarter and a third of children are thought to be overweight , and doctors fear there will be an epidemic of poor health related to obesity in coming decades .
the most success you can possibly have is being vigilant in both what you 're eating and how much of it you are eating dr terry dovey an obese person dies on average nine years earlier than somebody of normal weight , while a very obese person 's life is cut short by an average of 13 years .
under the proposals being considered , information obtained under the measurement programme could be given automatically to parents , and involvement may become compulsory unless people choose to opt out of the measurement scheme .
early education tam fry , from the national obesity forum , said child obesity was a " huge problem to overcome " .
he said : " it 's a good thing in the sense that if the government expects parents to -lsb- have -rsb- prime responsibility for the raising of their children , it is absolutely essential that they should know what the healthy range of weight is .
have your say why should tax payers pay for parents that do n't feed their children correctly ?
georgina , camberley send us your comments " we would think , in fact , this whole thing has got to start earlier .
" if you start earlier , around the age of two and three from nursery , then you 've got the time to start to implant the healthy eating , healthy exercise education , which will then carry them through school . "
mr fry added that the forum would even like to start to promote this mode of lifestyle " from conception " .
' key stages ' but dr terry dovey , a psychologist at the university of staffordshire who specialises in childhood obesity , said " stigmatising " children and parents for having an overweight child was not the way forward .
he said : " the most success you can possibly have is being vigilant in both what you 're eating and how much of it you are eating .
" if you 're wanting to target specific groups then you have to have the key stages in the process to help the child and parents . "
a recent report by the foresight programme argued that dramatic and comprehensive action was required to stop the majority of us becoming obese by 2050 .
its authors predicted that if current trends continue , in that year , 60 % of men and half of women will be obese and cases of type 2 diabetes will rise by 70 % .
the report also suggested that cases of stroke will rise by 30 % by the middle of the century and cases of coronary heart disease will rise by 20 % .

a claims management firm , robertson holbrook , has now agreed to pursue the bank at special hearings at cardiff county court later next month .
the firm applied for a winding-up order as hbos had not fully repaid £ 50,000 in overdraft charges to 11 customers .
but a high court hearing in leeds on friday agreed to extend an injunction against the order .
the bank had said it was ridiculous for such a profitable business to face the possibility of being declared insolvent .
it had retaliated against the threat of being wound up by gaining the high court injunction against the application two weeks ago .
robertson holbrook , based in cardiff , had intended to challenge the injunction at a further high court hearing in leeds last friday , and to press for the immediate payment of money outstanding from the original £ 50,000 owed to its clients .
off the hook ?
in the event , the claims management firm agreed to the injunction being extended , because the matter will now be settled at special " set aside " hearings in cardiff on 23 november .
tim russell , a spokesman for robertson holbrook , said the firm was not letting hbos off the hook .
" halifax -lsb- hbos -rsb- only have themselves to blame for the current predicament , " he said .
" had they adhered to the set court protocols , we would not have had to go to extreme measures to ensure that our clients ' cases are dealt with in a timely manner in accordance with the law , which most other banks have no problem at all in adhering to . "
the bank has so far paid £ 21,000 to the 11 customers who , in early august , won judgement against it for the return of overdraft charges , after asking robertson holbrook to take up their claims .
since then , the bank has argued it can ignore the county court decisions and have them set aside , because the high court is scheduled , next year , to hear a test case between the office of fair trading and eight banking groups .
this should decide , eventually , if the banks ' overdraft charges can be challenged legally .

a claims management firm , robertson holbrook , has now agreed to pursue the bank at special hearings at cardiff county court later next month .
the firm applied for a winding-up order as hbos had not fully repaid £ 50,000 in overdraft charges to 11 customers .
but a high court hearing in leeds on friday agreed to extend an injunction against the order .
the bank had said it was ridiculous for such a profitable business to face the possibility of being declared insolvent .
it had retaliated against the threat of being wound up by gaining the high court injunction against the application two weeks ago .
robertson holbrook , based in cardiff , had intended to challenge the injunction at a further high court hearing in leeds last friday , and to press for the immediate payment of money outstanding from the original £ 50,000 owed to its clients .
off the hook ?
in the event , the claims management firm agreed to the injunction being extended , because the matter will now be settled at special " set aside " hearings in cardiff on 23 november .
tim russell , a spokesman for robertson holbrook , said the firm was not letting hbos off the hook .
" halifax -lsb- hbos -rsb- only have themselves to blame for the current predicament , " he said .
" had they adhered to the set court protocols , we would not have had to go to extreme measures to ensure that our clients ' cases are dealt with in a timely manner in accordance with the law , which most other banks have no problem at all in adhering to . "
the bank has so far paid £ 21,000 to the 11 customers who , in early august , won judgement against it for the return of overdraft charges , after asking robertson holbrook to take up their claims .
since then , the bank has argued it can ignore the county court decisions and have them set aside , because the high court is scheduled , next year , to hear a test case between the office of fair trading and eight banking groups .

bbc news -pipe- science / nature -pipe- seeing the carbon for the trees bbc news / science / nature graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- monday , 22 october 2007 , 09:11 gmt 10:11 uk seeing the carbon for the trees viewpoint peter seligmann protecting the world 's remaining tropical forests will play a vital role in preventing dangerous climate change in the future , says peter seligmann .
in this week 's green room , he calls for a global system that offers nations an economic incentive to halt the destruction of the earth 's " lungs " . "
liberia 's greenhouse gas emissions are roughly 250,000 times lower than those of the us , yet its remaining forests store approximately four billion tonnes of carbon dioxide " " as liberian president ellen johnson-sirleaf met us president george bush at the white house last week , an expert from liberia 's forestry development authority was across the river in a hi-tech laboratory , working on his country 's potential involvement in a global strategy to confront climate change .
augustine johnson has been looking at ways to map and assess liberia 's remaining tropical forest and the carbon it stores .
if all goes according to plan , that carbon and the forest 's ability to store it will become a valuable economic asset capable of bringing new revenue to the african country in desperate need of help to recover from civil war .
the forests are already a valuable environmental asset for the whole planet .
fifteen years have passed since liberia and the us were among 190 countries that signed the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- at the rio earth summit .
since then , liberia has emerged from its long civil conflict , but economic recovery and widespread unemployment remain daunting challenges .
untapped asset climate change poses another major threat to liberia and other developing countries .
the anticipated impacts , such as rising sea levels and more severe droughts , will cause the most harm to the world 's poorest people living in nations that lack the resources to help them adapt .
liberia 's greenhouse gas emissions are roughly 250,000 times lower than those of the us , yet its remaining forests store approximately four billion tonnes of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , equivalent to the amount emitted by 57 million cars over 10 years .
original forests are universally recognised as one of our planet 's greatest natural resources because they provide jobs and sustenance for hundreds of millions of people .
they are nature 's pharmacies and raw material factories , with unmatched biological diversity .
they cleanse and restore water supplies , and they help prevent the spread of certain tropical diseases .
however , the amount of tropical forest our planet loses each year is one-and-a-half times the size of liberia , releasing almost 20 % of total greenhouse gas emissions - more than all the world 's cars , trucks and planes combined .
protect and preserve regulated carbon markets , recognised by the unfccc and mediated by kyoto protocol processes such as the clean development mechanism , offer incentives to reduce methane from farming and landfill sites .
the markets also have programmes that reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the industrial sectors of emerging economies such as china and india . "
with the right economic tools and technical assistance to protect these forests , we will not only be helping liberia , but a global community facing the unprecedented challenge of climate change " yet they lack any mechanism to reduce the emissions from cutting and burning the valuable tropical forests of developing countries .
at december 's un climate change conference in bali , indonesia , leaders from all countries can find common ground to ensure forest protection is included as a valid , direct and immediate action that generates measurable carbon credits .
president johnson-sirleaf has demonstrated liberia is a serious partner .
a year ago , her newly elected government enacted the forest reform law as a bold step to manage these natural forest resources .
the legislation established 30 % of its remaining forests as national protected areas .
these biologically rich and unique forests comprise the most extensive forest coverage in west africa , providing resources depended on by a large percentage of the nation 's people .
however , rampant poverty poses a serious threat to the government 's ambitious policy .
many people have little choice but to earn a living by logging or mining , sometimes within the forests that are protected by law .
liberia and other developing countries should be able to benefit economically from protecting their forests for the long-term global good , rather than sacrificing them for short-term survival .
but this will require reliable and consistent economic incentives from many different financing sources , including carbon credits and economic development assistance .
it will also require political will from developed nations such as the us , japan and eu member states .
investment will be needed to quantify the carbon savings from forestry protection , and to build technical capacity and expertise in the forestry programmes of developing countries .
and the corporate sector that buys carbon credits would have to be engaged and receptive to the concept .
like many developing countries in tropical africa , latin america and asia , liberia possesses a vast wealth of biologically rich and globally important forests , despite its difficult economic circumstances .
by supporting this promising and courageous democracy with the right economic tools and technical assistance to protect these forests , we will not only be helping liberia , but a global community facing the unprecedented challenge of climate change . "
peter a seligmann is chairman and chief executive of conservation international the green room is a series of opinion pieces on environmental topics running weekly on the bbc news website do you agree with peter seligmann ?
should we be doing more to reduce the emissions from cutting and burning the valuable tropical forests of developing countries ?
should we be paying countries like liberia not to destroy their own forests ?
we should definitely be providing financial incentives to stop de-forestation .
however , does liberia have the necessary resources to police this ?
illegal logging is a massive problem in other parts of the world .
with so much poverty and possibly corruption , is n't this going to be nearly impossible to enforce ?
paul , london perhaps it is not only in the rain forests that global capitalism is killing itself and us .
if we are to have a trully democratic system -lrb- iether globally or locally -rrb- -then surely we need to abandon the idea that democracy = free market capitalism .
if there is no such thing as a free lunch -then how can there be ever be such a thing as a free market ?
so why are we always forced to eat the pre-set packaged meal -instead of being allowed to choose the " a la carte " menu ?
presumably , we are not supposed to see the forest for the trees. trevor batten , manila , ph is it incentive to " protect forest " or to " avoid deforestation " ?
in the second case , one needs to estimate the amount of forest that would have been cut if the incentives were not present ...
that is tricky .
anyway monitoring forest cover precisely and on a short term regular basis is far from easy , on the technical point of view .
patrick , brussels absolutely .
at treetax we believe that to start we should pay the people / not politicians to protect the forests .
in the case of deserts we set the example of planting fruiting trees as a cash crop which has the beenfit of halting desertification and provides shade .
these are simple actions which produce long term benefits. julie lowe treetax , sheffield yes , it is a good topic to discuss .
it is necessary to wake up people who are in high position in each goverment all over the world. time to save our planet time to reforest again time to think and do action otherwise earth will be gone forever stop illegal logging stop curruption sarah blaauw , sipalay city negros occidental , philippines i think this is a great idea .
we should save the forsest and any inigenous people that live in them .
my concern is that we might save them for a while and then they get destroyed when economics change .
why do n't rich countries buy them for a charity that is wholly independent and then they are safe forever ?
phil cox , watford fascinating .
we have the opportunity to help decrease co2 emissions , save an invaluable forest -lrb- and countless species that reside there -rrb- , and help a third world country !
i ca n't imagine not taking advantage of this opportunity . but then again , i do live in america .
shawn mccorkle , college station , usa of course providing funds for standing forests will slow deforestation .
but in liberia with a per capita income of 130 dollars a year and a life per person of less than 48 years how much would be needed to dent poverty .
an old forest has no net volume growth .
hence the harvesting of old trees then replaced by new young trees would increase the annual carbon uptake .
further when considering carbon storage not only the live life of the tree must be considered , but also the length of time the wood remains before decay .
economically liberia needs a modern forestry sector to replace the present export of unsawn logs .
value added must be shifted to 3rd world countries also .
if any of you ever go to the mayan ruins of tikal you willsee lintels of chicle wood still sound and over a 1000 years old .
yet very little of that wood is harvested as it is slow and very hard to saw .
i am sure such rot resistant woods exist in africa with the same comercial problems .
yet they are the best storers of carbon .
also unless sub saharan africa reduces its human growth rate the forest and just about everything else will be swept away .
peter hubbell , tucson , arizona , u.s.a. the big question is how can you devise an effective mechanism that rewards governments for protecting forests .
from a c02 perspective the retention of forest is beneficial in three ways .
firstly the forest absorbs c02 , secondly forest destruction results in c02 being released and thirdly logging operations use large machines that use fossil fuels .
how to calculate the value of each of these elements is not easy .
for example mature trees absorb less c02 than younger ones .
and then how to measure if forests are being successfully maintained .
satellite imagery will help , but is not foolproof especially when trying to gauge forest density .
how about forest fires ?
what value should be ascribed to new forests ? -lrb- younger trees absorb more c02 -rrb- .
there are answers to all of these questions .
lets hope they are answered without too much political interference .
richard rhodes , chiang mai , thailand peace nobel prize to ipcc and mr al gore this year , has emphasized the significance of ' climate change ' .
incidentally mr al gore is from america , the highest green house gas emitter in the world and the ipcc chief dr pachouri is from india , which is projected to take over that role from us .
can someone put the ' sino indo us link ' in perspective ?
should someone play ' big brother ' ?
can india afford greener technologies ?
is it -lrb- im -rrb- possible for usa to curb its carbon footprint ?
how different are local policies on environment in these countries ?
can they compliment one another ? with due respect , is un , a useless body ?
kydala danappiah , bangalore , india it is welcoming to know that 'liberia 'despite its very poor economic state , extreme poverty , and other unmentioned characteristics of nothingness is far better than some of the world 's developed nations .
i think the developed nations should be proud of such achievement , and provide the rightful assistance needed to help detraumatise and stabilise such impoverished nation that suffers the debasement of a senseless and brainwashed war .
the funds given should be monitored at all levels of usage to avoid the disguised system of bandits using the funds on their families , and other unnecessary issues .
i also think the revelation of such contribution to climate change and rain forest 's protection should give rise to other developing countries to advocate in general for better assistance that the funds would be used to helping the common and poor families around the world not enriching politician 's pockets .
allen nyeka , melbourne , victoria , australia these tropical rainforests are massive carbon sinks and should be protected .
countries with such natural resources , if lacking other sources of economic wealth , should seek such incentives .
countries that emit large amounts of carbon dioxide would best benefit by investing in these forests .
of course , it would be much more beneficial if each country reduced its carbon footprint in the first place .
both require long-term preparation and action .
mark ostendorf , missouri , us i can not see us doing enough in time to halt the wanton destruction of this natural treasure .
the amazon forests are seriously threatened by drought and if they perish we will be in terrible trouble .
liberia is to be applauded and supported as much as is humanly possible to help conserve these irreplaceable resources for the good of humankind .
the developed world should take decisive and effective steps to reduce the toll on these forests .
call me cynical , but can you see that happening before it 's too late ?
pete roberts , rhiwlas this is an excellent idea in my opinion because studies have shown that preserving tropical forests could make a big contribution to cutting greenhouse gas production and the money spent on preserving them could be less than would be required for many high-tech solutions .
at the same time preserving them could help reduce poverty .
last but not least , part of the reason why we want to avoid man-made climate change is that we want to preserve nature , so preserving forest biodiversity , reducing poverty and reducing climate change could be tackled together .
ed , bath true , in this i believe forests should be treated and traded like intellectual property -lrb- i.e. for the benefit of pharmaceutics -rrb- with physical immunity .
they should be able to ' move ' within a country by trade , not destroyed .
the markets would love this .
and it would be of global benefit .
pieter vermeersch , dendermonde , belgium i have walked the forests of liberia and i have seen the greedy foreign and local people in the capital hungry to get to the trees .
the key to keeping the trees is educating the average liberian what a tree means to him or her and humanity .
the " big " people at top will work very hard to get every euro or dollar they can out of the natural resources in liberia and hardly any of that will benefit the masses , as usual .
cutting a tree does not have a huge emotional impact on us liberians .
recently very old flowering trees in the center of the city were completely cut down the only shade in the center and the only greenery .
it was seen as progress .
you have to ask yourself , who is in charge ?
even those in charge see cutting trees as gaining something for themselves .
no matter that a law was enacted , will it really protect liberian forests and why only 30percent of the whole forest ?
if we could get financing for not cutting , them those at top need to run after this immediately and ! save our forests for us and for all humans !
a liberian who cares , monrovia , liberia absolutely .
after spending three years in west africa -lrb- guinea , conakry -rrb- i am convinced that the african sub-continent will save the rest of the world by being able to offer up its natural resources - which by and large remain pristine .
if we can catch them in time before poverty reduces the forests to nothingness that is .
good for johnson and liberians to recognize this as a resource the rest of the world will soon die for , almost literally .
overdevelopment and the consumption levels seen in the west are proving to be bad for the planet , africa is the only place where this is not yet reality .
therese turner-jones , bridgetown , barbados considering the role of ' original ' tropical forests in climate stablisation and the quantity of carbon released into the atmosphere from deforestaion , i do n't think we have a choice .
but this will no doubt get tricky - the economic beneifts of forest conservation must be competetive -lrb- in the short and long term -rrb- with other land use strategies such as subsistence and commercial agriculture -lrb- including bio-fuel production -rrb- .
currently , other land use strategies are winning hands down ... lets give the climate-forest conservation model a chance !
brad mulley , bangui , car after reading this interesting rather exciting article , i ' ve understood yet , simpithised with the people all over the world trying to prevent forest pollution and the cutting of trees , asking god to help them in every step .
hhh hisham al-saleh , usa i think this is a brilliant idea that should be backed by all the necessary people .
in reality , people do have to make ands meet and if you can help them do that by providing a financial incentive and assistance and education , we have a chance of saving forests that we can never replace , that we have already lost too much of gemma foley , barnstaple , devon , uk great that this is happening but please look at what the australian gov is doing in tasmania .
australia has an 8 year drought and then they legalise the destruction of a thousand year old forest giving a logging company a 50 year contract for blanket clearing .
it begs belief .
greg page , castellina in chianti italy .
good article : ' avoided deforestation ' may be one of the very few good things to come out of the problem of climate change .
protecting natural forest helps both wildlife and climate , unlike many other supposed mitigation measures .
clive hambler , oxford , uk definately !
almost all of the tropical rainforests are in third world countries .
all these countries are crying out for investment , trade etc . , therefore there is a huge temptation to export rain forest products .
however , i believe there should be tight control of where that money goes to .
not , hopefully into the back pockets of politicians !

peter a seligmann is chairman and chief executive of conservation international the green room is a series of opinion pieces on environmental topics running weekly on the bbc news website do you agree with peter seligmann ?
should we be doing more to reduce the emissions from cutting and burning the valuable tropical forests of developing countries ?
should we be paying countries like liberia not to destroy their own forests ?
we should definitely be providing financial incentives to stop de-forestation .
however , does liberia have the necessary resources to police this ?
illegal logging is a massive problem in other parts of the world .
with so much poverty and possibly corruption , is n't this going to be nearly impossible to enforce ?
paul , london perhaps it is not only in the rain forests that global capitalism is killing itself and us .
if we are to have a trully democratic system -lrb- iether globally or locally -rrb- -then surely we need to abandon the idea that democracy = free market capitalism .
if there is no such thing as a free lunch -then how can there be ever be such a thing as a free market ?
so why are we always forced to eat the pre-set packaged meal -instead of being allowed to choose the " a la carte " menu ?
presumably , we are not supposed to see the forest for the trees. trevor batten , manila , ph is it incentive to " protect forest " or to " avoid deforestation " ?
in the second case , one needs to estimate the amount of forest that would have been cut if the incentives were not present ...
that is tricky .
anyway monitoring forest cover precisely and on a short term regular basis is far from easy , on the technical point of view .
patrick , brussels absolutely .
at treetax we believe that to start we should pay the people / not politicians to protect the forests .
in the case of deserts we set the example of planting fruiting trees as a cash crop which has the beenfit of halting desertification and provides shade .
these are simple actions which produce long term benefits. julie lowe treetax , sheffield yes , it is a good topic to discuss .
it is necessary to wake up people who are in high position in each goverment all over the world. time to save our planet time to reforest again time to think and do action otherwise earth will be gone forever stop illegal logging stop curruption sarah blaauw , sipalay city negros occidental , philippines i think this is a great idea .
we should save the forsest and any inigenous people that live in them .
my concern is that we might save them for a while and then they get destroyed when economics change .
why do n't rich countries buy them for a charity that is wholly independent and then they are safe forever ?
phil cox , watford fascinating .
we have the opportunity to help decrease co2 emissions , save an invaluable forest -lrb- and countless species that reside there -rrb- , and help a third world country !
i ca n't imagine not taking advantage of this opportunity . but then again , i do live in america .
shawn mccorkle , college station , usa of course providing funds for standing forests will slow deforestation .
but in liberia with a per capita income of 130 dollars a year and a life per person of less than 48 years how much would be needed to dent poverty .
an old forest has no net volume growth .
hence the harvesting of old trees then replaced by new young trees would increase the annual carbon uptake .
further when considering carbon storage not only the live life of the tree must be considered , but also the length of time the wood remains before decay .
economically liberia needs a modern forestry sector to replace the present export of unsawn logs .
value added must be shifted to 3rd world countries also .
if any of you ever go to the mayan ruins of tikal you willsee lintels of chicle wood still sound and over a 1000 years old .
yet very little of that wood is harvested as it is slow and very hard to saw .
i am sure such rot resistant woods exist in africa with the same comercial problems .
yet they are the best storers of carbon .
also unless sub saharan africa reduces its human growth rate the forest and just about everything else will be swept away .
peter hubbell , tucson , arizona , u.s.a. the big question is how can you devise an effective mechanism that rewards governments for protecting forests .
from a c02 perspective the retention of forest is beneficial in three ways .
firstly the forest absorbs c02 , secondly forest destruction results in c02 being released and thirdly logging operations use large machines that use fossil fuels .
how to calculate the value of each of these elements is not easy .
for example mature trees absorb less c02 than younger ones .
and then how to measure if forests are being successfully maintained .
satellite imagery will help , but is not foolproof especially when trying to gauge forest density .
how about forest fires ?
what value should be ascribed to new forests ? -lrb- younger trees absorb more c02 -rrb- .
there are answers to all of these questions .
lets hope they are answered without too much political interference .
richard rhodes , chiang mai , thailand peace nobel prize to ipcc and mr al gore this year , has emphasized the significance of ' climate change ' .
incidentally mr al gore is from america , the highest green house gas emitter in the world and the ipcc chief dr pachouri is from india , which is projected to take over that role from us .
can someone put the ' sino indo us link ' in perspective ?
should someone play ' big brother ' ?
can india afford greener technologies ?
is it -lrb- im -rrb- possible for usa to curb its carbon footprint ?
how different are local policies on environment in these countries ?
can they compliment one another ? with due respect , is un , a useless body ?
kydala danappiah , bangalore , india it is welcoming to know that 'liberia 'despite its very poor economic state , extreme poverty , and other unmentioned characteristics of nothingness is far better than some of the world 's developed nations .
i think the developed nations should be proud of such achievement , and provide the rightful assistance needed to help detraumatise and stabilise such impoverished nation that suffers the debasement of a senseless and brainwashed war .
the funds given should be monitored at all levels of usage to avoid the disguised system of bandits using the funds on their families , and other unnecessary issues .
i also think the revelation of such contribution to climate change and rain forest 's protection should give rise to other developing countries to advocate in general for better assistance that the funds would be used to helping the common and poor families around the world not enriching politician 's pockets .
allen nyeka , melbourne , victoria , australia these tropical rainforests are massive carbon sinks and should be protected .
countries with such natural resources , if lacking other sources of economic wealth , should seek such incentives .
countries that emit large amounts of carbon dioxide would best benefit by investing in these forests .
of course , it would be much more beneficial if each country reduced its carbon footprint in the first place .
both require long-term preparation and action .
mark ostendorf , missouri , us i can not see us doing enough in time to halt the wanton destruction of this natural treasure .
the amazon forests are seriously threatened by drought and if they perish we will be in terrible trouble .
liberia is to be applauded and supported as much as is humanly possible to help conserve these irreplaceable resources for the good of humankind .
the developed world should take decisive and effective steps to reduce the toll on these forests .
call me cynical , but can you see that happening before it 's too late ?
pete roberts , rhiwlas this is an excellent idea in my opinion because studies have shown that preserving tropical forests could make a big contribution to cutting greenhouse gas production and the money spent on preserving them could be less than would be required for many high-tech solutions .
at the same time preserving them could help reduce poverty .
last but not least , part of the reason why we want to avoid man-made climate change is that we want to preserve nature , so preserving forest biodiversity , reducing poverty and reducing climate change could be tackled together .
ed , bath true , in this i believe forests should be treated and traded like intellectual property -lrb- i.e. for the benefit of pharmaceutics -rrb- with physical immunity .
they should be able to ' move ' within a country by trade , not destroyed .
the markets would love this .
and it would be of global benefit .
pieter vermeersch , dendermonde , belgium i have walked the forests of liberia and i have seen the greedy foreign and local people in the capital hungry to get to the trees .
the key to keeping the trees is educating the average liberian what a tree means to him or her and humanity .
the " big " people at top will work very hard to get every euro or dollar they can out of the natural resources in liberia and hardly any of that will benefit the masses , as usual .
cutting a tree does not have a huge emotional impact on us liberians .
recently very old flowering trees in the center of the city were completely cut down the only shade in the center and the only greenery .
it was seen as progress .
you have to ask yourself , who is in charge ?
even those in charge see cutting trees as gaining something for themselves .
no matter that a law was enacted , will it really protect liberian forests and why only 30percent of the whole forest ?
if we could get financing for not cutting , them those at top need to run after this immediately and ! save our forests for us and for all humans !
a liberian who cares , monrovia , liberia absolutely .
after spending three years in west africa -lrb- guinea , conakry -rrb- i am convinced that the african sub-continent will save the rest of the world by being able to offer up its natural resources - which by and large remain pristine .
if we can catch them in time before poverty reduces the forests to nothingness that is .
good for johnson and liberians to recognize this as a resource the rest of the world will soon die for , almost literally .
overdevelopment and the consumption levels seen in the west are proving to be bad for the planet , africa is the only place where this is not yet reality .
therese turner-jones , bridgetown , barbados considering the role of ' original ' tropical forests in climate stablisation and the quantity of carbon released into the atmosphere from deforestaion , i do n't think we have a choice .
but this will no doubt get tricky - the economic beneifts of forest conservation must be competetive -lrb- in the short and long term -rrb- with other land use strategies such as subsistence and commercial agriculture -lrb- including bio-fuel production -rrb- .
currently , other land use strategies are winning hands down ... lets give the climate-forest conservation model a chance !
brad mulley , bangui , car after reading this interesting rather exciting article , i ' ve understood yet , simpithised with the people all over the world trying to prevent forest pollution and the cutting of trees , asking god to help them in every step .
hhh hisham al-saleh , usa i think this is a brilliant idea that should be backed by all the necessary people .
in reality , people do have to make ands meet and if you can help them do that by providing a financial incentive and assistance and education , we have a chance of saving forests that we can never replace , that we have already lost too much of gemma foley , barnstaple , devon , uk great that this is happening but please look at what the australian gov is doing in tasmania .
australia has an 8 year drought and then they legalise the destruction of a thousand year old forest giving a logging company a 50 year contract for blanket clearing .
it begs belief .
greg page , castellina in chianti italy .
good article : ' avoided deforestation ' may be one of the very few good things to come out of the problem of climate change .
protecting natural forest helps both wildlife and climate , unlike many other supposed mitigation measures .
clive hambler , oxford , uk definately !
almost all of the tropical rainforests are in third world countries .
all these countries are crying out for investment , trade etc . , therefore there is a huge temptation to export rain forest products .
however , i believe there should be tight control of where that money goes to .
not , hopefully into the back pockets of politicians !

in this week 's green room , he calls for a global system that offers nations an economic incentive to halt the destruction of the earth 's " lungs " .
liberia 's greenhouse gas emissions are roughly 250,000 times lower than those of the us , yet its remaining forests store approximately four billion tonnes of carbon dioxide as liberian president ellen johnson-sirleaf met us president george bush at the white house last week , an expert from liberia 's forestry development authority was across the river in a hi-tech laboratory , working on his country 's potential involvement in a global strategy to confront climate change .
augustine johnson has been looking at ways to map and assess liberia 's remaining tropical forest and the carbon it stores .
if all goes according to plan , that carbon and the forest 's ability to store it will become a valuable economic asset capable of bringing new revenue to the african country in desperate need of help to recover from civil war .
the forests are already a valuable environmental asset for the whole planet .
fifteen years have passed since liberia and the us were among 190 countries that signed the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- at the rio earth summit .
since then , liberia has emerged from its long civil conflict , but economic recovery and widespread unemployment remain daunting challenges .
untapped asset climate change poses another major threat to liberia and other developing countries .
the anticipated impacts , such as rising sea levels and more severe droughts , will cause the most harm to the world 's poorest people living in nations that lack the resources to help them adapt .
nations such as liberia have high levels of people living in poverty liberia 's greenhouse gas emissions are roughly 250,000 times lower than those of the us , yet its remaining forests store approximately four billion tonnes of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , equivalent to the amount emitted by 57 million cars over 10 years .
original forests are universally recognised as one of our planet 's greatest natural resources because they provide jobs and sustenance for hundreds of millions of people .
they are nature 's pharmacies and raw material factories , with unmatched biological diversity .
they cleanse and restore water supplies , and they help prevent the spread of certain tropical diseases .
however , the amount of tropical forest our planet loses each year is one-and-a-half times the size of liberia , releasing almost 20 % of total greenhouse gas emissions - more than all the world 's cars , trucks and planes combined .
protect and preserve regulated carbon markets , recognised by the unfccc and mediated by kyoto protocol processes such as the clean development mechanism , offer incentives to reduce methane from farming and landfill sites .
the markets also have programmes that reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the industrial sectors of emerging economies such as china and india .
with the right economic tools and technical assistance to protect these forests , we will not only be helping liberia , but a global community facing the unprecedented challenge of climate change yet they lack any mechanism to reduce the emissions from cutting and burning the valuable tropical forests of developing countries .
at december 's un climate change conference in bali , indonesia , leaders from all countries can find common ground to ensure forest protection is included as a valid , direct and immediate action that generates measurable carbon credits .
president johnson-sirleaf has demonstrated liberia is a serious partner .
a year ago , her newly elected government enacted the forest reform law as a bold step to manage these natural forest resources .
the legislation established 30 % of its remaining forests as national protected areas .
these biologically rich and unique forests comprise the most extensive forest coverage in west africa , providing resources depended on by a large percentage of the nation 's people .
however , rampant poverty poses a serious threat to the government 's ambitious policy .
many people have little choice but to earn a living by logging or mining , sometimes within the forests that are protected by law .
liberia and other developing countries should be able to benefit economically from protecting their forests for the long-term global good , rather than sacrificing them for short-term survival .
but this will require reliable and consistent economic incentives from many different financing sources , including carbon credits and economic development assistance .
it will also require political will from developed nations such as the us , japan and eu member states .
investment will be needed to quantify the carbon savings from forestry protection , and to build technical capacity and expertise in the forestry programmes of developing countries .
and the corporate sector that buys carbon credits would have to be engaged and receptive to the concept .
like many developing countries in tropical africa , latin america and asia , liberia possesses a vast wealth of biologically rich and globally important forests , despite its difficult economic circumstances .
by supporting this promising and courageous democracy with the right economic tools and technical assistance to protect these forests , we will not only be helping liberia , but a global community facing the unprecedented challenge of climate change .

augustine johnson has been looking at ways to map and assess liberia 's remaining tropical forest and the carbon it stores .
if all goes according to plan , that carbon and the forest 's ability to store it will become a valuable economic asset capable of bringing new revenue to the african country in desperate need of help to recover from civil war .
the forests are already a valuable environmental asset for the whole planet .
fifteen years have passed since liberia and the us were among 190 countries that signed the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- at the rio earth summit .
since then , liberia has emerged from its long civil conflict , but economic recovery and widespread unemployment remain daunting challenges .
untapped asset climate change poses another major threat to liberia and other developing countries .
the anticipated impacts , such as rising sea levels and more severe droughts , will cause the most harm to the world 's poorest people living in nations that lack the resources to help them adapt .
nations such as liberia have high levels of people living in poverty liberia 's greenhouse gas emissions are roughly 250,000 times lower than those of the us , yet its remaining forests store approximately four billion tonnes of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , equivalent to the amount emitted by 57 million cars over 10 years .
original forests are universally recognised as one of our planet 's greatest natural resources because they provide jobs and sustenance for hundreds of millions of people .
they are nature 's pharmacies and raw material factories , with unmatched biological diversity .
they cleanse and restore water supplies , and they help prevent the spread of certain tropical diseases .
however , the amount of tropical forest our planet loses each year is one-and-a-half times the size of liberia , releasing almost 20 % of total greenhouse gas emissions - more than all the world 's cars , trucks and planes combined .
protect and preserve regulated carbon markets , recognised by the unfccc and mediated by kyoto protocol processes such as the clean development mechanism , offer incentives to reduce methane from farming and landfill sites .
the markets also have programmes that reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the industrial sectors of emerging economies such as china and india .
with the right economic tools and technical assistance to protect these forests , we will not only be helping liberia , but a global community facing the unprecedented challenge of climate change yet they lack any mechanism to reduce the emissions from cutting and burning the valuable tropical forests of developing countries .
at december 's un climate change conference in bali , indonesia , leaders from all countries can find common ground to ensure forest protection is included as a valid , direct and immediate action that generates measurable carbon credits .
president johnson-sirleaf has demonstrated liberia is a serious partner .
a year ago , her newly elected government enacted the forest reform law as a bold step to manage these natural forest resources .
the legislation established 30 % of its remaining forests as national protected areas .
these biologically rich and unique forests comprise the most extensive forest coverage in west africa , providing resources depended on by a large percentage of the nation 's people .
however , rampant poverty poses a serious threat to the government 's ambitious policy .
many people have little choice but to earn a living by logging or mining , sometimes within the forests that are protected by law .
liberia and other developing countries should be able to benefit economically from protecting their forests for the long-term global good , rather than sacrificing them for short-term survival .
but this will require reliable and consistent economic incentives from many different financing sources , including carbon credits and economic development assistance .
it will also require political will from developed nations such as the us , japan and eu member states .
investment will be needed to quantify the carbon savings from forestry protection , and to build technical capacity and expertise in the forestry programmes of developing countries .
and the corporate sector that buys carbon credits would have to be engaged and receptive to the concept .
like many developing countries in tropical africa , latin america and asia , liberia possesses a vast wealth of biologically rich and globally important forests , despite its difficult economic circumstances .
by supporting this promising and courageous democracy with the right economic tools and technical assistance to protect these forests , we will not only be helping liberia , but a global community facing the unprecedented challenge of climate change .
peter a seligmann is chairman and chief executive of conservation international the green room is a series of opinion pieces on environmental topics running weekly on the bbc news website do you agree with peter seligmann ?
should we be doing more to reduce the emissions from cutting and burning the valuable tropical forests of developing countries ?
should we be paying countries like liberia not to destroy their own forests ?
we should definitely be providing financial incentives to stop de-forestation .
however , does liberia have the necessary resources to police this ?
illegal logging is a massive problem in other parts of the world .
with so much poverty and possibly corruption , is n't this going to be nearly impossible to enforce ?
paul , london perhaps it is not only in the rain forests that global capitalism is killing itself and us .
if we are to have a trully democratic system -lrb- iether globally or locally -rrb- -then surely we need to abandon the idea that democracy = free market capitalism .
if there is no such thing as a free lunch -then how can there be ever be such a thing as a free market ?
so why are we always forced to eat the pre-set packaged meal -instead of being allowed to choose the " a la carte " menu ?
presumably , we are not supposed to see the forest for the trees. trevor batten , manila , ph is it incentive to " protect forest " or to " avoid deforestation " ?
in the second case , one needs to estimate the amount of forest that would have been cut if the incentives were not present ...
that is tricky .
anyway monitoring forest cover precisely and on a short term regular basis is far from easy , on the technical point of view .
patrick , brussels absolutely .
at treetax we believe that to start we should pay the people / not politicians to protect the forests .
in the case of deserts we set the example of planting fruiting trees as a cash crop which has the beenfit of halting desertification and provides shade .
these are simple actions which produce long term benefits. julie lowe treetax , sheffield yes , it is a good topic to discuss .
it is necessary to wake up people who are in high position in each goverment all over the world. time to save our planet time to reforest again time to think and do action otherwise earth will be gone forever stop illegal logging stop curruption sarah blaauw , sipalay city negros occidental , philippines i think this is a great idea .
we should save the forsest and any inigenous people that live in them .
my concern is that we might save them for a while and then they get destroyed when economics change .
why do n't rich countries buy them for a charity that is wholly independent and then they are safe forever ?
phil cox , watford fascinating .
we have the opportunity to help decrease co2 emissions , save an invaluable forest -lrb- and countless species that reside there -rrb- , and help a third world country !
i ca n't imagine not taking advantage of this opportunity . but then again , i do live in america .
shawn mccorkle , college station , usa of course providing funds for standing forests will slow deforestation .
but in liberia with a per capita income of 130 dollars a year and a life per person of less than 48 years how much would be needed to dent poverty .
an old forest has no net volume growth .
hence the harvesting of old trees then replaced by new young trees would increase the annual carbon uptake .
further when considering carbon storage not only the live life of the tree must be considered , but also the length of time the wood remains before decay .
economically liberia needs a modern forestry sector to replace the present export of unsawn logs .
value added must be shifted to 3rd world countries also .
if any of you ever go to the mayan ruins of tikal you willsee lintels of chicle wood still sound and over a 1000 years old .
yet very little of that wood is harvested as it is slow and very hard to saw .
i am sure such rot resistant woods exist in africa with the same comercial problems .
yet they are the best storers of carbon .
also unless sub saharan africa reduces its human growth rate the forest and just about everything else will be swept away .
peter hubbell , tucson , arizona , u.s.a. the big question is how can you devise an effective mechanism that rewards governments for protecting forests .
from a c02 perspective the retention of forest is beneficial in three ways .
firstly the forest absorbs c02 , secondly forest destruction results in c02 being released and thirdly logging operations use large machines that use fossil fuels .
how to calculate the value of each of these elements is not easy .
for example mature trees absorb less c02 than younger ones .
and then how to measure if forests are being successfully maintained .
satellite imagery will help , but is not foolproof especially when trying to gauge forest density .
how about forest fires ?
what value should be ascribed to new forests ? -lrb- younger trees absorb more c02 -rrb- .
there are answers to all of these questions .
lets hope they are answered without too much political interference .
richard rhodes , chiang mai , thailand peace nobel prize to ipcc and mr al gore this year , has emphasized the significance of ' climate change ' .
incidentally mr al gore is from america , the highest green house gas emitter in the world and the ipcc chief dr pachouri is from india , which is projected to take over that role from us .
can someone put the ' sino indo us link ' in perspective ?
should someone play ' big brother ' ?
can india afford greener technologies ?
is it -lrb- im -rrb- possible for usa to curb its carbon footprint ?
how different are local policies on environment in these countries ?
can they compliment one another ? with due respect , is un , a useless body ?
kydala danappiah , bangalore , india it is welcoming to know that 'liberia 'despite its very poor economic state , extreme poverty , and other unmentioned characteristics of nothingness is far better than some of the world 's developed nations .
i think the developed nations should be proud of such achievement , and provide the rightful assistance needed to help detraumatise and stabilise such impoverished nation that suffers the debasement of a senseless and brainwashed war .
the funds given should be monitored at all levels of usage to avoid the disguised system of bandits using the funds on their families , and other unnecessary issues .
i also think the revelation of such contribution to climate change and rain forest 's protection should give rise to other developing countries to advocate in general for better assistance that the funds would be used to helping the common and poor families around the world not enriching politician 's pockets .
allen nyeka , melbourne , victoria , australia these tropical rainforests are massive carbon sinks and should be protected .
countries with such natural resources , if lacking other sources of economic wealth , should seek such incentives .
countries that emit large amounts of carbon dioxide would best benefit by investing in these forests .
of course , it would be much more beneficial if each country reduced its carbon footprint in the first place .
both require long-term preparation and action .
mark ostendorf , missouri , us i can not see us doing enough in time to halt the wanton destruction of this natural treasure .
the amazon forests are seriously threatened by drought and if they perish we will be in terrible trouble .
liberia is to be applauded and supported as much as is humanly possible to help conserve these irreplaceable resources for the good of humankind .
the developed world should take decisive and effective steps to reduce the toll on these forests .
call me cynical , but can you see that happening before it 's too late ?
pete roberts , rhiwlas this is an excellent idea in my opinion because studies have shown that preserving tropical forests could make a big contribution to cutting greenhouse gas production and the money spent on preserving them could be less than would be required for many high-tech solutions .
at the same time preserving them could help reduce poverty .
last but not least , part of the reason why we want to avoid man-made climate change is that we want to preserve nature , so preserving forest biodiversity , reducing poverty and reducing climate change could be tackled together .
ed , bath true , in this i believe forests should be treated and traded like intellectual property -lrb- i.e. for the benefit of pharmaceutics -rrb- with physical immunity .
they should be able to ' move ' within a country by trade , not destroyed .
the markets would love this .
and it would be of global benefit .
pieter vermeersch , dendermonde , belgium i have walked the forests of liberia and i have seen the greedy foreign and local people in the capital hungry to get to the trees .
the key to keeping the trees is educating the average liberian what a tree means to him or her and humanity .
the " big " people at top will work very hard to get every euro or dollar they can out of the natural resources in liberia and hardly any of that will benefit the masses , as usual .
cutting a tree does not have a huge emotional impact on us liberians .
recently very old flowering trees in the center of the city were completely cut down the only shade in the center and the only greenery .
it was seen as progress .
you have to ask yourself , who is in charge ?
even those in charge see cutting trees as gaining something for themselves .
no matter that a law was enacted , will it really protect liberian forests and why only 30percent of the whole forest ?
if we could get financing for not cutting , them those at top need to run after this immediately and ! save our forests for us and for all humans !
a liberian who cares , monrovia , liberia absolutely .
after spending three years in west africa -lrb- guinea , conakry -rrb- i am convinced that the african sub-continent will save the rest of the world by being able to offer up its natural resources - which by and large remain pristine .
if we can catch them in time before poverty reduces the forests to nothingness that is .
good for johnson and liberians to recognize this as a resource the rest of the world will soon die for , almost literally .
overdevelopment and the consumption levels seen in the west are proving to be bad for the planet , africa is the only place where this is not yet reality .
therese turner-jones , bridgetown , barbados considering the role of ' original ' tropical forests in climate stablisation and the quantity of carbon released into the atmosphere from deforestaion , i do n't think we have a choice .
but this will no doubt get tricky - the economic beneifts of forest conservation must be competetive -lrb- in the short and long term -rrb- with other land use strategies such as subsistence and commercial agriculture -lrb- including bio-fuel production -rrb- .
currently , other land use strategies are winning hands down ... lets give the climate-forest conservation model a chance !
brad mulley , bangui , car after reading this interesting rather exciting article , i ' ve understood yet , simpithised with the people all over the world trying to prevent forest pollution and the cutting of trees , asking god to help them in every step .
hhh hisham al-saleh , usa i think this is a brilliant idea that should be backed by all the necessary people .
in reality , people do have to make ands meet and if you can help them do that by providing a financial incentive and assistance and education , we have a chance of saving forests that we can never replace , that we have already lost too much of gemma foley , barnstaple , devon , uk great that this is happening but please look at what the australian gov is doing in tasmania .
australia has an 8 year drought and then they legalise the destruction of a thousand year old forest giving a logging company a 50 year contract for blanket clearing .
it begs belief .
greg page , castellina in chianti italy .
good article : ' avoided deforestation ' may be one of the very few good things to come out of the problem of climate change .
protecting natural forest helps both wildlife and climate , unlike many other supposed mitigation measures .
clive hambler , oxford , uk definately !
almost all of the tropical rainforests are in third world countries .
all these countries are crying out for investment , trade etc . , therefore there is a huge temptation to export rain forest products .
however , i believe there should be tight control of where that money goes to .
not , hopefully into the back pockets of politicians !

in reality , people do have to make ands meet and if you can help them do that by providing a financial incentive and assistance and education , we have a chance of saving forests that we can never replace , that we have already lost too much of gemma foley , barnstaple , devon , uk great that this is happening but please look at what the australian gov is doing in tasmania .
australia has an 8 year drought and then they legalise the destruction of a thousand year old forest giving a logging company a 50 year contract for blanket clearing .
it begs belief .
greg page , castellina in chianti italy .
good article : ' avoided deforestation ' may be one of the very few good things to come out of the problem of climate change .
protecting natural forest helps both wildlife and climate , unlike many other supposed mitigation measures .
clive hambler , oxford , uk definately !
almost all of the tropical rainforests are in third world countries .
all these countries are crying out for investment , trade etc . , therefore there is a huge temptation to export rain forest products .
however , i believe there should be tight control of where that money goes to .
not , hopefully into the back pockets of politicians !

in this week 's green room , he calls for a global system that offers nations an economic incentive to halt the destruction of the earth 's " lungs " .
liberia 's greenhouse gas emissions are roughly 250,000 times lower than those of the us , yet its remaining forests store approximately four billion tonnes of carbon dioxide as liberian president ellen johnson-sirleaf met us president george bush at the white house last week , an expert from liberia 's forestry development authority was across the river in a hi-tech laboratory , working on his country 's potential involvement in a global strategy to confront climate change .
augustine johnson has been looking at ways to map and assess liberia 's remaining tropical forest and the carbon it stores .
if all goes according to plan , that carbon and the forest 's ability to store it will become a valuable economic asset capable of bringing new revenue to the african country in desperate need of help to recover from civil war .
the forests are already a valuable environmental asset for the whole planet .
fifteen years have passed since liberia and the us were among 190 countries that signed the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- at the rio earth summit .
since then , liberia has emerged from its long civil conflict , but economic recovery and widespread unemployment remain daunting challenges .
untapped asset climate change poses another major threat to liberia and other developing countries .
the anticipated impacts , such as rising sea levels and more severe droughts , will cause the most harm to the world 's poorest people living in nations that lack the resources to help them adapt .
nations such as liberia have high levels of people living in poverty liberia 's greenhouse gas emissions are roughly 250,000 times lower than those of the us , yet its remaining forests store approximately four billion tonnes of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , equivalent to the amount emitted by 57 million cars over 10 years .
original forests are universally recognised as one of our planet 's greatest natural resources because they provide jobs and sustenance for hundreds of millions of people .
they are nature 's pharmacies and raw material factories , with unmatched biological diversity .
they cleanse and restore water supplies , and they help prevent the spread of certain tropical diseases .
however , the amount of tropical forest our planet loses each year is one-and-a-half times the size of liberia , releasing almost 20 % of total greenhouse gas emissions - more than all the world 's cars , trucks and planes combined .
protect and preserve regulated carbon markets , recognised by the unfccc and mediated by kyoto protocol processes such as the clean development mechanism , offer incentives to reduce methane from farming and landfill sites .
the markets also have programmes that reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the industrial sectors of emerging economies such as china and india .
with the right economic tools and technical assistance to protect these forests , we will not only be helping liberia , but a global community facing the unprecedented challenge of climate change yet they lack any mechanism to reduce the emissions from cutting and burning the valuable tropical forests of developing countries .
at december 's un climate change conference in bali , indonesia , leaders from all countries can find common ground to ensure forest protection is included as a valid , direct and immediate action that generates measurable carbon credits .
president johnson-sirleaf has demonstrated liberia is a serious partner .
a year ago , her newly elected government enacted the forest reform law as a bold step to manage these natural forest resources .
the legislation established 30 % of its remaining forests as national protected areas .
these biologically rich and unique forests comprise the most extensive forest coverage in west africa , providing resources depended on by a large percentage of the nation 's people .
however , rampant poverty poses a serious threat to the government 's ambitious policy .
many people have little choice but to earn a living by logging or mining , sometimes within the forests that are protected by law .
liberia and other developing countries should be able to benefit economically from protecting their forests for the long-term global good , rather than sacrificing them for short-term survival .
but this will require reliable and consistent economic incentives from many different financing sources , including carbon credits and economic development assistance .
it will also require political will from developed nations such as the us , japan and eu member states .
investment will be needed to quantify the carbon savings from forestry protection , and to build technical capacity and expertise in the forestry programmes of developing countries .
and the corporate sector that buys carbon credits would have to be engaged and receptive to the concept .
like many developing countries in tropical africa , latin america and asia , liberia possesses a vast wealth of biologically rich and globally important forests , despite its difficult economic circumstances .
by supporting this promising and courageous democracy with the right economic tools and technical assistance to protect these forests , we will not only be helping liberia , but a global community facing the unprecedented challenge of climate change .
peter a seligmann is chairman and chief executive of conservation international the green room is a series of opinion pieces on environmental topics running weekly on the bbc news website do you agree with peter seligmann ?
should we be doing more to reduce the emissions from cutting and burning the valuable tropical forests of developing countries ?
should we be paying countries like liberia not to destroy their own forests ?
we should definitely be providing financial incentives to stop de-forestation .
however , does liberia have the necessary resources to police this ?
illegal logging is a massive problem in other parts of the world .
with so much poverty and possibly corruption , is n't this going to be nearly impossible to enforce ?
paul , london perhaps it is not only in the rain forests that global capitalism is killing itself and us .
if we are to have a trully democratic system -lrb- iether globally or locally -rrb- -then surely we need to abandon the idea that democracy = free market capitalism .
if there is no such thing as a free lunch -then how can there be ever be such a thing as a free market ?
so why are we always forced to eat the pre-set packaged meal -instead of being allowed to choose the " a la carte " menu ?
presumably , we are not supposed to see the forest for the trees. trevor batten , manila , ph is it incentive to " protect forest " or to " avoid deforestation " ?
in the second case , one needs to estimate the amount of forest that would have been cut if the incentives were not present ...
that is tricky .
anyway monitoring forest cover precisely and on a short term regular basis is far from easy , on the technical point of view .
patrick , brussels absolutely .
at treetax we believe that to start we should pay the people / not politicians to protect the forests .
in the case of deserts we set the example of planting fruiting trees as a cash crop which has the beenfit of halting desertification and provides shade .
these are simple actions which produce long term benefits. julie lowe treetax , sheffield yes , it is a good topic to discuss .
it is necessary to wake up people who are in high position in each goverment all over the world. time to save our planet time to reforest again time to think and do action otherwise earth will be gone forever stop illegal logging stop curruption sarah blaauw , sipalay city negros occidental , philippines i think this is a great idea .
we should save the forsest and any inigenous people that live in them .
my concern is that we might save them for a while and then they get destroyed when economics change .
why do n't rich countries buy them for a charity that is wholly independent and then they are safe forever ?
phil cox , watford fascinating .
we have the opportunity to help decrease co2 emissions , save an invaluable forest -lrb- and countless species that reside there -rrb- , and help a third world country !
i ca n't imagine not taking advantage of this opportunity . but then again , i do live in america .
shawn mccorkle , college station , usa of course providing funds for standing forests will slow deforestation .
but in liberia with a per capita income of 130 dollars a year and a life per person of less than 48 years how much would be needed to dent poverty .
an old forest has no net volume growth .
hence the harvesting of old trees then replaced by new young trees would increase the annual carbon uptake .
further when considering carbon storage not only the live life of the tree must be considered , but also the length of time the wood remains before decay .
economically liberia needs a modern forestry sector to replace the present export of unsawn logs .
value added must be shifted to 3rd world countries also .
if any of you ever go to the mayan ruins of tikal you willsee lintels of chicle wood still sound and over a 1000 years old .
yet very little of that wood is harvested as it is slow and very hard to saw .
i am sure such rot resistant woods exist in africa with the same comercial problems .
yet they are the best storers of carbon .
also unless sub saharan africa reduces its human growth rate the forest and just about everything else will be swept away .
peter hubbell , tucson , arizona , u.s.a. the big question is how can you devise an effective mechanism that rewards governments for protecting forests .
from a c02 perspective the retention of forest is beneficial in three ways .
firstly the forest absorbs c02 , secondly forest destruction results in c02 being released and thirdly logging operations use large machines that use fossil fuels .
how to calculate the value of each of these elements is not easy .
for example mature trees absorb less c02 than younger ones .
and then how to measure if forests are being successfully maintained .
satellite imagery will help , but is not foolproof especially when trying to gauge forest density .
how about forest fires ?
what value should be ascribed to new forests ? -lrb- younger trees absorb more c02 -rrb- .
there are answers to all of these questions .
lets hope they are answered without too much political interference .
richard rhodes , chiang mai , thailand peace nobel prize to ipcc and mr al gore this year , has emphasized the significance of ' climate change ' .
incidentally mr al gore is from america , the highest green house gas emitter in the world and the ipcc chief dr pachouri is from india , which is projected to take over that role from us .
can someone put the ' sino indo us link ' in perspective ?
should someone play ' big brother ' ?
can india afford greener technologies ?
is it -lrb- im -rrb- possible for usa to curb its carbon footprint ?
how different are local policies on environment in these countries ?
can they compliment one another ? with due respect , is un , a useless body ?
kydala danappiah , bangalore , india it is welcoming to know that 'liberia 'despite its very poor economic state , extreme poverty , and other unmentioned characteristics of nothingness is far better than some of the world 's developed nations .
i think the developed nations should be proud of such achievement , and provide the rightful assistance needed to help detraumatise and stabilise such impoverished nation that suffers the debasement of a senseless and brainwashed war .
the funds given should be monitored at all levels of usage to avoid the disguised system of bandits using the funds on their families , and other unnecessary issues .
i also think the revelation of such contribution to climate change and rain forest 's protection should give rise to other developing countries to advocate in general for better assistance that the funds would be used to helping the common and poor families around the world not enriching politician 's pockets .
allen nyeka , melbourne , victoria , australia these tropical rainforests are massive carbon sinks and should be protected .
countries with such natural resources , if lacking other sources of economic wealth , should seek such incentives .
countries that emit large amounts of carbon dioxide would best benefit by investing in these forests .
of course , it would be much more beneficial if each country reduced its carbon footprint in the first place .
both require long-term preparation and action .
mark ostendorf , missouri , us i can not see us doing enough in time to halt the wanton destruction of this natural treasure .
the amazon forests are seriously threatened by drought and if they perish we will be in terrible trouble .
liberia is to be applauded and supported as much as is humanly possible to help conserve these irreplaceable resources for the good of humankind .
the developed world should take decisive and effective steps to reduce the toll on these forests .
call me cynical , but can you see that happening before it 's too late ?
pete roberts , rhiwlas this is an excellent idea in my opinion because studies have shown that preserving tropical forests could make a big contribution to cutting greenhouse gas production and the money spent on preserving them could be less than would be required for many high-tech solutions .
at the same time preserving them could help reduce poverty .
last but not least , part of the reason why we want to avoid man-made climate change is that we want to preserve nature , so preserving forest biodiversity , reducing poverty and reducing climate change could be tackled together .
ed , bath true , in this i believe forests should be treated and traded like intellectual property -lrb- i.e. for the benefit of pharmaceutics -rrb- with physical immunity .
they should be able to ' move ' within a country by trade , not destroyed .
the markets would love this .
and it would be of global benefit .
pieter vermeersch , dendermonde , belgium i have walked the forests of liberia and i have seen the greedy foreign and local people in the capital hungry to get to the trees .
the key to keeping the trees is educating the average liberian what a tree means to him or her and humanity .
the " big " people at top will work very hard to get every euro or dollar they can out of the natural resources in liberia and hardly any of that will benefit the masses , as usual .
cutting a tree does not have a huge emotional impact on us liberians .
recently very old flowering trees in the center of the city were completely cut down the only shade in the center and the only greenery .
it was seen as progress .
you have to ask yourself , who is in charge ?
even those in charge see cutting trees as gaining something for themselves .
no matter that a law was enacted , will it really protect liberian forests and why only 30percent of the whole forest ?
if we could get financing for not cutting , them those at top need to run after this immediately and ! save our forests for us and for all humans !
a liberian who cares , monrovia , liberia absolutely .
after spending three years in west africa -lrb- guinea , conakry -rrb- i am convinced that the african sub-continent will save the rest of the world by being able to offer up its natural resources - which by and large remain pristine .
if we can catch them in time before poverty reduces the forests to nothingness that is .
good for johnson and liberians to recognize this as a resource the rest of the world will soon die for , almost literally .
overdevelopment and the consumption levels seen in the west are proving to be bad for the planet , africa is the only place where this is not yet reality .
therese turner-jones , bridgetown , barbados considering the role of ' original ' tropical forests in climate stablisation and the quantity of carbon released into the atmosphere from deforestaion , i do n't think we have a choice .
but this will no doubt get tricky - the economic beneifts of forest conservation must be competetive -lrb- in the short and long term -rrb- with other land use strategies such as subsistence and commercial agriculture -lrb- including bio-fuel production -rrb- .
currently , other land use strategies are winning hands down ... lets give the climate-forest conservation model a chance !
brad mulley , bangui , car after reading this interesting rather exciting article , i ' ve understood yet , simpithised with the people all over the world trying to prevent forest pollution and the cutting of trees , asking god to help them in every step .
hhh hisham al-saleh , usa i think this is a brilliant idea that should be backed by all the necessary people .
in reality , people do have to make ands meet and if you can help them do that by providing a financial incentive and assistance and education , we have a chance of saving forests that we can never replace , that we have already lost too much of gemma foley , barnstaple , devon , uk great that this is happening but please look at what the australian gov is doing in tasmania .
australia has an 8 year drought and then they legalise the destruction of a thousand year old forest giving a logging company a 50 year contract for blanket clearing .
it begs belief .

in sunday 's referendum , about 75 % of voters backed the constitutional changes , election officials said .
president bakiyev said the new system would give the people more power , but opposition parties say the changes will hand more power to mr bakiyev .
the election is expected to take place later this year , probably in december .
reuters reported some election observers as saying there had been incidents of ballot-stuffing during sunday 's referendum , and the official turnout of 80 % of the country 's 2.7m voters was inflated .
but the central election commission denied any major irregularities .
political stand-off president bakiyev swept to power in 2005 , ousting long-term leader askar akayev and winning a landslide victory in presidential elections .
but since then , the central asian country has been hampered by a political stand-off between the president and parliamentary deputies elected during the akayev era .
the new constitution includes a proportional representation system of voting , where candidates are selected from central party lists rather than locally elected .
the president has formed his own party , ak zhol , and analysts say the constitutional changes will help him gain a foothold in the chamber .
other changes to the constitution include giving parliament more power in forming the government , and limiting the president 's ability to dismiss parliament .
it will also increase the number of deputies .
while president bakiyev says the changes will help to clarify the separation of power , his critics say they are a move towards authoritarianism .
the former soviet republic is strategically crucial for the us , whose only remaining military base in central asia lies just outside the capital bishkek .

he has written to representatives of 189 countries signed up to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
mr salmond is asking them to back his bid for scotland to have observer status at future treaty talks .
labour mp eric joyce said the letter could " potentially damage our national security interests " .
nuclear weapons defence is not an area devolved to holyrood .
mr joyce , the mp for falkirk , said that the uk had very complex relationships with some countries such as iran and zimbabwe .
mr joyce said : " alex salmond simply can not know whether he is making damaging assertions or not because he does not know the nature of our relationships with many of these complex and difficult countries .
" he has written to some very despotic and dangerous individuals , which we have very sensitive and complex relationships with , and treated it like a weekly political football .
it is potentially very damaging to our national security . "
" i really do think it is the wrong thing for the snp to be doing to be hosting a conference they do n't have responsibility for " wendy alexander scottish labour leader read brian taylor 's blog britain 's trident nuclear submarine fleet is based at hmnb clyde at faslane .
the snp government is opposed to the renewal of the nuclear weapons system .
deputy first minister nicola sturgeon said iran and zimbabwe were written to , along with other countries , because they are signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
" it is not about trying to make common cause with any particular country .
" given that trident is based in scotland , i think it is right that we make sure all of these countries know scotland 's view , " she said .
ms sturgeon , who is hosting an anti-trident summit organised by the scottish government , added that a majority of scottish mps and msps and the public were opposed to replacing the trident system .
constitutional matters the topics to be discussed will include how devolved powers could be used to block the possible replacement of the nuclear missile system .
opposition parties said the event proved that the snp focused on constitutional matters more than health and education .
scottish labour leader wendy alexander said the government was wrong to host the event .
she told bbc scotland 's politics show : " there are strong views on either side of the argument .
" but it is not a scotland-england issue , and i really do think it is the wrong thing for the snp to be doing to be hosting a conference they do n't have responsibility for . "
scottish liberal democrat leader nicol stephen msp said the scottish government should get on with the job they were elected to do .

mr salmond is asking them to back his bid for scotland to have observer status at future treaty talks .
labour mp eric joyce said the letter could " potentially damage our national security interests " .
nuclear weapons defence is not an area devolved to holyrood .
mr joyce , the mp for falkirk , said that the uk had very complex relationships with some countries such as iran and zimbabwe .
mr joyce said : " alex salmond simply can not know whether he is making damaging assertions or not because he does not know the nature of our relationships with many of these complex and difficult countries .

a whole generation is growing up for whom video games are a key part of how they relax , whether it be fragging friends in a first person shooter or backing up the main tank in a warcraft raid .
and it is not just youngsters .
there are plenty of older folks who shake off the dust of the working day in many different virtual worlds .
statistics from the the us entertainment software association -lrb- esa -rrb- back this up .
it claims that the average player is 33 and has more than a decade of gaming under their belt .
all of a sudden , say academics and researchers , companies have realised that all the time employees spend gaming in virtual worlds is changing them .
ian hughes , ibm 's metaverse evangelist , said many organisations were considering ways of harnessing the skills and familiarity their employees have with virtual environments .
this familiarity has driven many organisations to consider virtual worlds as places where employees can meet , mix and get on with the job .
" a lot of people are more accepting of that way of working just because of games , " he said .
" it 's about harnessing that ability to play to get work done . "
the formidable organisational skills needed to run a game team or guild , organise raids involving perhaps 40 people and co-ordinate their different abilities to defeat a game 's strongest foes are all relevant to work , said mr hughes .
game gear but it is not just the skills that gamers hone in futuristic or fantasy worlds that businesses want to co-opt .
some are taking their inspiration directly from the way that online games are structured .
skills learned on raids in games could apply to work too dr byron reeves , a professor of education at stanford university , said some firms were taking elements from games to overcome the difficulties of working life in the 21st century .
" the problems associated with distributed teams , collaboration and information overload right now are so severe , and the opportunities so good , that they are willing to look at anything , " he said .
dr reeves has founded a company called seriosity that applies game elements to workplaces .
it was working with five or six unnamed fortune 500 companies to harness the efficiencies of those game mechanics , said dr reeve .
one of the programs developed by seriosity adds a virtual currency element to e-mail in a bid to help people cope with information overload .
anyone sending a message adds some of their limited supply of virtual coins , called serios , to show how important they consider that e-mail to be .
it was a more finely grained grading system than the low , medium or high importance flags found in most e-mail programs , said dr reeves .
it had other benefits too , he said .
it revealed not just the flow of messages but also started to show who people pay attention to and who did a good job of getting responses .
some companies were starting to adopt even more of the elements familiar from games .
" there are people right now trying to map it one-to-one , " said dr reeves .
level playing field convinced that games can help them thrive some companies have turned work groups into guilds , rewarded staff with experience points when they complete tasks , giving out titles and badges when a guild finished a project and portraying objectives as quests .
virtual worlds could become key to future business life some were also considering using a virtual currency as a reward system allowing workers to cash in their savings for benefits or extras for their office space .
the top performing guilds also get to do the best projects .
none , so far , he said , were tying wages to how people performed in the quests and against other guilds .
" mapping levels and points on to wages is the most extreme application , " he said .
companies were adopting game mechanics for several reasons , said dr reeves .
partly because workers were so familiar with this structure , he said , and because people become powerfully motivated when they know how they compare to their contemporaries .
the main reason was for the transparency it gave to the way workplaces were organised and for revealing who got things done .
" it exposes those that do and do not play well , " said dr reeves .
" there is a leader board and you know the rules . "
it had the potential to turn workplaces into meritocracies where the most accomplished are easy to spot because they have racked up all rewards , achievements and levels required for a particular post .
while it may not sweep away systems of privilege or end nepotism it had the potential to make workplaces fairer and take some of the grind out of the day job , he said .
" the whole idea here is to get the objectives of the individual players aligned with the objectives of the organisation , " said dr reeves .
" do that and you have something good . "
angela barron , an advisor at the chartered institute of personnel and development , said games had long been used in training to expose personal preferences and prejudices .
many organisations also used courses that revolve around games to help make teams work together better or expose power structures among workers .
she said this was the first time she had heard of elements of online games being used in a similar way .
" i would not have thought enough people play games for it to be a great motivator , " she said .
but , she said , anything that helped staff develop a better working relationship and promote team work was likely to be a good thing .

a whole generation is growing up for whom video games are a key part of how they relax , whether it be fragging friends in a first person shooter or backing up the main tank in a warcraft raid .
and it is not just youngsters .
there are plenty of older folks who shake off the dust of the working day in many different virtual worlds .
statistics from the the us entertainment software association -lrb- esa -rrb- back this up .
it claims that the average player is 33 and has more than a decade of gaming under their belt .
all of a sudden , say academics and researchers , companies have realised that all the time employees spend gaming in virtual worlds is changing them .
ian hughes , ibm 's metaverse evangelist , said many organisations were considering ways of harnessing the skills and familiarity their employees have with virtual environments .
this familiarity has driven many organisations to consider virtual worlds as places where employees can meet , mix and get on with the job .
" a lot of people are more accepting of that way of working just because of games , " he said .
" it 's about harnessing that ability to play to get work done . "
the formidable organisational skills needed to run a game team or guild , organise raids involving perhaps 40 people and co-ordinate their different abilities to defeat a game 's strongest foes are all relevant to work , said mr hughes .
game gear but it is not just the skills that gamers hone in futuristic or fantasy worlds that businesses want to co-opt .
some are taking their inspiration directly from the way that online games are structured .
skills learned on raids in games could apply to work too dr byron reeves , a professor of education at stanford university , said some firms were taking elements from games to overcome the difficulties of working life in the 21st century .
" the problems associated with distributed teams , collaboration and information overload right now are so severe , and the opportunities so good , that they are willing to look at anything , " he said .
dr reeves has founded a company called seriosity that applies game elements to workplaces .
it was working with five or six unnamed fortune 500 companies to harness the efficiencies of those game mechanics , said dr reeve .
one of the programs developed by seriosity adds a virtual currency element to e-mail in a bid to help people cope with information overload .
anyone sending a message adds some of their limited supply of virtual coins , called serios , to show how important they consider that e-mail to be .
it was a more finely grained grading system than the low , medium or high importance flags found in most e-mail programs , said dr reeves .
it had other benefits too , he said .
it revealed not just the flow of messages but also started to show who people pay attention to and who did a good job of getting responses .
some companies were starting to adopt even more of the elements familiar from games .
" there are people right now trying to map it one-to-one , " said dr reeves .
level playing field convinced that games can help them thrive some companies have turned work groups into guilds , rewarded staff with experience points when they complete tasks , giving out titles and badges when a guild finished a project and portraying objectives as quests .
virtual worlds could become key to future business life some were also considering using a virtual currency as a reward system allowing workers to cash in their savings for benefits or extras for their office space .
the top performing guilds also get to do the best projects .
none , so far , he said , were tying wages to how people performed in the quests and against other guilds .
" mapping levels and points on to wages is the most extreme application , " he said .
companies were adopting game mechanics for several reasons , said dr reeves .
partly because workers were so familiar with this structure , he said , and because people become powerfully motivated when they know how they compare to their contemporaries .

a whole generation is growing up for whom video games are a key part of how they relax , whether it be fragging friends in a first person shooter or backing up the main tank in a warcraft raid .
and it is not just youngsters .
there are plenty of older folks who shake off the dust of the working day in many different virtual worlds .
statistics from the the us entertainment software association -lrb- esa -rrb- back this up .
it claims that the average player is 33 and has more than a decade of gaming under their belt .
all of a sudden , say academics and researchers , companies have realised that all the time employees spend gaming in virtual worlds is changing them .
ian hughes , ibm 's metaverse evangelist , said many organisations were considering ways of harnessing the skills and familiarity their employees have with virtual environments .
this familiarity has driven many organisations to consider virtual worlds as places where employees can meet , mix and get on with the job .
" a lot of people are more accepting of that way of working just because of games , " he said .
" it 's about harnessing that ability to play to get work done . "
the formidable organisational skills needed to run a game team or guild , organise raids involving perhaps 40 people and co-ordinate their different abilities to defeat a game 's strongest foes are all relevant to work , said mr hughes .
game gear but it is not just the skills that gamers hone in futuristic or fantasy worlds that businesses want to co-opt .
some are taking their inspiration directly from the way that online games are structured .
skills learned on raids in games could apply to work too dr byron reeves , a professor of education at stanford university , said some firms were taking elements from games to overcome the difficulties of working life in the 21st century .
" the problems associated with distributed teams , collaboration and information overload right now are so severe , and the opportunities so good , that they are willing to look at anything , " he said .
dr reeves has founded a company called seriosity that applies game elements to workplaces .
it was working with five or six unnamed fortune 500 companies to harness the efficiencies of those game mechanics , said dr reeve .
one of the programs developed by seriosity adds a virtual currency element to e-mail in a bid to help people cope with information overload .
anyone sending a message adds some of their limited supply of virtual coins , called serios , to show how important they consider that e-mail to be .
it was a more finely grained grading system than the low , medium or high importance flags found in most e-mail programs , said dr reeves .
it had other benefits too , he said .
it revealed not just the flow of messages but also started to show who people pay attention to and who did a good job of getting responses .
some companies were starting to adopt even more of the elements familiar from games .
" there are people right now trying to map it one-to-one , " said dr reeves .
level playing field convinced that games can help them thrive some companies have turned work groups into guilds , rewarded staff with experience points when they complete tasks , giving out titles and badges when a guild finished a project and portraying objectives as quests .
virtual worlds could become key to future business life some were also considering using a virtual currency as a reward system allowing workers to cash in their savings for benefits or extras for their office space .
the top performing guilds also get to do the best projects .
none , so far , he said , were tying wages to how people performed in the quests and against other guilds .
" mapping levels and points on to wages is the most extreme application , " he said .
companies were adopting game mechanics for several reasons , said dr reeves .
partly because workers were so familiar with this structure , he said , and because people become powerfully motivated when they know how they compare to their contemporaries .
the main reason was for the transparency it gave to the way workplaces were organised and for revealing who got things done .
" it exposes those that do and do not play well , " said dr reeves .
" there is a leader board and you know the rules . "
it had the potential to turn workplaces into meritocracies where the most accomplished are easy to spot because they have racked up all rewards , achievements and levels required for a particular post .
while it may not sweep away systems of privilege or end nepotism it had the potential to make workplaces fairer and take some of the grind out of the day job , he said .
" the whole idea here is to get the objectives of the individual players aligned with the objectives of the organisation , " said dr reeves .
" do that and you have something good . "
angela barron , an advisor at the chartered institute of personnel and development , said games had long been used in training to expose personal preferences and prejudices .
many organisations also used courses that revolve around games to help make teams work together better or expose power structures among workers .
she said this was the first time she had heard of elements of online games being used in a similar way .
" i would not have thought enough people play games for it to be a great motivator , " she said .
but , she said , anything that helped staff develop a better working relationship and promote team work was likely to be a good thing .

but at the annual meetings of both the world bank and international monetary fund in washington , they cautioned that vigilance remained necessary .
their comments come despite rising evidence that the downturn in the us housing market could be spreading .
global stocks continued to fall on monday because of us economy concerns .
oil prices also remain near record highs , because of fears over continued fighting between the turkish army and kurdish rebels on the iraqi border .
' slowly improving ' " the consensus was that markets are better than in august , " said us treasury secretary henry paulson .
" it has been slowly improving , but it is going to take a while . "
the world bank said turmoil that hit the world markets in august , sparked by the downturn in the us sub-prime mortgage market , had only had a limited impact on developing countries .
despite the sharp share falls in developed countries , the world bank said global economic growth remained strong , led by china , india and brazil .
separately at the meetings in washington , which conclude later on monday , south africa 's finance minister complained that the us and europe overly dominated both the world bank and international monetary fund .
trevor manuel said voting power needed to be adjusted to reflect the rising economic power of countries such as china and india .
" you 're telling these countries -lsb- us and european nations -rsb- that have acquired these rights that in the interests of broader democracy , they got to give it up , " he said .
" and that 's a problem we run into , which is why it will require monumental persuasion . "

a whole generation is growing up for whom video games are a key part of how they relax , whether it be fragging friends in a first person shooter or backing up the main tank in a warcraft raid .
and it is not just youngsters .
there are plenty of older folks who shake off the dust of the working day in many different virtual worlds .
statistics from the the us entertainment software association -lrb- esa -rrb- back this up .
it claims that the average player is 33 and has more than a decade of gaming under their belt .
all of a sudden , say academics and researchers , companies have realised that all the time employees spend gaming in virtual worlds is changing them .
ian hughes , ibm 's metaverse evangelist , said many organisations were considering ways of harnessing the skills and familiarity their employees have with virtual environments .
this familiarity has driven many organisations to consider virtual worlds as places where employees can meet , mix and get on with the job .
" a lot of people are more accepting of that way of working just because of games , " he said .
" it 's about harnessing that ability to play to get work done . "
the formidable organisational skills needed to run a game team or guild , organise raids involving perhaps 40 people and co-ordinate their different abilities to defeat a game 's strongest foes are all relevant to work , said mr hughes .
game gear but it is not just the skills that gamers hone in futuristic or fantasy worlds that businesses want to co-opt .
some are taking their inspiration directly from the way that online games are structured .
dr byron reeves , a professor of education at stanford university , said some firms were taking elements from games to overcome the difficulties of working life in the 21st century .
" the problems associated with distributed teams , collaboration and information overload right now are so severe , and the opportunities so good , that they are willing to look at anything , " he said .
dr reeves has founded a company called seriosity that applies game elements to workplaces .
it was working with five or six unnamed fortune 500 companies to harness the efficiencies of those game mechanics , said dr reeve .
one of the programs developed by seriosity adds a virtual currency element to e-mail in a bid to help people cope with information overload .
anyone sending a message adds some of their limited supply of virtual coins , called serios , to show how important they consider that e-mail to be .
it was a more finely grained grading system than the low , medium or high importance flags found in most e-mail programs , said dr reeves .
it had other benefits too , he said .
it revealed not just the flow of messages but also started to show who people pay attention to and who did a good job of getting responses .
some companies were starting to adopt even more of the elements familiar from games .
" there are people right now trying to map it one-to-one , " said dr reeves .
level playing field convinced that games can help them thrive some companies have turned work groups into guilds , rewarded staff with experience points when they complete tasks , giving out titles and badges when a guild finished a project and portraying objectives as quests .
some were also considering using a virtual currency as a reward system allowing workers to cash in their savings for benefits or extras for their office space .
the top performing guilds also get to do the best projects .
none , so far , he said , were tying wages to how people performed in the quests and against other guilds .
" mapping levels and points on to wages is the most extreme application , " he said .
companies were adopting game mechanics for several reasons , said dr reeves .
partly because workers were so familiar with this structure , he said , and because people become powerfully motivated when they know how they compare to their contemporaries .
the main reason was for the transparency it gave to the way workplaces were organised and for revealing who got things done .
" it exposes those that do and do not play well , " said dr reeves .
" there is a leader board and you know the rules . "
it had the potential to turn workplaces into meritocracies where the most accomplished are easy to spot because they have racked up all rewards , achievements and levels required for a particular post .
while it may not sweep away systems of privilege or end nepotism it had the potential to make workplaces fairer and take some of the grind out of the day job , he said .
" the whole idea here is to get the objectives of the individual players aligned with the objectives of the organisation , " said dr reeves .
" do that and you have something good . "
angela barron , an advisor at the chartered institute of personnel and development , said games had long been used in training to expose personal preferences and prejudices .
many organisations also used courses that revolve around games to help make teams work together better or expose power structures among workers .
she said this was the first time she had heard of elements of online games being used in a similar way .
" i would not have thought enough people play games for it to be a great motivator , " she said .
but , she said , anything that helped staff develop a better working relationship and promote team work was likely to be a good thing .

but at the annual meetings of both the world bank and international monetary fund in washington , they cautioned that vigilance remained necessary .
their comments come despite rising evidence that the downturn in the us housing market could be spreading .
global stocks continued to fall on monday because of us economy concerns .
oil prices also remain near record highs , because of fears over continued fighting between the turkish army and kurdish rebels on the iraqi border .
' slowly improving ' " the consensus was that markets are better than in august , " said us treasury secretary henry paulson .
" it has been slowly improving , but it is going to take a while . "
the world bank said turmoil that hit the world markets in august , sparked by the downturn in the us sub-prime mortgage market , had only had a limited impact on developing countries .
despite the sharp share falls in developed countries , the world bank said global economic growth remained strong , led by china , india and brazil .
separately at the meetings in washington , which conclude later on monday , south africa 's finance minister complained that the us and europe overly dominated both the world bank and international monetary fund .
trevor manuel said voting power needed to be adjusted to reflect the rising economic power of countries such as china and india .
" you 're telling these countries -lsb- us and european nations -rsb- that have acquired these rights that in the interests of broader democracy , they got to give it up , " he said .
" and that 's a problem we run into , which is why it will require monumental persuasion . "
