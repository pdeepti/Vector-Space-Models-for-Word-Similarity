" the situation is characterized by gross and systematic violations of human rights and grave breaches of international law , " the report said .
" war crimes and crimes against humanity continue across the region .
killing of civilians remains widespread , including in large-scale attacks .
rape and sexual violence are widespread and systematic .
torture continues .

"
" the international community wo n't remain silent , " steinmeier told the associated press , without adding further details . no sudanese cooperation the un estimates at least 200,000 people have been killed in darfur with a further 2.5 million displaced . the conflict and influx of refugees has also spilled over into neighboring chad , exacerbating existing tensions . williams and her team were unable to carry out investigations in darfur itself , as khartoum refused to grant visas , saying some of the team 's members were " biased " against sudan - a charge repeated on sunday by sudan 's justice minister while en route to geneva . last month , the international criminal court in the hague named a sudanese government minister and a janjaweed militia leader as the first suspects prosecutors want to try for war crimes in the darfur conflict . darfur requires unified approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former sudanese interior minister ahmed muhammed harun was charged with war crimes the report urged the international community to adopt a " fully unified approach " in addressing darfur , and to help convene a national conference on peace , human rights and a common vision for sudan . it also called for the implementation of measures such as travel bans and the freezing of assets for those identified as rights violators . turning to actions on the ground , it demanded that sudan " end the targeting of civilians in darfur , cease all support for janjaweed militia forces , and proceed with the disarmament , demobilization and reintegration of such forces . " " witnesses , victims and observers we met repeatedly confirmed joint action between government forces and armed militia in assaulting civilian targets in darfur , " the report said . rebels share responsibility the mission said rebel groups in the region shared some responsibility for the rights abuses , including rape and torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions have been displaced by violence in sudan 's darfur region khartoum 's provision of arms to the janjaweed and other militias is a key factor behind growing tensions between tribal groups and communities , victims and witnesses told members of the mission . the report also said the un general assembly should compile a blacklist of foreign companies that have an " adverse impact " on the human rights situation in darfur . the darfur report kicked off a three-week session of the un 's human rights council , which replaced the human rights commission in 2006 . the darfur mission was set up by a rare consensus of the council 's 47 members following hard bargaining by western , african and islamic nations during a special session last december - the first time the council had specifically focused on darfur . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de international court names first darfur war crimes suspects the international criminal court in the hague on tuesday named a sudanese minister and a janjaweed militia leader as the first war crimes suspects in the darfur conflict .

his decision to bow out at the age of 74 is the end of an era as younger rivals on the left and right battle it out to take over . the veteran conservative said in a televised address on sunday that he would stand down in may after the expected second round of the election and would then seek to serve the country " in a different fashion . " " i will not ask for your votes for a new mandate , " he said .
" in a different manner , but with the same enthusiasm and passion to act on your behalf , i shall continue to fight our battles - the battles i have fought all my life - for justice , progress , peace and the grandeur of france , " he said . chirac began his political career in 1962 as an advisor to prime minister georges pompidou , and had his first cabinet post in 1967 .
he served two straight mandates as president , was twice prime minister and spent 18 years as mayor of paris .
in 2002 he won re-election with the support of left-wing voters , anxious to keep out far-right leader jean-marie le pen who stunned the country by qualifying for the decisive second round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen said he was gladf to be rid of his enemy le pen said chirac was " the worst president in the history of france .

" president bush wishes president chirac all the best as he enters life after politics , " white house national security council spokesman gordon johndroe said after chirac 's announcement .
" the united states and france have been and will remain steadfast partners and allies , " he added . though bush 's fortunes have slumped because of the war , chirac 's also tumbled in 2005 , when france rejected the eu 's proposed constitution , riots hit the city suburbs , and he was hospitalized with a " vascular incident . " chirac said that he was " proud of the work which we have carried out together " - citing in particular improvements for the elderly and the handicapped , reforms of the pension system and reductions in crime and unemployment . and he called on the country to defend its values in the world .
" france is not a country like others .
it has particular responsibilities , the legacy of its history and the universal values it helped create , " he said .
still unclear which candidate he backs as expected , chirac gave no sign in his 10-minute address whether he intends to endorse the right-wing candidate for the presidency , interior minister nicolas sarkozy , a former protege who heads the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- . sarkozy , 52 , has a narrow lead in polls over socialist segolene royal but now faces a new challenge from the centrist candidate francois bayrou , head of the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , whose ratings have surged in the last month .

misgivings over legacy while misgivings remain about chirac 's legacy , he commands widespread affection and even political opponents praise his defense of french interests in the world . " it is a historic moment because a page of history is about to turn .
a new page is about to open and the french themselves are going to write it , " said royal . bayrou , who served as education minister under chirac from 1995 to 1997 , said that " on foreign policy he was an honorable voice , and a great voice at the moments when france needed one " - a clear reference to chirac 's defiance of the united states . however socialist former prime minister laurent fabius said the chirac era had been " wasted . " " his long presidency has lost france a lot of time .
this is what strikes me most : in relation to the major problems facing france and europe , a presidency of wasted time , " he said . chirac will officially leave his post on may 16 , when his mandate expires .

his decision to bow out at the age of 74 is the end of an era as younger rivals on the left and right battle it out to take over . the veteran conservative said in a televised address on sunday that he would stand down in may after the expected second round of the election and would then seek to serve the country " in a different fashion . " " i will not ask for your votes for a new mandate , " he said .
" in a different manner , but with the same enthusiasm and passion to act on your behalf , i shall continue to fight our battles - the battles i have fought all my life - for justice , progress , peace and the grandeur of france , " he said . chirac began his political career in 1962 as an advisor to prime minister georges pompidou , and had his first cabinet post in 1967 .
he served two straight mandates as president , was twice prime minister and spent 18 years as mayor of paris .
in 2002 he won re-election with the support of left-wing voters , anxious to keep out far-right leader jean-marie le pen who stunned the country by qualifying for the decisive second round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen said he was gladf to be rid of his enemy le pen said chirac was " the worst president in the history of france .
i am delighted to be losing my best enemy .
the proof that he has led the country to disaster is that not a single candidate ... claims his legacy . " proud of his work in 2003 , chirac led opposition to the us-led war on iraq , earning acclaim in many parts of the world and sparking a bitter diplomatic quarrel with us president george w. bush . " president bush wishes president chirac all the best as he enters life after politics , " white house national security council spokesman gordon johndroe said after chirac 's announcement .
" the united states and france have been and will remain steadfast partners and allies , " he added . though bush 's fortunes have slumped because of the war , chirac 's also tumbled in 2005 , when france rejected the eu 's proposed constitution , riots hit the city suburbs , and he was hospitalized with a " vascular incident . " chirac said that he was " proud of the work which we have carried out together " - citing in particular improvements for the elderly and the handicapped , reforms of the pension system and reductions in crime and unemployment . and he called on the country to defend its values in the world .
" france is not a country like others .
it has particular responsibilities , the legacy of its history and the universal values it helped create , " he said .
still unclear which candidate he backs as expected , chirac gave no sign in his 10-minute address whether he intends to endorse the right-wing candidate for the presidency , interior minister nicolas sarkozy , a former protege who heads the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- . sarkozy , 52 , has a narrow lead in polls over socialist segolene royal but now faces a new challenge from the centrist candidate francois bayrou , head of the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , whose ratings have surged in the last month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy -lrb- r . -rrb- faces a challenge from within as well as from royal -lrb- l . -rrb- a poll published in le journal du dimanche newspaper for the first time showed bayrou on the same score as royal - 23 percent - in the first round of the vote on april 22 .
sarkozy was given 29 percent .
the two leading contenders qualify for a run-off on may 6 .
misgivings over legacy while misgivings remain about chirac 's legacy , he commands widespread affection and even political opponents praise his defense of french interests in the world . " it is a historic moment because a page of history is about to turn .
a new page is about to open and the french themselves are going to write it , " said royal . bayrou , who served as education minister under chirac from 1995 to 1997 , said that " on foreign policy he was an honorable voice , and a great voice at the moments when france needed one " - a clear reference to chirac 's defiance of the united states . however socialist former prime minister laurent fabius said the chirac era had been " wasted . " " his long presidency has lost france a lot of time .
this is what strikes me most : in relation to the major problems facing france and europe , a presidency of wasted time , " he said . chirac will officially leave his post on may 16 , when his mandate expires .
he has indicated that he would like to chair an international foundation , promoting causes close to his heart such as the environment and non-european cultures . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de extremist le pen strikes chord in france , again for over 30 years , jean-marie le pen has campaigned at the top of french politics .

" we are part of a global danger zone , " he said .
" in times when we were not affected , we did not succumb to the illusion that that we were not threatened like the british , the spaniards or others , " he said in reference to the london and madrid bombings . an alarming position wolfgang bosbach , the interior expert for the conservative cdu / csu group in the bundestag and a party colleague of chancellor angela merkel , said german troops ' mission in the north of afghanistan and the deployment of german tornado reconnaissance jets in the south would continue despite the threats . " we in germany are in a persistent and alarming position in regard to this menace , and we also know that foreign policy decisions can change the security situation in germany , " bosbach said in an interview with the rheinsiche post newspaper published on monday .
" but it would be a major mistake if we were to stay out of the fight against international terror .
therefore , the security position will not change and neither will the decision on the tornado deployment in afghanistan . "
the bundestag decided on friday to deploy six tornado jets to provide reconnaissance assistance to nato troops in southern afghanistan ahead of an expected spring offensive from taliban fighters . peter struck , a former defense minister and currently leader of the social democrats in the german parliament , announced that the bundeswehr deployment in afghanistan would continue " at least for another decade . " " it must be clear to everybody that the reconstruction of the country is only possible if the taliban are defeated , " said struck in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper . berlin crisis team working on release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis team works on finding and freeing the hostages meanwhile , the german foreign ministry 's crisis team continued to work on the release of the two german hostages kidnapped in iraq .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on the weekend that everything was being done to secure the release of berlin-born hannelore marianne k. and her adult son . steinmeier said the crisis team believed that the kidnappers have criminal intent and that they are holding the hostages for ransom and for an ideological reason . the 61-year-old woman and her son were seized on feb .
6 by armed men who burst into their family home in baghdad .
a video of them was released over the weekend , showing the woman , who is married to an iraqi professor , begging for her and her son 's life . " i 'm asking you to help me , " she sobbed in the video broadcast .
" we 're germans as well .
these people want to kill my son before my eyes and then kill me .
i do n't want to die like this , " she said in german . the video showed three masked militants of a little-known group calling itself the brigade of the arrows of righteousness standing behind the woman , who was wearing a loosely tied headdress and holding the hand of her son crouching next to her . one of the masked men demanded the withdrawal of all of germany 's approximately 3,000 troops in the relatively stable north of afghanistan , where it commands the international security assistance force , within 10 days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.03.2007 germany skeptical about environmental speed limits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say slowing drivers to 120 kph -lrb- 75 mph -rrb- is n't the way to save the planet german politicians scoffed at the idea that speed limits on the country 's autobahns would prevent global warming .
yet the recent european interest in climate change has the german auto industry worried about its image . germany has no intention of slowing down its famously speedy drivers .
politicians and carmakers criticized the suggestion by european union environment minister that germany should introduce a speed limit on its autobahns . the speed limit idea is " a secondary front and a trivialization of the climate problem , " according to german environment minister sigmar gabriel . the powerful german automobile industry federation -lrb- vda -rrb- said in a statement that germany needed " no coaching " from brussels on how to protect the climate " above all when the proposals are only symbolic . " speed wastes energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's stavros dimas called for german speed limits eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said germany should impose speed limits on its highways as a way to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
the german transport ministry has rejected the idea , saying it would have a negligible effect on greenhouse gas emissions . " there are many areas in which we senselessly waste energy and harm the environment , " dimas said in an interview published in the bild newspaper 's sunday edition . he suggested speed limits as a good start .
in germany , some stretches of highway have speed limits but other sections allow drivers to go as fast as they like . " speed limits are useful for many reasons and are the order of the day in most of the eu 's 27 member nations and the united states , " dimas said .
" strangely enough , it is only in germany where they are controversial . " german social democratic party leader peter struck warned against " climate hysteria " where climate change is allowed to become the only thing on the agenda .
no one cares about preserving jobs , struck said in a bild interview sunday . but dimas said germany has a special responsibility towards curbing greenhouse gas emissions , which are widely believed to be responsible for global warming . " a breakthrough will only be possible if the eu members take steps to ensure that climate protection measures are feasible and financially sustainable - particularly germany as an important industrial nation , " he said . car industry concerned about image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers got the eu to water down its emissions limits the german car industry showed its clout last month , when the eu presented less strict co2 emissions standards .
dimas had originally wanted tougher levels for cars sold in europe but backed down after pressure from german automobile manufacturers , which said they would be unfairly targeted . but german car makers are increasingly concerned about their image , a recent shake-up at their lobbying group has shown .
long-time president of the vda , bernd gottschalk , resigned unexpectedly on saturday . automakers were reportedly unhappy at how their lobby initially handled the eu climate debate .
the industry felt the vda reacted too slowly and not forcefully enough , according to der spiegel magazine . there was also criticism that gottschalk had n't done a good job of explaining the what the auto industry has been doing up until now to help the environment .
a replacement for gottschalk has not yet been made . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urged to take lead on battling climate change the european union will seek to thrash out a common policy in fighting climate change , with plans to set tough targets for cutting carbon dioxide emissions .
-lrb- 07.03.2007 -rrb- eu backs plans for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions eu environment ministers gave unanimous support to plans for cuts in greenhouse gases of as much as 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels .

but it 's only now that the story of the man behind the brand has come to light with a new book on jewish entrepreneur julius fromm . they 've been called french letters and english raincoats , but in fact , the world 's oldest branded condom came from germany .
launched by a jewish entrepreneur in berlin shortly after the first world war , " fromms " are still no. 2 on the german condom market - but until now , their inventor had been languishing in obscurity . now in a new book , " fromms - how julius f. fell prey to german robbers , " authors götz aly and michael sontheimer set the record straight by exploring the life and times of a man who changed german sexual habits for good . tapping into the zeitgeist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julius fromm julius fromm was born in 1883 in konin , in what was then russia .
when he was 10 years old , his family left the poverty of the shtetl and moved to berlin in search of a better life .
his parents died young , and he and his six siblings were left to fend for themselves . along with many other east european jews in turn-of-the-century berlin , the fromm family initially earned their living by rolling cigarettes .
but as manual cigarette production was gradually ousted by mechanization , the entrepreneurial julius busied himself with evening classes in chemistry . like every inspired businessman , julius fromm had what one might be tempted to describe as a natural feel for the zeitgeist , and as the first world war raged across europe , germany experienced a perceptible shift in sexual values . " germany in some ways had the most liberal sexual culture in the world in the early 20th century , " said city university of new york 's dagmar herzog , author of " sex after fascism . "
" -lrb- this was thanks to -rrb- a combination of earthy , uncomplicated popular attitudes at the grassroots level , and courageous activism on the part of medical professionals in a wider context which included the disinhibiting impact of the war . " the latex revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany became more sexually liberal in the 1920s so the times were a changing , and more liberal approaches to morals were eroding the traditional link between sexuality and reproduction .
julius fromm seized the moment and decided the future was latex - an odorless , seamless , transparent natural rubber , and a lot smoother than pig gut . after centuries of makeshift contraception involving animal intestines and even lambskin and tortoise shells , the first modern condom had been invented in the mid-19th century by charles goodyear .
made of re-usable vulcanized rubber , it resembled a bicycle tire with bulky seams , so , perhaps not surprisingly , it never quite took off .
but the rapid spread of sexually transmitted diseases during the war had made condoms an indispensable accessory - while the uncertain times left governments reluctantly agreeable to approving a new way of containing the birth rate . in 1916 , julius fromm patented the titillatingly titled fromm 's act .
his manufacturing technique involved dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution , enabling the production of thinner condoms with no seams .
he did a roaring trade , with every packet containing a folded slip of paper on which was printed : " please discreetly hand me a packet of three fromm 's act , " to be silently presented to the salesperson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fromms condoms have come a long way mass production began in 1922 , and amid the sexual licentiousness of the weimar republic , fromm was soon doing well enough to open international branches from antwerp to auckland .
by 1930 , he had commissioned a flagship factory from the avant-garde jewish architects arthur korn and siegfried weitzman in the berlin suburb of köpenick - a boxy building in the " neue sachlichkeit " style that was as progressive as fromm 's product . but unlike the product , the bubble soon burst .
it was n't long before the nazis ' aryanization policy was in full swing .
in 1938 , on the grounds that his supplies of rubber were needed for the war effort , fromm was forced to sell his business at a fraction of its value to baroness elisabeth von epenstein , none other than hermann göring 's godmother .
in return , hitler 's luxury-loving second-in-command was able to add to his collection of teutonic kitsch two castles , burg mautendorf in austria and burg veldenstein , where göring had grown up .
a year later , fromm emigrated to london , where he died on may 12 , 1945 , four days after the allied victory over germany . fate unknown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish business was plundered in the third reich as an example of the social mobility of jewish immigrants in the early 20th century , fromm 's story is a typical one , though until now an unknown one .
that 's not surprising , according to christoph kreutzmüller , who oversees the research project " exclusion and survival strategies : small and medium-sized jewish businesses in berlin 1930 to 1940 " at berlin 's humboldt university .
the fate of most jewish businesses remains largely unknown , he explained . " there is maybe some dim recollection of the aryanization of the large companies and stereotypical branches such as tailoring , banking and department stores , " he said , citing the example of the wertheim department store and the private bank mendelssohn and co .
" but there is no information whatsoever about the small industries , or the pharmacies - the majority of those in berlin being owned by jews - let alone the jewish egg-trade , even though 98 percent of all egg-traders were jewish prior to 1935 . " in recent years , many of germany 's big-name companies have commissioned investigations into their nazi past , including media giant bertelsmann , deutsche bank and degussa , to name but a few .
while their findings go some way to establishing the full extent of hitler 's plundering of germany 's jewish community , these investigations ultimately uncover just the tip of the iceberg . " no jewish enterprise was left unharmed .
they were all liquidated or taken over by non-jews , " stressed kreutzmüller .
" however , we do n't even know how many jewish enterprises there were in berlin in 1933 - but probably at least 20,000 medium-sized companies , and thousands more doing small trading on markets or streets which we will never know of .

but the rapid spread of sexually transmitted diseases during the war had made condoms an indispensable accessory - while the uncertain times left governments reluctantly agreeable to approving a new way of containing the birth rate . in 1916 , julius fromm patented the titillatingly titled fromm 's act .
his manufacturing technique involved dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution , enabling the production of thinner condoms with no seams .
he did a roaring trade , with every packet containing a folded slip of paper on which was printed : " please discreetly hand me a packet of three fromm 's act , " to be silently presented to the salesperson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fromms condoms have come a long way mass production began in 1922 , and amid the sexual licentiousness of the weimar republic , fromm was soon doing well enough to open international branches from antwerp to auckland .
by 1930 , he had commissioned a flagship factory from the avant-garde jewish architects arthur korn and siegfried weitzman in the berlin suburb of köpenick - a boxy building in the " neue sachlichkeit " style that was as progressive as fromm 's product . but unlike the product , the bubble soon burst .
it was n't long before the nazis ' aryanization policy was in full swing .
in 1938 , on the grounds that his supplies of rubber were needed for the war effort , fromm was forced to sell his business at a fraction of its value to baroness elisabeth von epenstein , none other than hermann göring 's godmother .
in return , hitler 's luxury-loving second-in-command was able to add to his collection of teutonic kitsch two castles , burg mautendorf in austria and burg veldenstein , where göring had grown up .
a year later , fromm emigrated to london , where he died on may 12 , 1945 , four days after the allied victory over germany . fate unknown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish business was plundered in the third reich as an example of the social mobility of jewish immigrants in the early 20th century , fromm 's story is a typical one , though until now an unknown one .
that 's not surprising , according to christoph kreutzmüller , who oversees the research project " exclusion and survival strategies : small and medium-sized jewish businesses in berlin 1930 to 1940 " at berlin 's humboldt university .
the fate of most jewish businesses remains largely unknown , he explained . " there is maybe some dim recollection of the aryanization of the large companies and stereotypical branches such as tailoring , banking and department stores , " he said , citing the example of the wertheim department store and the private bank mendelssohn and co .
" but there is no information whatsoever about the small industries , or the pharmacies - the majority of those in berlin being owned by jews - let alone the jewish egg-trade , even though 98 percent of all egg-traders were jewish prior to 1935 . " in recent years , many of germany 's big-name companies have commissioned investigations into their nazi past , including media giant bertelsmann , deutsche bank and degussa , to name but a few .
while their findings go some way to establishing the full extent of hitler 's plundering of germany 's jewish community , these investigations ultimately uncover just the tip of the iceberg . " no jewish enterprise was left unharmed .
they were all liquidated or taken over by non-jews , " stressed kreutzmüller .

yet the recent european interest in climate change has the german auto industry worried about its image . germany has no intention of slowing down its famously speedy drivers .
politicians and carmakers criticized the suggestion by european union environment minister that germany should introduce a speed limit on its autobahns . the speed limit idea is " a secondary front and a trivialization of the climate problem , " according to german environment minister sigmar gabriel . the powerful german automobile industry federation -lrb- vda -rrb- said in a statement that germany needed " no coaching " from brussels on how to protect the climate " above all when the proposals are only symbolic . " speed wastes energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's stavros dimas called for german speed limits eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said germany should impose speed limits on its highways as a way to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
the german transport ministry has rejected the idea , saying it would have a negligible effect on greenhouse gas emissions . " there are many areas in which we senselessly waste energy and harm the environment , " dimas said in an interview published in the bild newspaper 's sunday edition . he suggested speed limits as a good start .
in germany , some stretches of highway have speed limits but other sections allow drivers to go as fast as they like . " speed limits are useful for many reasons and are the order of the day in most of the eu 's 27 member nations and the united states , " dimas said .
" strangely enough , it is only in germany where they are controversial . " german social democratic party leader peter struck warned against " climate hysteria " where climate change is allowed to become the only thing on the agenda .
no one cares about preserving jobs , struck said in a bild interview sunday . but dimas said germany has a special responsibility towards curbing greenhouse gas emissions , which are widely believed to be responsible for global warming . " a breakthrough will only be possible if the eu members take steps to ensure that climate protection measures are feasible and financially sustainable - particularly germany as an important industrial nation , " he said . car industry concerned about image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers got the eu to water down its emissions limits the german car industry showed its clout last month , when the eu presented less strict co2 emissions standards .
dimas had originally wanted tougher levels for cars sold in europe but backed down after pressure from german automobile manufacturers , which said they would be unfairly targeted . but german car makers are increasingly concerned about their image , a recent shake-up at their lobbying group has shown .
long-time president of the vda , bernd gottschalk , resigned unexpectedly on saturday . automakers were reportedly unhappy at how their lobby initially handled the eu climate debate .
the industry felt the vda reacted too slowly and not forcefully enough , according to der spiegel magazine . there was also criticism that gottschalk had n't done a good job of explaining the what the auto industry has been doing up until now to help the environment .
a replacement for gottschalk has not yet been made . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urged to take lead on battling climate change the european union will seek to thrash out a common policy in fighting climate change , with plans to set tough targets for cutting carbon dioxide emissions .
-lrb- 07.03.2007 -rrb- eu backs plans for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions eu environment ministers gave unanimous support to plans for cuts in greenhouse gases of as much as 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.03.2007 book tells little-known tale of revolutionary condom-maker großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hard at work making condoms at fromm 's factory in 1935 in germany , the name fromm is to condoms what hoover is to vacuum cleaners .
but it 's only now that the story of the man behind the brand has come to light with a new book on jewish entrepreneur julius fromm . they 've been called french letters and english raincoats , but in fact , the world 's oldest branded condom came from germany .
launched by a jewish entrepreneur in berlin shortly after the first world war , " fromms " are still no. 2 on the german condom market - but until now , their inventor had been languishing in obscurity . now in a new book , " fromms - how julius f. fell prey to german robbers , " authors götz aly and michael sontheimer set the record straight by exploring the life and times of a man who changed german sexual habits for good . tapping into the zeitgeist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julius fromm julius fromm was born in 1883 in konin , in what was then russia .
when he was 10 years old , his family left the poverty of the shtetl and moved to berlin in search of a better life .
his parents died young , and he and his six siblings were left to fend for themselves . along with many other east european jews in turn-of-the-century berlin , the fromm family initially earned their living by rolling cigarettes .
but as manual cigarette production was gradually ousted by mechanization , the entrepreneurial julius busied himself with evening classes in chemistry . like every inspired businessman , julius fromm had what one might be tempted to describe as a natural feel for the zeitgeist , and as the first world war raged across europe , germany experienced a perceptible shift in sexual values . " germany in some ways had the most liberal sexual culture in the world in the early 20th century , " said city university of new york 's dagmar herzog , author of " sex after fascism . "
" -lrb- this was thanks to -rrb- a combination of earthy , uncomplicated popular attitudes at the grassroots level , and courageous activism on the part of medical professionals in a wider context which included the disinhibiting impact of the war . " the latex revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany became more sexually liberal in the 1920s so the times were a changing , and more liberal approaches to morals were eroding the traditional link between sexuality and reproduction .
julius fromm seized the moment and decided the future was latex - an odorless , seamless , transparent natural rubber , and a lot smoother than pig gut . after centuries of makeshift contraception involving animal intestines and even lambskin and tortoise shells , the first modern condom had been invented in the mid-19th century by charles goodyear .
made of re-usable vulcanized rubber , it resembled a bicycle tire with bulky seams , so , perhaps not surprisingly , it never quite took off .
but the rapid spread of sexually transmitted diseases during the war had made condoms an indispensable accessory - while the uncertain times left governments reluctantly agreeable to approving a new way of containing the birth rate . in 1916 , julius fromm patented the titillatingly titled fromm 's act .
his manufacturing technique involved dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution , enabling the production of thinner condoms with no seams .
he did a roaring trade , with every packet containing a folded slip of paper on which was printed : " please discreetly hand me a packet of three fromm 's act , " to be silently presented to the salesperson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fromms condoms have come a long way mass production began in 1922 , and amid the sexual licentiousness of the weimar republic , fromm was soon doing well enough to open international branches from antwerp to auckland .
by 1930 , he had commissioned a flagship factory from the avant-garde jewish architects arthur korn and siegfried weitzman in the berlin suburb of köpenick - a boxy building in the " neue sachlichkeit " style that was as progressive as fromm 's product . but unlike the product , the bubble soon burst .
it was n't long before the nazis ' aryanization policy was in full swing .
in 1938 , on the grounds that his supplies of rubber were needed for the war effort , fromm was forced to sell his business at a fraction of its value to baroness elisabeth von epenstein , none other than hermann göring 's godmother .
in return , hitler 's luxury-loving second-in-command was able to add to his collection of teutonic kitsch two castles , burg mautendorf in austria and burg veldenstein , where göring had grown up .
a year later , fromm emigrated to london , where he died on may 12 , 1945 , four days after the allied victory over germany . fate unknown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish business was plundered in the third reich as an example of the social mobility of jewish immigrants in the early 20th century , fromm 's story is a typical one , though until now an unknown one .
that 's not surprising , according to christoph kreutzmüller , who oversees the research project " exclusion and survival strategies : small and medium-sized jewish businesses in berlin 1930 to 1940 " at berlin 's humboldt university .
the fate of most jewish businesses remains largely unknown , he explained . " there is maybe some dim recollection of the aryanization of the large companies and stereotypical branches such as tailoring , banking and department stores , " he said , citing the example of the wertheim department store and the private bank mendelssohn and co .
" but there is no information whatsoever about the small industries , or the pharmacies - the majority of those in berlin being owned by jews - let alone the jewish egg-trade , even though 98 percent of all egg-traders were jewish prior to 1935 . " in recent years , many of germany 's big-name companies have commissioned investigations into their nazi past , including media giant bertelsmann , deutsche bank and degussa , to name but a few .
while their findings go some way to establishing the full extent of hitler 's plundering of germany 's jewish community , these investigations ultimately uncover just the tip of the iceberg . " no jewish enterprise was left unharmed .
they were all liquidated or taken over by non-jews , " stressed kreutzmüller .
" however , we do n't even know how many jewish enterprises there were in berlin in 1933 - but probably at least 20,000 medium-sized companies , and thousands more doing small trading on markets or streets which we will never know of .

but it 's only now that the story of the man behind the brand has come to light with a new book on jewish entrepreneur julius fromm . they 've been called french letters and english raincoats , but in fact , the world 's oldest branded condom came from germany .
launched by a jewish entrepreneur in berlin shortly after the first world war , " fromms " are still no. 2 on the german condom market - but until now , their inventor had been languishing in obscurity . now in a new book , " fromms - how julius f. fell prey to german robbers , " authors götz aly and michael sontheimer set the record straight by exploring the life and times of a man who changed german sexual habits for good . tapping into the zeitgeist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julius fromm julius fromm was born in 1883 in konin , in what was then russia .
when he was 10 years old , his family left the poverty of the shtetl and moved to berlin in search of a better life .
his parents died young , and he and his six siblings were left to fend for themselves . along with many other east european jews in turn-of-the-century berlin , the fromm family initially earned their living by rolling cigarettes .
but as manual cigarette production was gradually ousted by mechanization , the entrepreneurial julius busied himself with evening classes in chemistry . like every inspired businessman , julius fromm had what one might be tempted to describe as a natural feel for the zeitgeist , and as the first world war raged across europe , germany experienced a perceptible shift in sexual values . " germany in some ways had the most liberal sexual culture in the world in the early 20th century , " said city university of new york 's dagmar herzog , author of " sex after fascism . "
" -lrb- this was thanks to -rrb- a combination of earthy , uncomplicated popular attitudes at the grassroots level , and courageous activism on the part of medical professionals in a wider context which included the disinhibiting impact of the war . " the latex revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany became more sexually liberal in the 1920s so the times were a changing , and more liberal approaches to morals were eroding the traditional link between sexuality and reproduction .
julius fromm seized the moment and decided the future was latex - an odorless , seamless , transparent natural rubber , and a lot smoother than pig gut . after centuries of makeshift contraception involving animal intestines and even lambskin and tortoise shells , the first modern condom had been invented in the mid-19th century by charles goodyear .
made of re-usable vulcanized rubber , it resembled a bicycle tire with bulky seams , so , perhaps not surprisingly , it never quite took off .
but the rapid spread of sexually transmitted diseases during the war had made condoms an indispensable accessory - while the uncertain times left governments reluctantly agreeable to approving a new way of containing the birth rate . in 1916 , julius fromm patented the titillatingly titled fromm 's act .
his manufacturing technique involved dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution , enabling the production of thinner condoms with no seams .
he did a roaring trade , with every packet containing a folded slip of paper on which was printed : " please discreetly hand me a packet of three fromm 's act , " to be silently presented to the salesperson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fromms condoms have come a long way mass production began in 1922 , and amid the sexual licentiousness of the weimar republic , fromm was soon doing well enough to open international branches from antwerp to auckland .
by 1930 , he had commissioned a flagship factory from the avant-garde jewish architects arthur korn and siegfried weitzman in the berlin suburb of köpenick - a boxy building in the " neue sachlichkeit " style that was as progressive as fromm 's product . but unlike the product , the bubble soon burst .
it was n't long before the nazis ' aryanization policy was in full swing .
in 1938 , on the grounds that his supplies of rubber were needed for the war effort , fromm was forced to sell his business at a fraction of its value to baroness elisabeth von epenstein , none other than hermann göring 's godmother .
in return , hitler 's luxury-loving second-in-command was able to add to his collection of teutonic kitsch two castles , burg mautendorf in austria and burg veldenstein , where göring had grown up .
a year later , fromm emigrated to london , where he died on may 12 , 1945 , four days after the allied victory over germany . fate unknown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish business was plundered in the third reich as an example of the social mobility of jewish immigrants in the early 20th century , fromm 's story is a typical one , though until now an unknown one .
that 's not surprising , according to christoph kreutzmüller , who oversees the research project " exclusion and survival strategies : small and medium-sized jewish businesses in berlin 1930 to 1940 " at berlin 's humboldt university .
the fate of most jewish businesses remains largely unknown , he explained . " there is maybe some dim recollection of the aryanization of the large companies and stereotypical branches such as tailoring , banking and department stores , " he said , citing the example of the wertheim department store and the private bank mendelssohn and co .
" but there is no information whatsoever about the small industries , or the pharmacies - the majority of those in berlin being owned by jews - let alone the jewish egg-trade , even though 98 percent of all egg-traders were jewish prior to 1935 . " in recent years , many of germany 's big-name companies have commissioned investigations into their nazi past , including media giant bertelsmann , deutsche bank and degussa , to name but a few .
while their findings go some way to establishing the full extent of hitler 's plundering of germany 's jewish community , these investigations ultimately uncover just the tip of the iceberg . " no jewish enterprise was left unharmed .
they were all liquidated or taken over by non-jews , " stressed kreutzmüller .
" however , we do n't even know how many jewish enterprises there were in berlin in 1933 - but probably at least 20,000 medium-sized companies , and thousands more doing small trading on markets or streets which we will never know of .

his parents died young , and he and his six siblings were left to fend for themselves . along with many other east european jews in turn-of-the-century berlin , the fromm family initially earned their living by rolling cigarettes .
but as manual cigarette production was gradually ousted by mechanization , the entrepreneurial julius busied himself with evening classes in chemistry . like every inspired businessman , julius fromm had what one might be tempted to describe as a natural feel for the zeitgeist , and as the first world war raged across europe , germany experienced a perceptible shift in sexual values . " germany in some ways had the most liberal sexual culture in the world in the early 20th century , " said city university of new york 's dagmar herzog , author of " sex after fascism . "
" -lrb- this was thanks to -rrb- a combination of earthy , uncomplicated popular attitudes at the grassroots level , and courageous activism on the part of medical professionals in a wider context which included the disinhibiting impact of the war . " the latex revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany became more sexually liberal in the 1920s so the times were a changing , and more liberal approaches to morals were eroding the traditional link between sexuality and reproduction .
julius fromm seized the moment and decided the future was latex - an odorless , seamless , transparent natural rubber , and a lot smoother than pig gut . after centuries of makeshift contraception involving animal intestines and even lambskin and tortoise shells , the first modern condom had been invented in the mid-19th century by charles goodyear .
made of re-usable vulcanized rubber , it resembled a bicycle tire with bulky seams , so , perhaps not surprisingly , it never quite took off .
but the rapid spread of sexually transmitted diseases during the war had made condoms an indispensable accessory - while the uncertain times left governments reluctantly agreeable to approving a new way of containing the birth rate . in 1916 , julius fromm patented the titillatingly titled fromm 's act .
his manufacturing technique involved dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution , enabling the production of thinner condoms with no seams .
he did a roaring trade , with every packet containing a folded slip of paper on which was printed : " please discreetly hand me a packet of three fromm 's act , " to be silently presented to the salesperson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fromms condoms have come a long way mass production began in 1922 , and amid the sexual licentiousness of the weimar republic , fromm was soon doing well enough to open international branches from antwerp to auckland .
by 1930 , he had commissioned a flagship factory from the avant-garde jewish architects arthur korn and siegfried weitzman in the berlin suburb of köpenick - a boxy building in the " neue sachlichkeit " style that was as progressive as fromm 's product . but unlike the product , the bubble soon burst .
it was n't long before the nazis ' aryanization policy was in full swing .
in 1938 , on the grounds that his supplies of rubber were needed for the war effort , fromm was forced to sell his business at a fraction of its value to baroness elisabeth von epenstein , none other than hermann göring 's godmother .
in return , hitler 's luxury-loving second-in-command was able to add to his collection of teutonic kitsch two castles , burg mautendorf in austria and burg veldenstein , where göring had grown up .
a year later , fromm emigrated to london , where he died on may 12 , 1945 , four days after the allied victory over germany . fate unknown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish business was plundered in the third reich as an example of the social mobility of jewish immigrants in the early 20th century , fromm 's story is a typical one , though until now an unknown one .
that 's not surprising , according to christoph kreutzmüller , who oversees the research project " exclusion and survival strategies : small and medium-sized jewish businesses in berlin 1930 to 1940 " at berlin 's humboldt university .
the fate of most jewish businesses remains largely unknown , he explained . " there is maybe some dim recollection of the aryanization of the large companies and stereotypical branches such as tailoring , banking and department stores , " he said , citing the example of the wertheim department store and the private bank mendelssohn and co .
" but there is no information whatsoever about the small industries , or the pharmacies - the majority of those in berlin being owned by jews - let alone the jewish egg-trade , even though 98 percent of all egg-traders were jewish prior to 1935 . " in recent years , many of germany 's big-name companies have commissioned investigations into their nazi past , including media giant bertelsmann , deutsche bank and degussa , to name but a few .
while their findings go some way to establishing the full extent of hitler 's plundering of germany 's jewish community , these investigations ultimately uncover just the tip of the iceberg . " no jewish enterprise was left unharmed .
they were all liquidated or taken over by non-jews , " stressed kreutzmüller .

on saturday , a final round of talks between the leaders of serbia and kosovo ended inconclusively , with the serbs rejecting recommendations drawn up by un mediator martti ahtisaari , much to the consternation of the united states . " the talks demonstrate that belgrade and pristina remain diametrically opposed on the question of the kosovo status , " said joanne moore , a us state department spokeswoman . washington expressed support for the revised plan drawn up by un special envoy ahtisaari . us , britain pledge support for un envoy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari 's plans have been rejected by the serbs " the settlement proposal revised after the several weeks of consultations with the parties is a fair document , " moore said .
" it 's a blueprint for a more stable and democratic kosovo that protects the right of all . " we support the intent to present a final report to the un security council by the end of the month .
we call all the parties to come together on the proposal , " she said . after 13 months of negotiations aimed at finding a solution for landlocked kosovo , belgrade and pristina were unable to find common ground to settle the fate of the disputed province . ahtisaari , who chaired the talks between the two sides , said saturday that the potential for negotiations was exhausted .
the next move would be made by the united nations security council , he added . un package seen as unworkable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbs are unwilling to give up their claims to kosovo belgrade has rejected ahtisaari 's proposal , which does not mention independence but offers the province the trappings of statehood , including a constitution , flag , national anthem and the right to join international institutions . kosovo is seen by many as the last hotspot in the balkans following a bloody decade of 1990s inter-ethnic conflicts . the un has administered kosovo since june 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign halted a crackdown by belgrade security forces on the ethnic albanian community in the province , who were seeking independence . some 10,000 ethnic albanians died and hundreds of thousands fled kosovo during the 1998-1999 conflict . meanwhile , britain also expressed support monday for ahtisaari .

his decision to bow out at the age of 74 is the end of an era as younger rivals on the left and right battle it out to take over . the veteran conservative said in a televised address on sunday that he would stand down in may after the expected second round of the election and would then seek to serve the country " in a different fashion . " " i will not ask for your votes for a new mandate , " he said .
" in a different manner , but with the same enthusiasm and passion to act on your behalf , i shall continue to fight our battles - the battles i have fought all my life - for justice , progress , peace and the grandeur of france , " he said . chirac began his political career in 1962 as an advisor to prime minister georges pompidou , and had his first cabinet post in 1967 .
he served two straight mandates as president , was twice prime minister and spent 18 years as mayor of paris .
in 2002 he won re-election with the support of left-wing voters , anxious to keep out far-right leader jean-marie le pen who stunned the country by qualifying for the decisive second round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen said he was gladf to be rid of his enemy le pen said chirac was " the worst president in the history of france .
i am delighted to be losing my best enemy .
the proof that he has led the country to disaster is that not a single candidate ... claims his legacy . " proud of his work in 2003 , chirac led opposition to the us-led war on iraq , earning acclaim in many parts of the world and sparking a bitter diplomatic quarrel with us president george w. bush . " president bush wishes president chirac all the best as he enters life after politics , " white house national security council spokesman gordon johndroe said after chirac 's announcement .
" the united states and france have been and will remain steadfast partners and allies , " he added . though bush 's fortunes have slumped because of the war , chirac 's also tumbled in 2005 , when france rejected the eu 's proposed constitution , riots hit the city suburbs , and he was hospitalized with a " vascular incident . " chirac said that he was " proud of the work which we have carried out together " - citing in particular improvements for the elderly and the handicapped , reforms of the pension system and reductions in crime and unemployment . and he called on the country to defend its values in the world .
" france is not a country like others .
it has particular responsibilities , the legacy of its history and the universal values it helped create , " he said .
still unclear which candidate he backs as expected , chirac gave no sign in his 10-minute address whether he intends to endorse the right-wing candidate for the presidency , interior minister nicolas sarkozy , a former protege who heads the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- . sarkozy , 52 , has a narrow lead in polls over socialist segolene royal but now faces a new challenge from the centrist candidate francois bayrou , head of the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , whose ratings have surged in the last month .

misgivings over legacy while misgivings remain about chirac 's legacy , he commands widespread affection and even political opponents praise his defense of french interests in the world . " it is a historic moment because a page of history is about to turn .
a new page is about to open and the french themselves are going to write it , " said royal . bayrou , who served as education minister under chirac from 1995 to 1997 , said that " on foreign policy he was an honorable voice , and a great voice at the moments when france needed one " - a clear reference to chirac 's defiance of the united states . however socialist former prime minister laurent fabius said the chirac era had been " wasted . " " his long presidency has lost france a lot of time .
this is what strikes me most : in relation to the major problems facing france and europe , a presidency of wasted time , " he said . chirac will officially leave his post on may 16 , when his mandate expires .

" " witnesses , victims and observers we met repeatedly confirmed joint action between government forces and armed militia in assaulting civilian targets in darfur , " the report said . rebels share responsibility the mission said rebel groups in the region shared some responsibility for the rights abuses , including rape and torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions have been displaced by violence in sudan 's darfur region khartoum 's provision of arms to the janjaweed and other militias is a key factor behind growing tensions between tribal groups and communities , victims and witnesses told members of the mission . the report also said the un general assembly should compile a blacklist of foreign companies that have an " adverse impact " on the human rights situation in darfur . the darfur report kicked off a three-week session of the un 's human rights council , which replaced the human rights commission in 2006 . the darfur mission was set up by a rare consensus of the council 's 47 members following hard bargaining by western , african and islamic nations during a special session last december - the first time the council had specifically focused on darfur . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de international court names first darfur war crimes suspects the international criminal court in the hague on tuesday named a sudanese minister and a janjaweed militia leader as the first war crimes suspects in the darfur conflict .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.03.2007 germany skeptical about environmental speed limits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say slowing drivers to 120 kph -lrb- 75 mph -rrb- is n't the way to save the planet german politicians scoffed at the idea that speed limits on the country 's autobahns would prevent global warming .
yet the recent european interest in climate change has the german auto industry worried about its image . germany has no intention of slowing down its famously speedy drivers .
politicians and carmakers criticized the suggestion by european union environment minister that germany should introduce a speed limit on its autobahns . the speed limit idea is " a secondary front and a trivialization of the climate problem , " according to german environment minister sigmar gabriel . the powerful german automobile industry federation -lrb- vda -rrb- said in a statement that germany needed " no coaching " from brussels on how to protect the climate " above all when the proposals are only symbolic . " speed wastes energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's stavros dimas called for german speed limits eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said germany should impose speed limits on its highways as a way to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
the german transport ministry has rejected the idea , saying it would have a negligible effect on greenhouse gas emissions . " there are many areas in which we senselessly waste energy and harm the environment , " dimas said in an interview published in the bild newspaper 's sunday edition . he suggested speed limits as a good start .
in germany , some stretches of highway have speed limits but other sections allow drivers to go as fast as they like . " speed limits are useful for many reasons and are the order of the day in most of the eu 's 27 member nations and the united states , " dimas said .
" strangely enough , it is only in germany where they are controversial . " german social democratic party leader peter struck warned against " climate hysteria " where climate change is allowed to become the only thing on the agenda .
no one cares about preserving jobs , struck said in a bild interview sunday . but dimas said germany has a special responsibility towards curbing greenhouse gas emissions , which are widely believed to be responsible for global warming . " a breakthrough will only be possible if the eu members take steps to ensure that climate protection measures are feasible and financially sustainable - particularly germany as an important industrial nation , " he said . car industry concerned about image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers got the eu to water down its emissions limits the german car industry showed its clout last month , when the eu presented less strict co2 emissions standards .
dimas had originally wanted tougher levels for cars sold in europe but backed down after pressure from german automobile manufacturers , which said they would be unfairly targeted . but german car makers are increasingly concerned about their image , a recent shake-up at their lobbying group has shown .
long-time president of the vda , bernd gottschalk , resigned unexpectedly on saturday . automakers were reportedly unhappy at how their lobby initially handled the eu climate debate .
the industry felt the vda reacted too slowly and not forcefully enough , according to der spiegel magazine . there was also criticism that gottschalk had n't done a good job of explaining the what the auto industry has been doing up until now to help the environment .
a replacement for gottschalk has not yet been made . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urged to take lead on battling climate change the european union will seek to thrash out a common policy in fighting climate change , with plans to set tough targets for cutting carbon dioxide emissions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.03.2007 president chirac bows out of french politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unclear what chirac will be remebered for president jacques chirac has announced that he will not stand as a candidate in the looming presidential election , ending a career of more than 40 years at the top of french politics . chirac has been president for 12 years and he made his name around the world by spearheading opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq .
his decision to bow out at the age of 74 is the end of an era as younger rivals on the left and right battle it out to take over . the veteran conservative said in a televised address on sunday that he would stand down in may after the expected second round of the election and would then seek to serve the country " in a different fashion . " " i will not ask for your votes for a new mandate , " he said .
" in a different manner , but with the same enthusiasm and passion to act on your behalf , i shall continue to fight our battles - the battles i have fought all my life - for justice , progress , peace and the grandeur of france , " he said . chirac began his political career in 1962 as an advisor to prime minister georges pompidou , and had his first cabinet post in 1967 .
he served two straight mandates as president , was twice prime minister and spent 18 years as mayor of paris .
in 2002 he won re-election with the support of left-wing voters , anxious to keep out far-right leader jean-marie le pen who stunned the country by qualifying for the decisive second round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen said he was gladf to be rid of his enemy le pen said chirac was " the worst president in the history of france .
i am delighted to be losing my best enemy .
the proof that he has led the country to disaster is that not a single candidate ... claims his legacy . " proud of his work in 2003 , chirac led opposition to the us-led war on iraq , earning acclaim in many parts of the world and sparking a bitter diplomatic quarrel with us president george w. bush . " president bush wishes president chirac all the best as he enters life after politics , " white house national security council spokesman gordon johndroe said after chirac 's announcement .
" the united states and france have been and will remain steadfast partners and allies , " he added . though bush 's fortunes have slumped because of the war , chirac 's also tumbled in 2005 , when france rejected the eu 's proposed constitution , riots hit the city suburbs , and he was hospitalized with a " vascular incident . " chirac said that he was " proud of the work which we have carried out together " - citing in particular improvements for the elderly and the handicapped , reforms of the pension system and reductions in crime and unemployment . and he called on the country to defend its values in the world .
" france is not a country like others .
it has particular responsibilities , the legacy of its history and the universal values it helped create , " he said .
still unclear which candidate he backs as expected , chirac gave no sign in his 10-minute address whether he intends to endorse the right-wing candidate for the presidency , interior minister nicolas sarkozy , a former protege who heads the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- . sarkozy , 52 , has a narrow lead in polls over socialist segolene royal but now faces a new challenge from the centrist candidate francois bayrou , head of the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , whose ratings have surged in the last month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy -lrb- r . -rrb- faces a challenge from within as well as from royal -lrb- l . -rrb- a poll published in le journal du dimanche newspaper for the first time showed bayrou on the same score as royal - 23 percent - in the first round of the vote on april 22 .
sarkozy was given 29 percent .
the two leading contenders qualify for a run-off on may 6 .
misgivings over legacy while misgivings remain about chirac 's legacy , he commands widespread affection and even political opponents praise his defense of french interests in the world . " it is a historic moment because a page of history is about to turn .
a new page is about to open and the french themselves are going to write it , " said royal . bayrou , who served as education minister under chirac from 1995 to 1997 , said that " on foreign policy he was an honorable voice , and a great voice at the moments when france needed one " - a clear reference to chirac 's defiance of the united states . however socialist former prime minister laurent fabius said the chirac era had been " wasted . " " his long presidency has lost france a lot of time .
this is what strikes me most : in relation to the major problems facing france and europe , a presidency of wasted time , " he said . chirac will officially leave his post on may 16 , when his mandate expires .
he has indicated that he would like to chair an international foundation , promoting causes close to his heart such as the environment and non-european cultures . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de extremist le pen strikes chord in france , again for over 30 years , jean-marie le pen has campaigned at the top of french politics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.03.2007 president chirac bows out of french politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unclear what chirac will be remebered for president jacques chirac has announced that he will not stand as a candidate in the looming presidential election , ending a career of more than 40 years at the top of french politics . chirac has been president for 12 years and he made his name around the world by spearheading opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq .
his decision to bow out at the age of 74 is the end of an era as younger rivals on the left and right battle it out to take over . the veteran conservative said in a televised address on sunday that he would stand down in may after the expected second round of the election and would then seek to serve the country " in a different fashion . " " i will not ask for your votes for a new mandate , " he said .
" in a different manner , but with the same enthusiasm and passion to act on your behalf , i shall continue to fight our battles - the battles i have fought all my life - for justice , progress , peace and the grandeur of france , " he said . chirac began his political career in 1962 as an advisor to prime minister georges pompidou , and had his first cabinet post in 1967 .
he served two straight mandates as president , was twice prime minister and spent 18 years as mayor of paris .
in 2002 he won re-election with the support of left-wing voters , anxious to keep out far-right leader jean-marie le pen who stunned the country by qualifying for the decisive second round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen said he was gladf to be rid of his enemy le pen said chirac was " the worst president in the history of france .
i am delighted to be losing my best enemy .
the proof that he has led the country to disaster is that not a single candidate ... claims his legacy . " proud of his work in 2003 , chirac led opposition to the us-led war on iraq , earning acclaim in many parts of the world and sparking a bitter diplomatic quarrel with us president george w. bush . " president bush wishes president chirac all the best as he enters life after politics , " white house national security council spokesman gordon johndroe said after chirac 's announcement .
" the united states and france have been and will remain steadfast partners and allies , " he added . though bush 's fortunes have slumped because of the war , chirac 's also tumbled in 2005 , when france rejected the eu 's proposed constitution , riots hit the city suburbs , and he was hospitalized with a " vascular incident . " chirac said that he was " proud of the work which we have carried out together " - citing in particular improvements for the elderly and the handicapped , reforms of the pension system and reductions in crime and unemployment . and he called on the country to defend its values in the world .
" france is not a country like others .
it has particular responsibilities , the legacy of its history and the universal values it helped create , " he said .
still unclear which candidate he backs as expected , chirac gave no sign in his 10-minute address whether he intends to endorse the right-wing candidate for the presidency , interior minister nicolas sarkozy , a former protege who heads the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- . sarkozy , 52 , has a narrow lead in polls over socialist segolene royal but now faces a new challenge from the centrist candidate francois bayrou , head of the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , whose ratings have surged in the last month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy -lrb- r . -rrb- faces a challenge from within as well as from royal -lrb- l . -rrb- a poll published in le journal du dimanche newspaper for the first time showed bayrou on the same score as royal - 23 percent - in the first round of the vote on april 22 .
sarkozy was given 29 percent .
the two leading contenders qualify for a run-off on may 6 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.03.2007 president chirac bows out of french politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unclear what chirac will be remebered for president jacques chirac has announced that he will not stand as a candidate in the looming presidential election , ending a career of more than 40 years at the top of french politics . chirac has been president for 12 years and he made his name around the world by spearheading opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq .
his decision to bow out at the age of 74 is the end of an era as younger rivals on the left and right battle it out to take over . the veteran conservative said in a televised address on sunday that he would stand down in may after the expected second round of the election and would then seek to serve the country " in a different fashion . " " i will not ask for your votes for a new mandate , " he said .
" in a different manner , but with the same enthusiasm and passion to act on your behalf , i shall continue to fight our battles - the battles i have fought all my life - for justice , progress , peace and the grandeur of france , " he said . chirac began his political career in 1962 as an advisor to prime minister georges pompidou , and had his first cabinet post in 1967 .
he served two straight mandates as president , was twice prime minister and spent 18 years as mayor of paris .
in 2002 he won re-election with the support of left-wing voters , anxious to keep out far-right leader jean-marie le pen who stunned the country by qualifying for the decisive second round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen said he was gladf to be rid of his enemy le pen said chirac was " the worst president in the history of france .
i am delighted to be losing my best enemy .
the proof that he has led the country to disaster is that not a single candidate ... claims his legacy . " proud of his work in 2003 , chirac led opposition to the us-led war on iraq , earning acclaim in many parts of the world and sparking a bitter diplomatic quarrel with us president george w. bush . " president bush wishes president chirac all the best as he enters life after politics , " white house national security council spokesman gordon johndroe said after chirac 's announcement .
" the united states and france have been and will remain steadfast partners and allies , " he added . though bush 's fortunes have slumped because of the war , chirac 's also tumbled in 2005 , when france rejected the eu 's proposed constitution , riots hit the city suburbs , and he was hospitalized with a " vascular incident . " chirac said that he was " proud of the work which we have carried out together " - citing in particular improvements for the elderly and the handicapped , reforms of the pension system and reductions in crime and unemployment . and he called on the country to defend its values in the world .
" france is not a country like others .
it has particular responsibilities , the legacy of its history and the universal values it helped create , " he said .
still unclear which candidate he backs as expected , chirac gave no sign in his 10-minute address whether he intends to endorse the right-wing candidate for the presidency , interior minister nicolas sarkozy , a former protege who heads the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- . sarkozy , 52 , has a narrow lead in polls over socialist segolene royal but now faces a new challenge from the centrist candidate francois bayrou , head of the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , whose ratings have surged in the last month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy -lrb- r . -rrb- faces a challenge from within as well as from royal -lrb- l . -rrb- a poll published in le journal du dimanche newspaper for the first time showed bayrou on the same score as royal - 23 percent - in the first round of the vote on april 22 .
sarkozy was given 29 percent .
the two leading contenders qualify for a run-off on may 6 .
misgivings over legacy while misgivings remain about chirac 's legacy , he commands widespread affection and even political opponents praise his defense of french interests in the world . " it is a historic moment because a page of history is about to turn .
a new page is about to open and the french themselves are going to write it , " said royal . bayrou , who served as education minister under chirac from 1995 to 1997 , said that " on foreign policy he was an honorable voice , and a great voice at the moments when france needed one " - a clear reference to chirac 's defiance of the united states . however socialist former prime minister laurent fabius said the chirac era had been " wasted .

tax laws will restrict how businesses claim depreciation next year , making it attractive to buy capital goods in 2007 , the report said . germany 's production levels also beat january forecasts , rising a sharp 1.9 percent from the previous month , according to seasonally adjusted figures released recently by the economics ministry . strong consumer spending will also play a role in the economic growth as the jobless rate decreases and private income grows , according to the report . unemployment continues to fall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german unemployment continues to drop jobless rates in germany decreased unexpectedly in february .
adjusted for the usual seasonal effects , the german jobless total was down sharply , falling by 79,000 to 3.897 million , with the adjusted jobless rate falling to 9.3 percent from 9.5 percent , data published by the german central bank in frankfurt showed . the growth rate is predicted to slow slightly next year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.03.2007 president chirac bows out of french politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unclear what chirac will be remebered for president jacques chirac has announced that he will not stand as a candidate in the looming presidential election , ending a career of more than 40 years at the top of french politics . chirac has been president for 12 years and he made his name around the world by spearheading opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq .
his decision to bow out at the age of 74 is the end of an era as younger rivals on the left and right battle it out to take over . the veteran conservative said in a televised address on sunday that he would stand down in may after the expected second round of the election and would then seek to serve the country " in a different fashion . " " i will not ask for your votes for a new mandate , " he said .
" in a different manner , but with the same enthusiasm and passion to act on your behalf , i shall continue to fight our battles - the battles i have fought all my life - for justice , progress , peace and the grandeur of france , " he said . chirac began his political career in 1962 as an advisor to prime minister georges pompidou , and had his first cabinet post in 1967 .
he served two straight mandates as president , was twice prime minister and spent 18 years as mayor of paris .
in 2002 he won re-election with the support of left-wing voters , anxious to keep out far-right leader jean-marie le pen who stunned the country by qualifying for the decisive second round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen said he was gladf to be rid of his enemy le pen said chirac was " the worst president in the history of france .
i am delighted to be losing my best enemy .
the proof that he has led the country to disaster is that not a single candidate ... claims his legacy . " proud of his work in 2003 , chirac led opposition to the us-led war on iraq , earning acclaim in many parts of the world and sparking a bitter diplomatic quarrel with us president george w. bush . " president bush wishes president chirac all the best as he enters life after politics , " white house national security council spokesman gordon johndroe said after chirac 's announcement .
" the united states and france have been and will remain steadfast partners and allies , " he added . though bush 's fortunes have slumped because of the war , chirac 's also tumbled in 2005 , when france rejected the eu 's proposed constitution , riots hit the city suburbs , and he was hospitalized with a " vascular incident . " chirac said that he was " proud of the work which we have carried out together " - citing in particular improvements for the elderly and the handicapped , reforms of the pension system and reductions in crime and unemployment . and he called on the country to defend its values in the world .
" france is not a country like others .
it has particular responsibilities , the legacy of its history and the universal values it helped create , " he said .
still unclear which candidate he backs as expected , chirac gave no sign in his 10-minute address whether he intends to endorse the right-wing candidate for the presidency , interior minister nicolas sarkozy , a former protege who heads the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- . sarkozy , 52 , has a narrow lead in polls over socialist segolene royal but now faces a new challenge from the centrist candidate francois bayrou , head of the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , whose ratings have surged in the last month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy -lrb- r . -rrb- faces a challenge from within as well as from royal -lrb- l . -rrb- a poll published in le journal du dimanche newspaper for the first time showed bayrou on the same score as royal - 23 percent - in the first round of the vote on april 22 .
sarkozy was given 29 percent .
the two leading contenders qualify for a run-off on may 6 .
misgivings over legacy while misgivings remain about chirac 's legacy , he commands widespread affection and even political opponents praise his defense of french interests in the world . " it is a historic moment because a page of history is about to turn .
a new page is about to open and the french themselves are going to write it , " said royal . bayrou , who served as education minister under chirac from 1995 to 1997 , said that " on foreign policy he was an honorable voice , and a great voice at the moments when france needed one " - a clear reference to chirac 's defiance of the united states . however socialist former prime minister laurent fabius said the chirac era had been " wasted . " " his long presidency has lost france a lot of time .
this is what strikes me most : in relation to the major problems facing france and europe , a presidency of wasted time , " he said . chirac will officially leave his post on may 16 , when his mandate expires .
he has indicated that he would like to chair an international foundation , promoting causes close to his heart such as the environment and non-european cultures . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de extremist le pen strikes chord in france , again for over 30 years , jean-marie le pen has campaigned at the top of french politics .

" the situation is characterized by gross and systematic violations of human rights and grave breaches of international law , " the report said .
" war crimes and crimes against humanity continue across the region .
killing of civilians remains widespread , including in large-scale attacks .
rape and sexual violence are widespread and systematic .
torture continues . " as violations and abuses continue unabated , a climate of impunity prevails , " it added . international condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said the world needed to speak out international reaction was swift following the report 's release . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , representing the eu at the un human rights council , said the world would have to act on the report 's description of " the ongoing , cruel human rights abuses . "
" the international community wo n't remain silent , " steinmeier told the associated press , without adding further details . no sudanese cooperation the un estimates at least 200,000 people have been killed in darfur with a further 2.5 million displaced . the conflict and influx of refugees has also spilled over into neighboring chad , exacerbating existing tensions . williams and her team were unable to carry out investigations in darfur itself , as khartoum refused to grant visas , saying some of the team 's members were " biased " against sudan - a charge repeated on sunday by sudan 's justice minister while en route to geneva . last month , the international criminal court in the hague named a sudanese government minister and a janjaweed militia leader as the first suspects prosecutors want to try for war crimes in the darfur conflict . darfur requires unified approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former sudanese interior minister ahmed muhammed harun was charged with war crimes the report urged the international community to adopt a " fully unified approach " in addressing darfur , and to help convene a national conference on peace , human rights and a common vision for sudan . it also called for the implementation of measures such as travel bans and the freezing of assets for those identified as rights violators . turning to actions on the ground , it demanded that sudan " end the targeting of civilians in darfur , cease all support for janjaweed militia forces , and proceed with the disarmament , demobilization and reintegration of such forces . " " witnesses , victims and observers we met repeatedly confirmed joint action between government forces and armed militia in assaulting civilian targets in darfur , " the report said . rebels share responsibility the mission said rebel groups in the region shared some responsibility for the rights abuses , including rape and torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions have been displaced by violence in sudan 's darfur region khartoum 's provision of arms to the janjaweed and other militias is a key factor behind growing tensions between tribal groups and communities , victims and witnesses told members of the mission . the report also said the un general assembly should compile a blacklist of foreign companies that have an " adverse impact " on the human rights situation in darfur . the darfur report kicked off a three-week session of the un 's human rights council , which replaced the human rights commission in 2006 . the darfur mission was set up by a rare consensus of the council 's 47 members following hard bargaining by western , african and islamic nations during a special session last december - the first time the council had specifically focused on darfur . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de international court names first darfur war crimes suspects the international criminal court in the hague on tuesday named a sudanese minister and a janjaweed militia leader as the first war crimes suspects in the darfur conflict .

" the situation is characterized by gross and systematic violations of human rights and grave breaches of international law , " the report said .
" war crimes and crimes against humanity continue across the region .

" " witnesses , victims and observers we met repeatedly confirmed joint action between government forces and armed militia in assaulting civilian targets in darfur , " the report said . rebels share responsibility the mission said rebel groups in the region shared some responsibility for the rights abuses , including rape and torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions have been displaced by violence in sudan 's darfur region khartoum 's provision of arms to the janjaweed and other militias is a key factor behind growing tensions between tribal groups and communities , victims and witnesses told members of the mission . the report also said the un general assembly should compile a blacklist of foreign companies that have an " adverse impact " on the human rights situation in darfur . the darfur report kicked off a three-week session of the un 's human rights council , which replaced the human rights commission in 2006 . the darfur mission was set up by a rare consensus of the council 's 47 members following hard bargaining by western , african and islamic nations during a special session last december - the first time the council had specifically focused on darfur . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de international court names first darfur war crimes suspects the international criminal court in the hague on tuesday named a sudanese minister and a janjaweed militia leader as the first war crimes suspects in the darfur conflict .

"
schröder worries the plan will provoke russia . schröder warned that the united states plan to install a radar base in the czech republic and interceptor missiles in poland established a " policy of encirclement against russia . "
the decision could lead to a new arms race , schröder said in a speech sunday . the united states has said it wants to establish a european system to protect against attacks by countries such as north korea and iran .
russia has seen the plan as a threat to its security .
senior russian military figures have threatened to target the missile-shield sites with their own weapons . provoking an arms race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has close personal ties to putin the us missile defense system could lead to a new global arms race , schröder warned at a sunday event in dresden .
he said current chancellor angela merkel 's government should try to persuade washington to drop its plan . merkel 's government has backed the us plan , saying it was a " purely defensive system " not aimed at russia . schröder has close personal ties to russian president vladimir putin and is currently involved with a russian-german natural gas consortium . the us was pursuing a containment strategy against russia , schröder warned .
europe should avoid similar actions which could be seen as encircling russia .
these included plans for ukraine and georgia to join nato , schröder said . the former chancellor admitted russia has a bad human rights record , but said the country was at the beginning of a new era .
he encouraged europe to strengthen its energy partnership with russia , which currently supplies 30 percent of the eu 's crude oil and 30 percent of germany 's natural gas . other german political leaders also issued strong criticism of the us plan . putting missiles in eastern europe is not a private matter between prague , warsaw and washington , opposition free democratic party leader guido westerwelle wrote in the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper on sunday .
it 's an important issue for all of europe . german left party leader gregor gysi was also critical . " this would be the start of a new arms race and a new cold war that is wasteful and unnecessary , " he said in an interview published sunday in the magazine super illu . nato chief criticizes plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us tests its defense system nato 's secretary general criticized the us plan as not adequately covering some south-eastern states in europe , which would need an extra , short-range system to defend against iran . " when it comes to missile defense , there should n't be an a-league and a b-league within nato , " jaap de hoop scheffer told the financial times in an article published monday .

" we are part of a global danger zone , " he said .
" in times when we were not affected , we did not succumb to the illusion that that we were not threatened like the british , the spaniards or others , " he said in reference to the london and madrid bombings . an alarming position wolfgang bosbach , the interior expert for the conservative cdu / csu group in the bundestag and a party colleague of chancellor angela merkel , said german troops ' mission in the north of afghanistan and the deployment of german tornado reconnaissance jets in the south would continue despite the threats . " we in germany are in a persistent and alarming position in regard to this menace , and we also know that foreign policy decisions can change the security situation in germany , " bosbach said in an interview with the rheinsiche post newspaper published on monday .
" but it would be a major mistake if we were to stay out of the fight against international terror .
therefore , the security position will not change and neither will the decision on the tornado deployment in afghanistan . "
the bundestag decided on friday to deploy six tornado jets to provide reconnaissance assistance to nato troops in southern afghanistan ahead of an expected spring offensive from taliban fighters . peter struck , a former defense minister and currently leader of the social democrats in the german parliament , announced that the bundeswehr deployment in afghanistan would continue " at least for another decade . " " it must be clear to everybody that the reconstruction of the country is only possible if the taliban are defeated , " said struck in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper . berlin crisis team working on release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis team works on finding and freeing the hostages meanwhile , the german foreign ministry 's crisis team continued to work on the release of the two german hostages kidnapped in iraq .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on the weekend that everything was being done to secure the release of berlin-born hannelore marianne k. and her adult son . steinmeier said the crisis team believed that the kidnappers have criminal intent and that they are holding the hostages for ransom and for an ideological reason . the 61-year-old woman and her son were seized on feb .
6 by armed men who burst into their family home in baghdad .
a video of them was released over the weekend , showing the woman , who is married to an iraqi professor , begging for her and her son 's life . " i 'm asking you to help me , " she sobbed in the video broadcast .
" we 're germans as well .
these people want to kill my son before my eyes and then kill me .
i do n't want to die like this , " she said in german . the video showed three masked militants of a little-known group calling itself the brigade of the arrows of righteousness standing behind the woman , who was wearing a loosely tied headdress and holding the hand of her son crouching next to her . one of the masked men demanded the withdrawal of all of germany 's approximately 3,000 troops in the relatively stable north of afghanistan , where it commands the international security assistance force , within 10 days .
" otherwise , " he said , " you will not even see one corpse for these two agents . " al qaeda web site broadcasts terror threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new jets were just approved for the mission the video 's release was followed by a threat broadcast on an al qaeda linked website which warned germany and austria of retribution if they did not pull their troops out of afghanistan . a masked man read out a statement in the video message , posted on the so-called voice of the caliphate web site in arabic with german subtitles , saying : " germany 's participation in the us war on islam and muslims will lead only to ... endangering germany itself .

" i plead with you - for the sake of allah - to immediately free the two captives , " al-masri told german news agency dpa , in a message directed at the militants . prominent cleric urges militants to free germans al-masri , the former imam of a mosque in milan , said he saw the video .
al-masri himself was reportedly kidnapped in italy and then taken to cairo in 2004 .
he was released briefly and detained by egyptian authorities as a terrorist suspect , and was recently released . " i am your brother in allah , who was kidnapped from the streets of milan on 27 february 2003 by cia agents , following campaigns where i condemned the injustice of the us state department towards the afghan and iraqi people , " he said in his message . al-masri , who in his own words spent " four years in captivity , -lrb- and -rrb- imprisonment , " urged the kidnappers not to kill the mother and her son . " what are the german mother and the son guilty of ?
what have they got to do with the foreign policy of their country ?

a video of them was released over the weekend , showing the woman , who is married to an iraqi professor , begging for her and her son 's life . " i 'm asking you to help me , " she sobbed in the video broadcast .
" we 're germans as well .
these people want to kill my son before my eyes and then kill me .
i do n't want to die like this , " she said in german . the video showed three masked militants of a little-known group calling itself the brigade of the arrows of righteousness standing behind the woman , who was wearing a loosely tied headdress and holding the hand of her son crouching next to her . one of the masked men demanded the withdrawal of all of germany 's approximately 3,000 troops in the relatively stable north of afghanistan , where it commands the international security assistance force , within 10 days .
" otherwise , " he said , " you will not even see one corpse for these two agents . " al qaeda web site broadcasts terror threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new jets were just approved for the mission the video 's release was followed by a threat broadcast on an al qaeda linked website which warned germany and austria of retribution if they did not pull their troops out of afghanistan . a masked man read out a statement in the video message , posted on the so-called voice of the caliphate web site in arabic with german subtitles , saying : " germany 's participation in the us war on islam and muslims will lead only to ... endangering germany itself .
we wonder where germany 's interest lies in throwing 2,750 troops -lrb- to afghanistan -rrb- ... to fight in defense of the lies of -lrb- president george w. -rrb-
bush and his gang . " as the flags of germany and austria appeared in front of a burning background , the man added : " in standing by the united states ... you have provoked those whom you call terrorists to target you . " also on sunday , a prominent egyptian islamist sheikh osama mustafa hassan nasr , known as abu omar al-masri , called sunday on the militants to release the german hostages . " i plead with you - for the sake of allah - to immediately free the two captives , " al-masri told german news agency dpa , in a message directed at the militants . prominent cleric urges militants to free germans al-masri , the former imam of a mosque in milan , said he saw the video .
al-masri himself was reportedly kidnapped in italy and then taken to cairo in 2004 .
he was released briefly and detained by egyptian authorities as a terrorist suspect , and was recently released . " i am your brother in allah , who was kidnapped from the streets of milan on 27 february 2003 by cia agents , following campaigns where i condemned the injustice of the us state department towards the afghan and iraqi people , " he said in his message . al-masri , who in his own words spent " four years in captivity , -lrb- and -rrb- imprisonment , " urged the kidnappers not to kill the mother and her son . " what are the german mother and the son guilty of ?
what have they got to do with the foreign policy of their country ? " he said , adding that muslims in the west " face troubles " and that killing the german citizens will have even more negative effects . " have mercy on your -lrb- muslim -rrb- brothers and let go of the german mother and her son , " he added . dw staff -lrb- nda , jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de islamist group warns germany , austria of attacks an islamist group urged germany and austria in a video to withdraw troops from afghanistan to prevent attacks against the two nations .

" we are part of a global danger zone , " he said .
" in times when we were not affected , we did not succumb to the illusion that that we were not threatened like the british , the spaniards or others , " he said in reference to the london and madrid bombings . an alarming position wolfgang bosbach , the interior expert for the conservative cdu / csu group in the bundestag and a party colleague of chancellor angela merkel , said german troops ' mission in the north of afghanistan and the deployment of german tornado reconnaissance jets in the south would continue despite the threats . " we in germany are in a persistent and alarming position in regard to this menace , and we also know that foreign policy decisions can change the security situation in germany , " bosbach said in an interview with the rheinsiche post newspaper published on monday .
" but it would be a major mistake if we were to stay out of the fight against international terror .
therefore , the security position will not change and neither will the decision on the tornado deployment in afghanistan . "
the bundestag decided on friday to deploy six tornado jets to provide reconnaissance assistance to nato troops in southern afghanistan ahead of an expected spring offensive from taliban fighters . peter struck , a former defense minister and currently leader of the social democrats in the german parliament , announced that the bundeswehr deployment in afghanistan would continue " at least for another decade .

foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on the weekend that everything was being done to secure the release of berlin-born hannelore marianne k. and her adult son . steinmeier said the crisis team believed that the kidnappers have criminal intent and that they are holding the hostages for ransom and for an ideological reason . the 61-year-old woman and her son were seized on feb .
6 by armed men who burst into their family home in baghdad .
a video of them was released over the weekend , showing the woman , who is married to an iraqi professor , begging for her and her son 's life . " i 'm asking you to help me , " she sobbed in the video broadcast .
" we 're germans as well .
these people want to kill my son before my eyes and then kill me .
i do n't want to die like this , " she said in german . the video showed three masked militants of a little-known group calling itself the brigade of the arrows of righteousness standing behind the woman , who was wearing a loosely tied headdress and holding the hand of her son crouching next to her . one of the masked men demanded the withdrawal of all of germany 's approximately 3,000 troops in the relatively stable north of afghanistan , where it commands the international security assistance force , within 10 days .

" i plead with you - for the sake of allah - to immediately free the two captives , " al-masri told german news agency dpa , in a message directed at the militants . prominent cleric urges militants to free germans al-masri , the former imam of a mosque in milan , said he saw the video .
al-masri himself was reportedly kidnapped in italy and then taken to cairo in 2004 .
he was released briefly and detained by egyptian authorities as a terrorist suspect , and was recently released . " i am your brother in allah , who was kidnapped from the streets of milan on 27 february 2003 by cia agents , following campaigns where i condemned the injustice of the us state department towards the afghan and iraqi people , " he said in his message . al-masri , who in his own words spent " four years in captivity , -lrb- and -rrb- imprisonment , " urged the kidnappers not to kill the mother and her son . " what are the german mother and the son guilty of ?
what have they got to do with the foreign policy of their country ?

his wish was granted in the city of braunschweig on feb .

" we want to clear this up once and for all . " hitler requested release from his austrian citizenship in 1925 on the grounds that he had been living in germany since 1912 and served in the german army in world war one .
austria agreed and hitler was stateless until officially becoming german seven years later . when locals congratulated him on the step , hitler replied , " it is not me but germany that you should congratulate , " wrote the spiegel online news web site . questionable legality saalmann said that while she felt the gesture of rescinding the citizenship carried symbolic importance , she did not aim to whitewash the history of braunschweig , which was a nazi stronghold in the 1930s . " this should never serve to play down history along the lines of ' look , he was n't a german at all , " ' she said .
" that would never be my intention as a social democrat . " although braunschweig deprived hitler of his honorary citizenship in 1946 , one year after his death at the end of world war two , spiegel online said the motion to withdraw his citizenship could face a few daunting hurdles . " dead is dead , " an unnamed official at the lower saxony justice ministry was quoted as saying .
" you ca n't take anything more away then . " according to german law , citizenship can not be revoked if the person in question would then be stateless , which would be the case for hitler , who abdicated his austrian passport seven years before officially becoming a german . a decision on the motion is not expected for several weeks . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german neo-nazi gets five years for holocaust denial a german court on thursday sentenced a prominent holocaust denier ernst zündel to five years in prison for inciting racial hatred and denying that the nazis killed millions of jews .

his decision to bow out at the age of 74 is the end of an era as younger rivals on the left and right battle it out to take over . the veteran conservative said in a televised address on sunday that he would stand down in may after the expected second round of the election and would then seek to serve the country " in a different fashion . " " i will not ask for your votes for a new mandate , " he said .
" in a different manner , but with the same enthusiasm and passion to act on your behalf , i shall continue to fight our battles - the battles i have fought all my life - for justice , progress , peace and the grandeur of france , " he said . chirac began his political career in 1962 as an advisor to prime minister georges pompidou , and had his first cabinet post in 1967 .
he served two straight mandates as president , was twice prime minister and spent 18 years as mayor of paris .
in 2002 he won re-election with the support of left-wing voters , anxious to keep out far-right leader jean-marie le pen who stunned the country by qualifying for the decisive second round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen said he was gladf to be rid of his enemy le pen said chirac was " the worst president in the history of france .

" president bush wishes president chirac all the best as he enters life after politics , " white house national security council spokesman gordon johndroe said after chirac 's announcement .
" the united states and france have been and will remain steadfast partners and allies , " he added . though bush 's fortunes have slumped because of the war , chirac 's also tumbled in 2005 , when france rejected the eu 's proposed constitution , riots hit the city suburbs , and he was hospitalized with a " vascular incident .

" france is not a country like others .
it has particular responsibilities , the legacy of its history and the universal values it helped create , " he said .

" proud of his work in 2003 , chirac led opposition to the us-led war on iraq , earning acclaim in many parts of the world and sparking a bitter diplomatic quarrel with us president george w. bush . " president bush wishes president chirac all the best as he enters life after politics , " white house national security council spokesman gordon johndroe said after chirac 's announcement .
" the united states and france have been and will remain steadfast partners and allies , " he added . though bush 's fortunes have slumped because of the war , chirac 's also tumbled in 2005 , when france rejected the eu 's proposed constitution , riots hit the city suburbs , and he was hospitalized with a " vascular incident . " chirac said that he was " proud of the work which we have carried out together " - citing in particular improvements for the elderly and the handicapped , reforms of the pension system and reductions in crime and unemployment . and he called on the country to defend its values in the world .
" france is not a country like others .
it has particular responsibilities , the legacy of its history and the universal values it helped create , " he said .
still unclear which candidate he backs as expected , chirac gave no sign in his 10-minute address whether he intends to endorse the right-wing candidate for the presidency , interior minister nicolas sarkozy , a former protege who heads the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- . sarkozy , 52 , has a narrow lead in polls over socialist segolene royal but now faces a new challenge from the centrist candidate francois bayrou , head of the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , whose ratings have surged in the last month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy -lrb- r . -rrb- faces a challenge from within as well as from royal -lrb- l . -rrb- a poll published in le journal du dimanche newspaper for the first time showed bayrou on the same score as royal - 23 percent - in the first round of the vote on april 22 .
sarkozy was given 29 percent .
the two leading contenders qualify for a run-off on may 6 .
misgivings over legacy while misgivings remain about chirac 's legacy , he commands widespread affection and even political opponents praise his defense of french interests in the world . " it is a historic moment because a page of history is about to turn .
a new page is about to open and the french themselves are going to write it , " said royal . bayrou , who served as education minister under chirac from 1995 to 1997 , said that " on foreign policy he was an honorable voice , and a great voice at the moments when france needed one " - a clear reference to chirac 's defiance of the united states . however socialist former prime minister laurent fabius said the chirac era had been " wasted . " " his long presidency has lost france a lot of time .
this is what strikes me most : in relation to the major problems facing france and europe , a presidency of wasted time , " he said . chirac will officially leave his post on may 16 , when his mandate expires .

his wish was granted in the city of braunschweig on feb .
25 , 1932 , less than a year before hitler became german chancellor . " once and for all " saalmann , who represents braunschweig , said she wanted to sever the city 's notorious connection with the nazi leader with her motion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler needed a german passport to be active in german politics " if the state of lower saxony , as the legal successor of the then free state of braunschweig , distances itself from it , it could be helpful , " she told the daily hannoversche allgemeine zeitung . " we want to clear this up once and for all . " hitler requested release from his austrian citizenship in 1925 on the grounds that he had been living in germany since 1912 and served in the german army in world war one .
austria agreed and hitler was stateless until officially becoming german seven years later . when locals congratulated him on the step , hitler replied , " it is not me but germany that you should congratulate , " wrote the spiegel online news web site . questionable legality saalmann said that while she felt the gesture of rescinding the citizenship carried symbolic importance , she did not aim to whitewash the history of braunschweig , which was a nazi stronghold in the 1930s . " this should never serve to play down history along the lines of ' look , he was n't a german at all , " ' she said .
" that would never be my intention as a social democrat . " although braunschweig deprived hitler of his honorary citizenship in 1946 , one year after his death at the end of world war two , spiegel online said the motion to withdraw his citizenship could face a few daunting hurdles . " dead is dead , " an unnamed official at the lower saxony justice ministry was quoted as saying .

" we are part of a global danger zone , " he said .
" in times when we were not affected , we did not succumb to the illusion that that we were not threatened like the british , the spaniards or others , " he said in reference to the london and madrid bombings . an alarming position wolfgang bosbach , the interior expert for the conservative cdu / csu group in the bundestag and a party colleague of chancellor angela merkel , said german troops ' mission in the north of afghanistan and the deployment of german tornado reconnaissance jets in the south would continue despite the threats . " we in germany are in a persistent and alarming position in regard to this menace , and we also know that foreign policy decisions can change the security situation in germany , " bosbach said in an interview with the rheinsiche post newspaper published on monday .
" but it would be a major mistake if we were to stay out of the fight against international terror .
therefore , the security position will not change and neither will the decision on the tornado deployment in afghanistan . "
the bundestag decided on friday to deploy six tornado jets to provide reconnaissance assistance to nato troops in southern afghanistan ahead of an expected spring offensive from taliban fighters . peter struck , a former defense minister and currently leader of the social democrats in the german parliament , announced that the bundeswehr deployment in afghanistan would continue " at least for another decade . " " it must be clear to everybody that the reconstruction of the country is only possible if the taliban are defeated , " said struck in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper . berlin crisis team working on release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis team works on finding and freeing the hostages meanwhile , the german foreign ministry 's crisis team continued to work on the release of the two german hostages kidnapped in iraq .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on the weekend that everything was being done to secure the release of berlin-born hannelore marianne k. and her adult son . steinmeier said the crisis team believed that the kidnappers have criminal intent and that they are holding the hostages for ransom and for an ideological reason . the 61-year-old woman and her son were seized on feb .
6 by armed men who burst into their family home in baghdad .
a video of them was released over the weekend , showing the woman , who is married to an iraqi professor , begging for her and her son 's life . " i 'm asking you to help me , " she sobbed in the video broadcast .
" we 're germans as well .
these people want to kill my son before my eyes and then kill me .
i do n't want to die like this , " she said in german . the video showed three masked militants of a little-known group calling itself the brigade of the arrows of righteousness standing behind the woman , who was wearing a loosely tied headdress and holding the hand of her son crouching next to her . one of the masked men demanded the withdrawal of all of germany 's approximately 3,000 troops in the relatively stable north of afghanistan , where it commands the international security assistance force , within 10 days .
" otherwise , " he said , " you will not even see one corpse for these two agents . " al qaeda web site broadcasts terror threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new jets were just approved for the mission the video 's release was followed by a threat broadcast on an al qaeda linked website which warned germany and austria of retribution if they did not pull their troops out of afghanistan . a masked man read out a statement in the video message , posted on the so-called voice of the caliphate web site in arabic with german subtitles , saying : " germany 's participation in the us war on islam and muslims will lead only to ... endangering germany itself .

al-masri himself was reportedly kidnapped in italy and then taken to cairo in 2004 .
he was released briefly and detained by egyptian authorities as a terrorist suspect , and was recently released . " i am your brother in allah , who was kidnapped from the streets of milan on 27 february 2003 by cia agents , following campaigns where i condemned the injustice of the us state department towards the afghan and iraqi people , " he said in his message . al-masri , who in his own words spent " four years in captivity , -lrb- and -rrb- imprisonment , " urged the kidnappers not to kill the mother and her son . " what are the german mother and the son guilty of ?
what have they got to do with the foreign policy of their country ?

" we are part of a global danger zone , " he said .
" in times when we were not affected , we did not succumb to the illusion that that we were not threatened like the british , the spaniards or others , " he said in reference to the london and madrid bombings . an alarming position wolfgang bosbach , the interior expert for the conservative cdu / csu group in the bundestag and a party colleague of chancellor angela merkel , said german troops ' mission in the north of afghanistan and the deployment of german tornado reconnaissance jets in the south would continue despite the threats .

" but it would be a major mistake if we were to stay out of the fight against international terror .
therefore , the security position will not change and neither will the decision on the tornado deployment in afghanistan . "
the bundestag decided on friday to deploy six tornado jets to provide reconnaissance assistance to nato troops in southern afghanistan ahead of an expected spring offensive from taliban fighters . peter struck , a former defense minister and currently leader of the social democrats in the german parliament , announced that the bundeswehr deployment in afghanistan would continue " at least for another decade .

a video of them was released over the weekend , showing the woman , who is married to an iraqi professor , begging for her and her son 's life . " i 'm asking you to help me , " she sobbed in the video broadcast .
" we 're germans as well .
these people want to kill my son before my eyes and then kill me .
i do n't want to die like this , " she said in german . the video showed three masked militants of a little-known group calling itself the brigade of the arrows of righteousness standing behind the woman , who was wearing a loosely tied headdress and holding the hand of her son crouching next to her . one of the masked men demanded the withdrawal of all of germany 's approximately 3,000 troops in the relatively stable north of afghanistan , where it commands the international security assistance force , within 10 days .

" we are part of a global danger zone , " he said .
" in times when we were not affected , we did not succumb to the illusion that that we were not threatened like the british , the spaniards or others , " he said in reference to the london and madrid bombings . an alarming position wolfgang bosbach , the interior expert for the conservative cdu / csu group in the bundestag and a party colleague of chancellor angela merkel , said german troops ' mission in the north of afghanistan and the deployment of german tornado reconnaissance jets in the south would continue despite the threats . " we in germany are in a persistent and alarming position in regard to this menace , and we also know that foreign policy decisions can change the security situation in germany , " bosbach said in an interview with the rheinsiche post newspaper published on monday .
" but it would be a major mistake if we were to stay out of the fight against international terror .
therefore , the security position will not change and neither will the decision on the tornado deployment in afghanistan . "
the bundestag decided on friday to deploy six tornado jets to provide reconnaissance assistance to nato troops in southern afghanistan ahead of an expected spring offensive from taliban fighters . peter struck , a former defense minister and currently leader of the social democrats in the german parliament , announced that the bundeswehr deployment in afghanistan would continue " at least for another decade . " " it must be clear to everybody that the reconstruction of the country is only possible if the taliban are defeated , " said struck in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper . berlin crisis team working on release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis team works on finding and freeing the hostages meanwhile , the german foreign ministry 's crisis team continued to work on the release of the two german hostages kidnapped in iraq .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on the weekend that everything was being done to secure the release of berlin-born hannelore marianne k. and her adult son . steinmeier said the crisis team believed that the kidnappers have criminal intent and that they are holding the hostages for ransom and for an ideological reason . the 61-year-old woman and her son were seized on feb .
6 by armed men who burst into their family home in baghdad .
a video of them was released over the weekend , showing the woman , who is married to an iraqi professor , begging for her and her son 's life . " i 'm asking you to help me , " she sobbed in the video broadcast .
" we 're germans as well .
these people want to kill my son before my eyes and then kill me .
i do n't want to die like this , " she said in german . the video showed three masked militants of a little-known group calling itself the brigade of the arrows of righteousness standing behind the woman , who was wearing a loosely tied headdress and holding the hand of her son crouching next to her . one of the masked men demanded the withdrawal of all of germany 's approximately 3,000 troops in the relatively stable north of afghanistan , where it commands the international security assistance force , within 10 days .
" otherwise , " he said , " you will not even see one corpse for these two agents . " al qaeda web site broadcasts terror threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new jets were just approved for the mission the video 's release was followed by a threat broadcast on an al qaeda linked website which warned germany and austria of retribution if they did not pull their troops out of afghanistan . a masked man read out a statement in the video message , posted on the so-called voice of the caliphate web site in arabic with german subtitles , saying : " germany 's participation in the us war on islam and muslims will lead only to ... endangering germany itself .
we wonder where germany 's interest lies in throwing 2,750 troops -lrb- to afghanistan -rrb- ... to fight in defense of the lies of -lrb- president george w. -rrb-
bush and his gang . " as the flags of germany and austria appeared in front of a burning background , the man added : " in standing by the united states ... you have provoked those whom you call terrorists to target you . " also on sunday , a prominent egyptian islamist sheikh osama mustafa hassan nasr , known as abu omar al-masri , called sunday on the militants to release the german hostages . " i plead with you - for the sake of allah - to immediately free the two captives , " al-masri told german news agency dpa , in a message directed at the militants . prominent cleric urges militants to free germans al-masri , the former imam of a mosque in milan , said he saw the video .
al-masri himself was reportedly kidnapped in italy and then taken to cairo in 2004 .
he was released briefly and detained by egyptian authorities as a terrorist suspect , and was recently released . " i am your brother in allah , who was kidnapped from the streets of milan on 27 february 2003 by cia agents , following campaigns where i condemned the injustice of the us state department towards the afghan and iraqi people , " he said in his message . al-masri , who in his own words spent " four years in captivity , -lrb- and -rrb- imprisonment , " urged the kidnappers not to kill the mother and her son . " what are the german mother and the son guilty of ?
what have they got to do with the foreign policy of their country ? " he said , adding that muslims in the west " face troubles " and that killing the german citizens will have even more negative effects . " have mercy on your -lrb- muslim -rrb- brothers and let go of the german mother and her son , " he added . dw staff -lrb- nda , jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de islamist group warns germany , austria of attacks an islamist group urged germany and austria in a video to withdraw troops from afghanistan to prevent attacks against the two nations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.03.2007 book tells little-known tale of revolutionary condom-maker großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hard at work making condoms at fromm 's factory in 1935 in germany , the name fromm is to condoms what hoover is to vacuum cleaners .
but it 's only now that the story of the man behind the brand has come to light with a new book on jewish entrepreneur julius fromm . they 've been called french letters and english raincoats , but in fact , the world 's oldest branded condom came from germany .
launched by a jewish entrepreneur in berlin shortly after the first world war , " fromms " are still no. 2 on the german condom market - but until now , their inventor had been languishing in obscurity . now in a new book , " fromms - how julius f. fell prey to german robbers , " authors götz aly and michael sontheimer set the record straight by exploring the life and times of a man who changed german sexual habits for good . tapping into the zeitgeist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julius fromm julius fromm was born in 1883 in konin , in what was then russia .
when he was 10 years old , his family left the poverty of the shtetl and moved to berlin in search of a better life .
his parents died young , and he and his six siblings were left to fend for themselves . along with many other east european jews in turn-of-the-century berlin , the fromm family initially earned their living by rolling cigarettes .
but as manual cigarette production was gradually ousted by mechanization , the entrepreneurial julius busied himself with evening classes in chemistry . like every inspired businessman , julius fromm had what one might be tempted to describe as a natural feel for the zeitgeist , and as the first world war raged across europe , germany experienced a perceptible shift in sexual values . " germany in some ways had the most liberal sexual culture in the world in the early 20th century , " said city university of new york 's dagmar herzog , author of " sex after fascism . "
" -lrb- this was thanks to -rrb- a combination of earthy , uncomplicated popular attitudes at the grassroots level , and courageous activism on the part of medical professionals in a wider context which included the disinhibiting impact of the war . " the latex revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany became more sexually liberal in the 1920s so the times were a changing , and more liberal approaches to morals were eroding the traditional link between sexuality and reproduction .
julius fromm seized the moment and decided the future was latex - an odorless , seamless , transparent natural rubber , and a lot smoother than pig gut . after centuries of makeshift contraception involving animal intestines and even lambskin and tortoise shells , the first modern condom had been invented in the mid-19th century by charles goodyear .
made of re-usable vulcanized rubber , it resembled a bicycle tire with bulky seams , so , perhaps not surprisingly , it never quite took off .
but the rapid spread of sexually transmitted diseases during the war had made condoms an indispensable accessory - while the uncertain times left governments reluctantly agreeable to approving a new way of containing the birth rate . in 1916 , julius fromm patented the titillatingly titled fromm 's act .
his manufacturing technique involved dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution , enabling the production of thinner condoms with no seams .
he did a roaring trade , with every packet containing a folded slip of paper on which was printed : " please discreetly hand me a packet of three fromm 's act , " to be silently presented to the salesperson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fromms condoms have come a long way mass production began in 1922 , and amid the sexual licentiousness of the weimar republic , fromm was soon doing well enough to open international branches from antwerp to auckland .
by 1930 , he had commissioned a flagship factory from the avant-garde jewish architects arthur korn and siegfried weitzman in the berlin suburb of köpenick - a boxy building in the " neue sachlichkeit " style that was as progressive as fromm 's product . but unlike the product , the bubble soon burst .
it was n't long before the nazis ' aryanization policy was in full swing .
in 1938 , on the grounds that his supplies of rubber were needed for the war effort , fromm was forced to sell his business at a fraction of its value to baroness elisabeth von epenstein , none other than hermann göring 's godmother .
in return , hitler 's luxury-loving second-in-command was able to add to his collection of teutonic kitsch two castles , burg mautendorf in austria and burg veldenstein , where göring had grown up .
a year later , fromm emigrated to london , where he died on may 12 , 1945 , four days after the allied victory over germany . fate unknown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish business was plundered in the third reich as an example of the social mobility of jewish immigrants in the early 20th century , fromm 's story is a typical one , though until now an unknown one .
that 's not surprising , according to christoph kreutzmüller , who oversees the research project " exclusion and survival strategies : small and medium-sized jewish businesses in berlin 1930 to 1940 " at berlin 's humboldt university .
the fate of most jewish businesses remains largely unknown , he explained . " there is maybe some dim recollection of the aryanization of the large companies and stereotypical branches such as tailoring , banking and department stores , " he said , citing the example of the wertheim department store and the private bank mendelssohn and co .
" but there is no information whatsoever about the small industries , or the pharmacies - the majority of those in berlin being owned by jews - let alone the jewish egg-trade , even though 98 percent of all egg-traders were jewish prior to 1935 . " in recent years , many of germany 's big-name companies have commissioned investigations into their nazi past , including media giant bertelsmann , deutsche bank and degussa , to name but a few .
while their findings go some way to establishing the full extent of hitler 's plundering of germany 's jewish community , these investigations ultimately uncover just the tip of the iceberg . " no jewish enterprise was left unharmed .
they were all liquidated or taken over by non-jews , " stressed kreutzmüller .
" however , we do n't even know how many jewish enterprises there were in berlin in 1933 - but probably at least 20,000 medium-sized companies , and thousands more doing small trading on markets or streets which we will never know of .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.03.2007 book tells little-known tale of revolutionary condom-maker großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hard at work making condoms at fromm 's factory in 1935 in germany , the name fromm is to condoms what hoover is to vacuum cleaners .
but it 's only now that the story of the man behind the brand has come to light with a new book on jewish entrepreneur julius fromm . they 've been called french letters and english raincoats , but in fact , the world 's oldest branded condom came from germany .
launched by a jewish entrepreneur in berlin shortly after the first world war , " fromms " are still no. 2 on the german condom market - but until now , their inventor had been languishing in obscurity . now in a new book , " fromms - how julius f. fell prey to german robbers , " authors götz aly and michael sontheimer set the record straight by exploring the life and times of a man who changed german sexual habits for good . tapping into the zeitgeist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julius fromm julius fromm was born in 1883 in konin , in what was then russia .
when he was 10 years old , his family left the poverty of the shtetl and moved to berlin in search of a better life .
his parents died young , and he and his six siblings were left to fend for themselves . along with many other east european jews in turn-of-the-century berlin , the fromm family initially earned their living by rolling cigarettes .
but as manual cigarette production was gradually ousted by mechanization , the entrepreneurial julius busied himself with evening classes in chemistry . like every inspired businessman , julius fromm had what one might be tempted to describe as a natural feel for the zeitgeist , and as the first world war raged across europe , germany experienced a perceptible shift in sexual values . " germany in some ways had the most liberal sexual culture in the world in the early 20th century , " said city university of new york 's dagmar herzog , author of " sex after fascism . "
" -lrb- this was thanks to -rrb- a combination of earthy , uncomplicated popular attitudes at the grassroots level , and courageous activism on the part of medical professionals in a wider context which included the disinhibiting impact of the war . " the latex revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany became more sexually liberal in the 1920s so the times were a changing , and more liberal approaches to morals were eroding the traditional link between sexuality and reproduction .
julius fromm seized the moment and decided the future was latex - an odorless , seamless , transparent natural rubber , and a lot smoother than pig gut . after centuries of makeshift contraception involving animal intestines and even lambskin and tortoise shells , the first modern condom had been invented in the mid-19th century by charles goodyear .
made of re-usable vulcanized rubber , it resembled a bicycle tire with bulky seams , so , perhaps not surprisingly , it never quite took off .
but the rapid spread of sexually transmitted diseases during the war had made condoms an indispensable accessory - while the uncertain times left governments reluctantly agreeable to approving a new way of containing the birth rate . in 1916 , julius fromm patented the titillatingly titled fromm 's act .
his manufacturing technique involved dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution , enabling the production of thinner condoms with no seams .
he did a roaring trade , with every packet containing a folded slip of paper on which was printed : " please discreetly hand me a packet of three fromm 's act , " to be silently presented to the salesperson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fromms condoms have come a long way mass production began in 1922 , and amid the sexual licentiousness of the weimar republic , fromm was soon doing well enough to open international branches from antwerp to auckland .
by 1930 , he had commissioned a flagship factory from the avant-garde jewish architects arthur korn and siegfried weitzman in the berlin suburb of köpenick - a boxy building in the " neue sachlichkeit " style that was as progressive as fromm 's product . but unlike the product , the bubble soon burst .
it was n't long before the nazis ' aryanization policy was in full swing .
in 1938 , on the grounds that his supplies of rubber were needed for the war effort , fromm was forced to sell his business at a fraction of its value to baroness elisabeth von epenstein , none other than hermann göring 's godmother .

but it 's only now that the story of the man behind the brand has come to light with a new book on jewish entrepreneur julius fromm . they 've been called french letters and english raincoats , but in fact , the world 's oldest branded condom came from germany .
launched by a jewish entrepreneur in berlin shortly after the first world war , " fromms " are still no. 2 on the german condom market - but until now , their inventor had been languishing in obscurity . now in a new book , " fromms - how julius f. fell prey to german robbers , " authors götz aly and michael sontheimer set the record straight by exploring the life and times of a man who changed german sexual habits for good . tapping into the zeitgeist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julius fromm julius fromm was born in 1883 in konin , in what was then russia .
when he was 10 years old , his family left the poverty of the shtetl and moved to berlin in search of a better life .
his parents died young , and he and his six siblings were left to fend for themselves . along with many other east european jews in turn-of-the-century berlin , the fromm family initially earned their living by rolling cigarettes .
but as manual cigarette production was gradually ousted by mechanization , the entrepreneurial julius busied himself with evening classes in chemistry . like every inspired businessman , julius fromm had what one might be tempted to describe as a natural feel for the zeitgeist , and as the first world war raged across europe , germany experienced a perceptible shift in sexual values . " germany in some ways had the most liberal sexual culture in the world in the early 20th century , " said city university of new york 's dagmar herzog , author of " sex after fascism . "
" -lrb- this was thanks to -rrb- a combination of earthy , uncomplicated popular attitudes at the grassroots level , and courageous activism on the part of medical professionals in a wider context which included the disinhibiting impact of the war . " the latex revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany became more sexually liberal in the 1920s so the times were a changing , and more liberal approaches to morals were eroding the traditional link between sexuality and reproduction .
julius fromm seized the moment and decided the future was latex - an odorless , seamless , transparent natural rubber , and a lot smoother than pig gut . after centuries of makeshift contraception involving animal intestines and even lambskin and tortoise shells , the first modern condom had been invented in the mid-19th century by charles goodyear .
made of re-usable vulcanized rubber , it resembled a bicycle tire with bulky seams , so , perhaps not surprisingly , it never quite took off .
but the rapid spread of sexually transmitted diseases during the war had made condoms an indispensable accessory - while the uncertain times left governments reluctantly agreeable to approving a new way of containing the birth rate . in 1916 , julius fromm patented the titillatingly titled fromm 's act .
his manufacturing technique involved dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution , enabling the production of thinner condoms with no seams .
he did a roaring trade , with every packet containing a folded slip of paper on which was printed : " please discreetly hand me a packet of three fromm 's act , " to be silently presented to the salesperson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fromms condoms have come a long way mass production began in 1922 , and amid the sexual licentiousness of the weimar republic , fromm was soon doing well enough to open international branches from antwerp to auckland .
by 1930 , he had commissioned a flagship factory from the avant-garde jewish architects arthur korn and siegfried weitzman in the berlin suburb of köpenick - a boxy building in the " neue sachlichkeit " style that was as progressive as fromm 's product . but unlike the product , the bubble soon burst .
it was n't long before the nazis ' aryanization policy was in full swing .
in 1938 , on the grounds that his supplies of rubber were needed for the war effort , fromm was forced to sell his business at a fraction of its value to baroness elisabeth von epenstein , none other than hermann göring 's godmother .
in return , hitler 's luxury-loving second-in-command was able to add to his collection of teutonic kitsch two castles , burg mautendorf in austria and burg veldenstein , where göring had grown up .
a year later , fromm emigrated to london , where he died on may 12 , 1945 , four days after the allied victory over germany . fate unknown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish business was plundered in the third reich as an example of the social mobility of jewish immigrants in the early 20th century , fromm 's story is a typical one , though until now an unknown one .

but it 's only now that the story of the man behind the brand has come to light with a new book on jewish entrepreneur julius fromm . they 've been called french letters and english raincoats , but in fact , the world 's oldest branded condom came from germany .
launched by a jewish entrepreneur in berlin shortly after the first world war , " fromms " are still no. 2 on the german condom market - but until now , their inventor had been languishing in obscurity . now in a new book , " fromms - how julius f. fell prey to german robbers , " authors götz aly and michael sontheimer set the record straight by exploring the life and times of a man who changed german sexual habits for good . tapping into the zeitgeist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julius fromm julius fromm was born in 1883 in konin , in what was then russia .
when he was 10 years old , his family left the poverty of the shtetl and moved to berlin in search of a better life .
his parents died young , and he and his six siblings were left to fend for themselves . along with many other east european jews in turn-of-the-century berlin , the fromm family initially earned their living by rolling cigarettes .
but as manual cigarette production was gradually ousted by mechanization , the entrepreneurial julius busied himself with evening classes in chemistry . like every inspired businessman , julius fromm had what one might be tempted to describe as a natural feel for the zeitgeist , and as the first world war raged across europe , germany experienced a perceptible shift in sexual values . " germany in some ways had the most liberal sexual culture in the world in the early 20th century , " said city university of new york 's dagmar herzog , author of " sex after fascism . "
" -lrb- this was thanks to -rrb- a combination of earthy , uncomplicated popular attitudes at the grassroots level , and courageous activism on the part of medical professionals in a wider context which included the disinhibiting impact of the war . " the latex revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany became more sexually liberal in the 1920s so the times were a changing , and more liberal approaches to morals were eroding the traditional link between sexuality and reproduction .
julius fromm seized the moment and decided the future was latex - an odorless , seamless , transparent natural rubber , and a lot smoother than pig gut . after centuries of makeshift contraception involving animal intestines and even lambskin and tortoise shells , the first modern condom had been invented in the mid-19th century by charles goodyear .
made of re-usable vulcanized rubber , it resembled a bicycle tire with bulky seams , so , perhaps not surprisingly , it never quite took off .
but the rapid spread of sexually transmitted diseases during the war had made condoms an indispensable accessory - while the uncertain times left governments reluctantly agreeable to approving a new way of containing the birth rate . in 1916 , julius fromm patented the titillatingly titled fromm 's act .
his manufacturing technique involved dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution , enabling the production of thinner condoms with no seams .
he did a roaring trade , with every packet containing a folded slip of paper on which was printed : " please discreetly hand me a packet of three fromm 's act , " to be silently presented to the salesperson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fromms condoms have come a long way mass production began in 1922 , and amid the sexual licentiousness of the weimar republic , fromm was soon doing well enough to open international branches from antwerp to auckland .
by 1930 , he had commissioned a flagship factory from the avant-garde jewish architects arthur korn and siegfried weitzman in the berlin suburb of köpenick - a boxy building in the " neue sachlichkeit " style that was as progressive as fromm 's product . but unlike the product , the bubble soon burst .
it was n't long before the nazis ' aryanization policy was in full swing .
in 1938 , on the grounds that his supplies of rubber were needed for the war effort , fromm was forced to sell his business at a fraction of its value to baroness elisabeth von epenstein , none other than hermann göring 's godmother .
in return , hitler 's luxury-loving second-in-command was able to add to his collection of teutonic kitsch two castles , burg mautendorf in austria and burg veldenstein , where göring had grown up .
a year later , fromm emigrated to london , where he died on may 12 , 1945 , four days after the allied victory over germany . fate unknown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish business was plundered in the third reich as an example of the social mobility of jewish immigrants in the early 20th century , fromm 's story is a typical one , though until now an unknown one .
that 's not surprising , according to christoph kreutzmüller , who oversees the research project " exclusion and survival strategies : small and medium-sized jewish businesses in berlin 1930 to 1940 " at berlin 's humboldt university .
the fate of most jewish businesses remains largely unknown , he explained . " there is maybe some dim recollection of the aryanization of the large companies and stereotypical branches such as tailoring , banking and department stores , " he said , citing the example of the wertheim department store and the private bank mendelssohn and co .
" but there is no information whatsoever about the small industries , or the pharmacies - the majority of those in berlin being owned by jews - let alone the jewish egg-trade , even though 98 percent of all egg-traders were jewish prior to 1935 . " in recent years , many of germany 's big-name companies have commissioned investigations into their nazi past , including media giant bertelsmann , deutsche bank and degussa , to name but a few .
while their findings go some way to establishing the full extent of hitler 's plundering of germany 's jewish community , these investigations ultimately uncover just the tip of the iceberg . " no jewish enterprise was left unharmed .
they were all liquidated or taken over by non-jews , " stressed kreutzmüller .
" however , we do n't even know how many jewish enterprises there were in berlin in 1933 - but probably at least 20,000 medium-sized companies , and thousands more doing small trading on markets or streets which we will never know of .

" the situation is characterized by gross and systematic violations of human rights and grave breaches of international law , " the report said .
" war crimes and crimes against humanity continue across the region .
killing of civilians remains widespread , including in large-scale attacks .
rape and sexual violence are widespread and systematic .
torture continues . " as violations and abuses continue unabated , a climate of impunity prevails , " it added . international condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said the world needed to speak out international reaction was swift following the report 's release . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , representing the eu at the un human rights council , said the world would have to act on the report 's description of " the ongoing , cruel human rights abuses . "

" the situation is characterized by gross and systematic violations of human rights and grave breaches of international law , " the report said .
" war crimes and crimes against humanity continue across the region .
killing of civilians remains widespread , including in large-scale attacks .
rape and sexual violence are widespread and systematic .
torture continues . " as violations and abuses continue unabated , a climate of impunity prevails , " it added . international condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said the world needed to speak out international reaction was swift following the report 's release . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , representing the eu at the un human rights council , said the world would have to act on the report 's description of " the ongoing , cruel human rights abuses . "
" the international community wo n't remain silent , " steinmeier told the associated press , without adding further details . no sudanese cooperation the un estimates at least 200,000 people have been killed in darfur with a further 2.5 million displaced . the conflict and influx of refugees has also spilled over into neighboring chad , exacerbating existing tensions . williams and her team were unable to carry out investigations in darfur itself , as khartoum refused to grant visas , saying some of the team 's members were " biased " against sudan - a charge repeated on sunday by sudan 's justice minister while en route to geneva . last month , the international criminal court in the hague named a sudanese government minister and a janjaweed militia leader as the first suspects prosecutors want to try for war crimes in the darfur conflict . darfur requires unified approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former sudanese interior minister ahmed muhammed harun was charged with war crimes the report urged the international community to adopt a " fully unified approach " in addressing darfur , and to help convene a national conference on peace , human rights and a common vision for sudan . it also called for the implementation of measures such as travel bans and the freezing of assets for those identified as rights violators . turning to actions on the ground , it demanded that sudan " end the targeting of civilians in darfur , cease all support for janjaweed militia forces , and proceed with the disarmament , demobilization and reintegration of such forces . " " witnesses , victims and observers we met repeatedly confirmed joint action between government forces and armed militia in assaulting civilian targets in darfur , " the report said . rebels share responsibility the mission said rebel groups in the region shared some responsibility for the rights abuses , including rape and torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions have been displaced by violence in sudan 's darfur region khartoum 's provision of arms to the janjaweed and other militias is a key factor behind growing tensions between tribal groups and communities , victims and witnesses told members of the mission . the report also said the un general assembly should compile a blacklist of foreign companies that have an " adverse impact " on the human rights situation in darfur . the darfur report kicked off a three-week session of the un 's human rights council , which replaced the human rights commission in 2006 . the darfur mission was set up by a rare consensus of the council 's 47 members following hard bargaining by western , african and islamic nations during a special session last december - the first time the council had specifically focused on darfur . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de international court names first darfur war crimes suspects the international criminal court in the hague on tuesday named a sudanese minister and a janjaweed militia leader as the first war crimes suspects in the darfur conflict .

yet the recent european interest in climate change has the german auto industry worried about its image . germany has no intention of slowing down its famously speedy drivers .
politicians and carmakers criticized the suggestion by european union environment minister that germany should introduce a speed limit on its autobahns . the speed limit idea is " a secondary front and a trivialization of the climate problem , " according to german environment minister sigmar gabriel . the powerful german automobile industry federation -lrb- vda -rrb- said in a statement that germany needed " no coaching " from brussels on how to protect the climate " above all when the proposals are only symbolic . " speed wastes energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's stavros dimas called for german speed limits eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said germany should impose speed limits on its highways as a way to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
the german transport ministry has rejected the idea , saying it would have a negligible effect on greenhouse gas emissions . " there are many areas in which we senselessly waste energy and harm the environment , " dimas said in an interview published in the bild newspaper 's sunday edition . he suggested speed limits as a good start .
in germany , some stretches of highway have speed limits but other sections allow drivers to go as fast as they like . " speed limits are useful for many reasons and are the order of the day in most of the eu 's 27 member nations and the united states , " dimas said .
" strangely enough , it is only in germany where they are controversial . " german social democratic party leader peter struck warned against " climate hysteria " where climate change is allowed to become the only thing on the agenda .
no one cares about preserving jobs , struck said in a bild interview sunday . but dimas said germany has a special responsibility towards curbing greenhouse gas emissions , which are widely believed to be responsible for global warming . " a breakthrough will only be possible if the eu members take steps to ensure that climate protection measures are feasible and financially sustainable - particularly germany as an important industrial nation , " he said . car industry concerned about image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers got the eu to water down its emissions limits the german car industry showed its clout last month , when the eu presented less strict co2 emissions standards .
dimas had originally wanted tougher levels for cars sold in europe but backed down after pressure from german automobile manufacturers , which said they would be unfairly targeted . but german car makers are increasingly concerned about their image , a recent shake-up at their lobbying group has shown .
long-time president of the vda , bernd gottschalk , resigned unexpectedly on saturday . automakers were reportedly unhappy at how their lobby initially handled the eu climate debate .
the industry felt the vda reacted too slowly and not forcefully enough , according to der spiegel magazine . there was also criticism that gottschalk had n't done a good job of explaining the what the auto industry has been doing up until now to help the environment .

yet the recent european interest in climate change has the german auto industry worried about its image . germany has no intention of slowing down its famously speedy drivers .
politicians and carmakers criticized the suggestion by european union environment minister that germany should introduce a speed limit on its autobahns . the speed limit idea is " a secondary front and a trivialization of the climate problem , " according to german environment minister sigmar gabriel . the powerful german automobile industry federation -lrb- vda -rrb- said in a statement that germany needed " no coaching " from brussels on how to protect the climate " above all when the proposals are only symbolic . " speed wastes energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's stavros dimas called for german speed limits eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said germany should impose speed limits on its highways as a way to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
the german transport ministry has rejected the idea , saying it would have a negligible effect on greenhouse gas emissions . " there are many areas in which we senselessly waste energy and harm the environment , " dimas said in an interview published in the bild newspaper 's sunday edition . he suggested speed limits as a good start .
in germany , some stretches of highway have speed limits but other sections allow drivers to go as fast as they like . " speed limits are useful for many reasons and are the order of the day in most of the eu 's 27 member nations and the united states , " dimas said .
" strangely enough , it is only in germany where they are controversial . " german social democratic party leader peter struck warned against " climate hysteria " where climate change is allowed to become the only thing on the agenda .
no one cares about preserving jobs , struck said in a bild interview sunday . but dimas said germany has a special responsibility towards curbing greenhouse gas emissions , which are widely believed to be responsible for global warming . " a breakthrough will only be possible if the eu members take steps to ensure that climate protection measures are feasible and financially sustainable - particularly germany as an important industrial nation , " he said . car industry concerned about image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers got the eu to water down its emissions limits the german car industry showed its clout last month , when the eu presented less strict co2 emissions standards .
dimas had originally wanted tougher levels for cars sold in europe but backed down after pressure from german automobile manufacturers , which said they would be unfairly targeted . but german car makers are increasingly concerned about their image , a recent shake-up at their lobbying group has shown .
long-time president of the vda , bernd gottschalk , resigned unexpectedly on saturday . automakers were reportedly unhappy at how their lobby initially handled the eu climate debate .
the industry felt the vda reacted too slowly and not forcefully enough , according to der spiegel magazine . there was also criticism that gottschalk had n't done a good job of explaining the what the auto industry has been doing up until now to help the environment .
a replacement for gottschalk has not yet been made . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urged to take lead on battling climate change the european union will seek to thrash out a common policy in fighting climate change , with plans to set tough targets for cutting carbon dioxide emissions .
-lrb- 07.03.2007 -rrb- eu backs plans for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions eu environment ministers gave unanimous support to plans for cuts in greenhouse gases of as much as 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels .

his decision to bow out at the age of 74 is the end of an era as younger rivals on the left and right battle it out to take over . the veteran conservative said in a televised address on sunday that he would stand down in may after the expected second round of the election and would then seek to serve the country " in a different fashion . " " i will not ask for your votes for a new mandate , " he said .
" in a different manner , but with the same enthusiasm and passion to act on your behalf , i shall continue to fight our battles - the battles i have fought all my life - for justice , progress , peace and the grandeur of france , " he said . chirac began his political career in 1962 as an advisor to prime minister georges pompidou , and had his first cabinet post in 1967 .
he served two straight mandates as president , was twice prime minister and spent 18 years as mayor of paris .
in 2002 he won re-election with the support of left-wing voters , anxious to keep out far-right leader jean-marie le pen who stunned the country by qualifying for the decisive second round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen said he was gladf to be rid of his enemy le pen said chirac was " the worst president in the history of france .
i am delighted to be losing my best enemy .
the proof that he has led the country to disaster is that not a single candidate ... claims his legacy . " proud of his work in 2003 , chirac led opposition to the us-led war on iraq , earning acclaim in many parts of the world and sparking a bitter diplomatic quarrel with us president george w. bush . " president bush wishes president chirac all the best as he enters life after politics , " white house national security council spokesman gordon johndroe said after chirac 's announcement .
" the united states and france have been and will remain steadfast partners and allies , " he added . though bush 's fortunes have slumped because of the war , chirac 's also tumbled in 2005 , when france rejected the eu 's proposed constitution , riots hit the city suburbs , and he was hospitalized with a " vascular incident . " chirac said that he was " proud of the work which we have carried out together " - citing in particular improvements for the elderly and the handicapped , reforms of the pension system and reductions in crime and unemployment . and he called on the country to defend its values in the world .
" france is not a country like others .
it has particular responsibilities , the legacy of its history and the universal values it helped create , " he said .
still unclear which candidate he backs as expected , chirac gave no sign in his 10-minute address whether he intends to endorse the right-wing candidate for the presidency , interior minister nicolas sarkozy , a former protege who heads the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- . sarkozy , 52 , has a narrow lead in polls over socialist segolene royal but now faces a new challenge from the centrist candidate francois bayrou , head of the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , whose ratings have surged in the last month .

sarkozy was given 29 percent .
the two leading contenders qualify for a run-off on may 6 .
misgivings over legacy while misgivings remain about chirac 's legacy , he commands widespread affection and even political opponents praise his defense of french interests in the world . " it is a historic moment because a page of history is about to turn .
a new page is about to open and the french themselves are going to write it , " said royal . bayrou , who served as education minister under chirac from 1995 to 1997 , said that " on foreign policy he was an honorable voice , and a great voice at the moments when france needed one " - a clear reference to chirac 's defiance of the united states . however socialist former prime minister laurent fabius said the chirac era had been " wasted . " " his long presidency has lost france a lot of time .
this is what strikes me most : in relation to the major problems facing france and europe , a presidency of wasted time , " he said . chirac will officially leave his post on may 16 , when his mandate expires .

his decision to bow out at the age of 74 is the end of an era as younger rivals on the left and right battle it out to take over . the veteran conservative said in a televised address on sunday that he would stand down in may after the expected second round of the election and would then seek to serve the country " in a different fashion . " " i will not ask for your votes for a new mandate , " he said .
" in a different manner , but with the same enthusiasm and passion to act on your behalf , i shall continue to fight our battles - the battles i have fought all my life - for justice , progress , peace and the grandeur of france , " he said . chirac began his political career in 1962 as an advisor to prime minister georges pompidou , and had his first cabinet post in 1967 .
he served two straight mandates as president , was twice prime minister and spent 18 years as mayor of paris .
in 2002 he won re-election with the support of left-wing voters , anxious to keep out far-right leader jean-marie le pen who stunned the country by qualifying for the decisive second round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen said he was gladf to be rid of his enemy le pen said chirac was " the worst president in the history of france .

" president bush wishes president chirac all the best as he enters life after politics , " white house national security council spokesman gordon johndroe said after chirac 's announcement .
" the united states and france have been and will remain steadfast partners and allies , " he added . though bush 's fortunes have slumped because of the war , chirac 's also tumbled in 2005 , when france rejected the eu 's proposed constitution , riots hit the city suburbs , and he was hospitalized with a " vascular incident . " chirac said that he was " proud of the work which we have carried out together " - citing in particular improvements for the elderly and the handicapped , reforms of the pension system and reductions in crime and unemployment . and he called on the country to defend its values in the world .
" france is not a country like others .
it has particular responsibilities , the legacy of its history and the universal values it helped create , " he said .

yet the recent european interest in climate change has the german auto industry worried about its image . germany has no intention of slowing down its famously speedy drivers .
politicians and carmakers criticized the suggestion by european union environment minister that germany should introduce a speed limit on its autobahns . the speed limit idea is " a secondary front and a trivialization of the climate problem , " according to german environment minister sigmar gabriel . the powerful german automobile industry federation -lrb- vda -rrb- said in a statement that germany needed " no coaching " from brussels on how to protect the climate " above all when the proposals are only symbolic . " speed wastes energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's stavros dimas called for german speed limits eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said germany should impose speed limits on its highways as a way to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
the german transport ministry has rejected the idea , saying it would have a negligible effect on greenhouse gas emissions . " there are many areas in which we senselessly waste energy and harm the environment , " dimas said in an interview published in the bild newspaper 's sunday edition . he suggested speed limits as a good start .
in germany , some stretches of highway have speed limits but other sections allow drivers to go as fast as they like . " speed limits are useful for many reasons and are the order of the day in most of the eu 's 27 member nations and the united states , " dimas said .
" strangely enough , it is only in germany where they are controversial . " german social democratic party leader peter struck warned against " climate hysteria " where climate change is allowed to become the only thing on the agenda .
no one cares about preserving jobs , struck said in a bild interview sunday . but dimas said germany has a special responsibility towards curbing greenhouse gas emissions , which are widely believed to be responsible for global warming . " a breakthrough will only be possible if the eu members take steps to ensure that climate protection measures are feasible and financially sustainable - particularly germany as an important industrial nation , " he said . car industry concerned about image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers got the eu to water down its emissions limits the german car industry showed its clout last month , when the eu presented less strict co2 emissions standards .
dimas had originally wanted tougher levels for cars sold in europe but backed down after pressure from german automobile manufacturers , which said they would be unfairly targeted . but german car makers are increasingly concerned about their image , a recent shake-up at their lobbying group has shown .
long-time president of the vda , bernd gottschalk , resigned unexpectedly on saturday . automakers were reportedly unhappy at how their lobby initially handled the eu climate debate .
the industry felt the vda reacted too slowly and not forcefully enough , according to der spiegel magazine . there was also criticism that gottschalk had n't done a good job of explaining the what the auto industry has been doing up until now to help the environment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.03.2007 president chirac bows out of french politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unclear what chirac will be remebered for president jacques chirac has announced that he will not stand as a candidate in the looming presidential election , ending a career of more than 40 years at the top of french politics . chirac has been president for 12 years and he made his name around the world by spearheading opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq .
his decision to bow out at the age of 74 is the end of an era as younger rivals on the left and right battle it out to take over . the veteran conservative said in a televised address on sunday that he would stand down in may after the expected second round of the election and would then seek to serve the country " in a different fashion . " " i will not ask for your votes for a new mandate , " he said .
" in a different manner , but with the same enthusiasm and passion to act on your behalf , i shall continue to fight our battles - the battles i have fought all my life - for justice , progress , peace and the grandeur of france , " he said . chirac began his political career in 1962 as an advisor to prime minister georges pompidou , and had his first cabinet post in 1967 .
he served two straight mandates as president , was twice prime minister and spent 18 years as mayor of paris .
in 2002 he won re-election with the support of left-wing voters , anxious to keep out far-right leader jean-marie le pen who stunned the country by qualifying for the decisive second round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen said he was gladf to be rid of his enemy le pen said chirac was " the worst president in the history of france .
i am delighted to be losing my best enemy .
the proof that he has led the country to disaster is that not a single candidate ... claims his legacy . " proud of his work in 2003 , chirac led opposition to the us-led war on iraq , earning acclaim in many parts of the world and sparking a bitter diplomatic quarrel with us president george w. bush . " president bush wishes president chirac all the best as he enters life after politics , " white house national security council spokesman gordon johndroe said after chirac 's announcement .
" the united states and france have been and will remain steadfast partners and allies , " he added . though bush 's fortunes have slumped because of the war , chirac 's also tumbled in 2005 , when france rejected the eu 's proposed constitution , riots hit the city suburbs , and he was hospitalized with a " vascular incident . " chirac said that he was " proud of the work which we have carried out together " - citing in particular improvements for the elderly and the handicapped , reforms of the pension system and reductions in crime and unemployment . and he called on the country to defend its values in the world .
" france is not a country like others .
it has particular responsibilities , the legacy of its history and the universal values it helped create , " he said .
still unclear which candidate he backs as expected , chirac gave no sign in his 10-minute address whether he intends to endorse the right-wing candidate for the presidency , interior minister nicolas sarkozy , a former protege who heads the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- . sarkozy , 52 , has a narrow lead in polls over socialist segolene royal but now faces a new challenge from the centrist candidate francois bayrou , head of the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , whose ratings have surged in the last month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy -lrb- r . -rrb- faces a challenge from within as well as from royal -lrb- l . -rrb- a poll published in le journal du dimanche newspaper for the first time showed bayrou on the same score as royal - 23 percent - in the first round of the vote on april 22 .
sarkozy was given 29 percent .
the two leading contenders qualify for a run-off on may 6 .
misgivings over legacy while misgivings remain about chirac 's legacy , he commands widespread affection and even political opponents praise his defense of french interests in the world . " it is a historic moment because a page of history is about to turn .
a new page is about to open and the french themselves are going to write it , " said royal . bayrou , who served as education minister under chirac from 1995 to 1997 , said that " on foreign policy he was an honorable voice , and a great voice at the moments when france needed one " - a clear reference to chirac 's defiance of the united states . however socialist former prime minister laurent fabius said the chirac era had been " wasted . " " his long presidency has lost france a lot of time .
this is what strikes me most : in relation to the major problems facing france and europe , a presidency of wasted time , " he said . chirac will officially leave his post on may 16 , when his mandate expires .
he has indicated that he would like to chair an international foundation , promoting causes close to his heart such as the environment and non-european cultures . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de extremist le pen strikes chord in france , again for over 30 years , jean-marie le pen has campaigned at the top of french politics .
while labeled an anti-semite and rascist by some , he still commands enough support to add a dark dimension to the presidential election .

but it 's only now that the story of the man behind the brand has come to light with a new book on jewish entrepreneur julius fromm . they 've been called french letters and english raincoats , but in fact , the world 's oldest branded condom came from germany .
launched by a jewish entrepreneur in berlin shortly after the first world war , " fromms " are still no. 2 on the german condom market - but until now , their inventor had been languishing in obscurity . now in a new book , " fromms - how julius f. fell prey to german robbers , " authors götz aly and michael sontheimer set the record straight by exploring the life and times of a man who changed german sexual habits for good . tapping into the zeitgeist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julius fromm julius fromm was born in 1883 in konin , in what was then russia .
when he was 10 years old , his family left the poverty of the shtetl and moved to berlin in search of a better life .
his parents died young , and he and his six siblings were left to fend for themselves . along with many other east european jews in turn-of-the-century berlin , the fromm family initially earned their living by rolling cigarettes .
but as manual cigarette production was gradually ousted by mechanization , the entrepreneurial julius busied himself with evening classes in chemistry . like every inspired businessman , julius fromm had what one might be tempted to describe as a natural feel for the zeitgeist , and as the first world war raged across europe , germany experienced a perceptible shift in sexual values . " germany in some ways had the most liberal sexual culture in the world in the early 20th century , " said city university of new york 's dagmar herzog , author of " sex after fascism . "
" -lrb- this was thanks to -rrb- a combination of earthy , uncomplicated popular attitudes at the grassroots level , and courageous activism on the part of medical professionals in a wider context which included the disinhibiting impact of the war . " the latex revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany became more sexually liberal in the 1920s so the times were a changing , and more liberal approaches to morals were eroding the traditional link between sexuality and reproduction .
julius fromm seized the moment and decided the future was latex - an odorless , seamless , transparent natural rubber , and a lot smoother than pig gut . after centuries of makeshift contraception involving animal intestines and even lambskin and tortoise shells , the first modern condom had been invented in the mid-19th century by charles goodyear .
made of re-usable vulcanized rubber , it resembled a bicycle tire with bulky seams , so , perhaps not surprisingly , it never quite took off .
but the rapid spread of sexually transmitted diseases during the war had made condoms an indispensable accessory - while the uncertain times left governments reluctantly agreeable to approving a new way of containing the birth rate . in 1916 , julius fromm patented the titillatingly titled fromm 's act .
his manufacturing technique involved dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution , enabling the production of thinner condoms with no seams .
he did a roaring trade , with every packet containing a folded slip of paper on which was printed : " please discreetly hand me a packet of three fromm 's act , " to be silently presented to the salesperson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fromms condoms have come a long way mass production began in 1922 , and amid the sexual licentiousness of the weimar republic , fromm was soon doing well enough to open international branches from antwerp to auckland .
by 1930 , he had commissioned a flagship factory from the avant-garde jewish architects arthur korn and siegfried weitzman in the berlin suburb of köpenick - a boxy building in the " neue sachlichkeit " style that was as progressive as fromm 's product . but unlike the product , the bubble soon burst .
it was n't long before the nazis ' aryanization policy was in full swing .
in 1938 , on the grounds that his supplies of rubber were needed for the war effort , fromm was forced to sell his business at a fraction of its value to baroness elisabeth von epenstein , none other than hermann göring 's godmother .
in return , hitler 's luxury-loving second-in-command was able to add to his collection of teutonic kitsch two castles , burg mautendorf in austria and burg veldenstein , where göring had grown up .
a year later , fromm emigrated to london , where he died on may 12 , 1945 , four days after the allied victory over germany . fate unknown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish business was plundered in the third reich as an example of the social mobility of jewish immigrants in the early 20th century , fromm 's story is a typical one , though until now an unknown one .
that 's not surprising , according to christoph kreutzmüller , who oversees the research project " exclusion and survival strategies : small and medium-sized jewish businesses in berlin 1930 to 1940 " at berlin 's humboldt university .
the fate of most jewish businesses remains largely unknown , he explained . " there is maybe some dim recollection of the aryanization of the large companies and stereotypical branches such as tailoring , banking and department stores , " he said , citing the example of the wertheim department store and the private bank mendelssohn and co .
" but there is no information whatsoever about the small industries , or the pharmacies - the majority of those in berlin being owned by jews - let alone the jewish egg-trade , even though 98 percent of all egg-traders were jewish prior to 1935 . " in recent years , many of germany 's big-name companies have commissioned investigations into their nazi past , including media giant bertelsmann , deutsche bank and degussa , to name but a few .
while their findings go some way to establishing the full extent of hitler 's plundering of germany 's jewish community , these investigations ultimately uncover just the tip of the iceberg . " no jewish enterprise was left unharmed .
they were all liquidated or taken over by non-jews , " stressed kreutzmüller .
" however , we do n't even know how many jewish enterprises there were in berlin in 1933 - but probably at least 20,000 medium-sized companies , and thousands more doing small trading on markets or streets which we will never know of .

but it 's only now that the story of the man behind the brand has come to light with a new book on jewish entrepreneur julius fromm . they 've been called french letters and english raincoats , but in fact , the world 's oldest branded condom came from germany .
launched by a jewish entrepreneur in berlin shortly after the first world war , " fromms " are still no. 2 on the german condom market - but until now , their inventor had been languishing in obscurity . now in a new book , " fromms - how julius f. fell prey to german robbers , " authors götz aly and michael sontheimer set the record straight by exploring the life and times of a man who changed german sexual habits for good . tapping into the zeitgeist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julius fromm julius fromm was born in 1883 in konin , in what was then russia .
when he was 10 years old , his family left the poverty of the shtetl and moved to berlin in search of a better life .
his parents died young , and he and his six siblings were left to fend for themselves . along with many other east european jews in turn-of-the-century berlin , the fromm family initially earned their living by rolling cigarettes .
but as manual cigarette production was gradually ousted by mechanization , the entrepreneurial julius busied himself with evening classes in chemistry . like every inspired businessman , julius fromm had what one might be tempted to describe as a natural feel for the zeitgeist , and as the first world war raged across europe , germany experienced a perceptible shift in sexual values . " germany in some ways had the most liberal sexual culture in the world in the early 20th century , " said city university of new york 's dagmar herzog , author of " sex after fascism . "
" -lrb- this was thanks to -rrb- a combination of earthy , uncomplicated popular attitudes at the grassroots level , and courageous activism on the part of medical professionals in a wider context which included the disinhibiting impact of the war . " the latex revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany became more sexually liberal in the 1920s so the times were a changing , and more liberal approaches to morals were eroding the traditional link between sexuality and reproduction .
julius fromm seized the moment and decided the future was latex - an odorless , seamless , transparent natural rubber , and a lot smoother than pig gut . after centuries of makeshift contraception involving animal intestines and even lambskin and tortoise shells , the first modern condom had been invented in the mid-19th century by charles goodyear .
made of re-usable vulcanized rubber , it resembled a bicycle tire with bulky seams , so , perhaps not surprisingly , it never quite took off .
but the rapid spread of sexually transmitted diseases during the war had made condoms an indispensable accessory - while the uncertain times left governments reluctantly agreeable to approving a new way of containing the birth rate . in 1916 , julius fromm patented the titillatingly titled fromm 's act .
his manufacturing technique involved dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution , enabling the production of thinner condoms with no seams .
he did a roaring trade , with every packet containing a folded slip of paper on which was printed : " please discreetly hand me a packet of three fromm 's act , " to be silently presented to the salesperson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fromms condoms have come a long way mass production began in 1922 , and amid the sexual licentiousness of the weimar republic , fromm was soon doing well enough to open international branches from antwerp to auckland .
by 1930 , he had commissioned a flagship factory from the avant-garde jewish architects arthur korn and siegfried weitzman in the berlin suburb of köpenick - a boxy building in the " neue sachlichkeit " style that was as progressive as fromm 's product . but unlike the product , the bubble soon burst .
it was n't long before the nazis ' aryanization policy was in full swing .
in 1938 , on the grounds that his supplies of rubber were needed for the war effort , fromm was forced to sell his business at a fraction of its value to baroness elisabeth von epenstein , none other than hermann göring 's godmother .
in return , hitler 's luxury-loving second-in-command was able to add to his collection of teutonic kitsch two castles , burg mautendorf in austria and burg veldenstein , where göring had grown up .
a year later , fromm emigrated to london , where he died on may 12 , 1945 , four days after the allied victory over germany . fate unknown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish business was plundered in the third reich as an example of the social mobility of jewish immigrants in the early 20th century , fromm 's story is a typical one , though until now an unknown one .
that 's not surprising , according to christoph kreutzmüller , who oversees the research project " exclusion and survival strategies : small and medium-sized jewish businesses in berlin 1930 to 1940 " at berlin 's humboldt university .
the fate of most jewish businesses remains largely unknown , he explained . " there is maybe some dim recollection of the aryanization of the large companies and stereotypical branches such as tailoring , banking and department stores , " he said , citing the example of the wertheim department store and the private bank mendelssohn and co .
" but there is no information whatsoever about the small industries , or the pharmacies - the majority of those in berlin being owned by jews - let alone the jewish egg-trade , even though 98 percent of all egg-traders were jewish prior to 1935 . " in recent years , many of germany 's big-name companies have commissioned investigations into their nazi past , including media giant bertelsmann , deutsche bank and degussa , to name but a few .
while their findings go some way to establishing the full extent of hitler 's plundering of germany 's jewish community , these investigations ultimately uncover just the tip of the iceberg . " no jewish enterprise was left unharmed .
they were all liquidated or taken over by non-jews , " stressed kreutzmüller .
" however , we do n't even know how many jewish enterprises there were in berlin in 1933 - but probably at least 20,000 medium-sized companies , and thousands more doing small trading on markets or streets which we will never know of .

but it 's only now that the story of the man behind the brand has come to light with a new book on jewish entrepreneur julius fromm . they 've been called french letters and english raincoats , but in fact , the world 's oldest branded condom came from germany .
launched by a jewish entrepreneur in berlin shortly after the first world war , " fromms " are still no. 2 on the german condom market - but until now , their inventor had been languishing in obscurity . now in a new book , " fromms - how julius f. fell prey to german robbers , " authors götz aly and michael sontheimer set the record straight by exploring the life and times of a man who changed german sexual habits for good . tapping into the zeitgeist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julius fromm julius fromm was born in 1883 in konin , in what was then russia .
when he was 10 years old , his family left the poverty of the shtetl and moved to berlin in search of a better life .
his parents died young , and he and his six siblings were left to fend for themselves . along with many other east european jews in turn-of-the-century berlin , the fromm family initially earned their living by rolling cigarettes .
but as manual cigarette production was gradually ousted by mechanization , the entrepreneurial julius busied himself with evening classes in chemistry . like every inspired businessman , julius fromm had what one might be tempted to describe as a natural feel for the zeitgeist , and as the first world war raged across europe , germany experienced a perceptible shift in sexual values . " germany in some ways had the most liberal sexual culture in the world in the early 20th century , " said city university of new york 's dagmar herzog , author of " sex after fascism . "
" -lrb- this was thanks to -rrb- a combination of earthy , uncomplicated popular attitudes at the grassroots level , and courageous activism on the part of medical professionals in a wider context which included the disinhibiting impact of the war . " the latex revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany became more sexually liberal in the 1920s so the times were a changing , and more liberal approaches to morals were eroding the traditional link between sexuality and reproduction .
julius fromm seized the moment and decided the future was latex - an odorless , seamless , transparent natural rubber , and a lot smoother than pig gut . after centuries of makeshift contraception involving animal intestines and even lambskin and tortoise shells , the first modern condom had been invented in the mid-19th century by charles goodyear .
made of re-usable vulcanized rubber , it resembled a bicycle tire with bulky seams , so , perhaps not surprisingly , it never quite took off .
but the rapid spread of sexually transmitted diseases during the war had made condoms an indispensable accessory - while the uncertain times left governments reluctantly agreeable to approving a new way of containing the birth rate . in 1916 , julius fromm patented the titillatingly titled fromm 's act .
his manufacturing technique involved dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution , enabling the production of thinner condoms with no seams .
he did a roaring trade , with every packet containing a folded slip of paper on which was printed : " please discreetly hand me a packet of three fromm 's act , " to be silently presented to the salesperson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fromms condoms have come a long way mass production began in 1922 , and amid the sexual licentiousness of the weimar republic , fromm was soon doing well enough to open international branches from antwerp to auckland .
by 1930 , he had commissioned a flagship factory from the avant-garde jewish architects arthur korn and siegfried weitzman in the berlin suburb of köpenick - a boxy building in the " neue sachlichkeit " style that was as progressive as fromm 's product . but unlike the product , the bubble soon burst .
it was n't long before the nazis ' aryanization policy was in full swing .
in 1938 , on the grounds that his supplies of rubber were needed for the war effort , fromm was forced to sell his business at a fraction of its value to baroness elisabeth von epenstein , none other than hermann göring 's godmother .
in return , hitler 's luxury-loving second-in-command was able to add to his collection of teutonic kitsch two castles , burg mautendorf in austria and burg veldenstein , where göring had grown up .
a year later , fromm emigrated to london , where he died on may 12 , 1945 , four days after the allied victory over germany . fate unknown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish business was plundered in the third reich as an example of the social mobility of jewish immigrants in the early 20th century , fromm 's story is a typical one , though until now an unknown one .
that 's not surprising , according to christoph kreutzmüller , who oversees the research project " exclusion and survival strategies : small and medium-sized jewish businesses in berlin 1930 to 1940 " at berlin 's humboldt university .
the fate of most jewish businesses remains largely unknown , he explained . " there is maybe some dim recollection of the aryanization of the large companies and stereotypical branches such as tailoring , banking and department stores , " he said , citing the example of the wertheim department store and the private bank mendelssohn and co .
" but there is no information whatsoever about the small industries , or the pharmacies - the majority of those in berlin being owned by jews - let alone the jewish egg-trade , even though 98 percent of all egg-traders were jewish prior to 1935 . " in recent years , many of germany 's big-name companies have commissioned investigations into their nazi past , including media giant bertelsmann , deutsche bank and degussa , to name but a few .
while their findings go some way to establishing the full extent of hitler 's plundering of germany 's jewish community , these investigations ultimately uncover just the tip of the iceberg . " no jewish enterprise was left unharmed .
they were all liquidated or taken over by non-jews , " stressed kreutzmüller .
" however , we do n't even know how many jewish enterprises there were in berlin in 1933 - but probably at least 20,000 medium-sized companies , and thousands more doing small trading on markets or streets which we will never know of .

" we are part of a global danger zone , " he said .
" in times when we were not affected , we did not succumb to the illusion that that we were not threatened like the british , the spaniards or others , " he said in reference to the london and madrid bombings . an alarming position wolfgang bosbach , the interior expert for the conservative cdu / csu group in the bundestag and a party colleague of chancellor angela merkel , said german troops ' mission in the north of afghanistan and the deployment of german tornado reconnaissance jets in the south would continue despite the threats . " we in germany are in a persistent and alarming position in regard to this menace , and we also know that foreign policy decisions can change the security situation in germany , " bosbach said in an interview with the rheinsiche post newspaper published on monday .
" but it would be a major mistake if we were to stay out of the fight against international terror .
therefore , the security position will not change and neither will the decision on the tornado deployment in afghanistan . "
the bundestag decided on friday to deploy six tornado jets to provide reconnaissance assistance to nato troops in southern afghanistan ahead of an expected spring offensive from taliban fighters . peter struck , a former defense minister and currently leader of the social democrats in the german parliament , announced that the bundeswehr deployment in afghanistan would continue " at least for another decade . " " it must be clear to everybody that the reconstruction of the country is only possible if the taliban are defeated , " said struck in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper . berlin crisis team working on release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis team works on finding and freeing the hostages meanwhile , the german foreign ministry 's crisis team continued to work on the release of the two german hostages kidnapped in iraq .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on the weekend that everything was being done to secure the release of berlin-born hannelore marianne k. and her adult son . steinmeier said the crisis team believed that the kidnappers have criminal intent and that they are holding the hostages for ransom and for an ideological reason . the 61-year-old woman and her son were seized on feb .
6 by armed men who burst into their family home in baghdad .
a video of them was released over the weekend , showing the woman , who is married to an iraqi professor , begging for her and her son 's life . " i 'm asking you to help me , " she sobbed in the video broadcast .
" we 're germans as well .
these people want to kill my son before my eyes and then kill me .
i do n't want to die like this , " she said in german . the video showed three masked militants of a little-known group calling itself the brigade of the arrows of righteousness standing behind the woman , who was wearing a loosely tied headdress and holding the hand of her son crouching next to her . one of the masked men demanded the withdrawal of all of germany 's approximately 3,000 troops in the relatively stable north of afghanistan , where it commands the international security assistance force , within 10 days .
" otherwise , " he said , " you will not even see one corpse for these two agents . " al qaeda web site broadcasts terror threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new jets were just approved for the mission the video 's release was followed by a threat broadcast on an al qaeda linked website which warned germany and austria of retribution if they did not pull their troops out of afghanistan . a masked man read out a statement in the video message , posted on the so-called voice of the caliphate web site in arabic with german subtitles , saying : " germany 's participation in the us war on islam and muslims will lead only to ... endangering germany itself .
we wonder where germany 's interest lies in throwing 2,750 troops -lrb- to afghanistan -rrb- ... to fight in defense of the lies of -lrb- president george w. -rrb-
bush and his gang . " as the flags of germany and austria appeared in front of a burning background , the man added : " in standing by the united states ... you have provoked those whom you call terrorists to target you . " also on sunday , a prominent egyptian islamist sheikh osama mustafa hassan nasr , known as abu omar al-masri , called sunday on the militants to release the german hostages . " i plead with you - for the sake of allah - to immediately free the two captives , " al-masri told german news agency dpa , in a message directed at the militants . prominent cleric urges militants to free germans al-masri , the former imam of a mosque in milan , said he saw the video .
al-masri himself was reportedly kidnapped in italy and then taken to cairo in 2004 .
he was released briefly and detained by egyptian authorities as a terrorist suspect , and was recently released . " i am your brother in allah , who was kidnapped from the streets of milan on 27 february 2003 by cia agents , following campaigns where i condemned the injustice of the us state department towards the afghan and iraqi people , " he said in his message . al-masri , who in his own words spent " four years in captivity , -lrb- and -rrb- imprisonment , " urged the kidnappers not to kill the mother and her son . " what are the german mother and the son guilty of ?
what have they got to do with the foreign policy of their country ? " he said , adding that muslims in the west " face troubles " and that killing the german citizens will have even more negative effects . " have mercy on your -lrb- muslim -rrb- brothers and let go of the german mother and her son , " he added . dw staff -lrb- nda , jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de islamist group warns germany , austria of attacks an islamist group urged germany and austria in a video to withdraw troops from afghanistan to prevent attacks against the two nations .

" we are part of a global danger zone , " he said .
" in times when we were not affected , we did not succumb to the illusion that that we were not threatened like the british , the spaniards or others , " he said in reference to the london and madrid bombings . an alarming position wolfgang bosbach , the interior expert for the conservative cdu / csu group in the bundestag and a party colleague of chancellor angela merkel , said german troops ' mission in the north of afghanistan and the deployment of german tornado reconnaissance jets in the south would continue despite the threats . " we in germany are in a persistent and alarming position in regard to this menace , and we also know that foreign policy decisions can change the security situation in germany , " bosbach said in an interview with the rheinsiche post newspaper published on monday .
" but it would be a major mistake if we were to stay out of the fight against international terror .
therefore , the security position will not change and neither will the decision on the tornado deployment in afghanistan . "
the bundestag decided on friday to deploy six tornado jets to provide reconnaissance assistance to nato troops in southern afghanistan ahead of an expected spring offensive from taliban fighters . peter struck , a former defense minister and currently leader of the social democrats in the german parliament , announced that the bundeswehr deployment in afghanistan would continue " at least for another decade . " " it must be clear to everybody that the reconstruction of the country is only possible if the taliban are defeated , " said struck in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper . berlin crisis team working on release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis team works on finding and freeing the hostages meanwhile , the german foreign ministry 's crisis team continued to work on the release of the two german hostages kidnapped in iraq .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on the weekend that everything was being done to secure the release of berlin-born hannelore marianne k. and her adult son . steinmeier said the crisis team believed that the kidnappers have criminal intent and that they are holding the hostages for ransom and for an ideological reason . the 61-year-old woman and her son were seized on feb .
6 by armed men who burst into their family home in baghdad .
a video of them was released over the weekend , showing the woman , who is married to an iraqi professor , begging for her and her son 's life . " i 'm asking you to help me , " she sobbed in the video broadcast .
" we 're germans as well .
these people want to kill my son before my eyes and then kill me .
i do n't want to die like this , " she said in german . the video showed three masked militants of a little-known group calling itself the brigade of the arrows of righteousness standing behind the woman , who was wearing a loosely tied headdress and holding the hand of her son crouching next to her . one of the masked men demanded the withdrawal of all of germany 's approximately 3,000 troops in the relatively stable north of afghanistan , where it commands the international security assistance force , within 10 days .
" otherwise , " he said , " you will not even see one corpse for these two agents . " al qaeda web site broadcasts terror threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new jets were just approved for the mission the video 's release was followed by a threat broadcast on an al qaeda linked website which warned germany and austria of retribution if they did not pull their troops out of afghanistan . a masked man read out a statement in the video message , posted on the so-called voice of the caliphate web site in arabic with german subtitles , saying : " germany 's participation in the us war on islam and muslims will lead only to ... endangering germany itself .
we wonder where germany 's interest lies in throwing 2,750 troops -lrb- to afghanistan -rrb- ... to fight in defense of the lies of -lrb- president george w. -rrb-
bush and his gang . " as the flags of germany and austria appeared in front of a burning background , the man added : " in standing by the united states ... you have provoked those whom you call terrorists to target you . " also on sunday , a prominent egyptian islamist sheikh osama mustafa hassan nasr , known as abu omar al-masri , called sunday on the militants to release the german hostages . " i plead with you - for the sake of allah - to immediately free the two captives , " al-masri told german news agency dpa , in a message directed at the militants . prominent cleric urges militants to free germans al-masri , the former imam of a mosque in milan , said he saw the video .
al-masri himself was reportedly kidnapped in italy and then taken to cairo in 2004 .
he was released briefly and detained by egyptian authorities as a terrorist suspect , and was recently released . " i am your brother in allah , who was kidnapped from the streets of milan on 27 february 2003 by cia agents , following campaigns where i condemned the injustice of the us state department towards the afghan and iraqi people , " he said in his message . al-masri , who in his own words spent " four years in captivity , -lrb- and -rrb- imprisonment , " urged the kidnappers not to kill the mother and her son . " what are the german mother and the son guilty of ?
what have they got to do with the foreign policy of their country ? " he said , adding that muslims in the west " face troubles " and that killing the german citizens will have even more negative effects . " have mercy on your -lrb- muslim -rrb- brothers and let go of the german mother and her son , " he added . dw staff -lrb- nda , jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de islamist group warns germany , austria of attacks an islamist group urged germany and austria in a video to withdraw troops from afghanistan to prevent attacks against the two nations .

his wish was granted in the city of braunschweig on feb .
25 , 1932 , less than a year before hitler became german chancellor . " once and for all " saalmann , who represents braunschweig , said she wanted to sever the city 's notorious connection with the nazi leader with her motion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler needed a german passport to be active in german politics " if the state of lower saxony , as the legal successor of the then free state of braunschweig , distances itself from it , it could be helpful , " she told the daily hannoversche allgemeine zeitung . " we want to clear this up once and for all . " hitler requested release from his austrian citizenship in 1925 on the grounds that he had been living in germany since 1912 and served in the german army in world war one .
austria agreed and hitler was stateless until officially becoming german seven years later . when locals congratulated him on the step , hitler replied , " it is not me but germany that you should congratulate , " wrote the spiegel online news web site . questionable legality saalmann said that while she felt the gesture of rescinding the citizenship carried symbolic importance , she did not aim to whitewash the history of braunschweig , which was a nazi stronghold in the 1930s . " this should never serve to play down history along the lines of ' look , he was n't a german at all , " ' she said .
" that would never be my intention as a social democrat . " although braunschweig deprived hitler of his honorary citizenship in 1946 , one year after his death at the end of world war two , spiegel online said the motion to withdraw his citizenship could face a few daunting hurdles . " dead is dead , " an unnamed official at the lower saxony justice ministry was quoted as saying .
" you ca n't take anything more away then . " according to german law , citizenship can not be revoked if the person in question would then be stateless , which would be the case for hitler , who abdicated his austrian passport seven years before officially becoming a german . a decision on the motion is not expected for several weeks . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german neo-nazi gets five years for holocaust denial a german court on thursday sentenced a prominent holocaust denier ernst zündel to five years in prison for inciting racial hatred and denying that the nazis killed millions of jews .

yet the recent european interest in climate change has the german auto industry worried about its image . germany has no intention of slowing down its famously speedy drivers .
politicians and carmakers criticized the suggestion by european union environment minister that germany should introduce a speed limit on its autobahns . the speed limit idea is " a secondary front and a trivialization of the climate problem , " according to german environment minister sigmar gabriel . the powerful german automobile industry federation -lrb- vda -rrb- said in a statement that germany needed " no coaching " from brussels on how to protect the climate " above all when the proposals are only symbolic . " speed wastes energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's stavros dimas called for german speed limits eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said germany should impose speed limits on its highways as a way to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
the german transport ministry has rejected the idea , saying it would have a negligible effect on greenhouse gas emissions . " there are many areas in which we senselessly waste energy and harm the environment , " dimas said in an interview published in the bild newspaper 's sunday edition . he suggested speed limits as a good start .
in germany , some stretches of highway have speed limits but other sections allow drivers to go as fast as they like . " speed limits are useful for many reasons and are the order of the day in most of the eu 's 27 member nations and the united states , " dimas said .
" strangely enough , it is only in germany where they are controversial . " german social democratic party leader peter struck warned against " climate hysteria " where climate change is allowed to become the only thing on the agenda .
no one cares about preserving jobs , struck said in a bild interview sunday . but dimas said germany has a special responsibility towards curbing greenhouse gas emissions , which are widely believed to be responsible for global warming .

dimas had originally wanted tougher levels for cars sold in europe but backed down after pressure from german automobile manufacturers , which said they would be unfairly targeted . but german car makers are increasingly concerned about their image , a recent shake-up at their lobbying group has shown .
long-time president of the vda , bernd gottschalk , resigned unexpectedly on saturday . automakers were reportedly unhappy at how their lobby initially handled the eu climate debate .
the industry felt the vda reacted too slowly and not forcefully enough , according to der spiegel magazine . there was also criticism that gottschalk had n't done a good job of explaining the what the auto industry has been doing up until now to help the environment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 12.03.2007 germany skeptical about environmental speed limits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say slowing drivers to 120 kph -lrb- 75 mph -rrb- is n't the way to save the planet german politicians scoffed at the idea that speed limits on the country 's autobahns would prevent global warming .
yet the recent european interest in climate change has the german auto industry worried about its image . germany has no intention of slowing down its famously speedy drivers .
politicians and carmakers criticized the suggestion by european union environment minister that germany should introduce a speed limit on its autobahns . the speed limit idea is " a secondary front and a trivialization of the climate problem , " according to german environment minister sigmar gabriel . the powerful german automobile industry federation -lrb- vda -rrb- said in a statement that germany needed " no coaching " from brussels on how to protect the climate " above all when the proposals are only symbolic . " speed wastes energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's stavros dimas called for german speed limits eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said germany should impose speed limits on its highways as a way to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
the german transport ministry has rejected the idea , saying it would have a negligible effect on greenhouse gas emissions . " there are many areas in which we senselessly waste energy and harm the environment , " dimas said in an interview published in the bild newspaper 's sunday edition . he suggested speed limits as a good start .

his decision to bow out at the age of 74 is the end of an era as younger rivals on the left and right battle it out to take over . the veteran conservative said in a televised address on sunday that he would stand down in may after the expected second round of the election and would then seek to serve the country " in a different fashion . " " i will not ask for your votes for a new mandate , " he said .
" in a different manner , but with the same enthusiasm and passion to act on your behalf , i shall continue to fight our battles - the battles i have fought all my life - for justice , progress , peace and the grandeur of france , " he said . chirac began his political career in 1962 as an advisor to prime minister georges pompidou , and had his first cabinet post in 1967 .
he served two straight mandates as president , was twice prime minister and spent 18 years as mayor of paris .
in 2002 he won re-election with the support of left-wing voters , anxious to keep out far-right leader jean-marie le pen who stunned the country by qualifying for the decisive second round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen said he was gladf to be rid of his enemy le pen said chirac was " the worst president in the history of france .
i am delighted to be losing my best enemy .
the proof that he has led the country to disaster is that not a single candidate ... claims his legacy . " proud of his work in 2003 , chirac led opposition to the us-led war on iraq , earning acclaim in many parts of the world and sparking a bitter diplomatic quarrel with us president george w. bush . " president bush wishes president chirac all the best as he enters life after politics , " white house national security council spokesman gordon johndroe said after chirac 's announcement .
" the united states and france have been and will remain steadfast partners and allies , " he added . though bush 's fortunes have slumped because of the war , chirac 's also tumbled in 2005 , when france rejected the eu 's proposed constitution , riots hit the city suburbs , and he was hospitalized with a " vascular incident . " chirac said that he was " proud of the work which we have carried out together " - citing in particular improvements for the elderly and the handicapped , reforms of the pension system and reductions in crime and unemployment . and he called on the country to defend its values in the world .
" france is not a country like others .
it has particular responsibilities , the legacy of its history and the universal values it helped create , " he said .
still unclear which candidate he backs as expected , chirac gave no sign in his 10-minute address whether he intends to endorse the right-wing candidate for the presidency , interior minister nicolas sarkozy , a former protege who heads the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- . sarkozy , 52 , has a narrow lead in polls over socialist segolene royal but now faces a new challenge from the centrist candidate francois bayrou , head of the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , whose ratings have surged in the last month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy -lrb- r . -rrb- faces a challenge from within as well as from royal -lrb- l . -rrb- a poll published in le journal du dimanche newspaper for the first time showed bayrou on the same score as royal - 23 percent - in the first round of the vote on april 22 .
sarkozy was given 29 percent .
the two leading contenders qualify for a run-off on may 6 .
misgivings over legacy while misgivings remain about chirac 's legacy , he commands widespread affection and even political opponents praise his defense of french interests in the world . " it is a historic moment because a page of history is about to turn .
a new page is about to open and the french themselves are going to write it , " said royal . bayrou , who served as education minister under chirac from 1995 to 1997 , said that " on foreign policy he was an honorable voice , and a great voice at the moments when france needed one " - a clear reference to chirac 's defiance of the united states . however socialist former prime minister laurent fabius said the chirac era had been " wasted . " " his long presidency has lost france a lot of time .
this is what strikes me most : in relation to the major problems facing france and europe , a presidency of wasted time , " he said . chirac will officially leave his post on may 16 , when his mandate expires .
he has indicated that he would like to chair an international foundation , promoting causes close to his heart such as the environment and non-european cultures . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de extremist le pen strikes chord in france , again for over 30 years , jean-marie le pen has campaigned at the top of french politics .

but it 's only now that the story of the man behind the brand has come to light with a new book on jewish entrepreneur julius fromm . they 've been called french letters and english raincoats , but in fact , the world 's oldest branded condom came from germany .
launched by a jewish entrepreneur in berlin shortly after the first world war , " fromms " are still no. 2 on the german condom market - but until now , their inventor had been languishing in obscurity . now in a new book , " fromms - how julius f. fell prey to german robbers , " authors götz aly and michael sontheimer set the record straight by exploring the life and times of a man who changed german sexual habits for good . tapping into the zeitgeist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julius fromm julius fromm was born in 1883 in konin , in what was then russia .
when he was 10 years old , his family left the poverty of the shtetl and moved to berlin in search of a better life .
his parents died young , and he and his six siblings were left to fend for themselves . along with many other east european jews in turn-of-the-century berlin , the fromm family initially earned their living by rolling cigarettes .
but as manual cigarette production was gradually ousted by mechanization , the entrepreneurial julius busied himself with evening classes in chemistry . like every inspired businessman , julius fromm had what one might be tempted to describe as a natural feel for the zeitgeist , and as the first world war raged across europe , germany experienced a perceptible shift in sexual values . " germany in some ways had the most liberal sexual culture in the world in the early 20th century , " said city university of new york 's dagmar herzog , author of " sex after fascism . "
" -lrb- this was thanks to -rrb- a combination of earthy , uncomplicated popular attitudes at the grassroots level , and courageous activism on the part of medical professionals in a wider context which included the disinhibiting impact of the war . " the latex revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany became more sexually liberal in the 1920s so the times were a changing , and more liberal approaches to morals were eroding the traditional link between sexuality and reproduction .
julius fromm seized the moment and decided the future was latex - an odorless , seamless , transparent natural rubber , and a lot smoother than pig gut . after centuries of makeshift contraception involving animal intestines and even lambskin and tortoise shells , the first modern condom had been invented in the mid-19th century by charles goodyear .
made of re-usable vulcanized rubber , it resembled a bicycle tire with bulky seams , so , perhaps not surprisingly , it never quite took off .
but the rapid spread of sexually transmitted diseases during the war had made condoms an indispensable accessory - while the uncertain times left governments reluctantly agreeable to approving a new way of containing the birth rate . in 1916 , julius fromm patented the titillatingly titled fromm 's act .
his manufacturing technique involved dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution , enabling the production of thinner condoms with no seams .
he did a roaring trade , with every packet containing a folded slip of paper on which was printed : " please discreetly hand me a packet of three fromm 's act , " to be silently presented to the salesperson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fromms condoms have come a long way mass production began in 1922 , and amid the sexual licentiousness of the weimar republic , fromm was soon doing well enough to open international branches from antwerp to auckland .
by 1930 , he had commissioned a flagship factory from the avant-garde jewish architects arthur korn and siegfried weitzman in the berlin suburb of köpenick - a boxy building in the " neue sachlichkeit " style that was as progressive as fromm 's product . but unlike the product , the bubble soon burst .
it was n't long before the nazis ' aryanization policy was in full swing .
in 1938 , on the grounds that his supplies of rubber were needed for the war effort , fromm was forced to sell his business at a fraction of its value to baroness elisabeth von epenstein , none other than hermann göring 's godmother .
in return , hitler 's luxury-loving second-in-command was able to add to his collection of teutonic kitsch two castles , burg mautendorf in austria and burg veldenstein , where göring had grown up .
a year later , fromm emigrated to london , where he died on may 12 , 1945 , four days after the allied victory over germany . fate unknown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish business was plundered in the third reich as an example of the social mobility of jewish immigrants in the early 20th century , fromm 's story is a typical one , though until now an unknown one .
that 's not surprising , according to christoph kreutzmüller , who oversees the research project " exclusion and survival strategies : small and medium-sized jewish businesses in berlin 1930 to 1940 " at berlin 's humboldt university .
the fate of most jewish businesses remains largely unknown , he explained . " there is maybe some dim recollection of the aryanization of the large companies and stereotypical branches such as tailoring , banking and department stores , " he said , citing the example of the wertheim department store and the private bank mendelssohn and co .
" but there is no information whatsoever about the small industries , or the pharmacies - the majority of those in berlin being owned by jews - let alone the jewish egg-trade , even though 98 percent of all egg-traders were jewish prior to 1935 . " in recent years , many of germany 's big-name companies have commissioned investigations into their nazi past , including media giant bertelsmann , deutsche bank and degussa , to name but a few .
while their findings go some way to establishing the full extent of hitler 's plundering of germany 's jewish community , these investigations ultimately uncover just the tip of the iceberg . " no jewish enterprise was left unharmed .
they were all liquidated or taken over by non-jews , " stressed kreutzmüller .
" however , we do n't even know how many jewish enterprises there were in berlin in 1933 - but probably at least 20,000 medium-sized companies , and thousands more doing small trading on markets or streets which we will never know of .

but it 's only now that the story of the man behind the brand has come to light with a new book on jewish entrepreneur julius fromm . they 've been called french letters and english raincoats , but in fact , the world 's oldest branded condom came from germany .
launched by a jewish entrepreneur in berlin shortly after the first world war , " fromms " are still no. 2 on the german condom market - but until now , their inventor had been languishing in obscurity . now in a new book , " fromms - how julius f. fell prey to german robbers , " authors götz aly and michael sontheimer set the record straight by exploring the life and times of a man who changed german sexual habits for good . tapping into the zeitgeist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julius fromm julius fromm was born in 1883 in konin , in what was then russia .
when he was 10 years old , his family left the poverty of the shtetl and moved to berlin in search of a better life .
his parents died young , and he and his six siblings were left to fend for themselves . along with many other east european jews in turn-of-the-century berlin , the fromm family initially earned their living by rolling cigarettes .
but as manual cigarette production was gradually ousted by mechanization , the entrepreneurial julius busied himself with evening classes in chemistry . like every inspired businessman , julius fromm had what one might be tempted to describe as a natural feel for the zeitgeist , and as the first world war raged across europe , germany experienced a perceptible shift in sexual values . " germany in some ways had the most liberal sexual culture in the world in the early 20th century , " said city university of new york 's dagmar herzog , author of " sex after fascism . "
" -lrb- this was thanks to -rrb- a combination of earthy , uncomplicated popular attitudes at the grassroots level , and courageous activism on the part of medical professionals in a wider context which included the disinhibiting impact of the war . " the latex revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany became more sexually liberal in the 1920s so the times were a changing , and more liberal approaches to morals were eroding the traditional link between sexuality and reproduction .
julius fromm seized the moment and decided the future was latex - an odorless , seamless , transparent natural rubber , and a lot smoother than pig gut . after centuries of makeshift contraception involving animal intestines and even lambskin and tortoise shells , the first modern condom had been invented in the mid-19th century by charles goodyear .
made of re-usable vulcanized rubber , it resembled a bicycle tire with bulky seams , so , perhaps not surprisingly , it never quite took off .
but the rapid spread of sexually transmitted diseases during the war had made condoms an indispensable accessory - while the uncertain times left governments reluctantly agreeable to approving a new way of containing the birth rate . in 1916 , julius fromm patented the titillatingly titled fromm 's act .
his manufacturing technique involved dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution , enabling the production of thinner condoms with no seams .
he did a roaring trade , with every packet containing a folded slip of paper on which was printed : " please discreetly hand me a packet of three fromm 's act , " to be silently presented to the salesperson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fromms condoms have come a long way mass production began in 1922 , and amid the sexual licentiousness of the weimar republic , fromm was soon doing well enough to open international branches from antwerp to auckland .
by 1930 , he had commissioned a flagship factory from the avant-garde jewish architects arthur korn and siegfried weitzman in the berlin suburb of köpenick - a boxy building in the " neue sachlichkeit " style that was as progressive as fromm 's product . but unlike the product , the bubble soon burst .
it was n't long before the nazis ' aryanization policy was in full swing .
in 1938 , on the grounds that his supplies of rubber were needed for the war effort , fromm was forced to sell his business at a fraction of its value to baroness elisabeth von epenstein , none other than hermann göring 's godmother .
in return , hitler 's luxury-loving second-in-command was able to add to his collection of teutonic kitsch two castles , burg mautendorf in austria and burg veldenstein , where göring had grown up .
a year later , fromm emigrated to london , where he died on may 12 , 1945 , four days after the allied victory over germany . fate unknown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish business was plundered in the third reich as an example of the social mobility of jewish immigrants in the early 20th century , fromm 's story is a typical one , though until now an unknown one .
that 's not surprising , according to christoph kreutzmüller , who oversees the research project " exclusion and survival strategies : small and medium-sized jewish businesses in berlin 1930 to 1940 " at berlin 's humboldt university .
the fate of most jewish businesses remains largely unknown , he explained . " there is maybe some dim recollection of the aryanization of the large companies and stereotypical branches such as tailoring , banking and department stores , " he said , citing the example of the wertheim department store and the private bank mendelssohn and co .
" but there is no information whatsoever about the small industries , or the pharmacies - the majority of those in berlin being owned by jews - let alone the jewish egg-trade , even though 98 percent of all egg-traders were jewish prior to 1935 . " in recent years , many of germany 's big-name companies have commissioned investigations into their nazi past , including media giant bertelsmann , deutsche bank and degussa , to name but a few .
while their findings go some way to establishing the full extent of hitler 's plundering of germany 's jewish community , these investigations ultimately uncover just the tip of the iceberg . " no jewish enterprise was left unharmed .
they were all liquidated or taken over by non-jews , " stressed kreutzmüller .
" however , we do n't even know how many jewish enterprises there were in berlin in 1933 - but probably at least 20,000 medium-sized companies , and thousands more doing small trading on markets or streets which we will never know of .

" the latex revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany became more sexually liberal in the 1920s so the times were a changing , and more liberal approaches to morals were eroding the traditional link between sexuality and reproduction .
julius fromm seized the moment and decided the future was latex - an odorless , seamless , transparent natural rubber , and a lot smoother than pig gut . after centuries of makeshift contraception involving animal intestines and even lambskin and tortoise shells , the first modern condom had been invented in the mid-19th century by charles goodyear .
made of re-usable vulcanized rubber , it resembled a bicycle tire with bulky seams , so , perhaps not surprisingly , it never quite took off .
but the rapid spread of sexually transmitted diseases during the war had made condoms an indispensable accessory - while the uncertain times left governments reluctantly agreeable to approving a new way of containing the birth rate . in 1916 , julius fromm patented the titillatingly titled fromm 's act .
his manufacturing technique involved dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution , enabling the production of thinner condoms with no seams .
he did a roaring trade , with every packet containing a folded slip of paper on which was printed : " please discreetly hand me a packet of three fromm 's act , " to be silently presented to the salesperson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fromms condoms have come a long way mass production began in 1922 , and amid the sexual licentiousness of the weimar republic , fromm was soon doing well enough to open international branches from antwerp to auckland .
by 1930 , he had commissioned a flagship factory from the avant-garde jewish architects arthur korn and siegfried weitzman in the berlin suburb of köpenick - a boxy building in the " neue sachlichkeit " style that was as progressive as fromm 's product . but unlike the product , the bubble soon burst .
it was n't long before the nazis ' aryanization policy was in full swing .
in 1938 , on the grounds that his supplies of rubber were needed for the war effort , fromm was forced to sell his business at a fraction of its value to baroness elisabeth von epenstein , none other than hermann göring 's godmother .
in return , hitler 's luxury-loving second-in-command was able to add to his collection of teutonic kitsch two castles , burg mautendorf in austria and burg veldenstein , where göring had grown up .
a year later , fromm emigrated to london , where he died on may 12 , 1945 , four days after the allied victory over germany . fate unknown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish business was plundered in the third reich as an example of the social mobility of jewish immigrants in the early 20th century , fromm 's story is a typical one , though until now an unknown one .
that 's not surprising , according to christoph kreutzmüller , who oversees the research project " exclusion and survival strategies : small and medium-sized jewish businesses in berlin 1930 to 1940 " at berlin 's humboldt university .
the fate of most jewish businesses remains largely unknown , he explained . " there is maybe some dim recollection of the aryanization of the large companies and stereotypical branches such as tailoring , banking and department stores , " he said , citing the example of the wertheim department store and the private bank mendelssohn and co .
" but there is no information whatsoever about the small industries , or the pharmacies - the majority of those in berlin being owned by jews - let alone the jewish egg-trade , even though 98 percent of all egg-traders were jewish prior to 1935 . " in recent years , many of germany 's big-name companies have commissioned investigations into their nazi past , including media giant bertelsmann , deutsche bank and degussa , to name but a few .
while their findings go some way to establishing the full extent of hitler 's plundering of germany 's jewish community , these investigations ultimately uncover just the tip of the iceberg . " no jewish enterprise was left unharmed .
they were all liquidated or taken over by non-jews , " stressed kreutzmüller .

on saturday , a final round of talks between the leaders of serbia and kosovo ended inconclusively , with the serbs rejecting recommendations drawn up by un mediator martti ahtisaari , much to the consternation of the united states . " the talks demonstrate that belgrade and pristina remain diametrically opposed on the question of the kosovo status , " said joanne moore , a us state department spokeswoman . washington expressed support for the revised plan drawn up by un special envoy ahtisaari . us , britain pledge support for un envoy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari 's plans have been rejected by the serbs " the settlement proposal revised after the several weeks of consultations with the parties is a fair document , " moore said .
" it 's a blueprint for a more stable and democratic kosovo that protects the right of all . " we support the intent to present a final report to the un security council by the end of the month .
we call all the parties to come together on the proposal , " she said . after 13 months of negotiations aimed at finding a solution for landlocked kosovo , belgrade and pristina were unable to find common ground to settle the fate of the disputed province . ahtisaari , who chaired the talks between the two sides , said saturday that the potential for negotiations was exhausted .
the next move would be made by the united nations security council , he added . un package seen as unworkable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbs are unwilling to give up their claims to kosovo belgrade has rejected ahtisaari 's proposal , which does not mention independence but offers the province the trappings of statehood , including a constitution , flag , national anthem and the right to join international institutions . kosovo is seen by many as the last hotspot in the balkans following a bloody decade of 1990s inter-ethnic conflicts . the un has administered kosovo since june 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign halted a crackdown by belgrade security forces on the ethnic albanian community in the province , who were seeking independence . some 10,000 ethnic albanians died and hundreds of thousands fled kosovo during the 1998-1999 conflict . meanwhile , britain also expressed support monday for ahtisaari . " there have been some constitutional difficulties but the differences between the two parties is clear to see , especially on the fundamental issue of status , " a foreign office spokesman told afp .
" both belgrade and pristina made clear that they are ready to proceed to the security council and we support the special envoy that all possibilities have been exhausted . " the foreign office described this development as a " further delay " rather than a derailment and praised the " effective chairmanship " of ahtisaari . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu foreign policy chief : balkans stability crucial to europe the european union has a duty to ensure stability in the balkans after a decade of ethnic conflict and offer its people the hope of eu membership , the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana said .

but it 's only now that the story of the man behind the brand has come to light with a new book on jewish entrepreneur julius fromm . they 've been called french letters and english raincoats , but in fact , the world 's oldest branded condom came from germany .
launched by a jewish entrepreneur in berlin shortly after the first world war , " fromms " are still no. 2 on the german condom market - but until now , their inventor had been languishing in obscurity . now in a new book , " fromms - how julius f. fell prey to german robbers , " authors götz aly and michael sontheimer set the record straight by exploring the life and times of a man who changed german sexual habits for good . tapping into the zeitgeist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julius fromm julius fromm was born in 1883 in konin , in what was then russia .
when he was 10 years old , his family left the poverty of the shtetl and moved to berlin in search of a better life .
his parents died young , and he and his six siblings were left to fend for themselves . along with many other east european jews in turn-of-the-century berlin , the fromm family initially earned their living by rolling cigarettes .
but as manual cigarette production was gradually ousted by mechanization , the entrepreneurial julius busied himself with evening classes in chemistry . like every inspired businessman , julius fromm had what one might be tempted to describe as a natural feel for the zeitgeist , and as the first world war raged across europe , germany experienced a perceptible shift in sexual values . " germany in some ways had the most liberal sexual culture in the world in the early 20th century , " said city university of new york 's dagmar herzog , author of " sex after fascism . "
" -lrb- this was thanks to -rrb- a combination of earthy , uncomplicated popular attitudes at the grassroots level , and courageous activism on the part of medical professionals in a wider context which included the disinhibiting impact of the war . " the latex revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany became more sexually liberal in the 1920s so the times were a changing , and more liberal approaches to morals were eroding the traditional link between sexuality and reproduction .
julius fromm seized the moment and decided the future was latex - an odorless , seamless , transparent natural rubber , and a lot smoother than pig gut . after centuries of makeshift contraception involving animal intestines and even lambskin and tortoise shells , the first modern condom had been invented in the mid-19th century by charles goodyear .
made of re-usable vulcanized rubber , it resembled a bicycle tire with bulky seams , so , perhaps not surprisingly , it never quite took off .
but the rapid spread of sexually transmitted diseases during the war had made condoms an indispensable accessory - while the uncertain times left governments reluctantly agreeable to approving a new way of containing the birth rate . in 1916 , julius fromm patented the titillatingly titled fromm 's act .
his manufacturing technique involved dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution , enabling the production of thinner condoms with no seams .
he did a roaring trade , with every packet containing a folded slip of paper on which was printed : " please discreetly hand me a packet of three fromm 's act , " to be silently presented to the salesperson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fromms condoms have come a long way mass production began in 1922 , and amid the sexual licentiousness of the weimar republic , fromm was soon doing well enough to open international branches from antwerp to auckland .
by 1930 , he had commissioned a flagship factory from the avant-garde jewish architects arthur korn and siegfried weitzman in the berlin suburb of köpenick - a boxy building in the " neue sachlichkeit " style that was as progressive as fromm 's product . but unlike the product , the bubble soon burst .
it was n't long before the nazis ' aryanization policy was in full swing .
in 1938 , on the grounds that his supplies of rubber were needed for the war effort , fromm was forced to sell his business at a fraction of its value to baroness elisabeth von epenstein , none other than hermann göring 's godmother .
in return , hitler 's luxury-loving second-in-command was able to add to his collection of teutonic kitsch two castles , burg mautendorf in austria and burg veldenstein , where göring had grown up .
a year later , fromm emigrated to london , where he died on may 12 , 1945 , four days after the allied victory over germany . fate unknown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish business was plundered in the third reich as an example of the social mobility of jewish immigrants in the early 20th century , fromm 's story is a typical one , though until now an unknown one .
that 's not surprising , according to christoph kreutzmüller , who oversees the research project " exclusion and survival strategies : small and medium-sized jewish businesses in berlin 1930 to 1940 " at berlin 's humboldt university .
the fate of most jewish businesses remains largely unknown , he explained . " there is maybe some dim recollection of the aryanization of the large companies and stereotypical branches such as tailoring , banking and department stores , " he said , citing the example of the wertheim department store and the private bank mendelssohn and co .
" but there is no information whatsoever about the small industries , or the pharmacies - the majority of those in berlin being owned by jews - let alone the jewish egg-trade , even though 98 percent of all egg-traders were jewish prior to 1935 . " in recent years , many of germany 's big-name companies have commissioned investigations into their nazi past , including media giant bertelsmann , deutsche bank and degussa , to name but a few .
while their findings go some way to establishing the full extent of hitler 's plundering of germany 's jewish community , these investigations ultimately uncover just the tip of the iceberg . " no jewish enterprise was left unharmed .
they were all liquidated or taken over by non-jews , " stressed kreutzmüller .
" however , we do n't even know how many jewish enterprises there were in berlin in 1933 - but probably at least 20,000 medium-sized companies , and thousands more doing small trading on markets or streets which we will never know of .

but it 's only now that the story of the man behind the brand has come to light with a new book on jewish entrepreneur julius fromm . they 've been called french letters and english raincoats , but in fact , the world 's oldest branded condom came from germany .
launched by a jewish entrepreneur in berlin shortly after the first world war , " fromms " are still no. 2 on the german condom market - but until now , their inventor had been languishing in obscurity . now in a new book , " fromms - how julius f. fell prey to german robbers , " authors götz aly and michael sontheimer set the record straight by exploring the life and times of a man who changed german sexual habits for good . tapping into the zeitgeist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julius fromm julius fromm was born in 1883 in konin , in what was then russia .
when he was 10 years old , his family left the poverty of the shtetl and moved to berlin in search of a better life .
his parents died young , and he and his six siblings were left to fend for themselves . along with many other east european jews in turn-of-the-century berlin , the fromm family initially earned their living by rolling cigarettes .
but as manual cigarette production was gradually ousted by mechanization , the entrepreneurial julius busied himself with evening classes in chemistry . like every inspired businessman , julius fromm had what one might be tempted to describe as a natural feel for the zeitgeist , and as the first world war raged across europe , germany experienced a perceptible shift in sexual values . " germany in some ways had the most liberal sexual culture in the world in the early 20th century , " said city university of new york 's dagmar herzog , author of " sex after fascism . "
" -lrb- this was thanks to -rrb- a combination of earthy , uncomplicated popular attitudes at the grassroots level , and courageous activism on the part of medical professionals in a wider context which included the disinhibiting impact of the war . " the latex revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany became more sexually liberal in the 1920s so the times were a changing , and more liberal approaches to morals were eroding the traditional link between sexuality and reproduction .
julius fromm seized the moment and decided the future was latex - an odorless , seamless , transparent natural rubber , and a lot smoother than pig gut . after centuries of makeshift contraception involving animal intestines and even lambskin and tortoise shells , the first modern condom had been invented in the mid-19th century by charles goodyear .
made of re-usable vulcanized rubber , it resembled a bicycle tire with bulky seams , so , perhaps not surprisingly , it never quite took off .
but the rapid spread of sexually transmitted diseases during the war had made condoms an indispensable accessory - while the uncertain times left governments reluctantly agreeable to approving a new way of containing the birth rate . in 1916 , julius fromm patented the titillatingly titled fromm 's act .
his manufacturing technique involved dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution , enabling the production of thinner condoms with no seams .
he did a roaring trade , with every packet containing a folded slip of paper on which was printed : " please discreetly hand me a packet of three fromm 's act , " to be silently presented to the salesperson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fromms condoms have come a long way mass production began in 1922 , and amid the sexual licentiousness of the weimar republic , fromm was soon doing well enough to open international branches from antwerp to auckland .

his decision to bow out at the age of 74 is the end of an era as younger rivals on the left and right battle it out to take over . the veteran conservative said in a televised address on sunday that he would stand down in may after the expected second round of the election and would then seek to serve the country " in a different fashion .

" in a different manner , but with the same enthusiasm and passion to act on your behalf , i shall continue to fight our battles - the battles i have fought all my life - for justice , progress , peace and the grandeur of france , " he said . chirac began his political career in 1962 as an advisor to prime minister georges pompidou , and had his first cabinet post in 1967 .
he served two straight mandates as president , was twice prime minister and spent 18 years as mayor of paris .

still unclear which candidate he backs as expected , chirac gave no sign in his 10-minute address whether he intends to endorse the right-wing candidate for the presidency , interior minister nicolas sarkozy , a former protege who heads the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- . sarkozy , 52 , has a narrow lead in polls over socialist segolene royal but now faces a new challenge from the centrist candidate francois bayrou , head of the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , whose ratings have surged in the last month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy -lrb- r . -rrb- faces a challenge from within as well as from royal -lrb- l . -rrb- a poll published in le journal du dimanche newspaper for the first time showed bayrou on the same score as royal - 23 percent - in the first round of the vote on april 22 .
sarkozy was given 29 percent .
the two leading contenders qualify for a run-off on may 6 .
misgivings over legacy while misgivings remain about chirac 's legacy , he commands widespread affection and even political opponents praise his defense of french interests in the world . " it is a historic moment because a page of history is about to turn .
a new page is about to open and the french themselves are going to write it , " said royal . bayrou , who served as education minister under chirac from 1995 to 1997 , said that " on foreign policy he was an honorable voice , and a great voice at the moments when france needed one " - a clear reference to chirac 's defiance of the united states . however socialist former prime minister laurent fabius said the chirac era had been " wasted . " " his long presidency has lost france a lot of time .
this is what strikes me most : in relation to the major problems facing france and europe , a presidency of wasted time , " he said . chirac will officially leave his post on may 16 , when his mandate expires .

" we are part of a global danger zone , " he said .
" in times when we were not affected , we did not succumb to the illusion that that we were not threatened like the british , the spaniards or others , " he said in reference to the london and madrid bombings . an alarming position wolfgang bosbach , the interior expert for the conservative cdu / csu group in the bundestag and a party colleague of chancellor angela merkel , said german troops ' mission in the north of afghanistan and the deployment of german tornado reconnaissance jets in the south would continue despite the threats . " we in germany are in a persistent and alarming position in regard to this menace , and we also know that foreign policy decisions can change the security situation in germany , " bosbach said in an interview with the rheinsiche post newspaper published on monday .
" but it would be a major mistake if we were to stay out of the fight against international terror .
therefore , the security position will not change and neither will the decision on the tornado deployment in afghanistan . "
the bundestag decided on friday to deploy six tornado jets to provide reconnaissance assistance to nato troops in southern afghanistan ahead of an expected spring offensive from taliban fighters . peter struck , a former defense minister and currently leader of the social democrats in the german parliament , announced that the bundeswehr deployment in afghanistan would continue " at least for another decade . " " it must be clear to everybody that the reconstruction of the country is only possible if the taliban are defeated , " said struck in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper . berlin crisis team working on release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crisis team works on finding and freeing the hostages meanwhile , the german foreign ministry 's crisis team continued to work on the release of the two german hostages kidnapped in iraq .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on the weekend that everything was being done to secure the release of berlin-born hannelore marianne k. and her adult son . steinmeier said the crisis team believed that the kidnappers have criminal intent and that they are holding the hostages for ransom and for an ideological reason . the 61-year-old woman and her son were seized on feb .
6 by armed men who burst into their family home in baghdad .
a video of them was released over the weekend , showing the woman , who is married to an iraqi professor , begging for her and her son 's life . " i 'm asking you to help me , " she sobbed in the video broadcast .
" we 're germans as well .
these people want to kill my son before my eyes and then kill me .
i do n't want to die like this , " she said in german . the video showed three masked militants of a little-known group calling itself the brigade of the arrows of righteousness standing behind the woman , who was wearing a loosely tied headdress and holding the hand of her son crouching next to her . one of the masked men demanded the withdrawal of all of germany 's approximately 3,000 troops in the relatively stable north of afghanistan , where it commands the international security assistance force , within 10 days .
" otherwise , " he said , " you will not even see one corpse for these two agents . " al qaeda web site broadcasts terror threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new jets were just approved for the mission the video 's release was followed by a threat broadcast on an al qaeda linked website which warned germany and austria of retribution if they did not pull their troops out of afghanistan . a masked man read out a statement in the video message , posted on the so-called voice of the caliphate web site in arabic with german subtitles , saying : " germany 's participation in the us war on islam and muslims will lead only to ... endangering germany itself .

al-masri himself was reportedly kidnapped in italy and then taken to cairo in 2004 .
he was released briefly and detained by egyptian authorities as a terrorist suspect , and was recently released . " i am your brother in allah , who was kidnapped from the streets of milan on 27 february 2003 by cia agents , following campaigns where i condemned the injustice of the us state department towards the afghan and iraqi people , " he said in his message . al-masri , who in his own words spent " four years in captivity , -lrb- and -rrb- imprisonment , " urged the kidnappers not to kill the mother and her son . " what are the german mother and the son guilty of ?

" we are part of a global danger zone , " he said .
" in times when we were not affected , we did not succumb to the illusion that that we were not threatened like the british , the spaniards or others , " he said in reference to the london and madrid bombings . an alarming position wolfgang bosbach , the interior expert for the conservative cdu / csu group in the bundestag and a party colleague of chancellor angela merkel , said german troops ' mission in the north of afghanistan and the deployment of german tornado reconnaissance jets in the south would continue despite the threats . " we in germany are in a persistent and alarming position in regard to this menace , and we also know that foreign policy decisions can change the security situation in germany , " bosbach said in an interview with the rheinsiche post newspaper published on monday .
" but it would be a major mistake if we were to stay out of the fight against international terror .
therefore , the security position will not change and neither will the decision on the tornado deployment in afghanistan . "
the bundestag decided on friday to deploy six tornado jets to provide reconnaissance assistance to nato troops in southern afghanistan ahead of an expected spring offensive from taliban fighters . peter struck , a former defense minister and currently leader of the social democrats in the german parliament , announced that the bundeswehr deployment in afghanistan would continue " at least for another decade .

a video of them was released over the weekend , showing the woman , who is married to an iraqi professor , begging for her and her son 's life . " i 'm asking you to help me , " she sobbed in the video broadcast .
" we 're germans as well .
these people want to kill my son before my eyes and then kill me .
i do n't want to die like this , " she said in german . the video showed three masked militants of a little-known group calling itself the brigade of the arrows of righteousness standing behind the woman , who was wearing a loosely tied headdress and holding the hand of her son crouching next to her . one of the masked men demanded the withdrawal of all of germany 's approximately 3,000 troops in the relatively stable north of afghanistan , where it commands the international security assistance force , within 10 days .
" otherwise , " he said , " you will not even see one corpse for these two agents .

"
schröder worries the plan will provoke russia . schröder warned that the united states plan to install a radar base in the czech republic and interceptor missiles in poland established a " policy of encirclement against russia . "
the decision could lead to a new arms race , schröder said in a speech sunday . the united states has said it wants to establish a european system to protect against attacks by countries such as north korea and iran .
russia has seen the plan as a threat to its security .
senior russian military figures have threatened to target the missile-shield sites with their own weapons . provoking an arms race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has close personal ties to putin the us missile defense system could lead to a new global arms race , schröder warned at a sunday event in dresden .
he said current chancellor angela merkel 's government should try to persuade washington to drop its plan . merkel 's government has backed the us plan , saying it was a " purely defensive system " not aimed at russia . schröder has close personal ties to russian president vladimir putin and is currently involved with a russian-german natural gas consortium . the us was pursuing a containment strategy against russia , schröder warned .
europe should avoid similar actions which could be seen as encircling russia .
these included plans for ukraine and georgia to join nato , schröder said . the former chancellor admitted russia has a bad human rights record , but said the country was at the beginning of a new era .
he encouraged europe to strengthen its energy partnership with russia , which currently supplies 30 percent of the eu 's crude oil and 30 percent of germany 's natural gas . other german political leaders also issued strong criticism of the us plan . putting missiles in eastern europe is not a private matter between prague , warsaw and washington , opposition free democratic party leader guido westerwelle wrote in the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper on sunday .
it 's an important issue for all of europe . german left party leader gregor gysi was also critical . " this would be the start of a new arms race and a new cold war that is wasteful and unnecessary , " he said in an interview published sunday in the magazine super illu . nato chief criticizes plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us tests its defense system nato 's secretary general criticized the us plan as not adequately covering some south-eastern states in europe , which would need an extra , short-range system to defend against iran . " when it comes to missile defense , there should n't be an a-league and a b-league within nato , " jaap de hoop scheffer told the financial times in an article published monday .
" for me it is indivisibility of security that is the guiding principle . " europe has plans for its own battlefield defense system which should be ready by 2010 to protect deployed forces , de hoop scheffer told the newspaper .

while it promises to help students get a career in the döner industry , it 's actually setting young hopefuls on the road to a sisyphean existence . when it comes to the culinary oscars , the award for the most futile act within the service industry will be one of the most hard-fought categories on that most glittering of prize nights . challenging for the golden spatula will be the dog and duck 's " all-you-can-drink and french existentialist poetry reading " evening , the starlight restaurant 's five course supermodel buffet and peta 's george foreman grill and bush meat extravaganza . however , the prize for the food-related initiative most likely to be ignored despite its best efforts is likely to go to the certificate in " meat processing with döner kebab production specialization " at hamburg 's vocational school for gastronomy and nutrition . while encouraging young people to get a start in life with a vocational qualification is a worthy cause , one will have to search high and low to find a pursuit that is less appreciated and undervalued by the customer in the fast food sector than the high-quality preparation and presentation of a kebab . planning for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kebab scholars learn the ropes of healthy preparation the reasons for starting this course are , of course , honorable - and not just in terms of raising the standard of the döner-labeled concoction called a kebab by some snack stands . the training scheme is part of an initiative in germany to encourage young people with immigrant backgrounds to get professional training and help improve their chances of employment in a country where unemployment stands at under over 4 million . " mainly people with migrant backgrounds and turkish people work in -lrb- the kebab -rrb- business but few have qualifications , " kazim abaci , head of companies without borders , a german association designed to promote integration in the workplace , told reuters .
" we want to give those people a better chance and make them re-employable . " a standing ovation for that philosophy would naturally be forthcoming if it was not for the fact that those trainees are going to be asking themselves every day of their working lives why they even bothered in the first place for all the thanks they get . serving an ungrateful clientele imagine the scene : after successfully completing the course and proudly hanging his certificate on the wall , murat is qualified to lovingly prepare the cleanest , tastiest and most aesthetically pleasing kebab on the planet . his lamb is of the finest cut , his salad the freshest , his pita bread the most aromatic - a fast food masterpiece free of germs and scandal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.03.2007 germany skeptical about environmental speed limits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say slowing drivers to 120 kph -lrb- 75 mph -rrb- is n't the way to save the planet german politicians scoffed at the idea that speed limits on the country 's autobahns would prevent global warming .
yet the recent european interest in climate change has the german auto industry worried about its image . germany has no intention of slowing down its famously speedy drivers .
politicians and carmakers criticized the suggestion by european union environment minister that germany should introduce a speed limit on its autobahns . the speed limit idea is " a secondary front and a trivialization of the climate problem , " according to german environment minister sigmar gabriel . the powerful german automobile industry federation -lrb- vda -rrb- said in a statement that germany needed " no coaching " from brussels on how to protect the climate " above all when the proposals are only symbolic . " speed wastes energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's stavros dimas called for german speed limits eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said germany should impose speed limits on its highways as a way to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
the german transport ministry has rejected the idea , saying it would have a negligible effect on greenhouse gas emissions . " there are many areas in which we senselessly waste energy and harm the environment , " dimas said in an interview published in the bild newspaper 's sunday edition . he suggested speed limits as a good start .
in germany , some stretches of highway have speed limits but other sections allow drivers to go as fast as they like . " speed limits are useful for many reasons and are the order of the day in most of the eu 's 27 member nations and the united states , " dimas said .
" strangely enough , it is only in germany where they are controversial . " german social democratic party leader peter struck warned against " climate hysteria " where climate change is allowed to become the only thing on the agenda .
no one cares about preserving jobs , struck said in a bild interview sunday . but dimas said germany has a special responsibility towards curbing greenhouse gas emissions , which are widely believed to be responsible for global warming . " a breakthrough will only be possible if the eu members take steps to ensure that climate protection measures are feasible and financially sustainable - particularly germany as an important industrial nation , " he said . car industry concerned about image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers got the eu to water down its emissions limits the german car industry showed its clout last month , when the eu presented less strict co2 emissions standards .
dimas had originally wanted tougher levels for cars sold in europe but backed down after pressure from german automobile manufacturers , which said they would be unfairly targeted . but german car makers are increasingly concerned about their image , a recent shake-up at their lobbying group has shown .
long-time president of the vda , bernd gottschalk , resigned unexpectedly on saturday . automakers were reportedly unhappy at how their lobby initially handled the eu climate debate .
the industry felt the vda reacted too slowly and not forcefully enough , according to der spiegel magazine . there was also criticism that gottschalk had n't done a good job of explaining the what the auto industry has been doing up until now to help the environment .
a replacement for gottschalk has not yet been made . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urged to take lead on battling climate change the european union will seek to thrash out a common policy in fighting climate change , with plans to set tough targets for cutting carbon dioxide emissions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.03.2007 eu plans kosovo takeover despite deadlock over future status großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo , as the graffiti says , is still seen as a part of serbia the european union is allegedly planning to replace the un administration in kosovo despite the on-going deadlock over the province 's political future , according to a leaked confidential report . the eu allegedly has a blueprint for the takeover of the province in the " advanced stages " despite the political deadlock over its future status , the associated press reported monday . the bloc envisages a 72-member eu delegation supported by about 200 local staff who will oversee the implementation of the disputed un plan granting kosovo virtual independence , according to the blueprint report . according to ap , the report has been compiled by a team planning the transition between kosovo 's current un administration , known as unmik , the 3,000-strong authority that has been running kosovo since the war in 1999 , and its eu-led successor , the international civilian representative 's office . the eu move , if confirmed , is surprising given the uncertainty over the province 's future .
on saturday , a final round of talks between the leaders of serbia and kosovo ended inconclusively , with the serbs rejecting recommendations drawn up by un mediator martti ahtisaari , much to the consternation of the united states . " the talks demonstrate that belgrade and pristina remain diametrically opposed on the question of the kosovo status , " said joanne moore , a us state department spokeswoman . washington expressed support for the revised plan drawn up by un special envoy ahtisaari . us , britain pledge support for un envoy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahtisaari 's plans have been rejected by the serbs " the settlement proposal revised after the several weeks of consultations with the parties is a fair document , " moore said .
" it 's a blueprint for a more stable and democratic kosovo that protects the right of all . " we support the intent to present a final report to the un security council by the end of the month .
we call all the parties to come together on the proposal , " she said . after 13 months of negotiations aimed at finding a solution for landlocked kosovo , belgrade and pristina were unable to find common ground to settle the fate of the disputed province . ahtisaari , who chaired the talks between the two sides , said saturday that the potential for negotiations was exhausted .
the next move would be made by the united nations security council , he added . un package seen as unworkable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbs are unwilling to give up their claims to kosovo belgrade has rejected ahtisaari 's proposal , which does not mention independence but offers the province the trappings of statehood , including a constitution , flag , national anthem and the right to join international institutions . kosovo is seen by many as the last hotspot in the balkans following a bloody decade of 1990s inter-ethnic conflicts . the un has administered kosovo since june 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign halted a crackdown by belgrade security forces on the ethnic albanian community in the province , who were seeking independence . some 10,000 ethnic albanians died and hundreds of thousands fled kosovo during the 1998-1999 conflict . meanwhile , britain also expressed support monday for ahtisaari . " there have been some constitutional difficulties but the differences between the two parties is clear to see , especially on the fundamental issue of status , " a foreign office spokesman told afp .
" both belgrade and pristina made clear that they are ready to proceed to the security council and we support the special envoy that all possibilities have been exhausted . " the foreign office described this development as a " further delay " rather than a derailment and praised the " effective chairmanship " of ahtisaari . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu foreign policy chief : balkans stability crucial to europe the european union has a duty to ensure stability in the balkans after a decade of ethnic conflict and offer its people the hope of eu membership , the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana said .

" the situation is characterized by gross and systematic violations of human rights and grave breaches of international law , " the report said .
" war crimes and crimes against humanity continue across the region .
killing of civilians remains widespread , including in large-scale attacks .
rape and sexual violence are widespread and systematic .
torture continues . " as violations and abuses continue unabated , a climate of impunity prevails , " it added . international condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier said the world needed to speak out international reaction was swift following the report 's release . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , representing the eu at the un human rights council , said the world would have to act on the report 's description of " the ongoing , cruel human rights abuses . "
" the international community wo n't remain silent , " steinmeier told the associated press , without adding further details . no sudanese cooperation the un estimates at least 200,000 people have been killed in darfur with a further 2.5 million displaced . the conflict and influx of refugees has also spilled over into neighboring chad , exacerbating existing tensions . williams and her team were unable to carry out investigations in darfur itself , as khartoum refused to grant visas , saying some of the team 's members were " biased " against sudan - a charge repeated on sunday by sudan 's justice minister while en route to geneva . last month , the international criminal court in the hague named a sudanese government minister and a janjaweed militia leader as the first suspects prosecutors want to try for war crimes in the darfur conflict . darfur requires unified approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former sudanese interior minister ahmed muhammed harun was charged with war crimes the report urged the international community to adopt a " fully unified approach " in addressing darfur , and to help convene a national conference on peace , human rights and a common vision for sudan . it also called for the implementation of measures such as travel bans and the freezing of assets for those identified as rights violators . turning to actions on the ground , it demanded that sudan " end the targeting of civilians in darfur , cease all support for janjaweed militia forces , and proceed with the disarmament , demobilization and reintegration of such forces . " " witnesses , victims and observers we met repeatedly confirmed joint action between government forces and armed militia in assaulting civilian targets in darfur , " the report said . rebels share responsibility the mission said rebel groups in the region shared some responsibility for the rights abuses , including rape and torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions have been displaced by violence in sudan 's darfur region khartoum 's provision of arms to the janjaweed and other militias is a key factor behind growing tensions between tribal groups and communities , victims and witnesses told members of the mission . the report also said the un general assembly should compile a blacklist of foreign companies that have an " adverse impact " on the human rights situation in darfur . the darfur report kicked off a three-week session of the un 's human rights council , which replaced the human rights commission in 2006 . the darfur mission was set up by a rare consensus of the council 's 47 members following hard bargaining by western , african and islamic nations during a special session last december - the first time the council had specifically focused on darfur . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de international court names first darfur war crimes suspects the international criminal court in the hague on tuesday named a sudanese minister and a janjaweed militia leader as the first war crimes suspects in the darfur conflict .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.03.2007 book tells little-known tale of revolutionary condom-maker großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hard at work making condoms at fromm 's factory in 1935 in germany , the name fromm is to condoms what hoover is to vacuum cleaners .
but it 's only now that the story of the man behind the brand has come to light with a new book on jewish entrepreneur julius fromm . they 've been called french letters and english raincoats , but in fact , the world 's oldest branded condom came from germany .
launched by a jewish entrepreneur in berlin shortly after the first world war , " fromms " are still no. 2 on the german condom market - but until now , their inventor had been languishing in obscurity . now in a new book , " fromms - how julius f. fell prey to german robbers , " authors götz aly and michael sontheimer set the record straight by exploring the life and times of a man who changed german sexual habits for good . tapping into the zeitgeist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julius fromm julius fromm was born in 1883 in konin , in what was then russia .
when he was 10 years old , his family left the poverty of the shtetl and moved to berlin in search of a better life .
his parents died young , and he and his six siblings were left to fend for themselves . along with many other east european jews in turn-of-the-century berlin , the fromm family initially earned their living by rolling cigarettes .
but as manual cigarette production was gradually ousted by mechanization , the entrepreneurial julius busied himself with evening classes in chemistry . like every inspired businessman , julius fromm had what one might be tempted to describe as a natural feel for the zeitgeist , and as the first world war raged across europe , germany experienced a perceptible shift in sexual values . " germany in some ways had the most liberal sexual culture in the world in the early 20th century , " said city university of new york 's dagmar herzog , author of " sex after fascism . "
" -lrb- this was thanks to -rrb- a combination of earthy , uncomplicated popular attitudes at the grassroots level , and courageous activism on the part of medical professionals in a wider context which included the disinhibiting impact of the war . " the latex revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany became more sexually liberal in the 1920s so the times were a changing , and more liberal approaches to morals were eroding the traditional link between sexuality and reproduction .
julius fromm seized the moment and decided the future was latex - an odorless , seamless , transparent natural rubber , and a lot smoother than pig gut . after centuries of makeshift contraception involving animal intestines and even lambskin and tortoise shells , the first modern condom had been invented in the mid-19th century by charles goodyear .
made of re-usable vulcanized rubber , it resembled a bicycle tire with bulky seams , so , perhaps not surprisingly , it never quite took off .
but the rapid spread of sexually transmitted diseases during the war had made condoms an indispensable accessory - while the uncertain times left governments reluctantly agreeable to approving a new way of containing the birth rate . in 1916 , julius fromm patented the titillatingly titled fromm 's act .
his manufacturing technique involved dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution , enabling the production of thinner condoms with no seams .
he did a roaring trade , with every packet containing a folded slip of paper on which was printed : " please discreetly hand me a packet of three fromm 's act , " to be silently presented to the salesperson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fromms condoms have come a long way mass production began in 1922 , and amid the sexual licentiousness of the weimar republic , fromm was soon doing well enough to open international branches from antwerp to auckland .
by 1930 , he had commissioned a flagship factory from the avant-garde jewish architects arthur korn and siegfried weitzman in the berlin suburb of köpenick - a boxy building in the " neue sachlichkeit " style that was as progressive as fromm 's product . but unlike the product , the bubble soon burst .
it was n't long before the nazis ' aryanization policy was in full swing .
in 1938 , on the grounds that his supplies of rubber were needed for the war effort , fromm was forced to sell his business at a fraction of its value to baroness elisabeth von epenstein , none other than hermann göring 's godmother .
in return , hitler 's luxury-loving second-in-command was able to add to his collection of teutonic kitsch two castles , burg mautendorf in austria and burg veldenstein , where göring had grown up .
a year later , fromm emigrated to london , where he died on may 12 , 1945 , four days after the allied victory over germany . fate unknown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish business was plundered in the third reich as an example of the social mobility of jewish immigrants in the early 20th century , fromm 's story is a typical one , though until now an unknown one .
that 's not surprising , according to christoph kreutzmüller , who oversees the research project " exclusion and survival strategies : small and medium-sized jewish businesses in berlin 1930 to 1940 " at berlin 's humboldt university .
the fate of most jewish businesses remains largely unknown , he explained . " there is maybe some dim recollection of the aryanization of the large companies and stereotypical branches such as tailoring , banking and department stores , " he said , citing the example of the wertheim department store and the private bank mendelssohn and co .
" but there is no information whatsoever about the small industries , or the pharmacies - the majority of those in berlin being owned by jews - let alone the jewish egg-trade , even though 98 percent of all egg-traders were jewish prior to 1935 . " in recent years , many of germany 's big-name companies have commissioned investigations into their nazi past , including media giant bertelsmann , deutsche bank and degussa , to name but a few .
while their findings go some way to establishing the full extent of hitler 's plundering of germany 's jewish community , these investigations ultimately uncover just the tip of the iceberg . " no jewish enterprise was left unharmed .
they were all liquidated or taken over by non-jews , " stressed kreutzmüller .
" however , we do n't even know how many jewish enterprises there were in berlin in 1933 - but probably at least 20,000 medium-sized companies , and thousands more doing small trading on markets or streets which we will never know of .

yet the recent european interest in climate change has the german auto industry worried about its image . germany has no intention of slowing down its famously speedy drivers .
politicians and carmakers criticized the suggestion by european union environment minister that germany should introduce a speed limit on its autobahns . the speed limit idea is " a secondary front and a trivialization of the climate problem , " according to german environment minister sigmar gabriel . the powerful german automobile industry federation -lrb- vda -rrb- said in a statement that germany needed " no coaching " from brussels on how to protect the climate " above all when the proposals are only symbolic . " speed wastes energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's stavros dimas called for german speed limits eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said germany should impose speed limits on its highways as a way to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
the german transport ministry has rejected the idea , saying it would have a negligible effect on greenhouse gas emissions . " there are many areas in which we senselessly waste energy and harm the environment , " dimas said in an interview published in the bild newspaper 's sunday edition . he suggested speed limits as a good start .
in germany , some stretches of highway have speed limits but other sections allow drivers to go as fast as they like . " speed limits are useful for many reasons and are the order of the day in most of the eu 's 27 member nations and the united states , " dimas said .
" strangely enough , it is only in germany where they are controversial . " german social democratic party leader peter struck warned against " climate hysteria " where climate change is allowed to become the only thing on the agenda .
no one cares about preserving jobs , struck said in a bild interview sunday . but dimas said germany has a special responsibility towards curbing greenhouse gas emissions , which are widely believed to be responsible for global warming . " a breakthrough will only be possible if the eu members take steps to ensure that climate protection measures are feasible and financially sustainable - particularly germany as an important industrial nation , " he said . car industry concerned about image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german carmakers got the eu to water down its emissions limits the german car industry showed its clout last month , when the eu presented less strict co2 emissions standards .
dimas had originally wanted tougher levels for cars sold in europe but backed down after pressure from german automobile manufacturers , which said they would be unfairly targeted . but german car makers are increasingly concerned about their image , a recent shake-up at their lobbying group has shown .
long-time president of the vda , bernd gottschalk , resigned unexpectedly on saturday . automakers were reportedly unhappy at how their lobby initially handled the eu climate debate .
the industry felt the vda reacted too slowly and not forcefully enough , according to der spiegel magazine . there was also criticism that gottschalk had n't done a good job of explaining the what the auto industry has been doing up until now to help the environment .
a replacement for gottschalk has not yet been made . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urged to take lead on battling climate change the european union will seek to thrash out a common policy in fighting climate change , with plans to set tough targets for cutting carbon dioxide emissions .

but it 's only now that the story of the man behind the brand has come to light with a new book on jewish entrepreneur julius fromm . they 've been called french letters and english raincoats , but in fact , the world 's oldest branded condom came from germany .
launched by a jewish entrepreneur in berlin shortly after the first world war , " fromms " are still no. 2 on the german condom market - but until now , their inventor had been languishing in obscurity . now in a new book , " fromms - how julius f. fell prey to german robbers , " authors götz aly and michael sontheimer set the record straight by exploring the life and times of a man who changed german sexual habits for good . tapping into the zeitgeist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julius fromm julius fromm was born in 1883 in konin , in what was then russia .
when he was 10 years old , his family left the poverty of the shtetl and moved to berlin in search of a better life .
his parents died young , and he and his six siblings were left to fend for themselves . along with many other east european jews in turn-of-the-century berlin , the fromm family initially earned their living by rolling cigarettes .
but as manual cigarette production was gradually ousted by mechanization , the entrepreneurial julius busied himself with evening classes in chemistry . like every inspired businessman , julius fromm had what one might be tempted to describe as a natural feel for the zeitgeist , and as the first world war raged across europe , germany experienced a perceptible shift in sexual values . " germany in some ways had the most liberal sexual culture in the world in the early 20th century , " said city university of new york 's dagmar herzog , author of " sex after fascism . "
" -lrb- this was thanks to -rrb- a combination of earthy , uncomplicated popular attitudes at the grassroots level , and courageous activism on the part of medical professionals in a wider context which included the disinhibiting impact of the war . " the latex revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany became more sexually liberal in the 1920s so the times were a changing , and more liberal approaches to morals were eroding the traditional link between sexuality and reproduction .
julius fromm seized the moment and decided the future was latex - an odorless , seamless , transparent natural rubber , and a lot smoother than pig gut . after centuries of makeshift contraception involving animal intestines and even lambskin and tortoise shells , the first modern condom had been invented in the mid-19th century by charles goodyear .
made of re-usable vulcanized rubber , it resembled a bicycle tire with bulky seams , so , perhaps not surprisingly , it never quite took off .
but the rapid spread of sexually transmitted diseases during the war had made condoms an indispensable accessory - while the uncertain times left governments reluctantly agreeable to approving a new way of containing the birth rate . in 1916 , julius fromm patented the titillatingly titled fromm 's act .
his manufacturing technique involved dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution , enabling the production of thinner condoms with no seams .
he did a roaring trade , with every packet containing a folded slip of paper on which was printed : " please discreetly hand me a packet of three fromm 's act , " to be silently presented to the salesperson . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fromms condoms have come a long way mass production began in 1922 , and amid the sexual licentiousness of the weimar republic , fromm was soon doing well enough to open international branches from antwerp to auckland .
by 1930 , he had commissioned a flagship factory from the avant-garde jewish architects arthur korn and siegfried weitzman in the berlin suburb of köpenick - a boxy building in the " neue sachlichkeit " style that was as progressive as fromm 's product . but unlike the product , the bubble soon burst .
it was n't long before the nazis ' aryanization policy was in full swing .
in 1938 , on the grounds that his supplies of rubber were needed for the war effort , fromm was forced to sell his business at a fraction of its value to baroness elisabeth von epenstein , none other than hermann göring 's godmother .
in return , hitler 's luxury-loving second-in-command was able to add to his collection of teutonic kitsch two castles , burg mautendorf in austria and burg veldenstein , where göring had grown up .
a year later , fromm emigrated to london , where he died on may 12 , 1945 , four days after the allied victory over germany . fate unknown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish business was plundered in the third reich as an example of the social mobility of jewish immigrants in the early 20th century , fromm 's story is a typical one , though until now an unknown one .
that 's not surprising , according to christoph kreutzmüller , who oversees the research project " exclusion and survival strategies : small and medium-sized jewish businesses in berlin 1930 to 1940 " at berlin 's humboldt university .
the fate of most jewish businesses remains largely unknown , he explained . " there is maybe some dim recollection of the aryanization of the large companies and stereotypical branches such as tailoring , banking and department stores , " he said , citing the example of the wertheim department store and the private bank mendelssohn and co .
" but there is no information whatsoever about the small industries , or the pharmacies - the majority of those in berlin being owned by jews - let alone the jewish egg-trade , even though 98 percent of all egg-traders were jewish prior to 1935 . " in recent years , many of germany 's big-name companies have commissioned investigations into their nazi past , including media giant bertelsmann , deutsche bank and degussa , to name but a few .
while their findings go some way to establishing the full extent of hitler 's plundering of germany 's jewish community , these investigations ultimately uncover just the tip of the iceberg . " no jewish enterprise was left unharmed .
they were all liquidated or taken over by non-jews , " stressed kreutzmüller .
" however , we do n't even know how many jewish enterprises there were in berlin in 1933 - but probably at least 20,000 medium-sized companies , and thousands more doing small trading on markets or streets which we will never know of .

the option is opposed by the labour party as a threat to its historic links with the trade unions .
the review was set up by tony blair last year after the two main parties admitted raising secret loans before the 2005 general election .
report author sir hayden phillips will publish his findings on thursday .
sir hayden , a former civil servant , was asked by the prime minister to examine whether agreement could be reached over changes to party funding .
' party fury risked ' labour wants a small increase in state funding , stringent caps on spending and voluntary caps to be placed on donations by each party , which can reflect historic links with trade unions .
but bbc political correspondent james hardy said sir hayden would " risk labour fury " by recommending a legally binding limit on individual donations , whether they are from private donors , big business or trade unions .
an earlier memorandum from sir hayden - seen by the bbc in december - suggested a £ 500,000 limit on donations from organisations , including trade unions , falling to £ 50,000 in four years .
our correspondent said the conservatives are also likely to be disappointed by sir hayden 's recommendation that limits should be set on donations at a national level and in individual constituencies .
in recent years tory financier lord ashcroft has poured money into local parties to help win marginal seats , he said .
hope for agreement the tories have called for a large increase in state funding for all parties with more than two commons seats , a cap of £ 50,000 on all donations , the phasing out of corporate donations - including from trade unions - and tax relief for donations .
sources familiar with the report have told the bbc that sir hayden believes his findings will form the basis for an agreement between the two political parties .
the funding review was ordered following allegations , denied by all concerned , that honours have been given to people in return for people lending money to political parties .
it then emerged that ahead of the last election labour was secretly lent nearly £ 14m and the conservatives £ 16m .
the liberal democrats said they borrowed £ 850,000 from three backers .

sir hayden , a former civil servant , was asked by the prime minister to examine whether agreement could be reached over changes to party funding .
' party fury risked ' labour wants a small increase in state funding , stringent caps on spending and voluntary caps to be placed on donations by each party , which can reflect historic links with trade unions .

an earlier memorandum from sir hayden - seen by the bbc in december - suggested a £ 500,000 limit on donations from organisations , including trade unions , falling to £ 50,000 in four years .

the wales 60 - one for every assembly member - represent a balanced range of views from across the nation .
they will be giving their opinions on the bbc news website , tv and radio throughout the campaign .
they came forward after bbc wales urged anyone who wanted to have their views heard to get in touch .
the 60 people who have been selected include first-time voters , a student nurse , supermarket workers , a war veteran , a firefighter , a businessman and pensioners , to name but a few .
they all want to air their views on a range of issues about which they feel passionate .
not surprisingly , many of them are concerned about the big issues expected to feature prominently : health , education , the environment and jobs .
but other topics also pre-occupy some of the 60 , such as a lack of engagement between politicians and the young , illegal dog-fighting , citizenship , equal opportunities for black people and house prices in rural areas .
there may also be some surprises during the campaign as the wales 60 get to challenge and question the politicians .
they , like other voters across the country , want answers to the big questions before wales makes up its mind on polling day .
there will be regular updates on the views of the wales 60 - and , of course , detailed coverage of the elections - on the bbc news website , and tv and radio throughout the campaign .

the group - one for every assembly member - has been selected by the bbc to represent a balance of opinions before voters go to the polls on 3 may .
they will be electing members of the welsh assembly for the third time since devolution was established in 1999 .
here , some of the 60 explain what they will be looking for from the politicians seeking their votes .
you can follow the campaign and hear the opinions of the wales 60 on the bbc news website , tv and radio throughout .
click here for the views of jenny jones rhiannon eley clive jones julie farrington lisa berry dewi parry , 32 , it manager , rhiwlas , bangor dewi parry one of my main concerns is the state of the nhs in wales and especially the ambulance service .
it seems that the nhs has had enough money thrown at it for years but still things are n't right .
it also annoys me that if i choose to go private then i still have to pay my full tax burden .
it 's like filling up my car in shell and then calling into esso and giving them £ 10 because the law says i have to !
our third baby is due in april : why is it that my number one concern is what either mum or baby will catch in hospital ?
do n't get me wrong , the nhs does a fantastic job but it seems that you have to be very ill or dying before things really swing into action .
a group of us raised money for the air ambulance last year , it saves so much time and lives , but still the nhs in wales wo n't pay for it .
i 'd like a party to pledge to turn the nhs around within a year , get the hospitals clean and clear out the dead wood .
i think voters would sit up and take notice if politicians make clear definitive promises and pledge to make radical changes that the rest of the uk would then see and follow .
radical new thinking and clear timetabled promises is what we need .
jenny jones , 24 , geologist , llandyrnog , denbighshire jenny jones i will be looking for politicians who seem honest and are more passionate about policies than point-scoring - i want to hear about what they can do for us , not how badly other parties have fared in the past !
i believe the people of wales will vote primarily on local issues but more contentious issues such as the iraq war and immigration may well swing some voters .
personally i am interested in local health care , environmental and rural issues , and i would like to see more community-based services .
whatever people 's views , i just hope they take the time to come out and vote in may jenny jones being a farmer 's daughter , i would like to see a return to consumers buying more locally produce and supporting their communities .
i also feel there is a strong need for more education about the countryside , in the hope that young people will grow up to respect it .
maybe for younger voters like myself who are looking to be first-time buyers , plaid 's policy to match-fund up to £ 5,000 towards a house deposit might encourage younger people to vote .
whatever people 's views , i just hope they take the time to come out and vote in may .
rhiannon eley , 21 , student nurse , swansea rhiannon eley working daily within the nhs means that i see the issues affecting the workforce and patient care from the front line .
politicians have a chance in the elections to prove that they 're not only committed to making the nhs a better place for both workers and patients , but also that they understand that the issues affecting wales are different to those that affect england due to our different demography and epidemiology .
it 's been a worrying and uncertain time for me with job cuts taking place just as i 'm starting to apply for a post and nurse morale is lower than ever .
i think that it 's important to remember that nurses make up two-thirds of the nhs workforce and yet their views are rarely heard outside the hospital they work in .
i would like to see politicians giving evidence that they will utilise the invaluable opinions of staff at ward level before trying to implement policy in a " top down " style , so that nhs workers and politicians can pull together to improve patient care .
clive jones , 50 , accountant , monmouth clive jones although i 've already decided now i 'm going to vote in the assembly elections , i 'm not that enthused by any of the platforms on offer in that they all share a poverty of ambition and an acceptance that the outcomes in wales are always going to be worse than in england -lrb- and , come to that , scotland -rrb- .
it 's easy to find excuses in wales .
yes , we do have a lot of people with lung problems from mining and with back problems from all forms of heavy industry .
but most people with health problems in wales have problems which are fixable given the right amount of investment targeted in the right way .
we have to use whatever works in other parts of the uk and the rest of the world clive jones however , i do n't think that the nhs in its current form is capable of providing enough money or good enough management .
in the long term we will have to move towards the " continental " model of mixed private and public finance which will get more money into the systems and produce the right incentives and responsiveness to peoples ' needs .
another area in which we are thinking small is transport .
south wales has enough of a rail system left to take a lot of commuters off the roads if it is invested in .
on the environmental side , the severn barrage project would be great and wales could become a world leader in tidal power but not enough is being done .
the private sector needs to be encouraged , not ignored and drowned in permanent consultations .
in the end , there is no " welsh way " which is unique .
we have to use whatever works in other parts of the uk and the rest of the world .
the assembly is not some form of adult board game played by politicians but affects people 's lives .
julie farrington , stained glass artist , aberystwyth julie farrington my impetus for volunteering for the wales 60 was simply that for the first time in my adult life i am completely at a loss as to who to vote for .
this will be my first time voting in assembly elections , having lived in wales for three years and i feel that it is really important to get it right .
my politics are naturally left-wing , but on this occasion i feel that if i cast a vote for labour in wales that would send a message to the national party that i approve of policies they are currently implementing - which i do n't .
so for the first time , in a long time , i am a truly floating voter .
i need to know more about the other parties ' manifestoes and how those of us who are not welsh-speakers will be approached .
i am interested in how tourism could be better managed and how the crisis in the provision of dentists in rural areas is going to be resolved .
i also wish to add my voice to the growing number of people who oppose centralisation of hospital services - an english policy which can not work in rural wales .
lisa berry , 18 , student , newport lisa berry as a student there are a number of issues that i am interested in , particularly tuition fees and student loans .
these are going up and up in england , and although they are at a fixed £ 1,200 a year these wo n't be fixed forever !
the cost and state of public transport -lrb- trains and buses -rrb- in wales is not up to a great standard and the amount that the public are paying to use these facilities is extremely inflated considering the standard that is provided .
the ideal politician would be one that actually listens to what the people want lisa berry congestion charges in wales may be thrown on top of ever-increasing fuel costs and road tax - motorists are being charged way too much to use their vehicles .
the ideal politician would be one that actually listens to what the people want and actually attempt to solve any problems or concerns that the public have .
i think that politicians can engage the voters best by meeting and talking to people - not specifically to guaranteed voters , but to the wider public - and to let them air their views , so that they can have a better idea of what people want .
i do n't think that people will vote solely on welsh issues because there are a lot of other aspects that are important .
because wales does not have complete power , westminster still has some power over us which means that voters will need to take into consideration what issues that can affect us .

she is one of 80 roma women in this pretty and quiet czech town who claim they were coerced into sterilisation in the czech health system .
elegant and articulate , 37-year-old elena describes how her stay in the maternity ward 16 years ago left her emotionally and physically scarred for life .
she had just delivered a boy and joked to the doctor : " i wo n't bother to take the baby home , because i wanted a girl " .
the doctor 's answer still reverberates in her ears : " you 'd better take it , because you will not have any more children .
we have sterilised you . "
silence broken for years these women stayed silent , and some were even ashamed to tell their own husbands .
only a few years ago did the shocking details start to emerge .
roma girls danced at an exhibition dedicated to sterilised women there are allegations that coercive sterilisation was used to curb the traditionally high fertility rate among the roma .
many were offered money , though that was not official policy .
similar cases have been reported in neighbouring slovakia .
the practice officially ended in 1990 after the collapse of communist czechoslovakia , but a number of doctors are said to have continued the operations on their own initiative .
the complaints sparked an official inquiry .
the czech ombudsman - public defender of rights otakar motejl - investigated the cases and issued a report in december 2005 .
" the problem of sexual sterilisation carried out in the czech republic , either with improper motivation or illegally , exists , " he said , recommending state compensation for women affected between 1973 and 1991 .
during that period social services had offered some roma women financial incentives to undergo sterilisation " even though the state issued no instruction , " he concluded .
the communist authorities had practised an assimilation policy towards roma which " included efforts by social services to control the birth rate in the romani community , " he said .
pressure for action but human rights groups say the last recorded case happened as late as 2003 .
" sterilisation was used as a means of birth control , " says kumar vishwanathan , head of life together , an ostrava-based ngo for roma rights .
like many other roma women , elena gorolova signed a consent form without realising what the operation entailed .
some women say they had been administered drugs , others simply did not understand what the word " sterilisation " meant .
czech doctors disagree .
" sterilisation is conducted on purely medical grounds , " says richard spousta , head of the gynaecological unit at an ostrava hospital .
" we do n't keep any statistics on roma and non-roma sterilised women .
i do n't know why you are making such claims . "
an investigation by a czech health ministry advisory committee concluded that procedural mistakes had been made in a number of cases .
but the czech embassy in london told the bbc that " sterilisation is in no way a national policy targeted on a specific ethnic or any other group in the czech republic " .
" we 've suggested to the government that it issue an apology to the victims , " says ceslaw walek , director of the roma community affairs council , which advises the government on roma-related policies .
" but i can not see this happening . "
earlier this year the czech high court did uphold a lower court 's decision obliging an ostrava hospital to apologise to one of the victims , helena ferencikova , sterilised in 2001 .
" this is the first decision of its kind in central and eastern europe , " says lucie fremlova from the life together ngo .
the hospital has not yet complied with the court 's decision .
helena ferencikova is still waiting .

elegant and articulate , 37-year-old elena describes how her stay in the maternity ward 16 years ago left her emotionally and physically scarred for life .
she had just delivered a boy and joked to the doctor : " i wo n't bother to take the baby home , because i wanted a girl " .
the doctor 's answer still reverberates in her ears : " you 'd better take it , because you will not have any more children .
we have sterilised you . "
silence broken for years these women stayed silent , and some were even ashamed to tell their own husbands .
only a few years ago did the shocking details start to emerge .
roma girls danced at an exhibition dedicated to sterilised women there are allegations that coercive sterilisation was used to curb the traditionally high fertility rate among the roma .
many were offered money , though that was not official policy .
similar cases have been reported in neighbouring slovakia .
the practice officially ended in 1990 after the collapse of communist czechoslovakia , but a number of doctors are said to have continued the operations on their own initiative .
the complaints sparked an official inquiry .
the czech ombudsman - public defender of rights otakar motejl - investigated the cases and issued a report in december 2005 .
" the problem of sexual sterilisation carried out in the czech republic , either with improper motivation or illegally , exists , " he said , recommending state compensation for women affected between 1973 and 1991 .
during that period social services had offered some roma women financial incentives to undergo sterilisation " even though the state issued no instruction , " he concluded .
the communist authorities had practised an assimilation policy towards roma which " included efforts by social services to control the birth rate in the romani community , " he said .
pressure for action but human rights groups say the last recorded case happened as late as 2003 .
" sterilisation was used as a means of birth control , " says kumar vishwanathan , head of life together , an ostrava-based ngo for roma rights .
like many other roma women , elena gorolova signed a consent form without realising what the operation entailed .
some women say they had been administered drugs , others simply did not understand what the word " sterilisation " meant .
czech doctors disagree .
" sterilisation is conducted on purely medical grounds , " says richard spousta , head of the gynaecological unit at an ostrava hospital .
" we do n't keep any statistics on roma and non-roma sterilised women .
i do n't know why you are making such claims . "
an investigation by a czech health ministry advisory committee concluded that procedural mistakes had been made in a number of cases .
but the czech embassy in london told the bbc that " sterilisation is in no way a national policy targeted on a specific ethnic or any other group in the czech republic " .
" we 've suggested to the government that it issue an apology to the victims , " says ceslaw walek , director of the roma community affairs council , which advises the government on roma-related policies .
" but i can not see this happening . "
earlier this year the czech high court did uphold a lower court 's decision obliging an ostrava hospital to apologise to one of the victims , helena ferencikova , sterilised in 2001 .
" this is the first decision of its kind in central and eastern europe , " says lucie fremlova from the life together ngo .

the families will be expected to cook , wash and clean as they did in the 1920s .
they may even have to sing in the local choir , enjoy a dance evening at the local working men 's hall or play a game of 1920s-style football . "
all traces of creatures comforts will be removed from the house " producer colin davies the series is being made for bbc wales by cardiff company indus films .
producer colin davies said : " coal house will be great fun and an unforgettable experience for the families involved .
" as a typical 21st century family they will have to come to terms with life lacking the luxuries we take for granted in our modern lives .
" all traces of creatures comforts will be removed from the house .
there will be no tv , pc , washing machine or microwave oven .
" they will have to live without the benefit of central heating and hot running water .
" dad will have to bath in the front of an open fire or outside in the back yard . "
the series will be filmed in october and november this year and those taking part do not have to be welsh or have a mining background .

oliver jufer was arrested last december after drunkenly spray-painting several portraits of the monarch , king bhumibol adulyadej .
in court , jufer pleaded guilty to five charges under thailand 's draconian lese majeste law .
he is due to be sentenced later this month , and the maximum penalty he could face is 75 years in jail .
jufer 's lawyer said the minimum sentence he faced was seven-and-a-half years .
king bhumibol adulyadej born in 1927 , ascended throne in 1946 world 's longest-serving current head of state official powers are limited , but wields enormous influence because of popular backing widely believed to have given backing to 2006 military coup case shows monarchy fears police reports said jufer was drunk when the portraits were defaced on 5 december , which as the day of the king 's birthday is a national holiday .
jufer , who has lived in thailand for more than 10 years , was recorded on surveillance cameras defacing the portraits .
carefully managed the bbc 's jonathan head , who was outside the court in the northern city of chiang mai , says the case throws a rare spotlight on the strict lese-majeste laws in thailand forbidding any criticism of the monarchy .
at one point the prosecutor tried to get the media to leave , saying the case had been postponed .
" we do n't want the thai people to know about this case , " he said .
the image of the monarchy is very carefully managed , with local media only allowed to lavish praise on the king , our correspondent says .
the popular reverence for him is genuine , but the draconian laws deter most thais from even discussing the monarchy .
the king himself appeared to question this in a recent speech when he said it was wrong to put him above criticism .
" i am not afraid if the criticism concerns what i do wrong , because then i know , " he said .
" if you say the king can not be criticised , it means that the king is not human . "
but without any public debate there seems no possibility of amending the law , which allows any thai citizen to bring a charge against anyone else for insulting the king .
a handful of other foreigners have faced similar charges in the past .
most have eventually been allowed to leave the country .

the rise of convenience stores run by major supermarkets and the growth of take-away food chains meant business was increasingly competitive , it added .
greggs - which operates more than 1,330 uk bakeries - added that energy bills grew by £ 4.5m , also denting its income .
pre-tax profits fell 12.8 % to £ 43.7m in the year , while like-for-like sales grew a by " disappointing " 0.5 % .
" trading conditions were the most demanding that we have encountered for well over a decade , " said managing director sir michael darrington .
as well as increased competition , the warm summer had dented sales , with its core customers of shoppers and office workers shunning its warm sausage rolls and pasties , he added .
the company gave many of its stores a facelift and in 2006 sold off some of its poorly-performing bakers oven shops in northern england and scotland .
the sale of a bakery in the north east had offset some of the costs associated with closing the branches , greggs said .

that is the question being asked by an increasing number of customers of big organisations such as bt and the newly enlarged virgin media empire .
from 1 may , bt will levy an increased charge of £ 4.50 a quarter on people who pay their bills by cheque or cash .
and virgin charges £ 5 a month as a so-called administration charge for customers who do not sign up for direct debit payments .
the average payment by virgin customers is just £ 43 a month for their cable tv , phone and broadband bills .
squeezing customers the suspicion is that this is just a way of squeezing more money out of customers and that these charges bear little relation to any real extra cost involved .
i am pretty sure the virgin figure has no relation to the true cost professor david llewellyn " that is not fair and -lrb- it is -rrb- time action was taken to stop multi-nationals bullying their customers into submission , " complained alan pelling of eastbourne , a bt customer .

don wood from lincolnshire contacted the bbc web site to complain that this would be a particular problem for pensioners in rural areas .
" it 's disgusting , " he says .
" in my village many old people do n't have bank accounts .

support for such scepticsm comes from david llewellyn , professor of money and banking at loughborough university .
" i am pretty sure the virgin figure has no relation to the true cost , " he said .
virgin and bt virgin 's £ 5 a month processing charge is paid by about 1.5 million of its customers .
collecting payments via cash or cheque has obvious drawbacks " the cost reflects our processing costs , " said a spokeswoman .
but she did acknowledge that " some of it will be an incentive as well to encourage people to move to direct debit . "
bt points out that customers who are paying via cheque or cash are not , in fact , going to pay an extra £ 4.50 a quarter .
until now those who were paying via direct debit or a monthly payment plan had £ 1 a month knocked off their line rental .
that discount will now apply to all customers .
so the net increase to the cheque and cash payers is just £ 1.50 a quarter .
" effectively , we are replacing an existing discount with a charge , which results in a 50p a month decrease for some customers and a 50p increase for others , " said a bt spokesman .
" the charge will not apply to customers on our light user and in contact plus social telephone schemes , " said bt .
costs and savings even so , now that the line rentals are aligned , £ 4.50 is the apparent extra cost of paying by cheque or cash every three months .
we believe it is a fair and reasonable charge and is amongst the lowest such charges bt spokesman bt will not reveal exactly how it arrives at that figure .
it claims that the processing fee covers not only the charges made by its own bank , but also its in-house processing costs and also the charge made by post offices , which also accept bt bill payments .
" we believe it is a fair and reasonable charge and is amongst the lowest such charges , " said bt .
an automated payment process , such as direct debit , is cheaper to run , for both banks and their corporate customers , than one that involves people opening envelopes and counting figures on bits of paper .
it also saves money on chasing customers who fail to pay on time , or indeed at all .
but teasing out the real costs of processing cheques or direct debits is not easy .
bacs , the inter-bank money transmission service , will not reveal the basic cost per item it charges to the banks .
and the banking organisation apacs -lrb- association for payment clearing services -rrb- says there are no current , meaningful , average costs for the banking industry as a whole .
back in the mid-1990s it carried out some research on the cost of money transmission in the uk .
at the time it came to the conclusion that the cost to a bank of processing a cheque was 44p and that of a direct debit was 21p .

" i am pretty certain these charges are not , " he warned .
some customers are clearly not convinced that these non-direct debit charges are fair , and neither are some mps .

until now those who were paying via direct debit or a monthly payment plan had £ 1 a month knocked off their line rental .
that discount will now apply to all customers .
so the net increase to the cheque and cash payers is just £ 1.50 a quarter .
" effectively , we are replacing an existing discount with a charge , which results in a 50p a month decrease for some customers and a 50p increase for others , " said a bt spokesman .
" the charge will not apply to customers on our light user and in contact plus social telephone schemes , " said bt .
costs and savings even so , now that the line rentals are aligned , £ 4.50 is the apparent extra cost of paying by cheque or cash every three months .
we believe it is a fair and reasonable charge and is amongst the lowest such charges bt spokesman bt will not reveal exactly how it arrives at that figure .
it claims that the processing fee covers not only the charges made by its own bank , but also its in-house processing costs and also the charge made by post offices , which also accept bt bill payments .
" we believe it is a fair and reasonable charge and is amongst the lowest such charges , " said bt .
an automated payment process , such as direct debit , is cheaper to run , for both banks and their corporate customers , than one that involves people opening envelopes and counting figures on bits of paper .
it also saves money on chasing customers who fail to pay on time , or indeed at all .
but teasing out the real costs of processing cheques or direct debits is not easy .
bacs , the inter-bank money transmission service , will not reveal the basic cost per item it charges to the banks .
and the banking organisation apacs -lrb- association for payment clearing services -rrb- says there are no current , meaningful , average costs for the banking industry as a whole .
back in the mid-1990s it carried out some research on the cost of money transmission in the uk .
at the time it came to the conclusion that the cost to a bank of processing a cheque was 44p and that of a direct debit was 21p .
locking you in direct debits were first introduced in 1966 .
the main option is to leave bt as there is competition these days , people are free to leave if they want ofcom spokesman in the mid-1990s british gas became the first organisation to offer customers a discount for paying by this method .
but there are reasons , other than cost and convenience , that make this payment method attractive for service companies , like utilities , with lots of customers making regular payments .
professor llewellyn says the evidence is that people who pay this way are less likely to move to another supplier .
" direct debits are inclined to lock you in , " he said .
" and if the money has already been deducted you have no bargaining power , " he added , suggesting that companies that prefer direct debits as a method of payment should be wary of charging too much .
" this is very comparable to penalty charges being charged by banks , which the office of fair trading said should be related to cost , " pointed out professor llewellyn .
" i am pretty certain these charges are not , " he warned .
some customers are clearly not convinced that these non-direct debit charges are fair , and neither are some mps .
an early day motion , a traditional expression of back-bench opinion , criticising the new bt additional charge , has been signed by 77 mps .
so far , the telecoms regulator ofcom is fairly relaxed about the issue .
" we have looked at this , " said a spokesman .

that is the question being asked by an increasing number of customers of big organisations such as bt and the newly enlarged virgin media empire .
from 1 may , bt will levy an increased charge of £ 4.50 a quarter on people who pay their bills by cheque or cash .
and virgin charges £ 5 a month as a so-called administration charge for customers who do not sign up for direct debit payments .
the average payment by virgin customers is just £ 43 a month for their cable tv , phone and broadband bills .
squeezing customers the suspicion is that this is just a way of squeezing more money out of customers and that these charges bear little relation to any real extra cost involved . "
i am pretty sure the virgin figure has no relation to the true cost " professor david llewellyn " that is not fair and -lrb- it is -rrb- time action was taken to stop multi-nationals bullying their customers into submission , " complained alan pelling of eastbourne , a bt customer .
like millions of other people he discovered the raised charge when he read bt 's update leaflet that came with his last bill .
don wood from lincolnshire contacted the bbc web site to complain that this would be a particular problem for pensioners in rural areas .
" it 's disgusting , " he says .
" in my village many old people do n't have bank accounts .
they rely on the small post office , " he added .
support for such scepticsm comes from david llewellyn , professor of money and banking at loughborough university .
" i am pretty sure the virgin figure has no relation to the true cost , " he said .
virgin and bt virgin 's £ 5 a month processing charge is paid by about 1.5 million of its customers .
" the cost reflects our processing costs , " said a spokeswoman .
but she did acknowledge that " some of it will be an incentive as well to encourage people to move to direct debit . "
bt points out that customers who are paying via cheque or cash are not , in fact , going to pay an extra £ 4.50 a quarter .
until now those who were paying via direct debit or a monthly payment plan had £ 1 a month knocked off their line rental .
that discount will now apply to all customers .

however , dup deputy leader peter robinson said conditions had to be right for his party to go into government with sinn fein .

sdlp leader mark durkan said it was important to take the situation forward .
" we need to work with the mandates that the parties have , we need to try and convert that into working political institutions . "
ulster unionist leader sir reg empey , whose party lost nine seats , said he would have liked more seats , but respected the electorate 's decision .
" our commitment to devolution and a functioning executive has been made clear in the election campaign .

a subsequent court case collapsed .
direct rule has been in place since that date .

" it is up to other people to meet the requirements as soon as it is possible .

the dup got 30.1 % of first preferences - up 4.4 % from 2003 - while sinn fein got 26.2 % , up 2.6 % .

sdlp leader mark durkan said it was important to take the situation forward .
" we need to work with the mandates that the parties have , we need to try and convert that into working political institutions . "
ulster unionist leader sir reg empey , whose party lost nine seats , said he would have liked more seats , but respected the electorate 's decision .

speaking at the count in north down , she said her party 's vote management had been " woeful , to put it mildly " , and added that she had " a lot to think about " .

not only does she run a taxi company in nairobi with a fleet of more than 30 vehicles , but also when she leaves her office in the central business district of the kenyan capital she miraculously gets into all of them as they drive to their different locations to pick up or drop off customers .
at the touch of a button , she can tell which among her flock is low on fuel , which has a hangover and is shuffling at a painful pace , which has gone astray , and which has been car-jacked .
in that case - by another touch of the button she can easily bring it to a halt - much to the horror of any gun-wielding temporary proprietor .
how does she do all this ?
kenyan muti or juju ?
not at all .
actually , mumbi 's magical wand is a simple tool of modern day sorcery : a gsm -lrb- global system for mobile communications -rrb- phone .
misuse of vehicles mumbi 's dial-a-cab company is one of 20 fleet firms in kenya which have adopted a new vehicle-tracking technology that has been made possible by the growth of mobile phones .
the brains behind this new technology are two young it enthusiasts , paul mahiaini and waweru kimani . "
this technology has brought big benefits to our company " dial-a-cab owner mumbi muriuki " we saw a gap in the market with fleet owners having a huge problem monitoring their vehicles , " says mahiaini , who acts as marketing director of stoic company .
" misuse of vehicles by drivers is common , as is fuel theft , and fleet owners in the past relied on drivers to tell them the location of each vehicle .
" so we developed this new tracking technology which enables companies and individuals to monitor their vehicles in real time on the internet using the mobile phone network . "
at a one-off cost of 40,000 kenya shillings -lrb- $ 570 , £ 295 -rrb- and a monthly charge of 3,000 shillings -lrb- $ 40 -rrb- , a transponder is installed discreetly on the vehicle .
this device captures information such as when car doors are opened , how long the car has stopped , and vehicle speed and location .
through a built-in mobile phone sim card , the transponder continuously relays the data back to stoic 's main server and the control room of the fleet company via the mobile phone network .
all a fleet manager like mumbi needs is access to the internet to track her vehicles and drivers ' movements .
" this technology has brought big benefits to our company , " she says .
" we now run our cars more efficiently and save on fuel .
drivers no longer need to return to base in the city centre after each trip - we can see where they are at any time and allocate work close to them .
" we 've managed to drastically reduce the running costs of our vehicles and improved on the safety of our drivers and customers because we can remotely demobilise any car that 's been hijacked . "
it also enables fleet managers like mumbi to create a speed limit and geo-fenced area - a virtual parameter , for example , of the nairobi district - beyond which her vehicles should not travel .
any car that breaches this boundary or speed limit or deviates from an agreed route automatically triggers an alert which is monitored by mumbi or stoic .
stiff resistance but not everyone has embraced the gsm-tracking technology .
in one company , all the drivers walked out on the fleet owner after he installed tracking devices on the vehicles , objecting to what they saw as intrusive " big brother " technology .
for kimani it is not hard to see why his company 's initiative has met stiff resistance from many drivers .
" some of the haulage truck drivers thrived on the unmonitored world , " he says .
" one company told us how some of their truck drivers , ferrying transit goods from the port of mombasa to landlocked countries like uganda or rwanda , would spend about five days in mombasa and inform the fleet managers that they were being held up in the queue at the port waiting to load their cargo .
" but what they were actually doing was transporting other people 's goods from the port to nearby warehouses and pocketing the money - sometimes as much as 90,000 kenya shillings -lrb- $ 1,300 -rrb- for each driver .
our tracking system ended this misuse of vehicles . "
the tracking technology could kill another luxury - african time .
" fleet companies running on our tracking system have gained a reputation for reliability and predictability from their clients , " says kimani .
" the days when drivers in kenya would say to their ugandan clients , ' i 'll deliver your goods in kampala in the course of the day or within the next two days , ' are gone .
now one can clearly see where the vehicle is , how fast it 's travelling and work out when exactly it should arrive at its destination . "
stoic has also inadvertently strayed into another sensitive area in people 's lives - the family .
some individuals have had tracking devices installed on their family car so that they can be monitored when they drive through dangerous areas , especially at night .
but it could turn out to be a doubled-edged sword - stoic 's tracking system and the detailed digital map of nairobi and other big towns record not just where and when you drove but can pinpoint exactly which house you visited .
" some men tell us to monitor them as they drive their families through remote areas but are less keen to be ' watched ' when alone during their free time , " kimani says .
mumbi , however , is content with being the woman behind the wheel of every dial-a-cab taxi in all her walking , waking and sleeping hours - the laptop her steering wheel , the mobile phone her gear stick .

for kimani it is not hard to see why his company 's initiative has met stiff resistance from many drivers .
the gps tracker has caught out dishonest drivers " some of the haulage truck drivers thrived on the unmonitored world , " he says .
" one company told us how some of their truck drivers , ferrying transit goods from the port of mombasa to landlocked countries like uganda or rwanda , would spend about five days in mombasa and inform the fleet managers that they were being held up in the queue at the port waiting to load their cargo .
" but what they were actually doing was transporting other people 's goods from the port to nearby warehouses and pocketing the money - sometimes as much as 90,000 kenya shillings -lrb- $ 1,300 -rrb- for each driver .
our tracking system ended this misuse of vehicles . "
the tracking technology could kill another luxury - african time .
" fleet companies running on our tracking system have gained a reputation for reliability and predictability from their clients , " says kimani .
" the days when drivers in kenya would say to their ugandan clients , ' i 'll deliver your goods in kampala in the course of the day or within the next two days , ' are gone .
now one can clearly see where the vehicle is , how fast it 's travelling and work out when exactly it should arrive at its destination . "
stoic has also inadvertently strayed into another sensitive area in people 's lives - the family .
some individuals have had tracking devices installed on their family car so that they can be monitored when they drive through dangerous areas , especially at night .
but it could turn out to be a doubled-edged sword - stoic 's tracking system and the detailed digital map of nairobi and other big towns record not just where and when you drove but can pinpoint exactly which house you visited .
" some men tell us to monitor them as they drive their families through remote areas but are less keen to be ' watched ' when alone during their free time , " kimani says .
mumbi , however , is content with being the woman behind the wheel of every dial-a-cab taxi in all her walking , waking and sleeping hours - the laptop her steering wheel , the mobile phone her gear stick .

not only does she run a taxi company in nairobi with a fleet of more than 30 vehicles , but also when she leaves her office in the central business district of the kenyan capital she miraculously gets into all of them as they drive to their different locations to pick up or drop off customers .
at the touch of a button , she can tell which among her flock is low on fuel , which has a hangover and is shuffling at a painful pace , which has gone astray , and which has been car-jacked .
in that case - by another touch of the button she can easily bring it to a halt - much to the horror of any gun-wielding temporary proprietor .
how does she do all this ?
kenyan muti or juju ?
not at all .
actually , mumbi 's magical wand is a simple tool of modern day sorcery : a gsm -lrb- global system for mobile communications -rrb- phone .
misuse of vehicles mumbi 's dial-a-cab company is one of 20 fleet firms in kenya which have adopted a new vehicle-tracking technology that has been made possible by the growth of mobile phones .
the brains behind this new technology are two young it enthusiasts , paul mahiaini and waweru kimani .
this technology has brought big benefits to our company dial-a-cab owner mumbi muriuki " we saw a gap in the market with fleet owners having a huge problem monitoring their vehicles , " says mahiaini , who acts as marketing director of stoic company .
" misuse of vehicles by drivers is common , as is fuel theft , and fleet owners in the past relied on drivers to tell them the location of each vehicle .
" so we developed this new tracking technology which enables companies and individuals to monitor their vehicles in real time on the internet using the mobile phone network . "
at a one-off cost of 40,000 kenya shillings -lrb- $ 570 , £ 295 -rrb- and a monthly charge of 3,000 shillings -lrb- $ 40 -rrb- , a transponder is installed discreetly on the vehicle .
this device captures information such as when car doors are opened , how long the car has stopped , and vehicle speed and location .
through a built-in mobile phone sim card , the transponder continuously relays the data back to stoic 's main server and the control room of the fleet company via the mobile phone network .
all a fleet manager like mumbi needs is access to the internet to track her vehicles and drivers ' movements .
" this technology has brought big benefits to our company , " she says .
" we now run our cars more efficiently and save on fuel .
drivers no longer need to return to base in the city centre after each trip - we can see where they are at any time and allocate work close to them .
" we 've managed to drastically reduce the running costs of our vehicles and improved on the safety of our drivers and customers because we can remotely demobilise any car that 's been hijacked . "
it also enables fleet managers like mumbi to create a speed limit and geo-fenced area - a virtual parameter , for example , of the nairobi district - beyond which her vehicles should not travel .
any car that breaches this boundary or speed limit or deviates from an agreed route automatically triggers an alert which is monitored by mumbi or stoic .

some 70 % of registered voters turned out for the first fully democratic poll since independence in 1960 .
it marked a final stage of transition to civilian rule after a military coup in 2005 .
power has never changed hands at the ballot box in mauritania before .
results are expected late on monday or on tuesday , with a second round of voting expected in two weeks time .
sidi ould sheikh abdellahi , who served in the authoritarian government that was ousted two years ago by military leaders demanding democratic reform and his main rival - a long-standing opposition figure , ahmed ould daddah , both have about a quarter of the votes counted so far .
if none of the 19 candidates scores more than 50 % , people will return to the polls on 25 march .
" this event marks the turning of a page in the history of mauritania , " said marie anne isler beguin , from the eu 's 80-member election observer mission .
" for the first time , the people have been able to vote freely , without intervention . "
coming of age the coup leader , who is standing down , said the poll marked the moment mauritanians " come of age " .
colonel ely ould mohamed vall , whose military council took power in august 2005 , said he had a great sense of pride because it was the first time that mauritanians were choosing their leaders in a free and fair way .
" we came to power for a specific purpose .
we declared we would do specific things .
we stayed only so long as it took to accomplish or goals , " said col vall , who has barred himself and other members of the junta from running for office .
presidential poll 19 candidates 2,400 polling stations 1.1m voters 300 observers democratic dawn keeping the military out of power is seen as a key issue for a country which has seen numerous coups and attempted coups since independence from france .
mauritania seems to have gone further politically in the last two years than it has in the rest of its history , reports the bbc 's richard hamilton from the capital , nouakchott .
col vall has changed the constitution so that a president can only run for two terms , has improved human rights and brought democracy to this desert country , our correspondent says .
before the most recent coup , mauritania spent 21 years under the iron grip of former president ahmed taya and elections in those days were regarded as a sham , he reports .
mauritania is home to a number of different racial groups and many people were expected to vote along ethnic lines .
candidates include former ministers but no members of the outgoing military government .
unity another key issue is how to unite an ethnically diverse population , which includes arabs , berbers and sub-saharan africans .
while many presidential hopefuls come from the ruling arab elite , one candidate represents descendants of slaves .
despite a ban on slavery in 1980 , human rights groups say the phenomenon still exists in the country .
other major campaign issues have been how to manage the country 's new oil reserves and the islamic republic 's decision to recognise israel .
in february last year , mauritania started pumping millions of barrels of oil from offshore reserves , though people have still to see any benefits .

sidi ould sheikh abdellahi , who served in the authoritarian government that was ousted two years ago by military leaders demanding democratic reform and his main rival - a long-standing opposition figure , ahmed ould daddah , both have about a quarter of the votes counted so far .
if none of the 19 candidates scores more than 50 % , people will return to the polls on 25 march .
" this event marks the turning of a page in the history of mauritania , " said marie anne isler beguin , from the eu 's 80-member election observer mission .
" for the first time , the people have been able to vote freely , without intervention . "
coming of age the coup leader , who is standing down , said the poll marked the moment mauritanians " come of age " .
colonel ely ould mohamed vall , whose military council took power in august 2005 , said he had a great sense of pride because it was the first time that mauritanians were choosing their leaders in a free and fair way .
" we came to power for a specific purpose .
we declared we would do specific things .
we stayed only so long as it took to accomplish or goals , " said col vall , who has barred himself and other members of the junta from running for office .
presidential poll 19 candidates 2,400 polling stations 1.1m voters 300 observers democratic dawn keeping the military out of power is seen as a key issue for a country which has seen numerous coups and attempted coups since independence from france .
mauritania seems to have gone further politically in the last two years than it has in the rest of its history , reports the bbc 's richard hamilton from the capital , nouakchott .
col vall has changed the constitution so that a president can only run for two terms , has improved human rights and brought democracy to this desert country , our correspondent says .
before the most recent coup , mauritania spent 21 years under the iron grip of former president ahmed taya and elections in those days were regarded as a sham , he reports .
mauritania is home to a number of different racial groups and many people were expected to vote along ethnic lines .
candidates include former ministers but no members of the outgoing military government .
unity another key issue is how to unite an ethnically diverse population , which includes arabs , berbers and sub-saharan africans .
while many presidential hopefuls come from the ruling arab elite , one candidate represents descendants of slaves .
despite a ban on slavery in 1980 , human rights groups say the phenomenon still exists in the country .
other major campaign issues have been how to manage the country 's new oil reserves and the islamic republic 's decision to recognise israel .
in february last year , mauritania started pumping millions of barrels of oil from offshore reserves , though people have still to see any benefits .

the european union of federalists organises a congress at the hague in 1948 in the hope of drawing up a european constitution .
but the uk rejects the federal approach and the result is the council of europe a loose grouping that becomes a guardian of europe 's human rights .
1949 nato is born the washington treaty is signed by the usa canada and 10 western european states britain france the benelux countries iceland italy norway and portugal .
the key feature of the pact is a mutual defence clause if one country is attacked the others will come to its defence .
the us is supportive of european integration but it is another year before real progress is made in this field .
1950 the schuman declaration french foreign minister robert schuman announces a plan for france and germany to pool coal and steel production and invites other states to join them .
his plan is based on the idea that european unity is the key to peace .
solidarity in production he said would make war between france and germany " not merely unthinkable but materially impossible . " 1951 treaty of paris establishes european coal and steel community ecsc six countries sign the treaty france germany the benelux states and italy .
it sets up a high authority to manage the coal and steel industries and a common assembly a precursor of the european parliament .
the dutch supported by the germans also insist on the creation of a council of ministers made up of ministers from member states to counterbalance the supranational high authority .
1952 the ecsc begins work with jean monnet at its head the first president of the high authority is jean monnet the inspiration behind the schuman declaration .
the ecsc guarantees german coal to the french steel industry .
it also provides funds to upgrade belgian and italian coal mines .
germany agrees to this and to the dismantling of its steel cartels in order to gain international respectability .
1954 the rise and fall of the european defence community in response to the korean war the usa insists that europe must contribute more to its own defence and that germany must rearm .
in 1952 the six ecsc members agree to create a european defence community which envisages german soldiers joining a european army .
but the french parliament delays ratification and ultimately rejects the idea in 1954 .
1957 the treaty of rome a first step towards the common market the six members of the ecsc sign the treaty of rome setting up the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom .
the eec aims to create a common market a customs union plus free movement of capital and labour .
to please france it also promises subsidies to farmers .
euratom 's goal is the joint development of nuclear energy .
1958 the eec takes off dominating the other european communities the eec starts work and quickly establishes itself as the most important of the european communities .
it has a commission a council of ministers and an advisory parliamentary assembly whose members are drawn from national parliaments .
at the same time the european court of justice comes into existence to interpret the treaty of rome and rule in disputes over community decisions .
1960 efta is launched another kind of europe an alternative to the eec emerges when austria denmark norway portugal sweden switzerland and the uk set up efta the european free trade association .
like the eec efta aims to establish free trade but it opposes uniform external tariffs and sees no need for supranational institutions .
1961 britain denmark and ireland apply to join the eec the uk 's decision to apply for membership of the eec was taken by the government of harold macmillan a conservative .
it was not welcomed by french president charles de gaulle who saw it as a threat to his goal of using the eec to amplify france 's voice in world affairs .
he was also concerned about the uk 's close ties with the us .
1963 french president charles de gaulle vetoes british membership france 's nationalist leader charles de gaulle refuses to back the uk 's application to join the eec saying that the british government lacks commitment to european integration .
1967 treaty creating a single council and a commission for the three communities comes into effect 1968 the european community customs union is completed 1973 britain denmark and ireland join the european community the three countries and norway had failed to join 10 years earlier because of general de gaulle 's veto on british membership .
this time all sign an accession treaty in 1972 but norwegians reject it in a referendum later in the year .
denmark and ireland hold successful referendums .
the uk does not hold a referendum until 1975 after renegotiating its entry terms the result is twotoone in favour .
1979 the road to the euro begins with the ems the european monetary system ems introduces the european currency unit ecu and the exchange rate mechanism erm .
the ecu a unit for the communitys internal budget also takes on some of the features of a real currency it is used for travellers cheques and bank deposits .
the erm gives national currencies an exchange rate band denominated in ecus .
all ec members join except the uk .
1981 greece becomes the ecs 10th member 1984 the uk wins its budget rebate 1985 jacques delors becomes president of the european commission jacques delors proposes that the european community should by the end of 1992 remove a series of barriers to free trade and free movement of capital and labour creating a " single market " .
delors believes the single market programme will revive european integration by spilling over from the economic into the political arena .
it is widely seen as a necessity if europe is to compete with the united states .
1986 portugal and spain join the ec and the european flag is unveiled 1987 the single european act enters into force the sea modifies the treaty of rome aiming to complete the formation of a common market which the earlier treaty had begun .
it abolishes national vetoes in a host of areas relating to the single market increases the legislative powers of the european parliament and makes the first commitment by member states to create a " european union " .
1988 regional aid is doubled market liberalisation is seen to work to the benefit of the more developed northern european member states so the poorer southern states demand compensation .
this comes in the form of agreement to double the allocations for structural funds paid to poorer regions .
1990 britain enters the erm 1991 maastricht turns the community into a union the maastricht treaty on european union is signed in december .
it paves the way for monetary union and includes a chapter on social policy .
the uk negotiates an optout on both .
the treaty also introduces european citizenship giving europeans the right to live and vote in elections in any eu country and launches european cooperation in foreign affairs security asylum and immigration .
1992 the uk is forced out of the erm volatile currency markets put the exchange rate mechanism erm under pressure .
the erm was intended to harmonise currency values ahead of creating a single currency .
in an effort to bolster the £ which had been devalued by the unstable market the uk government raises base rates in an effort to prompt currency traders to buy £ s .
traders keep selling however forcing the government to pull the £ out of the erm .
1993 the treaty on european union comes into effect the maastricht treaty had a rough ride in national referendums .
danes rejected it in june 1992 and only accepted it in a second vote in may 1993 after receiving an optout on monetary union like the uk .
in france it squeaked home by just 50.4 to 49.7 .
there was also evidence of public discontent in other countries including germany and the uk .
1995 borders come down as a result of the schengen pact france germany portugal spain and the benelux countries are the first to drop border controls except on the eus external borders followed later by austria italy denmark finland sweden and greece but not the uk or ireland .
austria finland and sweden joined the eu at the start of 1995 taking membership to 15 .
norway would have joined if voters had not rejected the move in a second referendum .
1997 the amsterdam treaty is signed the treaty starts to get the eu ready for its eastward expansion .
more national vetoes are abolished .
laws on employment and discrimination are strengthened and the social chapter of the maastricht treaty becomes an official part of eu law .
the schengen agreement also becomes law though ireland and the uk maintain their optouts .
this gives the eu more say on immigration and asylum .
1998 first big steps towards enlargement accession negotiations open with cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary poland and slovenia .
a year later another group of countries gets its foot in the european door as the eu opens membership talks with romania slovakia latvia lithuania bulgaria and malta .
1999 crisis at the commission fraud and resignation the eu faces its darkest hour as revelations of fraud nepotism and mismanagement undermine the commission .
all 20 commissioners including president jacques santer resign before the parliament sacks them .
in september romano prodi becomes the new president of the commission promising radical change in the way it is run .
only a handful of the old commissioners are reappointed .
2002 national currencies replaced by euro notes and coins the euro came into existence in 1999 as the official currency of 11 countries .
greece adopted the currency two years later though sweden denmark and the uk stayed out .
on 1 january 2002 euro notes and coins were introduced in the 12 participating states and over the next few months their national currencies were phased out .
2003 plans for a european constitution suffer a setback a convention headed by former french president valery giscard destaing has spent much of 2002 and 2003 drafting the eus first constitution .
its goals are to simplify the eu treaties to make the eu more easily understood by its citizens and to help it work efficiently after enlargement .
but an intergovernmental conference ends in disarray as heads of state and government fail to agree a final text .
2004 the eu enlarges and a new constitution is signed enlargement goes ahead on 1 may 2004 .
elections to the european parliament in june 2004 the sixth since european polls began in 1979 are held in 25 countries from ireland to cyprus and malta to finland .
on 29 october eu leaders sign a new constitution in the same room where the treaty of rome was signed to establish the eu .
2005 no votes plunge constitution into crisis voters in referendums in both france and the netherlands reject their governments plans to ratify the eu constitution .
as the constitution can not come into effect unless it is ratified by all 25 member states many commentators declare it dead .
the european union continues to function on the basis of existing treaties but its future direction has been thrown dramatically into question .
2006 turkeys eu bid stalls letterspacing0 kerning0negotiations on turkey 's entry to the european union run into problems in december 2006 .
letterspacing0 kerning0eu foreign ministers decide to suspend accession talks with turkey in eight of the 35 areas that candidates are required to complete .
the decision follows turkey 's refusal

1960 efta is launched another kind of europe an alternative to the eec emerges when austria denmark norway portugal sweden switzerland and the uk set up efta the european free trade association .

the european union of federalists organises a congress at the hague in 1948 in the hope of drawing up a european constitution .
but the uk rejects the federal approach and the result is the council of europe a loose grouping that becomes a guardian of europe 's human rights .
1949 nato is born the washington treaty is signed by the usa canada and 10 western european states britain france the benelux countries iceland italy norway and portugal .
the key feature of the pact is a mutual defence clause if one country is attacked the others will come to its defence .
the us is supportive of european integration but it is another year before real progress is made in this field .
1950 the schuman declaration french foreign minister robert schuman announces a plan for france and germany to pool coal and steel production and invites other states to join them .
his plan is based on the idea that european unity is the key to peace .
solidarity in production he said would make war between france and germany " not merely unthinkable but materially impossible . " 1951 treaty of paris establishes european coal and steel community ecsc six countries sign the treaty france germany the benelux states and italy .
it sets up a high authority to manage the coal and steel industries and a common assembly a precursor of the european parliament .
the dutch supported by the germans also insist on the creation of a council of ministers made up of ministers from member states to counterbalance the supranational high authority .
1952 the ecsc begins work with jean monnet at its head the first president of the high authority is jean monnet the inspiration behind the schuman declaration .
the ecsc guarantees german coal to the french steel industry .
it also provides funds to upgrade belgian and italian coal mines .
germany agrees to this and to the dismantling of its steel cartels in order to gain international respectability .
1954 the rise and fall of the european defence community in response to the korean war the usa insists that europe must contribute more to its own defence and that germany must rearm .
in 1952 the six ecsc members agree to create a european defence community which envisages german soldiers joining a european army .
but the french parliament delays ratification and ultimately rejects the idea in 1954 .
1957 the treaty of rome a first step towards the common market the six members of the ecsc sign the treaty of rome setting up the european economic community eec and the european atomic energy community euratom .
the eec aims to create a common market a customs union plus free movement of capital and labour .
to please france it also promises subsidies to farmers .
euratom 's goal is the joint development of nuclear energy .
1958 the eec takes off dominating the other european communities the eec starts work and quickly establishes itself as the most important of the european communities .
it has a commission a council of ministers and an advisory parliamentary assembly whose members are drawn from national parliaments .
at the same time the european court of justice comes into existence to interpret the treaty of rome and rule in disputes over community decisions .
1960 efta is launched another kind of europe an alternative to the eec emerges when austria denmark norway portugal sweden switzerland and the uk set up efta the european free trade association .
like the eec efta aims to establish free trade but it opposes uniform external tariffs and sees no need for supranational institutions .
1961 britain denmark and ireland apply to join the eec the uk 's decision to apply for membership of the eec was taken by the government of harold macmillan a conservative .
it was not welcomed by french president charles de gaulle who saw it as a threat to his goal of using the eec to amplify france 's voice in world affairs .
he was also concerned about the uk 's close ties with the us .
1963 french president charles de gaulle vetoes british membership france 's nationalist leader charles de gaulle refuses to back the uk 's application to join the eec saying that the british government lacks commitment to european integration .
1967 treaty creating a single council and a commission for the three communities comes into effect 1968 the european community customs union is completed 1973 britain denmark and ireland join the european community the three countries and norway had failed to join 10 years earlier because of general de gaulle 's veto on british membership .
this time all sign an accession treaty in 1972 but norwegians reject it in a referendum later in the year .

1979 the road to the euro begins with the ems the european monetary system ems introduces the european currency unit ecu and the exchange rate mechanism erm .
the ecu a unit for the communitys internal budget also takes on some of the features of a real currency it is used for travellers cheques and bank deposits .
the erm gives national currencies an exchange rate band denominated in ecus .
all ec members join except the uk .
1981 greece becomes the ecs 10th member 1984 the uk wins its budget rebate 1985 jacques delors becomes president of the european commission jacques delors proposes that the european community should by the end of 1992 remove a series of barriers to free trade and free movement of capital and labour creating a " single market " .
delors believes the single market programme will revive european integration by spilling over from the economic into the political arena .
it is widely seen as a necessity if europe is to compete with the united states .
1986 portugal and spain join the ec and the european flag is unveiled 1987 the single european act enters into force the sea modifies the treaty of rome aiming to complete the formation of a common market which the earlier treaty had begun .
it abolishes national vetoes in a host of areas relating to the single market increases the legislative powers of the european parliament and makes the first commitment by member states to create a " european union " .
1988 regional aid is doubled market liberalisation is seen to work to the benefit of the more developed northern european member states so the poorer southern states demand compensation .
this comes in the form of agreement to double the allocations for structural funds paid to poorer regions .
1990 britain enters the erm 1991 maastricht turns the community into a union the maastricht treaty on european union is signed in december .
it paves the way for monetary union and includes a chapter on social policy .

liberal democrat figures show 52 % of trusts in england have bed occupancy rates higher than the recommended maximum safety level of 85 % .
among those , 95 trusts - more than one in five of the total - have occupancy rates in excess of 90 % .
experts say a rate above 85 % raises the infection risk , but the department of health said the risk was low .
figures from the office for national statistics show that deaths in england and wales involving mrsa rose by 39 % to 1,629 from 2004 to 2005 .
in the same period deaths involving another bug , clostridium difficile rose by 69 % to 3,800 .
geriatric beds a report drawn up last year by the department of health 's chief economist found the most crowded hospitals - with bed occupancy rates over 90 % - had mrsa rates 42 % higher than average .
the liberal democrat figures suggest that occupancy rates in many geriatric beds are a particular concern .
hospital superbugs are known to spread more quickly between elderly patients .
the latest figures show that of 261 nhs trusts with geriatric beds , almost 80 % had occupancy rates of over 85 % .
in 1997 the average bed occupancy rate was 80.8 % .
the figures were compiled by the liberal democrats ' health spokesman norman lamb .
he said : " if you are full there is more pressure , there is less slack in the system , it becomes much more difficult to keep patients clean , it becomes much more difficult to isolate patients .
" it makes it harder to fight the growing incidents of hospital-acquired infections which means that there are more people at risk of contracting infections and more risk of dying . "
' low risk ' the department of health said that risk of contracting mrsa was " low " .
a spokesman said : " the nhs treats a million people every 36 hours and there were approximately 7,000 mrsa bloodstream infections last year .
" the nhs is working hard to treat more patients and this means it needs to work even harder to reduce the risk of infection .
" guidance was issued in the chief medical officer 's winning ways report , which required chief executives to ensure that infection control teams work with bed managers to optimise bed use while implementing procedures to minimise the risk of infection . "
the figures were compiled from data for 2005-06 made available in september 2006 .

liberal democrat figures show 52 % of trusts in england have bed occupancy rates higher than the recommended maximum safety level of 85 % .
among those , 95 trusts - more than one in five of the total - have occupancy rates in excess of 90 % .
experts say a rate above 85 % raises the infection risk , but the department of health said the risk was low .
figures from the office for national statistics show that deaths in england and wales involving mrsa rose by 39 % to 1,629 from 2004 to 2005 .
in the same period deaths involving another bug , clostridium difficile rose by 69 % to 3,800 .
geriatric beds a report drawn up last year by the department of health 's chief economist found the most crowded hospitals - with bed occupancy rates over 90 % - had mrsa rates 42 % higher than average .
the liberal democrat figures suggest that occupancy rates in many geriatric beds are a particular concern .
hospital superbugs are known to spread more quickly between elderly patients .
the latest figures show that of 261 nhs trusts with geriatric beds , almost 80 % had occupancy rates of over 85 % .
in 1997 the average bed occupancy rate was 80.8 % .
the figures were compiled by the liberal democrats ' health spokesman norman lamb .
he said : " if you are full there is more pressure , there is less slack in the system , it becomes much more difficult to keep patients clean , it becomes much more difficult to isolate patients .
" it makes it harder to fight the growing incidents of hospital-acquired infections which means that there are more people at risk of contracting infections and more risk of dying . "
' low risk ' the department of health said that risk of contracting mrsa was " low " .
a spokesman said : " the nhs treats a million people every 36 hours and there were approximately 7,000 mrsa bloodstream infections last year .
" the nhs is working hard to treat more patients and this means it needs to work even harder to reduce the risk of infection .
" guidance was issued in the chief medical officer 's winning ways report , which required chief executives to ensure that infection control teams work with bed managers to optimise bed use while implementing procedures to minimise the risk of infection . "

wednesday 14 march 2007 1900 gmt on bbc two programme preview pskov is the only area in russia to have declared a state of emergency across its entire region .
since the epidemic began last september , over 800 people have been hospitalised in pskov , and doctors remain mystified as to the cause .

this world sends reporter john sweeney to pskov to investigate the truth behind the poison which is turning russia 's people yellow .
wednesday 14 march 2007 1900 gmt on bbc two pskov is the only area in russia to have declared a state of emergency across its entire region .
since the epidemic began last september , over 800 people have been hospitalised in pskov , and doctors remain mystified as to the cause .
the hospital corridors are crammed full of poison victims suffering from toxic hepatitis , a vile condition where their skin turns bile yellow before they die a horrible death .
while 80 % of patients die in a matter of days or weeks , 20 % go home but their days are numbered .
by the time they die , all their organs are yellow , including the brain .
this world has been given unique access to pskov city emergency services , the hospital , the police force and the city officials who are fighting to bring this horrific epidemic under control .
john sweeney successfully penetrates the world of pskov 's counterfeit bootleggers and films undercover while he buys some illegal alcohol .
but the investigation puts john sweeney 's own health at risk when he accidentally tastes some potentially poisoned alcohol .
toxicology lab the st petersburg toxicology lab 's preliminary tests on the confiscated counterfeit alcohol show that a medical disinfectant called extrasept has been implicated as the source of the poisonings .
it is a blend of chemicals which may have a synergetic cocktail effect and accelerate liver damage .
extrasept is a medical alcohol , and recent government changes to alcohol tax legislation have freed all medical alcohols from the usual hefty alcohol tax .
suddenly the bootleggers had an even cheaper source of alcohol .
after filming in russia , toxicology tests of extrasept were carried out on human liver cells wiping them out proving beyond doubt that extrasept is a human liver killer .
