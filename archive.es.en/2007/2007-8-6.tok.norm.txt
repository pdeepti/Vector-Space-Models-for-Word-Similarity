a woman found the music in her family 's summer home near moscow . it 's no surprise that music from hitler favorite composers such as richard wagner and ludwig van beethoven would turn up in the nazi leader 's personal record collection .
yet a moscow attic has yielded a more complex picture of the führer 's musical taste .
nearly 100 records suggest hitler also listened to russian and jewish musicians declared " subhuman " by the nazis , according to an article in the current issue of der spiegel magazine .
a surprising find bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler during the wagner festival in bayreuth in 1945 , lew besymenski , a captain in russia 's military intelligence unit , went with two other officers to the recently captured reich chancellery in berlin .
the headquarters of the nazi party were located near the secret underground bunker where hitler committed suicide at the end of world war ii .
besymenski 's comrades took silverware engraved with hitler 's initials home with them as souvenirs .
besymenski , a music lover , made an unexpected find .
behind several large steel doors that had been closed with special locks were boxes filled with personal belongings .
" it presented us with an odd sight : in each of the rooms there were numerous rows of sturdy wooden boxes all of them numbered , " besymenski wrote in a memoir years later , der spiegel reported .
the boxes were awaiting transfer to hitler 's mountain fortress in southern germany and were filled with plates and various household goods , including hitler 's records .
records kept in an attic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tchaikovsky was a russian composer considered sub-human besymenski 's daughter , alexandra besymenskaja , who is now 53 , accidentally came across the box in 1991 when she was at the family summer home near moscow . she had been sent to the attic to look for a badminton racket .
her shin hit something hard and she saw that she 'd run into a stack of records labeled führerhauptquartier , as the reich chancellery is called in german .
she asked her 70-year-old father about the records , but he did n't want to talk about them , saying that he had only listened for years to cds .
besymenski did n't want to be seen as a marauder who had ransacked the enemy 's personal belongings .
he had taken them because music was his personal passion , his daughter said .
when he died in june at the age of 86 , his daughter decided to talk publicly about her father 's record collection .
of the 100 discs , some are scratched , others are warped or broken , but many remain in relatively good condition .
the records include beethoven 's piano sonatas and wagner 's famous opera " the flying dutchman . "
hitler loved music , attending the opera almost daily during the time he lived in vienna .
hitler 's hypocrisy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner was a hitler favorite surprisingly , hitler 's collection also included russian composers labeled by the nazis as " subhuman " such as peter tchaikovsky , alexander borodin and sergei rachmaninoff , der spiegel reported .
one of the tchaikovsky records featured the star violinist bronislaw huberman , a polish jew forced to flee europe when the nazis took over .
hitler did n't care who had made the music he listened to in his bunker , despite in his book " mein kampf " stating that jewish art had never existed .
besymenski , who was a jew himself , was surprised that so many famous russian composers were included in hitler 's record collection , according to the memoir he wrote after being pressured by his daughter to record how he had had ended up with the collection .

nearly 100 records suggest hitler also listened to russian and jewish musicians declared " subhuman " by the nazis , according to an article in the current issue of der spiegel magazine .
a surprising find bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler during the wagner festival in bayreuth in 1945 , lew besymenski , a captain in russia 's military intelligence unit , went with two other officers to the recently captured reich chancellery in berlin .
the headquarters of the nazi party were located near the secret underground bunker where hitler committed suicide at the end of world war ii .
besymenski 's comrades took silverware engraved with hitler 's initials home with them as souvenirs .
besymenski , a music lover , made an unexpected find .
behind several large steel doors that had been closed with special locks were boxes filled with personal belongings .
" it presented us with an odd sight : in each of the rooms there were numerous rows of sturdy wooden boxes all of them numbered , " besymenski wrote in a memoir years later , der spiegel reported .
the boxes were awaiting transfer to hitler 's mountain fortress in southern germany and were filled with plates and various household goods , including hitler 's records .
records kept in an attic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tchaikovsky was a russian composer considered sub-human besymenski 's daughter , alexandra besymenskaja , who is now 53 , accidentally came across the box in 1991 when she was at the family summer home near moscow . she had been sent to the attic to look for a badminton racket .
her shin hit something hard and she saw that she 'd run into a stack of records labeled führerhauptquartier , as the reich chancellery is called in german .
she asked her 70-year-old father about the records , but he did n't want to talk about them , saying that he had only listened for years to cds .
besymenski did n't want to be seen as a marauder who had ransacked the enemy 's personal belongings .
he had taken them because music was his personal passion , his daughter said .
when he died in june at the age of 86 , his daughter decided to talk publicly about her father 's record collection .
of the 100 discs , some are scratched , others are warped or broken , but many remain in relatively good condition .
the records include beethoven 's piano sonatas and wagner 's famous opera " the flying dutchman . "
hitler loved music , attending the opera almost daily during the time he lived in vienna .
hitler 's hypocrisy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner was a hitler favorite surprisingly , hitler 's collection also included russian composers labeled by the nazis as " subhuman " such as peter tchaikovsky , alexander borodin and sergei rachmaninoff , der spiegel reported .
one of the tchaikovsky records featured the star violinist bronislaw huberman , a polish jew forced to flee europe when the nazis took over .
hitler did n't care who had made the music he listened to in his bunker , despite in his book " mein kampf " stating that jewish art had never existed .
besymenski , who was a jew himself , was surprised that so many famous russian composers were included in hitler 's record collection , according to the memoir he wrote after being pressured by his daughter to record how he had had ended up with the collection .
" i feel that is complete mockery , " besymenskaja told the magazine .
" millions of slavs and jews had to die because of the racist nazi ideology . " article based on news reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was right to do so , says dw 's ute schaeffer . from foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's perspective , there are many good reasons to support africa .
a new africa has emerged which , within the realm of the african union , is setting ambitious aims to promote peace .
it 's a new africa that wants to take responsibility to resolve conflicts and wars on the continent itself - as will soon be the case on behalf of the united nations in sudan .
democracy and political integration are the african union 's aims .
nigeria and ghana are important engines of these reform processes , self-confident partners , which are in transition politically and economically and which are taking responsibility regionally and globally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer above all , germany wants to export education and know-how to africa .
specifically , it wants to boost higher education and the exchange of scientists and students and to ramp up stipend programs .
the foreign minister wants to reverse bit by bit the mistakes of the past 15 years , when goethe institutes and embassies were closed in africa , and to considerably increase germany 's presence in africa .
that 's important , since it 's well-known that one can only cooperate well on the basis of trust and knowledge of one another .
that 's where germany has thoroughly lost ground over the years .
new actors , such as china , india or brazil - which do n't engage in strenuous discussions of values with their african partners but instead bring the continent investments , infrastructure and inexpensive products - have profited .
they do n't make developmental policy in africa , but economic policy - and the demand they generate ensures a clearly visible boom at least in africa 's resource-rich states .
these new actors have awakened the old ones .
in the battle for minds in africa , the issue is not lastly whether a sustainable and broad movement for more democracy will emerge .
for , that would be the most important prerequisite for the people to also benefit from economic growth .
that 's not the case in most of the african states that are rich in raw materials .
most people in those places are untouched by their countries ' wealth ; the number of people living in poverty has hardly changed .
a bad example is nigeria , where two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty .
germany does n't want to compete with the new actors - nor can it .
instead , germany 's africa policy is clearly set on partnership with states that are prepared to undertake reforms .
that 's also why the german foreign minister did without a business delegation and instead placed cultural and scientific exchange at the heart of his trip to nigeria and ghana .
but this time , too , readymade concepts ca n't be carried over .
on many points the two sides talk at cross purposes .
nigeria 's leadership called for german investment and more cooperation in the energy sector when they met with steinmeier .
and in ghana , too , the focus was on more economic cooperation .
that is exactly what the " new africa " demands in exchange for more reforms .
above all , africa is interested in the abolition of trade barriers , the targeted promotion of economic relations .
but during his first africa trip , the topic of business had shortened or limited talks , and this time steinmeier wanted to avoid that .
the new cultural policy approach for africa is forward-looking and ambitious .
it can advance development in africa .
at the same time though , this approach requires enduring and patient interest - a difficult and , certainly , a long route .
for , the results of cultural cooperation only appear after years and are far less visible than the stadiums , streets , pipelines or hospitals built by the chinese .
a long wind and a lot of promotion of the idea in germany as well as with the african partners will be necessary for the project to be a success .
africa has finally regained the significance that , in view of the global situation , it should have , seeing as none of the pressing problems in the international community - climate , energy security , terrorism , migration - can be solved without the continent .
incidentally , that was already the case 10 or 15 years ago , but it was n't discussed adequately in the public sphere .
it 's good that that 's now changing .

starting wednesday , millions of passengers throughout the country could be left stranded . gdl union officials said that 95.8 percent of the 12,000 union members voted in favor of the strike . the union aims to achieve a separate labor contract and a pay rise of up to 31 percent . a last-ditch attempt to avert industrial action failed on friday when gdl rejected a new offer by the state-owned railways deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- . schell said he expected that 90 percent of the 12,000 members eligible to take part in the ballot would vote in favor of striking .
it would be the first major strike to hit the rail company in 15 years . in an interview with the welt am sonntag newspaper , gdl chairman manfred schell said the only way the deutsche bahn would avoid strikes in the coming week would be to make an acceptable offer by tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de third reich -pipe- 06.08.2007 hitler 's unearthed music collection yields surprising finds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's record collection was found in an attic near moscow adolf hitler 's music collection included some surprise choices : russian and jewish musicians considered " subhuman " by the nazis .
a woman found the music in her family 's summer home near moscow . it 's no surprise that music from hitler favorite composers such as richard wagner and ludwig van beethoven would turn up in the nazi leader 's personal record collection .
yet a moscow attic has yielded a more complex picture of the führer 's musical taste .
nearly 100 records suggest hitler also listened to russian and jewish musicians declared " subhuman " by the nazis , according to an article in the current issue of der spiegel magazine .
a surprising find bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler during the wagner festival in bayreuth in 1945 , lew besymenski , a captain in russia 's military intelligence unit , went with two other officers to the recently captured reich chancellery in berlin .
the headquarters of the nazi party were located near the secret underground bunker where hitler committed suicide at the end of world war ii .
besymenski 's comrades took silverware engraved with hitler 's initials home with them as souvenirs .
besymenski , a music lover , made an unexpected find .
behind several large steel doors that had been closed with special locks were boxes filled with personal belongings .
" it presented us with an odd sight : in each of the rooms there were numerous rows of sturdy wooden boxes all of them numbered , " besymenski wrote in a memoir years later , der spiegel reported .
the boxes were awaiting transfer to hitler 's mountain fortress in southern germany and were filled with plates and various household goods , including hitler 's records .
records kept in an attic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tchaikovsky was a russian composer considered sub-human besymenski 's daughter , alexandra besymenskaja , who is now 53 , accidentally came across the box in 1991 when she was at the family summer home near moscow . she had been sent to the attic to look for a badminton racket .
her shin hit something hard and she saw that she 'd run into a stack of records labeled führerhauptquartier , as the reich chancellery is called in german .
she asked her 70-year-old father about the records , but he did n't want to talk about them , saying that he had only listened for years to cds .
besymenski did n't want to be seen as a marauder who had ransacked the enemy 's personal belongings .
he had taken them because music was his personal passion , his daughter said .
when he died in june at the age of 86 , his daughter decided to talk publicly about her father 's record collection .
of the 100 discs , some are scratched , others are warped or broken , but many remain in relatively good condition .
the records include beethoven 's piano sonatas and wagner 's famous opera " the flying dutchman . "
hitler loved music , attending the opera almost daily during the time he lived in vienna .
hitler 's hypocrisy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner was a hitler favorite surprisingly , hitler 's collection also included russian composers labeled by the nazis as " subhuman " such as peter tchaikovsky , alexander borodin and sergei rachmaninoff , der spiegel reported .
one of the tchaikovsky records featured the star violinist bronislaw huberman , a polish jew forced to flee europe when the nazis took over .
hitler did n't care who had made the music he listened to in his bunker , despite in his book " mein kampf " stating that jewish art had never existed .
besymenski , who was a jew himself , was surprised that so many famous russian composers were included in hitler 's record collection , according to the memoir he wrote after being pressured by his daughter to record how he had had ended up with the collection .
" i feel that is complete mockery , " besymenskaja told the magazine .

" this is what the future of streets looks like , " said cologne mayor konrad adenauer when he opened the highway for traffic on aug .
6 , 1932 . the highway was officially called the " automobile street " and there were no middle lanes .
it had two lanes going in each direction and there were no crossroads . it opened six months before the takeover of the nazis , who - through propaganda - spread the belief that hitler invented the highway . private predecessor the autobahn 's roots actually went back even a little further .
the first highway-like street , the so-called " avus " in berlin , opened in 1921 as an experimental motor racing circuit , financed privately . it was mostly used as a race- and testing track .
driving on the cologne highway , on the other hand , was open for any automobile , free of charge . in 1927 , a plan was put up for the construction of a 22,000-kilometer -lrb- 13,670-mile -rrb- highway network throughout germany .
the idea was filed , due to the 1929 new york market crash and the economic crisis that followed . rising traffic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has managed to build 7,705 miles of highways throughout the country this , however , did not change the fact that traffic issues kept rising : between 1920 and 1925 , the number of cars in the german reich rose from 75,000 to 256,000 - an increase the previous street network could not deal with . the construction of the crossroad-free , four-lane highway between cologne and bonn continued .
with 18,000 cars a day , this street along the rhine river was one of the busiest streets in the whole german reich .
in comparison , the front runner today is the highway a100 in berlin , with more than 165,000 cars a day . the constructions on the cologne-bonn highway began in 1929 .
the project also served as a program for provision of employment for the many unemployed in the region .
at the peak of construction , more than 125,000 men worked on building the highway . cars only specific laws were applied to the novel street : the new highway was only meant for automobiles , reported the kölnische zeitung newspaper on aug .
5 , 1932 .

" this is what the future of streets looks like , " said cologne mayor konrad adenauer when he opened the highway for traffic on aug .
6 , 1932 . the highway was officially called the " automobile street " and there were no middle lanes .
it had two lanes going in each direction and there were no crossroads . it opened six months before the takeover of the nazis , who - through propaganda - spread the belief that hitler invented the highway . private predecessor the autobahn 's roots actually went back even a little further .
the first highway-like street , the so-called " avus " in berlin , opened in 1921 as an experimental motor racing circuit , financed privately . it was mostly used as a race- and testing track .
driving on the cologne highway , on the other hand , was open for any automobile , free of charge . in 1927 , a plan was put up for the construction of a 22,000-kilometer -lrb- 13,670-mile -rrb- highway network throughout germany .
the idea was filed , due to the 1929 new york market crash and the economic crisis that followed . rising traffic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has managed to build 7,705 miles of highways throughout the country this , however , did not change the fact that traffic issues kept rising : between 1920 and 1925 , the number of cars in the german reich rose from 75,000 to 256,000 - an increase the previous street network could not deal with . the construction of the crossroad-free , four-lane highway between cologne and bonn continued .
with 18,000 cars a day , this street along the rhine river was one of the busiest streets in the whole german reich .
in comparison , the front runner today is the highway a100 in berlin , with more than 165,000 cars a day . the constructions on the cologne-bonn highway began in 1929 .
the project also served as a program for provision of employment for the many unemployed in the region .
at the peak of construction , more than 125,000 men worked on building the highway . cars only specific laws were applied to the novel street : the new highway was only meant for automobiles , reported the kölnische zeitung newspaper on aug .
5 , 1932 . " due to a specific police order , every other traffic , such as pedestrians , carts , bicyclists , motorcyclists and horse carriage , is prohibited to drive on the street , " it wrote . adenauer 's pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the highway traffic is busier during weekends and holidays cologne 's mayor , who later became germany 's first postwar chancellor , appeared happy that the construction of the first highway was connected to his cologne .

he was right to do so , says dw 's ute schaeffer . from foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's perspective , there are many good reasons to support africa .
a new africa has emerged which , within the realm of the african union , is setting ambitious aims to promote peace .
it 's a new africa that wants to take responsibility to resolve conflicts and wars on the continent itself - as will soon be the case on behalf of the united nations in sudan .
democracy and political integration are the african union 's aims .
nigeria and ghana are important engines of these reform processes , self-confident partners , which are in transition politically and economically and which are taking responsibility regionally and globally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer above all , germany wants to export education and know-how to africa .
specifically , it wants to boost higher education and the exchange of scientists and students and to ramp up stipend programs .
the foreign minister wants to reverse bit by bit the mistakes of the past 15 years , when goethe institutes and embassies were closed in africa , and to considerably increase germany 's presence in africa .
that 's important , since it 's well-known that one can only cooperate well on the basis of trust and knowledge of one another .
that 's where germany has thoroughly lost ground over the years .
new actors , such as china , india or brazil - which do n't engage in strenuous discussions of values with their african partners but instead bring the continent investments , infrastructure and inexpensive products - have profited .
they do n't make developmental policy in africa , but economic policy - and the demand they generate ensures a clearly visible boom at least in africa 's resource-rich states .
these new actors have awakened the old ones .
in the battle for minds in africa , the issue is not lastly whether a sustainable and broad movement for more democracy will emerge .
for , that would be the most important prerequisite for the people to also benefit from economic growth .
that 's not the case in most of the african states that are rich in raw materials .
most people in those places are untouched by their countries ' wealth ; the number of people living in poverty has hardly changed .
a bad example is nigeria , where two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty .
germany does n't want to compete with the new actors - nor can it .
instead , germany 's africa policy is clearly set on partnership with states that are prepared to undertake reforms .
that 's also why the german foreign minister did without a business delegation and instead placed cultural and scientific exchange at the heart of his trip to nigeria and ghana .
but this time , too , readymade concepts ca n't be carried over .
on many points the two sides talk at cross purposes .
nigeria 's leadership called for german investment and more cooperation in the energy sector when they met with steinmeier .
and in ghana , too , the focus was on more economic cooperation .
that is exactly what the " new africa " demands in exchange for more reforms .
above all , africa is interested in the abolition of trade barriers , the targeted promotion of economic relations .
but during his first africa trip , the topic of business had shortened or limited talks , and this time steinmeier wanted to avoid that .
the new cultural policy approach for africa is forward-looking and ambitious .
it can advance development in africa .
at the same time though , this approach requires enduring and patient interest - a difficult and , certainly , a long route .
for , the results of cultural cooperation only appear after years and are far less visible than the stadiums , streets , pipelines or hospitals built by the chinese .
a long wind and a lot of promotion of the idea in germany as well as with the african partners will be necessary for the project to be a success .
africa has finally regained the significance that , in view of the global situation , it should have , seeing as none of the pressing problems in the international community - climate , energy security , terrorism , migration - can be solved without the continent .
incidentally , that was already the case 10 or 15 years ago , but it was n't discussed adequately in the public sphere .
it 's good that that 's now changing .
it 's high time !

he was right to do so , says dw 's ute schaeffer . from foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's perspective , there are many good reasons to support africa .
a new africa has emerged which , within the realm of the african union , is setting ambitious aims to promote peace .
it 's a new africa that wants to take responsibility to resolve conflicts and wars on the continent itself - as will soon be the case on behalf of the united nations in sudan .
democracy and political integration are the african union 's aims .
nigeria and ghana are important engines of these reform processes , self-confident partners , which are in transition politically and economically and which are taking responsibility regionally and globally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer above all , germany wants to export education and know-how to africa .
specifically , it wants to boost higher education and the exchange of scientists and students and to ramp up stipend programs .
the foreign minister wants to reverse bit by bit the mistakes of the past 15 years , when goethe institutes and embassies were closed in africa , and to considerably increase germany 's presence in africa .
that 's important , since it 's well-known that one can only cooperate well on the basis of trust and knowledge of one another .
that 's where germany has thoroughly lost ground over the years .
new actors , such as china , india or brazil - which do n't engage in strenuous discussions of values with their african partners but instead bring the continent investments , infrastructure and inexpensive products - have profited .
they do n't make developmental policy in africa , but economic policy - and the demand they generate ensures a clearly visible boom at least in africa 's resource-rich states .
these new actors have awakened the old ones .
in the battle for minds in africa , the issue is not lastly whether a sustainable and broad movement for more democracy will emerge .
for , that would be the most important prerequisite for the people to also benefit from economic growth .
that 's not the case in most of the african states that are rich in raw materials .
most people in those places are untouched by their countries ' wealth ; the number of people living in poverty has hardly changed .
a bad example is nigeria , where two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty .
germany does n't want to compete with the new actors - nor can it .
instead , germany 's africa policy is clearly set on partnership with states that are prepared to undertake reforms .
that 's also why the german foreign minister did without a business delegation and instead placed cultural and scientific exchange at the heart of his trip to nigeria and ghana .
but this time , too , readymade concepts ca n't be carried over .
on many points the two sides talk at cross purposes .
nigeria 's leadership called for german investment and more cooperation in the energy sector when they met with steinmeier .
and in ghana , too , the focus was on more economic cooperation .
that is exactly what the " new africa " demands in exchange for more reforms .
above all , africa is interested in the abolition of trade barriers , the targeted promotion of economic relations .
but during his first africa trip , the topic of business had shortened or limited talks , and this time steinmeier wanted to avoid that .
the new cultural policy approach for africa is forward-looking and ambitious .
it can advance development in africa .
at the same time though , this approach requires enduring and patient interest - a difficult and , certainly , a long route .
for , the results of cultural cooperation only appear after years and are far less visible than the stadiums , streets , pipelines or hospitals built by the chinese .
a long wind and a lot of promotion of the idea in germany as well as with the african partners will be necessary for the project to be a success .
africa has finally regained the significance that , in view of the global situation , it should have , seeing as none of the pressing problems in the international community - climate , energy security , terrorism , migration - can be solved without the continent .
incidentally , that was already the case 10 or 15 years ago , but it was n't discussed adequately in the public sphere .
it 's good that that 's now changing .
it 's high time !

a woman found the music in her family 's summer home near moscow . it 's no surprise that music from hitler favorite composers such as richard wagner and ludwig van beethoven would turn up in the nazi leader 's personal record collection .
yet a moscow attic has yielded a more complex picture of the führer 's musical taste .
nearly 100 records suggest hitler also listened to russian and jewish musicians declared " subhuman " by the nazis , according to an article in the current issue of der spiegel magazine .
a surprising find bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler during the wagner festival in bayreuth in 1945 , lew besymenski , a captain in russia 's military intelligence unit , went with two other officers to the recently captured reich chancellery in berlin .
the headquarters of the nazi party were located near the secret underground bunker where hitler committed suicide at the end of world war ii .
besymenski 's comrades took silverware engraved with hitler 's initials home with them as souvenirs .
besymenski , a music lover , made an unexpected find .
behind several large steel doors that had been closed with special locks were boxes filled with personal belongings .
" it presented us with an odd sight : in each of the rooms there were numerous rows of sturdy wooden boxes all of them numbered , " besymenski wrote in a memoir years later , der spiegel reported .
the boxes were awaiting transfer to hitler 's mountain fortress in southern germany and were filled with plates and various household goods , including hitler 's records .
records kept in an attic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tchaikovsky was a russian composer considered sub-human besymenski 's daughter , alexandra besymenskaja , who is now 53 , accidentally came across the box in 1991 when she was at the family summer home near moscow . she had been sent to the attic to look for a badminton racket .
her shin hit something hard and she saw that she 'd run into a stack of records labeled führerhauptquartier , as the reich chancellery is called in german .
she asked her 70-year-old father about the records , but he did n't want to talk about them , saying that he had only listened for years to cds .
besymenski did n't want to be seen as a marauder who had ransacked the enemy 's personal belongings .
he had taken them because music was his personal passion , his daughter said .
when he died in june at the age of 86 , his daughter decided to talk publicly about her father 's record collection .
of the 100 discs , some are scratched , others are warped or broken , but many remain in relatively good condition .
the records include beethoven 's piano sonatas and wagner 's famous opera " the flying dutchman . "
hitler loved music , attending the opera almost daily during the time he lived in vienna .
hitler 's hypocrisy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner was a hitler favorite surprisingly , hitler 's collection also included russian composers labeled by the nazis as " subhuman " such as peter tchaikovsky , alexander borodin and sergei rachmaninoff , der spiegel reported .
one of the tchaikovsky records featured the star violinist bronislaw huberman , a polish jew forced to flee europe when the nazis took over .
hitler did n't care who had made the music he listened to in his bunker , despite in his book " mein kampf " stating that jewish art had never existed .
besymenski , who was a jew himself , was surprised that so many famous russian composers were included in hitler 's record collection , according to the memoir he wrote after being pressured by his daughter to record how he had had ended up with the collection .
" i feel that is complete mockery , " besymenskaja told the magazine .

a woman found the music in her family 's summer home near moscow . it 's no surprise that music from hitler favorite composers such as richard wagner and ludwig van beethoven would turn up in the nazi leader 's personal record collection .
yet a moscow attic has yielded a more complex picture of the führer 's musical taste .
nearly 100 records suggest hitler also listened to russian and jewish musicians declared " subhuman " by the nazis , according to an article in the current issue of der spiegel magazine .
a surprising find bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler during the wagner festival in bayreuth in 1945 , lew besymenski , a captain in russia 's military intelligence unit , went with two other officers to the recently captured reich chancellery in berlin .
the headquarters of the nazi party were located near the secret underground bunker where hitler committed suicide at the end of world war ii .
besymenski 's comrades took silverware engraved with hitler 's initials home with them as souvenirs .
besymenski , a music lover , made an unexpected find .
behind several large steel doors that had been closed with special locks were boxes filled with personal belongings .
" it presented us with an odd sight : in each of the rooms there were numerous rows of sturdy wooden boxes all of them numbered , " besymenski wrote in a memoir years later , der spiegel reported .
the boxes were awaiting transfer to hitler 's mountain fortress in southern germany and were filled with plates and various household goods , including hitler 's records .
records kept in an attic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tchaikovsky was a russian composer considered sub-human besymenski 's daughter , alexandra besymenskaja , who is now 53 , accidentally came across the box in 1991 when she was at the family summer home near moscow . she had been sent to the attic to look for a badminton racket .
her shin hit something hard and she saw that she 'd run into a stack of records labeled führerhauptquartier , as the reich chancellery is called in german .
she asked her 70-year-old father about the records , but he did n't want to talk about them , saying that he had only listened for years to cds .
besymenski did n't want to be seen as a marauder who had ransacked the enemy 's personal belongings .
he had taken them because music was his personal passion , his daughter said .
when he died in june at the age of 86 , his daughter decided to talk publicly about her father 's record collection .
of the 100 discs , some are scratched , others are warped or broken , but many remain in relatively good condition .
the records include beethoven 's piano sonatas and wagner 's famous opera " the flying dutchman . "
hitler loved music , attending the opera almost daily during the time he lived in vienna .
hitler 's hypocrisy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner was a hitler favorite surprisingly , hitler 's collection also included russian composers labeled by the nazis as " subhuman " such as peter tchaikovsky , alexander borodin and sergei rachmaninoff , der spiegel reported .
one of the tchaikovsky records featured the star violinist bronislaw huberman , a polish jew forced to flee europe when the nazis took over .
hitler did n't care who had made the music he listened to in his bunker , despite in his book " mein kampf " stating that jewish art had never existed .
besymenski , who was a jew himself , was surprised that so many famous russian composers were included in hitler 's record collection , according to the memoir he wrote after being pressured by his daughter to record how he had had ended up with the collection .

" this is what the future of streets looks like , " said cologne mayor konrad adenauer when he opened the highway for traffic on aug .
6 , 1932 . the highway was officially called the " automobile street " and there were no middle lanes .
it had two lanes going in each direction and there were no crossroads . it opened six months before the takeover of the nazis , who - through propaganda - spread the belief that hitler invented the highway . private predecessor the autobahn 's roots actually went back even a little further .
the first highway-like street , the so-called " avus " in berlin , opened in 1921 as an experimental motor racing circuit , financed privately . it was mostly used as a race- and testing track .
driving on the cologne highway , on the other hand , was open for any automobile , free of charge . in 1927 , a plan was put up for the construction of a 22,000-kilometer -lrb- 13,670-mile -rrb- highway network throughout germany .
the idea was filed , due to the 1929 new york market crash and the economic crisis that followed . rising traffic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has managed to build 7,705 miles of highways throughout the country this , however , did not change the fact that traffic issues kept rising : between 1920 and 1925 , the number of cars in the german reich rose from 75,000 to 256,000 - an increase the previous street network could not deal with . the construction of the crossroad-free , four-lane highway between cologne and bonn continued .
with 18,000 cars a day , this street along the rhine river was one of the busiest streets in the whole german reich .
in comparison , the front runner today is the highway a100 in berlin , with more than 165,000 cars a day . the constructions on the cologne-bonn highway began in 1929 .
the project also served as a program for provision of employment for the many unemployed in the region .
at the peak of construction , more than 125,000 men worked on building the highway . cars only specific laws were applied to the novel street : the new highway was only meant for automobiles , reported the kölnische zeitung newspaper on aug .
5 , 1932 . " due to a specific police order , every other traffic , such as pedestrians , carts , bicyclists , motorcyclists and horse carriage , is prohibited to drive on the street , " it wrote . adenauer 's pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the highway traffic is busier during weekends and holidays cologne 's mayor , who later became germany 's first postwar chancellor , appeared happy that the construction of the first highway was connected to his cologne . " we can be proud and pleased by the fact that this new traffic technology begins in cologne , " adenauer wrote in kölnische zeitung . germany 's highway system has since become a network that spans some 12,400 kilometers .
the cologne-bonn stretch is still part of it : it was named a555 in 1955 and expanded to six lanes 10 years later . article based on news reports -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the lawmakers were responding to prosecutors ' confirmation that 17 reporters were under investigation for quoting from classified documents intended for a parliamentary panel probing the activities of germany 's intelligence services .
" clarity must be established through legislation , " said green party chief reinhard bütikofer on ard television .
" it can not be that journalists who do their duty - exposing that which possibly shuns the public light - may then later be prosecuted . "
bütikofer 's party vetted a bill on the topic last year , but it was quashed in may by votes from parliamentarians from germany 's ruling coalition of christian democrats and social democrats .
opposition party lawmakers and panel members max stadler of the free democratic party and wolfgang neskovic of the left party also said in the neue presse newspaper that current legislation should be amended to protect journalists .
large , leaky apparatus neskovic rejected the suggestion that members of the panel investigating the activities of germany 's bnd intelligence service , or their staff members , had leaked the documents to the press . " certainly more than 100 people had access to these files - government civil servants also , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reporters for some of germany 's leading newspapers are being probed his comments were echoed by panel colleague michael hartmann , a social democrat . " the apparatus is large .
above all … there are the ministries , " he said in the mainzer allgemeine zeitung daily .
" some documents were already public before we , the member 's of the panel , even got them in our hands . "

" i am in favor of extending our assistance in training and equipping the afghan army , " steinmeier told the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
the remarks came amid a debate that has taken on renewed urgency in germany since two german engineers were kidnapped in afghanistan on july 18 .
one has been killed and the other is still being held by his abductors .
steinmeier said germany could begin considering withdrawing its 3,000 ground troops engaged in a reconstruction mission in the north of afghanistan only once afghan forces could guarantee security .
" if we give up now , then the taliban will have reached their goal , " the social democrat said .

polenz was responding to a renewed call from nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer in germany 's weekend press for germany to give more military assistance to afghanistan .
polenz said it was possible that " the german troop contingent could be slightly strengthened , " but he stressed the need for afghan forces to play a larger role .
" we must avoid that the foreign forces are seen as an occupying army , " polenz said .

he was right to do so , says dw 's ute schaeffer . from foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's perspective , there are many good reasons to support africa .
a new africa has emerged which , within the realm of the african union , is setting ambitious aims to promote peace .
it 's a new africa that wants to take responsibility to resolve conflicts and wars on the continent itself - as will soon be the case on behalf of the united nations in sudan .
democracy and political integration are the african union 's aims .
nigeria and ghana are important engines of these reform processes , self-confident partners , which are in transition politically and economically and which are taking responsibility regionally and globally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer above all , germany wants to export education and know-how to africa .
specifically , it wants to boost higher education and the exchange of scientists and students and to ramp up stipend programs .
the foreign minister wants to reverse bit by bit the mistakes of the past 15 years , when goethe institutes and embassies were closed in africa , and to considerably increase germany 's presence in africa .
that 's important , since it 's well-known that one can only cooperate well on the basis of trust and knowledge of one another .
that 's where germany has thoroughly lost ground over the years .
new actors , such as china , india or brazil - which do n't engage in strenuous discussions of values with their african partners but instead bring the continent investments , infrastructure and inexpensive products - have profited .
they do n't make developmental policy in africa , but economic policy - and the demand they generate ensures a clearly visible boom at least in africa 's resource-rich states .
these new actors have awakened the old ones .
in the battle for minds in africa , the issue is not lastly whether a sustainable and broad movement for more democracy will emerge .
for , that would be the most important prerequisite for the people to also benefit from economic growth .
that 's not the case in most of the african states that are rich in raw materials .
most people in those places are untouched by their countries ' wealth ; the number of people living in poverty has hardly changed .
a bad example is nigeria , where two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty .
germany does n't want to compete with the new actors - nor can it .
instead , germany 's africa policy is clearly set on partnership with states that are prepared to undertake reforms .
that 's also why the german foreign minister did without a business delegation and instead placed cultural and scientific exchange at the heart of his trip to nigeria and ghana .
but this time , too , readymade concepts ca n't be carried over .
on many points the two sides talk at cross purposes .
nigeria 's leadership called for german investment and more cooperation in the energy sector when they met with steinmeier .
and in ghana , too , the focus was on more economic cooperation .
that is exactly what the " new africa " demands in exchange for more reforms .
above all , africa is interested in the abolition of trade barriers , the targeted promotion of economic relations .
but during his first africa trip , the topic of business had shortened or limited talks , and this time steinmeier wanted to avoid that .
the new cultural policy approach for africa is forward-looking and ambitious .
it can advance development in africa .
at the same time though , this approach requires enduring and patient interest - a difficult and , certainly , a long route .
for , the results of cultural cooperation only appear after years and are far less visible than the stadiums , streets , pipelines or hospitals built by the chinese .
a long wind and a lot of promotion of the idea in germany as well as with the african partners will be necessary for the project to be a success .
africa has finally regained the significance that , in view of the global situation , it should have , seeing as none of the pressing problems in the international community - climate , energy security , terrorism , migration - can be solved without the continent .
incidentally , that was already the case 10 or 15 years ago , but it was n't discussed adequately in the public sphere .
it 's good that that 's now changing .
it 's high time !

he was right to do so , says dw 's ute schaeffer . from foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's perspective , there are many good reasons to support africa .
a new africa has emerged which , within the realm of the african union , is setting ambitious aims to promote peace .
it 's a new africa that wants to take responsibility to resolve conflicts and wars on the continent itself - as will soon be the case on behalf of the united nations in sudan .
democracy and political integration are the african union 's aims .
nigeria and ghana are important engines of these reform processes , self-confident partners , which are in transition politically and economically and which are taking responsibility regionally and globally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer above all , germany wants to export education and know-how to africa .
specifically , it wants to boost higher education and the exchange of scientists and students and to ramp up stipend programs .
the foreign minister wants to reverse bit by bit the mistakes of the past 15 years , when goethe institutes and embassies were closed in africa , and to considerably increase germany 's presence in africa .
that 's important , since it 's well-known that one can only cooperate well on the basis of trust and knowledge of one another .
that 's where germany has thoroughly lost ground over the years .
new actors , such as china , india or brazil - which do n't engage in strenuous discussions of values with their african partners but instead bring the continent investments , infrastructure and inexpensive products - have profited .
they do n't make developmental policy in africa , but economic policy - and the demand they generate ensures a clearly visible boom at least in africa 's resource-rich states .
these new actors have awakened the old ones .
in the battle for minds in africa , the issue is not lastly whether a sustainable and broad movement for more democracy will emerge .
for , that would be the most important prerequisite for the people to also benefit from economic growth .
that 's not the case in most of the african states that are rich in raw materials .
most people in those places are untouched by their countries ' wealth ; the number of people living in poverty has hardly changed .
a bad example is nigeria , where two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty .
germany does n't want to compete with the new actors - nor can it .
instead , germany 's africa policy is clearly set on partnership with states that are prepared to undertake reforms .
that 's also why the german foreign minister did without a business delegation and instead placed cultural and scientific exchange at the heart of his trip to nigeria and ghana .

a woman found the music in her family 's summer home near moscow . it 's no surprise that music from hitler favorite composers such as richard wagner and ludwig van beethoven would turn up in the nazi leader 's personal record collection .
yet a moscow attic has yielded a more complex picture of the führer 's musical taste .
nearly 100 records suggest hitler also listened to russian and jewish musicians declared " subhuman " by the nazis , according to an article in the current issue of der spiegel magazine .
a surprising find bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler during the wagner festival in bayreuth in 1945 , lew besymenski , a captain in russia 's military intelligence unit , went with two other officers to the recently captured reich chancellery in berlin .
the headquarters of the nazi party were located near the secret underground bunker where hitler committed suicide at the end of world war ii .
besymenski 's comrades took silverware engraved with hitler 's initials home with them as souvenirs .
besymenski , a music lover , made an unexpected find .
behind several large steel doors that had been closed with special locks were boxes filled with personal belongings .
" it presented us with an odd sight : in each of the rooms there were numerous rows of sturdy wooden boxes all of them numbered , " besymenski wrote in a memoir years later , der spiegel reported .
the boxes were awaiting transfer to hitler 's mountain fortress in southern germany and were filled with plates and various household goods , including hitler 's records .
records kept in an attic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tchaikovsky was a russian composer considered sub-human besymenski 's daughter , alexandra besymenskaja , who is now 53 , accidentally came across the box in 1991 when she was at the family summer home near moscow . she had been sent to the attic to look for a badminton racket .
her shin hit something hard and she saw that she 'd run into a stack of records labeled führerhauptquartier , as the reich chancellery is called in german .
she asked her 70-year-old father about the records , but he did n't want to talk about them , saying that he had only listened for years to cds .
besymenski did n't want to be seen as a marauder who had ransacked the enemy 's personal belongings .
he had taken them because music was his personal passion , his daughter said .
when he died in june at the age of 86 , his daughter decided to talk publicly about her father 's record collection .
of the 100 discs , some are scratched , others are warped or broken , but many remain in relatively good condition .
the records include beethoven 's piano sonatas and wagner 's famous opera " the flying dutchman . "
hitler loved music , attending the opera almost daily during the time he lived in vienna .
hitler 's hypocrisy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner was a hitler favorite surprisingly , hitler 's collection also included russian composers labeled by the nazis as " subhuman " such as peter tchaikovsky , alexander borodin and sergei rachmaninoff , der spiegel reported .
one of the tchaikovsky records featured the star violinist bronislaw huberman , a polish jew forced to flee europe when the nazis took over .
hitler did n't care who had made the music he listened to in his bunker , despite in his book " mein kampf " stating that jewish art had never existed .
besymenski , who was a jew himself , was surprised that so many famous russian composers were included in hitler 's record collection , according to the memoir he wrote after being pressured by his daughter to record how he had had ended up with the collection .
" i feel that is complete mockery , " besymenskaja told the magazine .

a surprising find bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler during the wagner festival in bayreuth in 1945 , lew besymenski , a captain in russia 's military intelligence unit , went with two other officers to the recently captured reich chancellery in berlin .
the headquarters of the nazi party were located near the secret underground bunker where hitler committed suicide at the end of world war ii .
besymenski 's comrades took silverware engraved with hitler 's initials home with them as souvenirs .
besymenski , a music lover , made an unexpected find .
behind several large steel doors that had been closed with special locks were boxes filled with personal belongings .
" it presented us with an odd sight : in each of the rooms there were numerous rows of sturdy wooden boxes all of them numbered , " besymenski wrote in a memoir years later , der spiegel reported .
the boxes were awaiting transfer to hitler 's mountain fortress in southern germany and were filled with plates and various household goods , including hitler 's records .
records kept in an attic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tchaikovsky was a russian composer considered sub-human besymenski 's daughter , alexandra besymenskaja , who is now 53 , accidentally came across the box in 1991 when she was at the family summer home near moscow . she had been sent to the attic to look for a badminton racket .
her shin hit something hard and she saw that she 'd run into a stack of records labeled führerhauptquartier , as the reich chancellery is called in german .
she asked her 70-year-old father about the records , but he did n't want to talk about them , saying that he had only listened for years to cds .
besymenski did n't want to be seen as a marauder who had ransacked the enemy 's personal belongings .
he had taken them because music was his personal passion , his daughter said .
when he died in june at the age of 86 , his daughter decided to talk publicly about her father 's record collection .
of the 100 discs , some are scratched , others are warped or broken , but many remain in relatively good condition .
the records include beethoven 's piano sonatas and wagner 's famous opera " the flying dutchman . "
hitler loved music , attending the opera almost daily during the time he lived in vienna .
hitler 's hypocrisy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner was a hitler favorite surprisingly , hitler 's collection also included russian composers labeled by the nazis as " subhuman " such as peter tchaikovsky , alexander borodin and sergei rachmaninoff , der spiegel reported .
one of the tchaikovsky records featured the star violinist bronislaw huberman , a polish jew forced to flee europe when the nazis took over .
hitler did n't care who had made the music he listened to in his bunker , despite in his book " mein kampf " stating that jewish art had never existed .
besymenski , who was a jew himself , was surprised that so many famous russian composers were included in hitler 's record collection , according to the memoir he wrote after being pressured by his daughter to record how he had had ended up with the collection .

the lawmakers were responding to prosecutors ' confirmation that 17 reporters were under investigation for quoting from classified documents intended for a parliamentary panel probing the activities of germany 's intelligence services .
" clarity must be established through legislation , " said green party chief reinhard bütikofer on ard television .
" it can not be that journalists who do their duty - exposing that which possibly shuns the public light - may then later be prosecuted . "
bütikofer 's party vetted a bill on the topic last year , but it was quashed in may by votes from parliamentarians from germany 's ruling coalition of christian democrats and social democrats .
opposition party lawmakers and panel members max stadler of the free democratic party and wolfgang neskovic of the left party also said in the neue presse newspaper that current legislation should be amended to protect journalists .
large , leaky apparatus neskovic rejected the suggestion that members of the panel investigating the activities of germany 's bnd intelligence service , or their staff members , had leaked the documents to the press . " certainly more than 100 people had access to these files - government civil servants also , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reporters for some of germany 's leading newspapers are being probed his comments were echoed by panel colleague michael hartmann , a social democrat . " the apparatus is large .
above all … there are the ministries , " he said in the mainzer allgemeine zeitung daily .
" some documents were already public before we , the member 's of the panel , even got them in our hands . "
meanwhile , panel head siegfried kauder of the christian democrats defended the investigations of journalists .
" the federal chancellery had already indicated to me that it would not provide the panel with any more classified files if this were to continue , " he told the neue presse .
kauder said he felt like he had to take action . " my aim was to batten down the hatches , " he said .
" i want to find out who the informant or informants are . "
" excessive and ineffectual " the editors in chief of the affected newspapers published a joint declaration criticizing the prosecutors .
they called the investigations an " excessive and ineffectual attempt " to limit the freedom to report , according to the associated press .
the statement said their aim was to prevent the public from learning details about the handling of murat kurnaz .
the german-born turk spent four-and-a-half years at the us military prison at guantanamo in cuba before being released without charge .
his case was one of the topics examined by the panel , which was set up in april 2006 .
it was tasked with examining whether german intelligence services had violated human rights in the fight against terrorism , and what role the government played . the focus of attention was on the foreign intelligence service bnd and its involvement with the us central intelligence agency at the start of the iraq war in march 2003 . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a woman found the music in her family 's summer home near moscow . it 's no surprise that music from hitler favorite composers such as richard wagner and ludwig van beethoven would turn up in the nazi leader 's personal record collection .
yet a moscow attic has yielded a more complex picture of the führer 's musical taste .
nearly 100 records suggest hitler also listened to russian and jewish musicians declared " subhuman " by the nazis , according to an article in the current issue of der spiegel magazine .
a surprising find bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler during the wagner festival in bayreuth in 1945 , lew besymenski , a captain in russia 's military intelligence unit , went with two other officers to the recently captured reich chancellery in berlin .
the headquarters of the nazi party were located near the secret underground bunker where hitler committed suicide at the end of world war ii .
besymenski 's comrades took silverware engraved with hitler 's initials home with them as souvenirs .
besymenski , a music lover , made an unexpected find .
behind several large steel doors that had been closed with special locks were boxes filled with personal belongings .
" it presented us with an odd sight : in each of the rooms there were numerous rows of sturdy wooden boxes all of them numbered , " besymenski wrote in a memoir years later , der spiegel reported .
the boxes were awaiting transfer to hitler 's mountain fortress in southern germany and were filled with plates and various household goods , including hitler 's records .
records kept in an attic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tchaikovsky was a russian composer considered sub-human besymenski 's daughter , alexandra besymenskaja , who is now 53 , accidentally came across the box in 1991 when she was at the family summer home near moscow . she had been sent to the attic to look for a badminton racket .
her shin hit something hard and she saw that she 'd run into a stack of records labeled führerhauptquartier , as the reich chancellery is called in german .
she asked her 70-year-old father about the records , but he did n't want to talk about them , saying that he had only listened for years to cds .
besymenski did n't want to be seen as a marauder who had ransacked the enemy 's personal belongings .
he had taken them because music was his personal passion , his daughter said .
when he died in june at the age of 86 , his daughter decided to talk publicly about her father 's record collection .
of the 100 discs , some are scratched , others are warped or broken , but many remain in relatively good condition .
the records include beethoven 's piano sonatas and wagner 's famous opera " the flying dutchman . "
hitler loved music , attending the opera almost daily during the time he lived in vienna .
hitler 's hypocrisy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner was a hitler favorite surprisingly , hitler 's collection also included russian composers labeled by the nazis as " subhuman " such as peter tchaikovsky , alexander borodin and sergei rachmaninoff , der spiegel reported .
one of the tchaikovsky records featured the star violinist bronislaw huberman , a polish jew forced to flee europe when the nazis took over .
hitler did n't care who had made the music he listened to in his bunker , despite in his book " mein kampf " stating that jewish art had never existed .
besymenski , who was a jew himself , was surprised that so many famous russian composers were included in hitler 's record collection , according to the memoir he wrote after being pressured by his daughter to record how he had had ended up with the collection .
" i feel that is complete mockery , " besymenskaja told the magazine .

the idea was filed , due to the 1929 new york market crash and the economic crisis that followed . rising traffic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has managed to build 7,705 miles of highways throughout the country this , however , did not change the fact that traffic issues kept rising : between 1920 and 1925 , the number of cars in the german reich rose from 75,000 to 256,000 - an increase the previous street network could not deal with . the construction of the crossroad-free , four-lane highway between cologne and bonn continued .
with 18,000 cars a day , this street along the rhine river was one of the busiest streets in the whole german reich .
in comparison , the front runner today is the highway a100 in berlin , with more than 165,000 cars a day . the constructions on the cologne-bonn highway began in 1929 .
the project also served as a program for provision of employment for the many unemployed in the region .
at the peak of construction , more than 125,000 men worked on building the highway . cars only specific laws were applied to the novel street : the new highway was only meant for automobiles , reported the kölnische zeitung newspaper on aug .
5 , 1932 . " due to a specific police order , every other traffic , such as pedestrians , carts , bicyclists , motorcyclists and horse carriage , is prohibited to drive on the street , " it wrote . adenauer 's pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the highway traffic is busier during weekends and holidays cologne 's mayor , who later became germany 's first postwar chancellor , appeared happy that the construction of the first highway was connected to his cologne . " we can be proud and pleased by the fact that this new traffic technology begins in cologne , " adenauer wrote in kölnische zeitung . germany 's highway system has since become a network that spans some 12,400 kilometers .
the cologne-bonn stretch is still part of it : it was named a555 in 1955 and expanded to six lanes 10 years later . article based on news reports -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a woman found the music in her family 's summer home near moscow . it 's no surprise that music from hitler favorite composers such as richard wagner and ludwig van beethoven would turn up in the nazi leader 's personal record collection .
yet a moscow attic has yielded a more complex picture of the führer 's musical taste .
nearly 100 records suggest hitler also listened to russian and jewish musicians declared " subhuman " by the nazis , according to an article in the current issue of der spiegel magazine .
a surprising find bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler during the wagner festival in bayreuth in 1945 , lew besymenski , a captain in russia 's military intelligence unit , went with two other officers to the recently captured reich chancellery in berlin .
the headquarters of the nazi party were located near the secret underground bunker where hitler committed suicide at the end of world war ii .
besymenski 's comrades took silverware engraved with hitler 's initials home with them as souvenirs .
besymenski , a music lover , made an unexpected find .
behind several large steel doors that had been closed with special locks were boxes filled with personal belongings .
" it presented us with an odd sight : in each of the rooms there were numerous rows of sturdy wooden boxes all of them numbered , " besymenski wrote in a memoir years later , der spiegel reported .
the boxes were awaiting transfer to hitler 's mountain fortress in southern germany and were filled with plates and various household goods , including hitler 's records .
records kept in an attic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tchaikovsky was a russian composer considered sub-human besymenski 's daughter , alexandra besymenskaja , who is now 53 , accidentally came across the box in 1991 when she was at the family summer home near moscow . she had been sent to the attic to look for a badminton racket .
her shin hit something hard and she saw that she 'd run into a stack of records labeled führerhauptquartier , as the reich chancellery is called in german .
she asked her 70-year-old father about the records , but he did n't want to talk about them , saying that he had only listened for years to cds .
besymenski did n't want to be seen as a marauder who had ransacked the enemy 's personal belongings .
he had taken them because music was his personal passion , his daughter said .
when he died in june at the age of 86 , his daughter decided to talk publicly about her father 's record collection .
of the 100 discs , some are scratched , others are warped or broken , but many remain in relatively good condition .
the records include beethoven 's piano sonatas and wagner 's famous opera " the flying dutchman . "
hitler loved music , attending the opera almost daily during the time he lived in vienna .
hitler 's hypocrisy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner was a hitler favorite surprisingly , hitler 's collection also included russian composers labeled by the nazis as " subhuman " such as peter tchaikovsky , alexander borodin and sergei rachmaninoff , der spiegel reported .
one of the tchaikovsky records featured the star violinist bronislaw huberman , a polish jew forced to flee europe when the nazis took over .
hitler did n't care who had made the music he listened to in his bunker , despite in his book " mein kampf " stating that jewish art had never existed .
besymenski , who was a jew himself , was surprised that so many famous russian composers were included in hitler 's record collection , according to the memoir he wrote after being pressured by his daughter to record how he had had ended up with the collection .
" i feel that is complete mockery , " besymenskaja told the magazine .

the lawmakers were responding to prosecutors ' confirmation that 17 reporters were under investigation for quoting from classified documents intended for a parliamentary panel probing the activities of germany 's intelligence services .
" clarity must be established through legislation , " said green party chief reinhard bütikofer on ard television .
" it can not be that journalists who do their duty - exposing that which possibly shuns the public light - may then later be prosecuted . "
bütikofer 's party vetted a bill on the topic last year , but it was quashed in may by votes from parliamentarians from germany 's ruling coalition of christian democrats and social democrats .
opposition party lawmakers and panel members max stadler of the free democratic party and wolfgang neskovic of the left party also said in the neue presse newspaper that current legislation should be amended to protect journalists .

a woman found the music in her family 's summer home near moscow . it 's no surprise that music from hitler favorite composers such as richard wagner and ludwig van beethoven would turn up in the nazi leader 's personal record collection .
yet a moscow attic has yielded a more complex picture of the führer 's musical taste .
nearly 100 records suggest hitler also listened to russian and jewish musicians declared " subhuman " by the nazis , according to an article in the current issue of der spiegel magazine .
a surprising find bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler during the wagner festival in bayreuth in 1945 , lew besymenski , a captain in russia 's military intelligence unit , went with two other officers to the recently captured reich chancellery in berlin .
the headquarters of the nazi party were located near the secret underground bunker where hitler committed suicide at the end of world war ii .
besymenski 's comrades took silverware engraved with hitler 's initials home with them as souvenirs .
besymenski , a music lover , made an unexpected find .
behind several large steel doors that had been closed with special locks were boxes filled with personal belongings .
" it presented us with an odd sight : in each of the rooms there were numerous rows of sturdy wooden boxes all of them numbered , " besymenski wrote in a memoir years later , der spiegel reported .
the boxes were awaiting transfer to hitler 's mountain fortress in southern germany and were filled with plates and various household goods , including hitler 's records .
records kept in an attic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tchaikovsky was a russian composer considered sub-human besymenski 's daughter , alexandra besymenskaja , who is now 53 , accidentally came across the box in 1991 when she was at the family summer home near moscow . she had been sent to the attic to look for a badminton racket .
her shin hit something hard and she saw that she 'd run into a stack of records labeled führerhauptquartier , as the reich chancellery is called in german .
she asked her 70-year-old father about the records , but he did n't want to talk about them , saying that he had only listened for years to cds .
besymenski did n't want to be seen as a marauder who had ransacked the enemy 's personal belongings .
he had taken them because music was his personal passion , his daughter said .
when he died in june at the age of 86 , his daughter decided to talk publicly about her father 's record collection .
of the 100 discs , some are scratched , others are warped or broken , but many remain in relatively good condition .
the records include beethoven 's piano sonatas and wagner 's famous opera " the flying dutchman . "
hitler loved music , attending the opera almost daily during the time he lived in vienna .
hitler 's hypocrisy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner was a hitler favorite surprisingly , hitler 's collection also included russian composers labeled by the nazis as " subhuman " such as peter tchaikovsky , alexander borodin and sergei rachmaninoff , der spiegel reported .
one of the tchaikovsky records featured the star violinist bronislaw huberman , a polish jew forced to flee europe when the nazis took over .
hitler did n't care who had made the music he listened to in his bunker , despite in his book " mein kampf " stating that jewish art had never existed .
besymenski , who was a jew himself , was surprised that so many famous russian composers were included in hitler 's record collection , according to the memoir he wrote after being pressured by his daughter to record how he had had ended up with the collection .

starting wednesday , millions of passengers throughout the country could be left stranded . gdl union officials said that 95.8 percent of the 12,000 union members voted in favor of the strike . the union aims to achieve a separate labor contract and a pay rise of up to 31 percent . a last-ditch attempt to avert industrial action failed on friday when gdl rejected a new offer by the state-owned railways deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- . schell said he expected that 90 percent of the 12,000 members eligible to take part in the ballot would vote in favor of striking .
it would be the first major strike to hit the rail company in 15 years . in an interview with the welt am sonntag newspaper , gdl chairman manfred schell said the only way the deutsche bahn would avoid strikes in the coming week would be to make an acceptable offer by tuesday . " nothing else is going to work , " schell added . unions demand different deals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schell said he expected the vast majority of union members to support a strike deutsche bahn has offered an inflation-beating 4.5-percent increase , the same it agreed with two larger unions representing 134,000 workers , following a series of pinpoint strikes last month . but the rail operator has refused to sanction a separate contract for the smaller gdl , arguing that such a move could prompt the other unions to make fresh demands . the gdl maintains that train drivers , some of them piloting passenger trains at speeds in excess of 200 kilometers an hour , earn as little as 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,070 -rrb- a month in take-home pay . db claims that most drivers earn supplements that lift net pay to 2,100 euros . pack up the car bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lobby group said rail passengers should drive themselves if a strike occurs in order to avoid delays , the rail passenger lobby group pro bahn has recommended that people who have not yet bought train tickets should travel by car , while those who already have tickets should call the bahn hotline or visit its web site for the latest information , the group 's chairman karl-peter naumann told the afp news agency on sunday . the rail operator is drawing up contingency plans to cushion the impacts of the strike , including the use of buses for local services and drafting in administrative staff with train drivers ' licenses . the planned general strike would affect some 5 million people daily by stopping some 28,000 passenger trains and 4,780 cargo trains . bahn threatens suit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdorn said the bahn may begin training more train conductors deutsche bahn chief executive hartmut mehdorn 's has warned that the dispute could cost the company millions of euros and threatened to sue the union for damages if their action is deemed illegal . " if illegal actions lead to millions in damages for the bahn , we naturally want compensation for them , " he told der speigel newsmagazine on saturday . gdl head schell called mehdorn statement " completely absurd " and said the union would neither be influenced by the bahn 's tactics nor start an illegal labor fight . the union sought a series of injunctions to avert the stoppage but was successful only in germany 's most populous state of north rhine-westphalia , where a labor court outlawed industrial action in local services . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a woman found the music in her family 's summer home near moscow . it 's no surprise that music from hitler favorite composers such as richard wagner and ludwig van beethoven would turn up in the nazi leader 's personal record collection .
yet a moscow attic has yielded a more complex picture of the führer 's musical taste .
nearly 100 records suggest hitler also listened to russian and jewish musicians declared " subhuman " by the nazis , according to an article in the current issue of der spiegel magazine .
a surprising find bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler during the wagner festival in bayreuth in 1945 , lew besymenski , a captain in russia 's military intelligence unit , went with two other officers to the recently captured reich chancellery in berlin .
the headquarters of the nazi party were located near the secret underground bunker where hitler committed suicide at the end of world war ii .
besymenski 's comrades took silverware engraved with hitler 's initials home with them as souvenirs .
besymenski , a music lover , made an unexpected find .
behind several large steel doors that had been closed with special locks were boxes filled with personal belongings .
" it presented us with an odd sight : in each of the rooms there were numerous rows of sturdy wooden boxes all of them numbered , " besymenski wrote in a memoir years later , der spiegel reported .
the boxes were awaiting transfer to hitler 's mountain fortress in southern germany and were filled with plates and various household goods , including hitler 's records .
records kept in an attic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tchaikovsky was a russian composer considered sub-human besymenski 's daughter , alexandra besymenskaja , who is now 53 , accidentally came across the box in 1991 when she was at the family summer home near moscow . she had been sent to the attic to look for a badminton racket .
her shin hit something hard and she saw that she 'd run into a stack of records labeled führerhauptquartier , as the reich chancellery is called in german .
she asked her 70-year-old father about the records , but he did n't want to talk about them , saying that he had only listened for years to cds .
besymenski did n't want to be seen as a marauder who had ransacked the enemy 's personal belongings .
he had taken them because music was his personal passion , his daughter said .
when he died in june at the age of 86 , his daughter decided to talk publicly about her father 's record collection .
of the 100 discs , some are scratched , others are warped or broken , but many remain in relatively good condition .
the records include beethoven 's piano sonatas and wagner 's famous opera " the flying dutchman . "
hitler loved music , attending the opera almost daily during the time he lived in vienna .
hitler 's hypocrisy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner was a hitler favorite surprisingly , hitler 's collection also included russian composers labeled by the nazis as " subhuman " such as peter tchaikovsky , alexander borodin and sergei rachmaninoff , der spiegel reported .
one of the tchaikovsky records featured the star violinist bronislaw huberman , a polish jew forced to flee europe when the nazis took over .
hitler did n't care who had made the music he listened to in his bunker , despite in his book " mein kampf " stating that jewish art had never existed .
besymenski , who was a jew himself , was surprised that so many famous russian composers were included in hitler 's record collection , according to the memoir he wrote after being pressured by his daughter to record how he had had ended up with the collection .

the lawmakers were responding to prosecutors ' confirmation that 17 reporters were under investigation for quoting from classified documents intended for a parliamentary panel probing the activities of germany 's intelligence services .
" clarity must be established through legislation , " said green party chief reinhard bütikofer on ard television .
" it can not be that journalists who do their duty - exposing that which possibly shuns the public light - may then later be prosecuted . "
bütikofer 's party vetted a bill on the topic last year , but it was quashed in may by votes from parliamentarians from germany 's ruling coalition of christian democrats and social democrats .
opposition party lawmakers and panel members max stadler of the free democratic party and wolfgang neskovic of the left party also said in the neue presse newspaper that current legislation should be amended to protect journalists .
large , leaky apparatus neskovic rejected the suggestion that members of the panel investigating the activities of germany 's bnd intelligence service , or their staff members , had leaked the documents to the press . " certainly more than 100 people had access to these files - government civil servants also , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reporters for some of germany 's leading newspapers are being probed his comments were echoed by panel colleague michael hartmann , a social democrat . " the apparatus is large .
above all … there are the ministries , " he said in the mainzer allgemeine zeitung daily .
" some documents were already public before we , the member 's of the panel , even got them in our hands . "
meanwhile , panel head siegfried kauder of the christian democrats defended the investigations of journalists .
" the federal chancellery had already indicated to me that it would not provide the panel with any more classified files if this were to continue , " he told the neue presse .
kauder said he felt like he had to take action . " my aim was to batten down the hatches , " he said .
" i want to find out who the informant or informants are . "
" excessive and ineffectual " the editors in chief of the affected newspapers published a joint declaration criticizing the prosecutors .
they called the investigations an " excessive and ineffectual attempt " to limit the freedom to report , according to the associated press .
the statement said their aim was to prevent the public from learning details about the handling of murat kurnaz .
the german-born turk spent four-and-a-half years at the us military prison at guantanamo in cuba before being released without charge .
his case was one of the topics examined by the panel , which was set up in april 2006 .
it was tasked with examining whether german intelligence services had violated human rights in the fight against terrorism , and what role the government played . the focus of attention was on the foreign intelligence service bnd and its involvement with the us central intelligence agency at the start of the iraq war in march 2003 . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is what the future of streets looks like , " said cologne mayor konrad adenauer when he opened the highway for traffic on aug .
6 , 1932 . the highway was officially called the " automobile street " and there were no middle lanes .
it had two lanes going in each direction and there were no crossroads . it opened six months before the takeover of the nazis , who - through propaganda - spread the belief that hitler invented the highway . private predecessor the autobahn 's roots actually went back even a little further .
the first highway-like street , the so-called " avus " in berlin , opened in 1921 as an experimental motor racing circuit , financed privately . it was mostly used as a race- and testing track .
driving on the cologne highway , on the other hand , was open for any automobile , free of charge . in 1927 , a plan was put up for the construction of a 22,000-kilometer -lrb- 13,670-mile -rrb- highway network throughout germany .

" this is what the future of streets looks like , " said cologne mayor konrad adenauer when he opened the highway for traffic on aug .
6 , 1932 . the highway was officially called the " automobile street " and there were no middle lanes .
it had two lanes going in each direction and there were no crossroads . it opened six months before the takeover of the nazis , who - through propaganda - spread the belief that hitler invented the highway . private predecessor the autobahn 's roots actually went back even a little further .
the first highway-like street , the so-called " avus " in berlin , opened in 1921 as an experimental motor racing circuit , financed privately . it was mostly used as a race- and testing track .
driving on the cologne highway , on the other hand , was open for any automobile , free of charge . in 1927 , a plan was put up for the construction of a 22,000-kilometer -lrb- 13,670-mile -rrb- highway network throughout germany .
the idea was filed , due to the 1929 new york market crash and the economic crisis that followed . rising traffic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has managed to build 7,705 miles of highways throughout the country this , however , did not change the fact that traffic issues kept rising : between 1920 and 1925 , the number of cars in the german reich rose from 75,000 to 256,000 - an increase the previous street network could not deal with . the construction of the crossroad-free , four-lane highway between cologne and bonn continued .
with 18,000 cars a day , this street along the rhine river was one of the busiest streets in the whole german reich .
in comparison , the front runner today is the highway a100 in berlin , with more than 165,000 cars a day . the constructions on the cologne-bonn highway began in 1929 .
the project also served as a program for provision of employment for the many unemployed in the region .
at the peak of construction , more than 125,000 men worked on building the highway . cars only specific laws were applied to the novel street : the new highway was only meant for automobiles , reported the kölnische zeitung newspaper on aug .
5 , 1932 . " due to a specific police order , every other traffic , such as pedestrians , carts , bicyclists , motorcyclists and horse carriage , is prohibited to drive on the street , " it wrote . adenauer 's pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the highway traffic is busier during weekends and holidays cologne 's mayor , who later became germany 's first postwar chancellor , appeared happy that the construction of the first highway was connected to his cologne . " we can be proud and pleased by the fact that this new traffic technology begins in cologne , " adenauer wrote in kölnische zeitung . germany 's highway system has since become a network that spans some 12,400 kilometers .
the cologne-bonn stretch is still part of it : it was named a555 in 1955 and expanded to six lanes 10 years later . article based on news reports -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

starting wednesday , millions of passengers throughout the country could be left stranded . gdl union officials said that 95.8 percent of the 12,000 union members voted in favor of the strike . the union aims to achieve a separate labor contract and a pay rise of up to 31 percent . a last-ditch attempt to avert industrial action failed on friday when gdl rejected a new offer by the state-owned railways deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- . schell said he expected that 90 percent of the 12,000 members eligible to take part in the ballot would vote in favor of striking .
it would be the first major strike to hit the rail company in 15 years . in an interview with the welt am sonntag newspaper , gdl chairman manfred schell said the only way the deutsche bahn would avoid strikes in the coming week would be to make an acceptable offer by tuesday .

a woman found the music in her family 's summer home near moscow . it 's no surprise that music from hitler favorite composers such as richard wagner and ludwig van beethoven would turn up in the nazi leader 's personal record collection .
yet a moscow attic has yielded a more complex picture of the führer 's musical taste .
nearly 100 records suggest hitler also listened to russian and jewish musicians declared " subhuman " by the nazis , according to an article in the current issue of der spiegel magazine .
a surprising find bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler during the wagner festival in bayreuth in 1945 , lew besymenski , a captain in russia 's military intelligence unit , went with two other officers to the recently captured reich chancellery in berlin .
the headquarters of the nazi party were located near the secret underground bunker where hitler committed suicide at the end of world war ii .
besymenski 's comrades took silverware engraved with hitler 's initials home with them as souvenirs .
besymenski , a music lover , made an unexpected find .
behind several large steel doors that had been closed with special locks were boxes filled with personal belongings .
" it presented us with an odd sight : in each of the rooms there were numerous rows of sturdy wooden boxes all of them numbered , " besymenski wrote in a memoir years later , der spiegel reported .
the boxes were awaiting transfer to hitler 's mountain fortress in southern germany and were filled with plates and various household goods , including hitler 's records .
records kept in an attic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tchaikovsky was a russian composer considered sub-human besymenski 's daughter , alexandra besymenskaja , who is now 53 , accidentally came across the box in 1991 when she was at the family summer home near moscow . she had been sent to the attic to look for a badminton racket .
her shin hit something hard and she saw that she 'd run into a stack of records labeled führerhauptquartier , as the reich chancellery is called in german .
she asked her 70-year-old father about the records , but he did n't want to talk about them , saying that he had only listened for years to cds .
besymenski did n't want to be seen as a marauder who had ransacked the enemy 's personal belongings .
he had taken them because music was his personal passion , his daughter said .
when he died in june at the age of 86 , his daughter decided to talk publicly about her father 's record collection .
of the 100 discs , some are scratched , others are warped or broken , but many remain in relatively good condition .
the records include beethoven 's piano sonatas and wagner 's famous opera " the flying dutchman . "
hitler loved music , attending the opera almost daily during the time he lived in vienna .
hitler 's hypocrisy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner was a hitler favorite surprisingly , hitler 's collection also included russian composers labeled by the nazis as " subhuman " such as peter tchaikovsky , alexander borodin and sergei rachmaninoff , der spiegel reported .
one of the tchaikovsky records featured the star violinist bronislaw huberman , a polish jew forced to flee europe when the nazis took over .
hitler did n't care who had made the music he listened to in his bunker , despite in his book " mein kampf " stating that jewish art had never existed .
besymenski , who was a jew himself , was surprised that so many famous russian composers were included in hitler 's record collection , according to the memoir he wrote after being pressured by his daughter to record how he had had ended up with the collection .

he had taken them because music was his personal passion , his daughter said .
when he died in june at the age of 86 , his daughter decided to talk publicly about her father 's record collection .
of the 100 discs , some are scratched , others are warped or broken , but many remain in relatively good condition .

a woman found the music in her family 's summer home near moscow . it 's no surprise that music from hitler favorite composers such as richard wagner and ludwig van beethoven would turn up in the nazi leader 's personal record collection .
yet a moscow attic has yielded a more complex picture of the führer 's musical taste .
nearly 100 records suggest hitler also listened to russian and jewish musicians declared " subhuman " by the nazis , according to an article in the current issue of der spiegel magazine .
a surprising find bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler during the wagner festival in bayreuth in 1945 , lew besymenski , a captain in russia 's military intelligence unit , went with two other officers to the recently captured reich chancellery in berlin .
the headquarters of the nazi party were located near the secret underground bunker where hitler committed suicide at the end of world war ii .
besymenski 's comrades took silverware engraved with hitler 's initials home with them as souvenirs .
besymenski , a music lover , made an unexpected find .
behind several large steel doors that had been closed with special locks were boxes filled with personal belongings .
" it presented us with an odd sight : in each of the rooms there were numerous rows of sturdy wooden boxes all of them numbered , " besymenski wrote in a memoir years later , der spiegel reported .
the boxes were awaiting transfer to hitler 's mountain fortress in southern germany and were filled with plates and various household goods , including hitler 's records .

" i am in favor of extending our assistance in training and equipping the afghan army , " steinmeier told the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
the remarks came amid a debate that has taken on renewed urgency in germany since two german engineers were kidnapped in afghanistan on july 18 .
one has been killed and the other is still being held by his abductors .
steinmeier said germany could begin considering withdrawing its 3,000 ground troops engaged in a reconstruction mission in the north of afghanistan only once afghan forces could guarantee security .
" if we give up now , then the taliban will have reached their goal , " the social democrat said .
' aid not occupiers ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- l . -rrb- met afghan president hamid karzai -lrb- r . -rrb- in kabul in may ruprecht polenz , head of the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee and a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , spoke out against repeated calls for more western troops to be sent to afghanistan .
polenz was responding to a renewed call from nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer in germany 's weekend press for germany to give more military assistance to afghanistan .
polenz said it was possible that " the german troop contingent could be slightly strengthened , " but he stressed the need for afghan forces to play a larger role .
" we must avoid that the foreign forces are seen as an occupying army , " polenz said .
increasingly controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 3,000 german soldiers are stationed in afghanistan germany 's three separate deployments to afghanistan come up for renewal by parliament in the autumn .
apart from the 3,000 troops in the north , six reconnaissance jets are assisting the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in detecting taliban positions , and a number of german troops are deployed to the us-led counter-terrorism operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- .
the deployment of the tornado spy planes and the elite troops to oef are increasingly controversial within merkel 's broad coalition that includes both main parties , the cdu and the spd . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was right to do so , says dw 's ute schaeffer . from foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's perspective , there are many good reasons to support africa .
a new africa has emerged which , within the realm of the african union , is setting ambitious aims to promote peace .
it 's a new africa that wants to take responsibility to resolve conflicts and wars on the continent itself - as will soon be the case on behalf of the united nations in sudan .
democracy and political integration are the african union 's aims .
nigeria and ghana are important engines of these reform processes , self-confident partners , which are in transition politically and economically and which are taking responsibility regionally and globally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer above all , germany wants to export education and know-how to africa .
specifically , it wants to boost higher education and the exchange of scientists and students and to ramp up stipend programs .
the foreign minister wants to reverse bit by bit the mistakes of the past 15 years , when goethe institutes and embassies were closed in africa , and to considerably increase germany 's presence in africa .
that 's important , since it 's well-known that one can only cooperate well on the basis of trust and knowledge of one another .
that 's where germany has thoroughly lost ground over the years .
new actors , such as china , india or brazil - which do n't engage in strenuous discussions of values with their african partners but instead bring the continent investments , infrastructure and inexpensive products - have profited .
they do n't make developmental policy in africa , but economic policy - and the demand they generate ensures a clearly visible boom at least in africa 's resource-rich states .
these new actors have awakened the old ones .
in the battle for minds in africa , the issue is not lastly whether a sustainable and broad movement for more democracy will emerge .
for , that would be the most important prerequisite for the people to also benefit from economic growth .
that 's not the case in most of the african states that are rich in raw materials .
most people in those places are untouched by their countries ' wealth ; the number of people living in poverty has hardly changed .
a bad example is nigeria , where two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty .
germany does n't want to compete with the new actors - nor can it .
instead , germany 's africa policy is clearly set on partnership with states that are prepared to undertake reforms .
that 's also why the german foreign minister did without a business delegation and instead placed cultural and scientific exchange at the heart of his trip to nigeria and ghana .
but this time , too , readymade concepts ca n't be carried over .
on many points the two sides talk at cross purposes .
nigeria 's leadership called for german investment and more cooperation in the energy sector when they met with steinmeier .
and in ghana , too , the focus was on more economic cooperation .
that is exactly what the " new africa " demands in exchange for more reforms .
above all , africa is interested in the abolition of trade barriers , the targeted promotion of economic relations .
but during his first africa trip , the topic of business had shortened or limited talks , and this time steinmeier wanted to avoid that .
the new cultural policy approach for africa is forward-looking and ambitious .
it can advance development in africa .
at the same time though , this approach requires enduring and patient interest - a difficult and , certainly , a long route .
for , the results of cultural cooperation only appear after years and are far less visible than the stadiums , streets , pipelines or hospitals built by the chinese .
a long wind and a lot of promotion of the idea in germany as well as with the african partners will be necessary for the project to be a success .
africa has finally regained the significance that , in view of the global situation , it should have , seeing as none of the pressing problems in the international community - climate , energy security , terrorism , migration - can be solved without the continent .
incidentally , that was already the case 10 or 15 years ago , but it was n't discussed adequately in the public sphere .
it 's good that that 's now changing .
it 's high time !

he was right to do so , says dw 's ute schaeffer . from foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's perspective , there are many good reasons to support africa .
a new africa has emerged which , within the realm of the african union , is setting ambitious aims to promote peace .
it 's a new africa that wants to take responsibility to resolve conflicts and wars on the continent itself - as will soon be the case on behalf of the united nations in sudan .
democracy and political integration are the african union 's aims .
nigeria and ghana are important engines of these reform processes , self-confident partners , which are in transition politically and economically and which are taking responsibility regionally and globally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer above all , germany wants to export education and know-how to africa .
specifically , it wants to boost higher education and the exchange of scientists and students and to ramp up stipend programs .
the foreign minister wants to reverse bit by bit the mistakes of the past 15 years , when goethe institutes and embassies were closed in africa , and to considerably increase germany 's presence in africa .
that 's important , since it 's well-known that one can only cooperate well on the basis of trust and knowledge of one another .
that 's where germany has thoroughly lost ground over the years .
new actors , such as china , india or brazil - which do n't engage in strenuous discussions of values with their african partners but instead bring the continent investments , infrastructure and inexpensive products - have profited .
they do n't make developmental policy in africa , but economic policy - and the demand they generate ensures a clearly visible boom at least in africa 's resource-rich states .
these new actors have awakened the old ones .
in the battle for minds in africa , the issue is not lastly whether a sustainable and broad movement for more democracy will emerge .
for , that would be the most important prerequisite for the people to also benefit from economic growth .
that 's not the case in most of the african states that are rich in raw materials .
most people in those places are untouched by their countries ' wealth ; the number of people living in poverty has hardly changed .
a bad example is nigeria , where two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty .
germany does n't want to compete with the new actors - nor can it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 06.08.2007 opinion : germany right to put culture before business in africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier focused on cultural and educational cooperation rather than business when he visited nigeria and ghana last week .
he was right to do so , says dw 's ute schaeffer . from foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's perspective , there are many good reasons to support africa .
a new africa has emerged which , within the realm of the african union , is setting ambitious aims to promote peace .
it 's a new africa that wants to take responsibility to resolve conflicts and wars on the continent itself - as will soon be the case on behalf of the united nations in sudan .
democracy and political integration are the african union 's aims .
nigeria and ghana are important engines of these reform processes , self-confident partners , which are in transition politically and economically and which are taking responsibility regionally and globally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer above all , germany wants to export education and know-how to africa .
specifically , it wants to boost higher education and the exchange of scientists and students and to ramp up stipend programs .
the foreign minister wants to reverse bit by bit the mistakes of the past 15 years , when goethe institutes and embassies were closed in africa , and to considerably increase germany 's presence in africa .
that 's important , since it 's well-known that one can only cooperate well on the basis of trust and knowledge of one another .
that 's where germany has thoroughly lost ground over the years .
new actors , such as china , india or brazil - which do n't engage in strenuous discussions of values with their african partners but instead bring the continent investments , infrastructure and inexpensive products - have profited .
they do n't make developmental policy in africa , but economic policy - and the demand they generate ensures a clearly visible boom at least in africa 's resource-rich states .
these new actors have awakened the old ones .
in the battle for minds in africa , the issue is not lastly whether a sustainable and broad movement for more democracy will emerge .
for , that would be the most important prerequisite for the people to also benefit from economic growth .
that 's not the case in most of the african states that are rich in raw materials .
most people in those places are untouched by their countries ' wealth ; the number of people living in poverty has hardly changed .
a bad example is nigeria , where two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty .
germany does n't want to compete with the new actors - nor can it .
instead , germany 's africa policy is clearly set on partnership with states that are prepared to undertake reforms .
that 's also why the german foreign minister did without a business delegation and instead placed cultural and scientific exchange at the heart of his trip to nigeria and ghana .
but this time , too , readymade concepts ca n't be carried over .
on many points the two sides talk at cross purposes .
nigeria 's leadership called for german investment and more cooperation in the energy sector when they met with steinmeier .
and in ghana , too , the focus was on more economic cooperation .
that is exactly what the " new africa " demands in exchange for more reforms .
above all , africa is interested in the abolition of trade barriers , the targeted promotion of economic relations .
but during his first africa trip , the topic of business had shortened or limited talks , and this time steinmeier wanted to avoid that .
the new cultural policy approach for africa is forward-looking and ambitious .
it can advance development in africa .
at the same time though , this approach requires enduring and patient interest - a difficult and , certainly , a long route .
for , the results of cultural cooperation only appear after years and are far less visible than the stadiums , streets , pipelines or hospitals built by the chinese .
a long wind and a lot of promotion of the idea in germany as well as with the african partners will be necessary for the project to be a success .
africa has finally regained the significance that , in view of the global situation , it should have , seeing as none of the pressing problems in the international community - climate , energy security , terrorism , migration - can be solved without the continent .
incidentally , that was already the case 10 or 15 years ago , but it was n't discussed adequately in the public sphere .
it 's good that that 's now changing .
it 's high time !

he was right to do so , says dw 's ute schaeffer . from foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's perspective , there are many good reasons to support africa .
a new africa has emerged which , within the realm of the african union , is setting ambitious aims to promote peace .
it 's a new africa that wants to take responsibility to resolve conflicts and wars on the continent itself - as will soon be the case on behalf of the united nations in sudan .
democracy and political integration are the african union 's aims .
nigeria and ghana are important engines of these reform processes , self-confident partners , which are in transition politically and economically and which are taking responsibility regionally and globally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer above all , germany wants to export education and know-how to africa .
specifically , it wants to boost higher education and the exchange of scientists and students and to ramp up stipend programs .
the foreign minister wants to reverse bit by bit the mistakes of the past 15 years , when goethe institutes and embassies were closed in africa , and to considerably increase germany 's presence in africa .
that 's important , since it 's well-known that one can only cooperate well on the basis of trust and knowledge of one another .
that 's where germany has thoroughly lost ground over the years .
new actors , such as china , india or brazil - which do n't engage in strenuous discussions of values with their african partners but instead bring the continent investments , infrastructure and inexpensive products - have profited .
they do n't make developmental policy in africa , but economic policy - and the demand they generate ensures a clearly visible boom at least in africa 's resource-rich states .
these new actors have awakened the old ones .
in the battle for minds in africa , the issue is not lastly whether a sustainable and broad movement for more democracy will emerge .
for , that would be the most important prerequisite for the people to also benefit from economic growth .
that 's not the case in most of the african states that are rich in raw materials .
most people in those places are untouched by their countries ' wealth ; the number of people living in poverty has hardly changed .
a bad example is nigeria , where two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty .
germany does n't want to compete with the new actors - nor can it .
instead , germany 's africa policy is clearly set on partnership with states that are prepared to undertake reforms .
that 's also why the german foreign minister did without a business delegation and instead placed cultural and scientific exchange at the heart of his trip to nigeria and ghana .
but this time , too , readymade concepts ca n't be carried over .
on many points the two sides talk at cross purposes .
nigeria 's leadership called for german investment and more cooperation in the energy sector when they met with steinmeier .
and in ghana , too , the focus was on more economic cooperation .
that is exactly what the " new africa " demands in exchange for more reforms .
above all , africa is interested in the abolition of trade barriers , the targeted promotion of economic relations .
but during his first africa trip , the topic of business had shortened or limited talks , and this time steinmeier wanted to avoid that .
the new cultural policy approach for africa is forward-looking and ambitious .
it can advance development in africa .
at the same time though , this approach requires enduring and patient interest - a difficult and , certainly , a long route .
for , the results of cultural cooperation only appear after years and are far less visible than the stadiums , streets , pipelines or hospitals built by the chinese .
a long wind and a lot of promotion of the idea in germany as well as with the african partners will be necessary for the project to be a success .
africa has finally regained the significance that , in view of the global situation , it should have , seeing as none of the pressing problems in the international community - climate , energy security , terrorism , migration - can be solved without the continent .
incidentally , that was already the case 10 or 15 years ago , but it was n't discussed adequately in the public sphere .
it 's good that that 's now changing .
it 's high time !

he was right to do so , says dw 's ute schaeffer . from foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's perspective , there are many good reasons to support africa .
a new africa has emerged which , within the realm of the african union , is setting ambitious aims to promote peace .
it 's a new africa that wants to take responsibility to resolve conflicts and wars on the continent itself - as will soon be the case on behalf of the united nations in sudan .
democracy and political integration are the african union 's aims .
nigeria and ghana are important engines of these reform processes , self-confident partners , which are in transition politically and economically and which are taking responsibility regionally and globally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer above all , germany wants to export education and know-how to africa .
specifically , it wants to boost higher education and the exchange of scientists and students and to ramp up stipend programs .
the foreign minister wants to reverse bit by bit the mistakes of the past 15 years , when goethe institutes and embassies were closed in africa , and to considerably increase germany 's presence in africa .
that 's important , since it 's well-known that one can only cooperate well on the basis of trust and knowledge of one another .
that 's where germany has thoroughly lost ground over the years .
new actors , such as china , india or brazil - which do n't engage in strenuous discussions of values with their african partners but instead bring the continent investments , infrastructure and inexpensive products - have profited .
they do n't make developmental policy in africa , but economic policy - and the demand they generate ensures a clearly visible boom at least in africa 's resource-rich states .
these new actors have awakened the old ones .
in the battle for minds in africa , the issue is not lastly whether a sustainable and broad movement for more democracy will emerge .
for , that would be the most important prerequisite for the people to also benefit from economic growth .
that 's not the case in most of the african states that are rich in raw materials .
most people in those places are untouched by their countries ' wealth ; the number of people living in poverty has hardly changed .
a bad example is nigeria , where two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty .
germany does n't want to compete with the new actors - nor can it .
instead , germany 's africa policy is clearly set on partnership with states that are prepared to undertake reforms .
that 's also why the german foreign minister did without a business delegation and instead placed cultural and scientific exchange at the heart of his trip to nigeria and ghana .
but this time , too , readymade concepts ca n't be carried over .
on many points the two sides talk at cross purposes .
nigeria 's leadership called for german investment and more cooperation in the energy sector when they met with steinmeier .
and in ghana , too , the focus was on more economic cooperation .
that is exactly what the " new africa " demands in exchange for more reforms .
above all , africa is interested in the abolition of trade barriers , the targeted promotion of economic relations .
but during his first africa trip , the topic of business had shortened or limited talks , and this time steinmeier wanted to avoid that .
the new cultural policy approach for africa is forward-looking and ambitious .
it can advance development in africa .
at the same time though , this approach requires enduring and patient interest - a difficult and , certainly , a long route .
for , the results of cultural cooperation only appear after years and are far less visible than the stadiums , streets , pipelines or hospitals built by the chinese .
a long wind and a lot of promotion of the idea in germany as well as with the african partners will be necessary for the project to be a success .
africa has finally regained the significance that , in view of the global situation , it should have , seeing as none of the pressing problems in the international community - climate , energy security , terrorism , migration - can be solved without the continent .
incidentally , that was already the case 10 or 15 years ago , but it was n't discussed adequately in the public sphere .
it 's good that that 's now changing .
it 's high time !

the lawmakers were responding to prosecutors ' confirmation that 17 reporters were under investigation for quoting from classified documents intended for a parliamentary panel probing the activities of germany 's intelligence services .
" clarity must be established through legislation , " said green party chief reinhard bütikofer on ard television .
" it can not be that journalists who do their duty - exposing that which possibly shuns the public light - may then later be prosecuted . "
bütikofer 's party vetted a bill on the topic last year , but it was quashed in may by votes from parliamentarians from germany 's ruling coalition of christian democrats and social democrats .
opposition party lawmakers and panel members max stadler of the free democratic party and wolfgang neskovic of the left party also said in the neue presse newspaper that current legislation should be amended to protect journalists .
large , leaky apparatus neskovic rejected the suggestion that members of the panel investigating the activities of germany 's bnd intelligence service , or their staff members , had leaked the documents to the press .

a woman found the music in her family 's summer home near moscow . it 's no surprise that music from hitler favorite composers such as richard wagner and ludwig van beethoven would turn up in the nazi leader 's personal record collection .
yet a moscow attic has yielded a more complex picture of the führer 's musical taste .
nearly 100 records suggest hitler also listened to russian and jewish musicians declared " subhuman " by the nazis , according to an article in the current issue of der spiegel magazine .
a surprising find bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler during the wagner festival in bayreuth in 1945 , lew besymenski , a captain in russia 's military intelligence unit , went with two other officers to the recently captured reich chancellery in berlin .
the headquarters of the nazi party were located near the secret underground bunker where hitler committed suicide at the end of world war ii .
besymenski 's comrades took silverware engraved with hitler 's initials home with them as souvenirs .
besymenski , a music lover , made an unexpected find .
behind several large steel doors that had been closed with special locks were boxes filled with personal belongings .
" it presented us with an odd sight : in each of the rooms there were numerous rows of sturdy wooden boxes all of them numbered , " besymenski wrote in a memoir years later , der spiegel reported .
the boxes were awaiting transfer to hitler 's mountain fortress in southern germany and were filled with plates and various household goods , including hitler 's records .
records kept in an attic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tchaikovsky was a russian composer considered sub-human besymenski 's daughter , alexandra besymenskaja , who is now 53 , accidentally came across the box in 1991 when she was at the family summer home near moscow . she had been sent to the attic to look for a badminton racket .
her shin hit something hard and she saw that she 'd run into a stack of records labeled führerhauptquartier , as the reich chancellery is called in german .
she asked her 70-year-old father about the records , but he did n't want to talk about them , saying that he had only listened for years to cds .
besymenski did n't want to be seen as a marauder who had ransacked the enemy 's personal belongings .
he had taken them because music was his personal passion , his daughter said .
when he died in june at the age of 86 , his daughter decided to talk publicly about her father 's record collection .
of the 100 discs , some are scratched , others are warped or broken , but many remain in relatively good condition .
the records include beethoven 's piano sonatas and wagner 's famous opera " the flying dutchman . "
hitler loved music , attending the opera almost daily during the time he lived in vienna .
hitler 's hypocrisy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner was a hitler favorite surprisingly , hitler 's collection also included russian composers labeled by the nazis as " subhuman " such as peter tchaikovsky , alexander borodin and sergei rachmaninoff , der spiegel reported .
one of the tchaikovsky records featured the star violinist bronislaw huberman , a polish jew forced to flee europe when the nazis took over .
hitler did n't care who had made the music he listened to in his bunker , despite in his book " mein kampf " stating that jewish art had never existed .
besymenski , who was a jew himself , was surprised that so many famous russian composers were included in hitler 's record collection , according to the memoir he wrote after being pressured by his daughter to record how he had had ended up with the collection .

a woman found the music in her family 's summer home near moscow . it 's no surprise that music from hitler favorite composers such as richard wagner and ludwig van beethoven would turn up in the nazi leader 's personal record collection .
yet a moscow attic has yielded a more complex picture of the führer 's musical taste .
nearly 100 records suggest hitler also listened to russian and jewish musicians declared " subhuman " by the nazis , according to an article in the current issue of der spiegel magazine .
a surprising find bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler during the wagner festival in bayreuth in 1945 , lew besymenski , a captain in russia 's military intelligence unit , went with two other officers to the recently captured reich chancellery in berlin .
the headquarters of the nazi party were located near the secret underground bunker where hitler committed suicide at the end of world war ii .
besymenski 's comrades took silverware engraved with hitler 's initials home with them as souvenirs .
besymenski , a music lover , made an unexpected find .
behind several large steel doors that had been closed with special locks were boxes filled with personal belongings .
" it presented us with an odd sight : in each of the rooms there were numerous rows of sturdy wooden boxes all of them numbered , " besymenski wrote in a memoir years later , der spiegel reported .
the boxes were awaiting transfer to hitler 's mountain fortress in southern germany and were filled with plates and various household goods , including hitler 's records .
records kept in an attic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tchaikovsky was a russian composer considered sub-human besymenski 's daughter , alexandra besymenskaja , who is now 53 , accidentally came across the box in 1991 when she was at the family summer home near moscow . she had been sent to the attic to look for a badminton racket .
her shin hit something hard and she saw that she 'd run into a stack of records labeled führerhauptquartier , as the reich chancellery is called in german .
she asked her 70-year-old father about the records , but he did n't want to talk about them , saying that he had only listened for years to cds .
besymenski did n't want to be seen as a marauder who had ransacked the enemy 's personal belongings .
he had taken them because music was his personal passion , his daughter said .
when he died in june at the age of 86 , his daughter decided to talk publicly about her father 's record collection .
of the 100 discs , some are scratched , others are warped or broken , but many remain in relatively good condition .
the records include beethoven 's piano sonatas and wagner 's famous opera " the flying dutchman . "
hitler loved music , attending the opera almost daily during the time he lived in vienna .
hitler 's hypocrisy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner was a hitler favorite surprisingly , hitler 's collection also included russian composers labeled by the nazis as " subhuman " such as peter tchaikovsky , alexander borodin and sergei rachmaninoff , der spiegel reported .
one of the tchaikovsky records featured the star violinist bronislaw huberman , a polish jew forced to flee europe when the nazis took over .
hitler did n't care who had made the music he listened to in his bunker , despite in his book " mein kampf " stating that jewish art had never existed .
besymenski , who was a jew himself , was surprised that so many famous russian composers were included in hitler 's record collection , according to the memoir he wrote after being pressured by his daughter to record how he had had ended up with the collection .

starting wednesday , millions of passengers throughout the country could be left stranded . gdl union officials said that 95.8 percent of the 12,000 union members voted in favor of the strike . the union aims to achieve a separate labor contract and a pay rise of up to 31 percent . a last-ditch attempt to avert industrial action failed on friday when gdl rejected a new offer by the state-owned railways deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- . schell said he expected that 90 percent of the 12,000 members eligible to take part in the ballot would vote in favor of striking .
it would be the first major strike to hit the rail company in 15 years . in an interview with the welt am sonntag newspaper , gdl chairman manfred schell said the only way the deutsche bahn would avoid strikes in the coming week would be to make an acceptable offer by tuesday . " nothing else is going to work , " schell added . unions demand different deals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schell said he expected the vast majority of union members to support a strike deutsche bahn has offered an inflation-beating 4.5-percent increase , the same it agreed with two larger unions representing 134,000 workers , following a series of pinpoint strikes last month . but the rail operator has refused to sanction a separate contract for the smaller gdl , arguing that such a move could prompt the other unions to make fresh demands . the gdl maintains that train drivers , some of them piloting passenger trains at speeds in excess of 200 kilometers an hour , earn as little as 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,070 -rrb- a month in take-home pay . db claims that most drivers earn supplements that lift net pay to 2,100 euros . pack up the car bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lobby group said rail passengers should drive themselves if a strike occurs in order to avoid delays , the rail passenger lobby group pro bahn has recommended that people who have not yet bought train tickets should travel by car , while those who already have tickets should call the bahn hotline or visit its web site for the latest information , the group 's chairman karl-peter naumann told the afp news agency on sunday . the rail operator is drawing up contingency plans to cushion the impacts of the strike , including the use of buses for local services and drafting in administrative staff with train drivers ' licenses . the planned general strike would affect some 5 million people daily by stopping some 28,000 passenger trains and 4,780 cargo trains . bahn threatens suit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdorn said the bahn may begin training more train conductors deutsche bahn chief executive hartmut mehdorn 's has warned that the dispute could cost the company millions of euros and threatened to sue the union for damages if their action is deemed illegal . " if illegal actions lead to millions in damages for the bahn , we naturally want compensation for them , " he told der speigel newsmagazine on saturday . gdl head schell called mehdorn statement " completely absurd " and said the union would neither be influenced by the bahn 's tactics nor start an illegal labor fight . the union sought a series of injunctions to avert the stoppage but was successful only in germany 's most populous state of north rhine-westphalia , where a labor court outlawed industrial action in local services . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a woman found the music in her family 's summer home near moscow . it 's no surprise that music from hitler favorite composers such as richard wagner and ludwig van beethoven would turn up in the nazi leader 's personal record collection .
yet a moscow attic has yielded a more complex picture of the führer 's musical taste .
nearly 100 records suggest hitler also listened to russian and jewish musicians declared " subhuman " by the nazis , according to an article in the current issue of der spiegel magazine .
a surprising find bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler during the wagner festival in bayreuth in 1945 , lew besymenski , a captain in russia 's military intelligence unit , went with two other officers to the recently captured reich chancellery in berlin .
the headquarters of the nazi party were located near the secret underground bunker where hitler committed suicide at the end of world war ii .
besymenski 's comrades took silverware engraved with hitler 's initials home with them as souvenirs .
besymenski , a music lover , made an unexpected find .
behind several large steel doors that had been closed with special locks were boxes filled with personal belongings .
" it presented us with an odd sight : in each of the rooms there were numerous rows of sturdy wooden boxes all of them numbered , " besymenski wrote in a memoir years later , der spiegel reported .
the boxes were awaiting transfer to hitler 's mountain fortress in southern germany and were filled with plates and various household goods , including hitler 's records .
records kept in an attic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tchaikovsky was a russian composer considered sub-human besymenski 's daughter , alexandra besymenskaja , who is now 53 , accidentally came across the box in 1991 when she was at the family summer home near moscow . she had been sent to the attic to look for a badminton racket .
her shin hit something hard and she saw that she 'd run into a stack of records labeled führerhauptquartier , as the reich chancellery is called in german .
she asked her 70-year-old father about the records , but he did n't want to talk about them , saying that he had only listened for years to cds .
besymenski did n't want to be seen as a marauder who had ransacked the enemy 's personal belongings .
he had taken them because music was his personal passion , his daughter said .
when he died in june at the age of 86 , his daughter decided to talk publicly about her father 's record collection .
of the 100 discs , some are scratched , others are warped or broken , but many remain in relatively good condition .
the records include beethoven 's piano sonatas and wagner 's famous opera " the flying dutchman . "
hitler loved music , attending the opera almost daily during the time he lived in vienna .
hitler 's hypocrisy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner was a hitler favorite surprisingly , hitler 's collection also included russian composers labeled by the nazis as " subhuman " such as peter tchaikovsky , alexander borodin and sergei rachmaninoff , der spiegel reported .
one of the tchaikovsky records featured the star violinist bronislaw huberman , a polish jew forced to flee europe when the nazis took over .
hitler did n't care who had made the music he listened to in his bunker , despite in his book " mein kampf " stating that jewish art had never existed .
besymenski , who was a jew himself , was surprised that so many famous russian composers were included in hitler 's record collection , according to the memoir he wrote after being pressured by his daughter to record how he had had ended up with the collection .
" i feel that is complete mockery , " besymenskaja told the magazine .

three years later he tracked it down to a repair shop in latvia after spotting it in an ad . german police officer jürgen klement has always loved motorbikes . he 's owned several over the years and spent years riding one in the western german city of herne 's police force .
the cop 's love affair with the sleek machines started in 1990 when he got a loan and bought himself a harley . he then got parts imported from the united states and built a further customized harley bike of the high-handlebars-thin-front-wheel variety .
his labor of love produced a driving machine worthy of the film " easy rider , " according to german news reports .
he called his bike " pura vida , " a line taken from the motorcycle film classic , which stars peter fonda , dennis hopper and jack nicholson .

the lawmakers were responding to prosecutors ' confirmation that 17 reporters were under investigation for quoting from classified documents intended for a parliamentary panel probing the activities of germany 's intelligence services .
" clarity must be established through legislation , " said green party chief reinhard bütikofer on ard television .
" it can not be that journalists who do their duty - exposing that which possibly shuns the public light - may then later be prosecuted . "
bütikofer 's party vetted a bill on the topic last year , but it was quashed in may by votes from parliamentarians from germany 's ruling coalition of christian democrats and social democrats .
opposition party lawmakers and panel members max stadler of the free democratic party and wolfgang neskovic of the left party also said in the neue presse newspaper that current legislation should be amended to protect journalists .
large , leaky apparatus neskovic rejected the suggestion that members of the panel investigating the activities of germany 's bnd intelligence service , or their staff members , had leaked the documents to the press . " certainly more than 100 people had access to these files - government civil servants also , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reporters for some of germany 's leading newspapers are being probed his comments were echoed by panel colleague michael hartmann , a social democrat . " the apparatus is large .
above all … there are the ministries , " he said in the mainzer allgemeine zeitung daily .
" some documents were already public before we , the member 's of the panel , even got them in our hands . "
meanwhile , panel head siegfried kauder of the christian democrats defended the investigations of journalists .
" the federal chancellery had already indicated to me that it would not provide the panel with any more classified files if this were to continue , " he told the neue presse .
kauder said he felt like he had to take action . " my aim was to batten down the hatches , " he said .
" i want to find out who the informant or informants are . "
" excessive and ineffectual " the editors in chief of the affected newspapers published a joint declaration criticizing the prosecutors .
they called the investigations an " excessive and ineffectual attempt " to limit the freedom to report , according to the associated press .
the statement said their aim was to prevent the public from learning details about the handling of murat kurnaz .
the german-born turk spent four-and-a-half years at the us military prison at guantanamo in cuba before being released without charge .
his case was one of the topics examined by the panel , which was set up in april 2006 .
it was tasked with examining whether german intelligence services had violated human rights in the fight against terrorism , and what role the government played . the focus of attention was on the foreign intelligence service bnd and its involvement with the us central intelligence agency at the start of the iraq war in march 2003 . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" nothing else is going to work , " schell added . unions demand different deals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schell said he expected the vast majority of union members to support a strike deutsche bahn has offered an inflation-beating 4.5-percent increase , the same it agreed with two larger unions representing 134,000 workers , following a series of pinpoint strikes last month . but the rail operator has refused to sanction a separate contract for the smaller gdl , arguing that such a move could prompt the other unions to make fresh demands . the gdl maintains that train drivers , some of them piloting passenger trains at speeds in excess of 200 kilometers an hour , earn as little as 1,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,070 -rrb- a month in take-home pay . db claims that most drivers earn supplements that lift net pay to 2,100 euros . pack up the car bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lobby group said rail passengers should drive themselves if a strike occurs in order to avoid delays , the rail passenger lobby group pro bahn has recommended that people who have not yet bought train tickets should travel by car , while those who already have tickets should call the bahn hotline or visit its web site for the latest information , the group 's chairman karl-peter naumann told the afp news agency on sunday . the rail operator is drawing up contingency plans to cushion the impacts of the strike , including the use of buses for local services and drafting in administrative staff with train drivers ' licenses . the planned general strike would affect some 5 million people daily by stopping some 28,000 passenger trains and 4,780 cargo trains . bahn threatens suit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdorn said the bahn may begin training more train conductors deutsche bahn chief executive hartmut mehdorn 's has warned that the dispute could cost the company millions of euros and threatened to sue the union for damages if their action is deemed illegal . " if illegal actions lead to millions in damages for the bahn , we naturally want compensation for them , " he told der speigel newsmagazine on saturday . gdl head schell called mehdorn statement " completely absurd " and said the union would neither be influenced by the bahn 's tactics nor start an illegal labor fight . the union sought a series of injunctions to avert the stoppage but was successful only in germany 's most populous state of north rhine-westphalia , where a labor court outlawed industrial action in local services . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the lawmakers were responding to prosecutors ' confirmation that 17 reporters were under investigation for quoting from classified documents intended for a parliamentary panel probing the activities of germany 's intelligence services .
" clarity must be established through legislation , " said green party chief reinhard bütikofer on ard television .
" it can not be that journalists who do their duty - exposing that which possibly shuns the public light - may then later be prosecuted . "
bütikofer 's party vetted a bill on the topic last year , but it was quashed in may by votes from parliamentarians from germany 's ruling coalition of christian democrats and social democrats .
opposition party lawmakers and panel members max stadler of the free democratic party and wolfgang neskovic of the left party also said in the neue presse newspaper that current legislation should be amended to protect journalists .
large , leaky apparatus neskovic rejected the suggestion that members of the panel investigating the activities of germany 's bnd intelligence service , or their staff members , had leaked the documents to the press . " certainly more than 100 people had access to these files - government civil servants also , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reporters for some of germany 's leading newspapers are being probed his comments were echoed by panel colleague michael hartmann , a social democrat . " the apparatus is large .
above all … there are the ministries , " he said in the mainzer allgemeine zeitung daily .
" some documents were already public before we , the member 's of the panel , even got them in our hands . "
meanwhile , panel head siegfried kauder of the christian democrats defended the investigations of journalists .
" the federal chancellery had already indicated to me that it would not provide the panel with any more classified files if this were to continue , " he told the neue presse .
kauder said he felt like he had to take action . " my aim was to batten down the hatches , " he said .
" i want to find out who the informant or informants are . "
" excessive and ineffectual " the editors in chief of the affected newspapers published a joint declaration criticizing the prosecutors .
they called the investigations an " excessive and ineffectual attempt " to limit the freedom to report , according to the associated press .
the statement said their aim was to prevent the public from learning details about the handling of murat kurnaz .
the german-born turk spent four-and-a-half years at the us military prison at guantanamo in cuba before being released without charge .
his case was one of the topics examined by the panel , which was set up in april 2006 .
it was tasked with examining whether german intelligence services had violated human rights in the fight against terrorism , and what role the government played . the focus of attention was on the foreign intelligence service bnd and its involvement with the us central intelligence agency at the start of the iraq war in march 2003 . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a woman found the music in her family 's summer home near moscow . it 's no surprise that music from hitler favorite composers such as richard wagner and ludwig van beethoven would turn up in the nazi leader 's personal record collection .
yet a moscow attic has yielded a more complex picture of the führer 's musical taste .
nearly 100 records suggest hitler also listened to russian and jewish musicians declared " subhuman " by the nazis , according to an article in the current issue of der spiegel magazine .
a surprising find bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler during the wagner festival in bayreuth in 1945 , lew besymenski , a captain in russia 's military intelligence unit , went with two other officers to the recently captured reich chancellery in berlin .
the headquarters of the nazi party were located near the secret underground bunker where hitler committed suicide at the end of world war ii .
besymenski 's comrades took silverware engraved with hitler 's initials home with them as souvenirs .
besymenski , a music lover , made an unexpected find .
behind several large steel doors that had been closed with special locks were boxes filled with personal belongings .
" it presented us with an odd sight : in each of the rooms there were numerous rows of sturdy wooden boxes all of them numbered , " besymenski wrote in a memoir years later , der spiegel reported .
the boxes were awaiting transfer to hitler 's mountain fortress in southern germany and were filled with plates and various household goods , including hitler 's records .
records kept in an attic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tchaikovsky was a russian composer considered sub-human besymenski 's daughter , alexandra besymenskaja , who is now 53 , accidentally came across the box in 1991 when she was at the family summer home near moscow . she had been sent to the attic to look for a badminton racket .
her shin hit something hard and she saw that she 'd run into a stack of records labeled führerhauptquartier , as the reich chancellery is called in german .
she asked her 70-year-old father about the records , but he did n't want to talk about them , saying that he had only listened for years to cds .
besymenski did n't want to be seen as a marauder who had ransacked the enemy 's personal belongings .
he had taken them because music was his personal passion , his daughter said .
when he died in june at the age of 86 , his daughter decided to talk publicly about her father 's record collection .
of the 100 discs , some are scratched , others are warped or broken , but many remain in relatively good condition .
the records include beethoven 's piano sonatas and wagner 's famous opera " the flying dutchman . "
hitler loved music , attending the opera almost daily during the time he lived in vienna .
hitler 's hypocrisy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner was a hitler favorite surprisingly , hitler 's collection also included russian composers labeled by the nazis as " subhuman " such as peter tchaikovsky , alexander borodin and sergei rachmaninoff , der spiegel reported .
one of the tchaikovsky records featured the star violinist bronislaw huberman , a polish jew forced to flee europe when the nazis took over .
hitler did n't care who had made the music he listened to in his bunker , despite in his book " mein kampf " stating that jewish art had never existed .
besymenski , who was a jew himself , was surprised that so many famous russian composers were included in hitler 's record collection , according to the memoir he wrote after being pressured by his daughter to record how he had had ended up with the collection .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 06.08.2007 opinion : germany right to put culture before business in africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier focused on cultural and educational cooperation rather than business when he visited nigeria and ghana last week .
he was right to do so , says dw 's ute schaeffer . from foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's perspective , there are many good reasons to support africa .
a new africa has emerged which , within the realm of the african union , is setting ambitious aims to promote peace .
it 's a new africa that wants to take responsibility to resolve conflicts and wars on the continent itself - as will soon be the case on behalf of the united nations in sudan .
democracy and political integration are the african union 's aims .
nigeria and ghana are important engines of these reform processes , self-confident partners , which are in transition politically and economically and which are taking responsibility regionally and globally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer above all , germany wants to export education and know-how to africa .
specifically , it wants to boost higher education and the exchange of scientists and students and to ramp up stipend programs .
the foreign minister wants to reverse bit by bit the mistakes of the past 15 years , when goethe institutes and embassies were closed in africa , and to considerably increase germany 's presence in africa .
that 's important , since it 's well-known that one can only cooperate well on the basis of trust and knowledge of one another .
that 's where germany has thoroughly lost ground over the years .
new actors , such as china , india or brazil - which do n't engage in strenuous discussions of values with their african partners but instead bring the continent investments , infrastructure and inexpensive products - have profited .
they do n't make developmental policy in africa , but economic policy - and the demand they generate ensures a clearly visible boom at least in africa 's resource-rich states .
these new actors have awakened the old ones .
in the battle for minds in africa , the issue is not lastly whether a sustainable and broad movement for more democracy will emerge .
for , that would be the most important prerequisite for the people to also benefit from economic growth .
that 's not the case in most of the african states that are rich in raw materials .
most people in those places are untouched by their countries ' wealth ; the number of people living in poverty has hardly changed .
a bad example is nigeria , where two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty .
germany does n't want to compete with the new actors - nor can it .
instead , germany 's africa policy is clearly set on partnership with states that are prepared to undertake reforms .
that 's also why the german foreign minister did without a business delegation and instead placed cultural and scientific exchange at the heart of his trip to nigeria and ghana .
but this time , too , readymade concepts ca n't be carried over .
on many points the two sides talk at cross purposes .
nigeria 's leadership called for german investment and more cooperation in the energy sector when they met with steinmeier .
and in ghana , too , the focus was on more economic cooperation .
that is exactly what the " new africa " demands in exchange for more reforms .
above all , africa is interested in the abolition of trade barriers , the targeted promotion of economic relations .
but during his first africa trip , the topic of business had shortened or limited talks , and this time steinmeier wanted to avoid that .
the new cultural policy approach for africa is forward-looking and ambitious .
it can advance development in africa .
at the same time though , this approach requires enduring and patient interest - a difficult and , certainly , a long route .
for , the results of cultural cooperation only appear after years and are far less visible than the stadiums , streets , pipelines or hospitals built by the chinese .
a long wind and a lot of promotion of the idea in germany as well as with the african partners will be necessary for the project to be a success .
africa has finally regained the significance that , in view of the global situation , it should have , seeing as none of the pressing problems in the international community - climate , energy security , terrorism , migration - can be solved without the continent .
incidentally , that was already the case 10 or 15 years ago , but it was n't discussed adequately in the public sphere .
it 's good that that 's now changing .
it 's high time !

" i am in favor of extending our assistance in training and equipping the afghan army , " steinmeier told the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
the remarks came amid a debate that has taken on renewed urgency in germany since two german engineers were kidnapped in afghanistan on july 18 .

polenz was responding to a renewed call from nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer in germany 's weekend press for germany to give more military assistance to afghanistan .
polenz said it was possible that " the german troop contingent could be slightly strengthened , " but he stressed the need for afghan forces to play a larger role .

" i am in favor of extending our assistance in training and equipping the afghan army , " steinmeier told the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
the remarks came amid a debate that has taken on renewed urgency in germany since two german engineers were kidnapped in afghanistan on july 18 .
one has been killed and the other is still being held by his abductors .
steinmeier said germany could begin considering withdrawing its 3,000 ground troops engaged in a reconstruction mission in the north of afghanistan only once afghan forces could guarantee security .
" if we give up now , then the taliban will have reached their goal , " the social democrat said .

polenz was responding to a renewed call from nato general secretary jaap de hoop scheffer in germany 's weekend press for germany to give more military assistance to afghanistan .
polenz said it was possible that " the german troop contingent could be slightly strengthened , " but he stressed the need for afghan forces to play a larger role .
" we must avoid that the foreign forces are seen as an occupying army , " polenz said .

" this is what the future of streets looks like , " said cologne mayor konrad adenauer when he opened the highway for traffic on aug .
6 , 1932 . the highway was officially called the " automobile street " and there were no middle lanes .
it had two lanes going in each direction and there were no crossroads . it opened six months before the takeover of the nazis , who - through propaganda - spread the belief that hitler invented the highway . private predecessor the autobahn 's roots actually went back even a little further .
the first highway-like street , the so-called " avus " in berlin , opened in 1921 as an experimental motor racing circuit , financed privately . it was mostly used as a race- and testing track .
driving on the cologne highway , on the other hand , was open for any automobile , free of charge . in 1927 , a plan was put up for the construction of a 22,000-kilometer -lrb- 13,670-mile -rrb- highway network throughout germany .
the idea was filed , due to the 1929 new york market crash and the economic crisis that followed . rising traffic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has managed to build 7,705 miles of highways throughout the country this , however , did not change the fact that traffic issues kept rising : between 1920 and 1925 , the number of cars in the german reich rose from 75,000 to 256,000 - an increase the previous street network could not deal with . the construction of the crossroad-free , four-lane highway between cologne and bonn continued .
with 18,000 cars a day , this street along the rhine river was one of the busiest streets in the whole german reich .
in comparison , the front runner today is the highway a100 in berlin , with more than 165,000 cars a day . the constructions on the cologne-bonn highway began in 1929 .
the project also served as a program for provision of employment for the many unemployed in the region .
at the peak of construction , more than 125,000 men worked on building the highway . cars only specific laws were applied to the novel street : the new highway was only meant for automobiles , reported the kölnische zeitung newspaper on aug .
5 , 1932 . " due to a specific police order , every other traffic , such as pedestrians , carts , bicyclists , motorcyclists and horse carriage , is prohibited to drive on the street , " it wrote . adenauer 's pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the highway traffic is busier during weekends and holidays cologne 's mayor , who later became germany 's first postwar chancellor , appeared happy that the construction of the first highway was connected to his cologne . " we can be proud and pleased by the fact that this new traffic technology begins in cologne , " adenauer wrote in kölnische zeitung . germany 's highway system has since become a network that spans some 12,400 kilometers .
the cologne-bonn stretch is still part of it : it was named a555 in 1955 and expanded to six lanes 10 years later . article based on news reports -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was right to do so , says dw 's ute schaeffer . from foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's perspective , there are many good reasons to support africa .
a new africa has emerged which , within the realm of the african union , is setting ambitious aims to promote peace .
it 's a new africa that wants to take responsibility to resolve conflicts and wars on the continent itself - as will soon be the case on behalf of the united nations in sudan .
democracy and political integration are the african union 's aims .
nigeria and ghana are important engines of these reform processes , self-confident partners , which are in transition politically and economically and which are taking responsibility regionally and globally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer above all , germany wants to export education and know-how to africa .
specifically , it wants to boost higher education and the exchange of scientists and students and to ramp up stipend programs .
the foreign minister wants to reverse bit by bit the mistakes of the past 15 years , when goethe institutes and embassies were closed in africa , and to considerably increase germany 's presence in africa .
that 's important , since it 's well-known that one can only cooperate well on the basis of trust and knowledge of one another .
that 's where germany has thoroughly lost ground over the years .
new actors , such as china , india or brazil - which do n't engage in strenuous discussions of values with their african partners but instead bring the continent investments , infrastructure and inexpensive products - have profited .
they do n't make developmental policy in africa , but economic policy - and the demand they generate ensures a clearly visible boom at least in africa 's resource-rich states .
these new actors have awakened the old ones .
in the battle for minds in africa , the issue is not lastly whether a sustainable and broad movement for more democracy will emerge .
for , that would be the most important prerequisite for the people to also benefit from economic growth .
that 's not the case in most of the african states that are rich in raw materials .
most people in those places are untouched by their countries ' wealth ; the number of people living in poverty has hardly changed .
a bad example is nigeria , where two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty .
germany does n't want to compete with the new actors - nor can it .
instead , germany 's africa policy is clearly set on partnership with states that are prepared to undertake reforms .
that 's also why the german foreign minister did without a business delegation and instead placed cultural and scientific exchange at the heart of his trip to nigeria and ghana .
but this time , too , readymade concepts ca n't be carried over .
on many points the two sides talk at cross purposes .
nigeria 's leadership called for german investment and more cooperation in the energy sector when they met with steinmeier .
and in ghana , too , the focus was on more economic cooperation .
that is exactly what the " new africa " demands in exchange for more reforms .
above all , africa is interested in the abolition of trade barriers , the targeted promotion of economic relations .
but during his first africa trip , the topic of business had shortened or limited talks , and this time steinmeier wanted to avoid that .
the new cultural policy approach for africa is forward-looking and ambitious .
it can advance development in africa .
at the same time though , this approach requires enduring and patient interest - a difficult and , certainly , a long route .
for , the results of cultural cooperation only appear after years and are far less visible than the stadiums , streets , pipelines or hospitals built by the chinese .
a long wind and a lot of promotion of the idea in germany as well as with the african partners will be necessary for the project to be a success .
africa has finally regained the significance that , in view of the global situation , it should have , seeing as none of the pressing problems in the international community - climate , energy security , terrorism , migration - can be solved without the continent .
incidentally , that was already the case 10 or 15 years ago , but it was n't discussed adequately in the public sphere .
it 's good that that 's now changing .
it 's high time !

a woman found the music in her family 's summer home near moscow . it 's no surprise that music from hitler favorite composers such as richard wagner and ludwig van beethoven would turn up in the nazi leader 's personal record collection .
yet a moscow attic has yielded a more complex picture of the führer 's musical taste .
nearly 100 records suggest hitler also listened to russian and jewish musicians declared " subhuman " by the nazis , according to an article in the current issue of der spiegel magazine .
a surprising find bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler during the wagner festival in bayreuth in 1945 , lew besymenski , a captain in russia 's military intelligence unit , went with two other officers to the recently captured reich chancellery in berlin .
the headquarters of the nazi party were located near the secret underground bunker where hitler committed suicide at the end of world war ii .
besymenski 's comrades took silverware engraved with hitler 's initials home with them as souvenirs .
besymenski , a music lover , made an unexpected find .
behind several large steel doors that had been closed with special locks were boxes filled with personal belongings .
" it presented us with an odd sight : in each of the rooms there were numerous rows of sturdy wooden boxes all of them numbered , " besymenski wrote in a memoir years later , der spiegel reported .
the boxes were awaiting transfer to hitler 's mountain fortress in southern germany and were filled with plates and various household goods , including hitler 's records .
records kept in an attic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tchaikovsky was a russian composer considered sub-human besymenski 's daughter , alexandra besymenskaja , who is now 53 , accidentally came across the box in 1991 when she was at the family summer home near moscow . she had been sent to the attic to look for a badminton racket .
her shin hit something hard and she saw that she 'd run into a stack of records labeled führerhauptquartier , as the reich chancellery is called in german .
she asked her 70-year-old father about the records , but he did n't want to talk about them , saying that he had only listened for years to cds .
besymenski did n't want to be seen as a marauder who had ransacked the enemy 's personal belongings .
he had taken them because music was his personal passion , his daughter said .
when he died in june at the age of 86 , his daughter decided to talk publicly about her father 's record collection .
of the 100 discs , some are scratched , others are warped or broken , but many remain in relatively good condition .
the records include beethoven 's piano sonatas and wagner 's famous opera " the flying dutchman . "
hitler loved music , attending the opera almost daily during the time he lived in vienna .
hitler 's hypocrisy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner was a hitler favorite surprisingly , hitler 's collection also included russian composers labeled by the nazis as " subhuman " such as peter tchaikovsky , alexander borodin and sergei rachmaninoff , der spiegel reported .
one of the tchaikovsky records featured the star violinist bronislaw huberman , a polish jew forced to flee europe when the nazis took over .
hitler did n't care who had made the music he listened to in his bunker , despite in his book " mein kampf " stating that jewish art had never existed .
besymenski , who was a jew himself , was surprised that so many famous russian composers were included in hitler 's record collection , according to the memoir he wrote after being pressured by his daughter to record how he had had ended up with the collection .
" i feel that is complete mockery , " besymenskaja told the magazine .

starting wednesday , millions of passengers throughout the country could be left stranded . gdl union officials said that 95.8 percent of the 12,000 union members voted in favor of the strike . the union aims to achieve a separate labor contract and a pay rise of up to 31 percent . a last-ditch attempt to avert industrial action failed on friday when gdl rejected a new offer by the state-owned railways deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- . schell said he expected that 90 percent of the 12,000 members eligible to take part in the ballot would vote in favor of striking .
it would be the first major strike to hit the rail company in 15 years . in an interview with the welt am sonntag newspaper , gdl chairman manfred schell said the only way the deutsche bahn would avoid strikes in the coming week would be to make an acceptable offer by tuesday .

" if illegal actions lead to millions in damages for the bahn , we naturally want compensation for them , " he told der speigel newsmagazine on saturday . gdl head schell called mehdorn statement " completely absurd " and said the union would neither be influenced by the bahn 's tactics nor start an illegal labor fight . the union sought a series of injunctions to avert the stoppage but was successful only in germany 's most populous state of north rhine-westphalia , where a labor court outlawed industrial action in local services . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the lawmakers were responding to prosecutors ' confirmation that 17 reporters were under investigation for quoting from classified documents intended for a parliamentary panel probing the activities of germany 's intelligence services .
" clarity must be established through legislation , " said green party chief reinhard bütikofer on ard television .
" it can not be that journalists who do their duty - exposing that which possibly shuns the public light - may then later be prosecuted . "
bütikofer 's party vetted a bill on the topic last year , but it was quashed in may by votes from parliamentarians from germany 's ruling coalition of christian democrats and social democrats .
opposition party lawmakers and panel members max stadler of the free democratic party and wolfgang neskovic of the left party also said in the neue presse newspaper that current legislation should be amended to protect journalists .
large , leaky apparatus neskovic rejected the suggestion that members of the panel investigating the activities of germany 's bnd intelligence service , or their staff members , had leaked the documents to the press . " certainly more than 100 people had access to these files - government civil servants also , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reporters for some of germany 's leading newspapers are being probed his comments were echoed by panel colleague michael hartmann , a social democrat . " the apparatus is large .
above all … there are the ministries , " he said in the mainzer allgemeine zeitung daily .
" some documents were already public before we , the member 's of the panel , even got them in our hands . "
meanwhile , panel head siegfried kauder of the christian democrats defended the investigations of journalists .
" the federal chancellery had already indicated to me that it would not provide the panel with any more classified files if this were to continue , " he told the neue presse .
kauder said he felt like he had to take action . " my aim was to batten down the hatches , " he said .
" i want to find out who the informant or informants are . "
" excessive and ineffectual " the editors in chief of the affected newspapers published a joint declaration criticizing the prosecutors .
they called the investigations an " excessive and ineffectual attempt " to limit the freedom to report , according to the associated press .
the statement said their aim was to prevent the public from learning details about the handling of murat kurnaz .
the german-born turk spent four-and-a-half years at the us military prison at guantanamo in cuba before being released without charge .
his case was one of the topics examined by the panel , which was set up in april 2006 .
it was tasked with examining whether german intelligence services had violated human rights in the fight against terrorism , and what role the government played . the focus of attention was on the foreign intelligence service bnd and its involvement with the us central intelligence agency at the start of the iraq war in march 2003 . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

behind several large steel doors that had been closed with special locks were boxes filled with personal belongings .
" it presented us with an odd sight : in each of the rooms there were numerous rows of sturdy wooden boxes all of them numbered , " besymenski wrote in a memoir years later , der spiegel reported .
the boxes were awaiting transfer to hitler 's mountain fortress in southern germany and were filled with plates and various household goods , including hitler 's records .
records kept in an attic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tchaikovsky was a russian composer considered sub-human besymenski 's daughter , alexandra besymenskaja , who is now 53 , accidentally came across the box in 1991 when she was at the family summer home near moscow . she had been sent to the attic to look for a badminton racket .
her shin hit something hard and she saw that she 'd run into a stack of records labeled führerhauptquartier , as the reich chancellery is called in german .
she asked her 70-year-old father about the records , but he did n't want to talk about them , saying that he had only listened for years to cds .
besymenski did n't want to be seen as a marauder who had ransacked the enemy 's personal belongings .
he had taken them because music was his personal passion , his daughter said .
when he died in june at the age of 86 , his daughter decided to talk publicly about her father 's record collection .
of the 100 discs , some are scratched , others are warped or broken , but many remain in relatively good condition .
the records include beethoven 's piano sonatas and wagner 's famous opera " the flying dutchman . "
hitler loved music , attending the opera almost daily during the time he lived in vienna .

hitler did n't care who had made the music he listened to in his bunker , despite in his book " mein kampf " stating that jewish art had never existed .

a surprising find bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler during the wagner festival in bayreuth in 1945 , lew besymenski , a captain in russia 's military intelligence unit , went with two other officers to the recently captured reich chancellery in berlin .

as a favour mr holman agreed , and decided that if he was going to create one studio , he may as well build a few and test out the market .
" the reaction was incredible , " he explains , the surprise still evident 14 years after he placed an advert offering the finished units to aspiring artists tired of working at home .
" people were queuing all the way down the fire escape , " mr holman continues , pointing to the wrought metal stairs snaking up the outside of his warehouse .
" they were shouting ' do n't give the studio to them , i was at art school with them , they are rubbish ' . "
realising that there was a demand that was not being met , mr holman decided to go into the art studio business .
hobby or job ?
today , the warehouse near the greyhound track in wimbledon , south-west london , houses 130 artists in 111 studios , and is the biggest independent operator in the uk .
wimbledon art studios facts 25 % full-time artists 50 % part-time artists 25 % paying hobbyists ages range from 20 to 80 most aged between 22 and 35 65 % female 20 % non-uk looking through the window of mr holman 's office , you can see the wood and metal exterior of his new £ 2m art-studio building , which is due to be completed in september and will boost the number of studios to 163 .
it is already £ 800,000 over budget , and mr holman is keen to point out that in an industry where providers are often seen as a soft touch , he is a serious businessman spending serious amounts of money .
unlike many of his competitors , mr holman 's wimbledon art studios are not funded by state bodies such as the arts council .
instead mr holman says he charges about a third more for the studio space than his rivals , but says he will sell more of the artists ' work , making it a better deal in the long run .
" it 's great being an artist if you are earning a living , " he says .
" if you are n't making money then you are n't an artist , you are a waiter or a teacher with a hobby . "
' a little crazy ' walk through the corridors of bright and whitewashed studios and you get a feeling of quiet determination emanating from behind each of the numbered rooms .
some doors have been decorated with cards and posters from the artist 's gallery shows , while others have been left plain except for a cleanly lettered name .
nick vivian spent many years painting murals in the middle east before returning to the uk .
he came to wimbledon art studios because he was going " a little crazy " working alone at home , and was looking for the company of other artists he could turn to for advice and bounce ideas off .
a little further down the corridor and claire burke and rod billington are chatting , both professional artists who have recently gone into business together .
ms burke explains that commercial pressures can often impinge on the work an artist produces , especially when they first leave art school .
one of the best ways to gain the confidence needed to follow your own individual style is to sell paintings , she adds .
" i like to see my paintings sell as it validates my thinking behind them , " ms burke says .
" if they do n't sell , it bothers me . "
wall hangings the key to mr holman 's business model are the twice-yearly open studio days , when artists invite the public to come and view their work in situ .
" other studios open to the public normally once a year for a private view for a few hours on a friday night , and then all day saturday and sunday , " he explains , adding that some of them only attract about 250 people .
wimbledon art studios open twice a year , for four days at a time , and have in the past attracted 6,000 visitors who spent a total of £ 300,000 on the art on show .
" we do n't advertise in art magazines because you get people who are interested in art but do n't buy anything , " he explains .
" there has been a boom in the middle class in areas like this and they want real art to hang on their walls . "
sink or swim mr holman , who says he is dyslexic and grew up " when they just called you thick " , has experience of trying to make it as an artist , and has no illusions about how harsh life can be .
a self-taught artist who sold paintings of figurative nudes with a slight s & m twist , the 51-year-old says it is in his businesses ' interests to help others make it as artists . "
people do n't tend to become artists because of commercial gain , but they want to earn a living " nigel holman " i ca n't think of another industry where you are so left on your own , " says mr holman .
" you leave art school , and you go out on your own , there are no customers , no training available . "
in order to better prepare them for the cold world of business , artists at the wimbledon art studios can sign up for seminars and workshops with titles such as selling and presentation , accounts talk and the rise and design of internet marketing .
" the studios give artists a community , " mr holman explains .
" it can be a lonely business , but here they do n't feel so alone and isolated . "

as a favour mr holman agreed , and decided that if he was going to create one studio , he may as well build a few and test out the market .
" the reaction was incredible , " he explains , the surprise still evident 14 years after he placed an advert offering the finished units to aspiring artists tired of working at home .
" people were queuing all the way down the fire escape , " mr holman continues , pointing to the wrought metal stairs snaking up the outside of his warehouse .
" they were shouting ' do n't give the studio to them , i was at art school with them , they are rubbish ' . "
realising that there was a demand that was not being met , mr holman decided to go into the art studio business .
hobby or job ?
today , the warehouse near the greyhound track in wimbledon , south-west london , houses 130 artists in 111 studios , and is the biggest independent operator in the uk .
wimbledon art studios facts 25 % full-time artists 50 % part-time artists 25 % paying hobbyists ages range from 20 to 80 most aged between 22 and 35 65 % female 20 % non-uk looking through the window of mr holman 's office , you can see the wood and metal exterior of his new £ 2m art-studio building , which is due to be completed in september and will boost the number of studios to 163 .
it is already £ 800,000 over budget , and mr holman is keen to point out that in an industry where providers are often seen as a soft touch , he is a serious businessman spending serious amounts of money .
unlike many of his competitors , mr holman 's wimbledon art studios are not funded by state bodies such as the arts council .
instead mr holman says he charges about a third more for the studio space than his rivals , but says he will sell more of the artists ' work , making it a better deal in the long run .
" it 's great being an artist if you are earning a living , " he says .
" if you are n't making money then you are n't an artist , you are a waiter or a teacher with a hobby . "
' a little crazy ' walk through the corridors of bright and whitewashed studios and you get a feeling of quiet determination emanating from behind each of the numbered rooms .
some doors have been decorated with cards and posters from the artist 's gallery shows , while others have been left plain except for a cleanly lettered name .
a bit of company can help the artistic spirit , nick vivian says nick vivian spent many years painting murals in the middle east before returning to the uk .
he came to wimbledon art studios because he was going " a little crazy " working alone at home , and was looking for the company of other artists he could turn to for advice and bounce ideas off .
a little further down the corridor and claire burke and rod billington are chatting , both professional artists who have recently gone into business together .
ms burke explains that commercial pressures can often impinge on the work an artist produces , especially when they first leave art school .
one of the best ways to gain the confidence needed to follow your own individual style is to sell paintings , she adds .
" i like to see my paintings sell as it validates my thinking behind them , " ms burke says .
" if they do n't sell , it bothers me . "
wall hangings the key to mr holman 's business model are the twice-yearly open studio days , when artists invite the public to come and view their work in situ .
every studio has a slightly different look reflecting the artist 's tastes " other studios open to the public normally once a year for a private view for a few hours on a friday night , and then all day saturday and sunday , " he explains , adding that some of them only attract about 250 people .
wimbledon art studios open twice a year , for four days at a time , and have in the past attracted 6,000 visitors who spent a total of £ 300,000 on the art on show .
" we do n't advertise in art magazines because you get people who are interested in art but do n't buy anything , " he explains .
" there has been a boom in the middle class in areas like this and they want real art to hang on their walls . "

dark skies and long days of torrential rain are common in july and august .
protesters have picketed the us embassy in seoul to demand help the gloomy weather seems to reflect the mood of many south koreans as they wait to hear the fate of the 21 hostages still being held by the taleban in afghanistan .
the captives ' plight has become a national obsession .
it is the top story on television and radio and on the front pages of the newspapers .
there is widespread sympathy for the families of those who have been kidnapped .
that is exacerbated by the anguished appeals from the parents .
at a memorial service for one of the dead hostages , a mother of one of the hostages made a desperate plea .
" please save our children immediately , " said kim taek-kyoung .
" please save them quickly . "
hands tied but there is also anger about what the south koreans were doing in a conflict zone like afghanistan in the first place .
hostage timeline 19 july : 23 south korean christian aid workers seized on bus in ghazni province 26 july : body of hostage pastor bae hyung-kyu is found 31 july : second hostage shim sung-min , 29 , found shot dead they were working for a christian missionary organisation , one of many that have grown up in south korea in recent years .
it is thought that one quarter to one fifth of all south koreans are christians .
the organisation 's leader , park eun-jo , said he was working hard for the hostages ' release .
" we will try our best to clear up this crisis and comfort the families as we hope to resolve this crisis here in korea and in afghanistan , " he said .
this is a difficult situation for the south korean government .
it can not directly control events on the ground in afghanistan .
the afghan government has already said it does not want to give in to taleban demands to swap the hostages for prisoners held in afghan jails .
kabul worries that it might lead to more kidnappings .
so seoul 's room for manoeuvre is limited .
" through our contacts , our foremost goal is to make it clear that there is a limit as to what our government can do to meet their demands of releasing the prisoners , " said official south korean spokesman cheon ho-seon .
american angle seoul does not want a military operation to free the hostages , fearing more loss of life .
the father of slain hostage shim sung-min weeps at his funeral instead , politicians here in seoul have mounted a diplomatic offensive in an attempt to influence the outcome of the crisis .
eight senior south korean legislators flew to washington last week to lobby for support .
south korean foreign minister song min-soon has also had meetings with a top official at the us state department .
and a delegation , including the south korean ambassador to kabul , has been in negotiations with the taleban .
there is a growing belief both among some politicians and ordinary south koreans that the us has a crucial role to play in finding a resolution to the stand-off .
some think that the current hostage crisis is a direct result of south korean president roh moo-hyun 's decision to send south korean troops to help us lead forces in afghanistan .
they argue that seoul should commit to withdrawing its small force of just over 200 troops .
but the reality is that no-one knows how or when this stand-off might end .

dark skies and long days of torrential rain are common in july and august .
protesters have picketed the us embassy in seoul to demand help the gloomy weather seems to reflect the mood of many south koreans as they wait to hear the fate of the 21 hostages still being held by the taleban in afghanistan .
the captives ' plight has become a national obsession .
it is the top story on television and radio and on the front pages of the newspapers .
there is widespread sympathy for the families of those who have been kidnapped .
that is exacerbated by the anguished appeals from the parents .
at a memorial service for one of the dead hostages , a mother of one of the hostages made a desperate plea .
" please save our children immediately , " said kim taek-kyoung .
" please save them quickly . "
hands tied but there is also anger about what the south koreans were doing in a conflict zone like afghanistan in the first place .
hostage timeline 19 july : 23 south korean christian aid workers seized on bus in ghazni province 26 july : body of hostage pastor bae hyung-kyu is found 31 july : second hostage shim sung-min , 29 , found shot dead they were working for a christian missionary organisation , one of many that have grown up in south korea in recent years .
it is thought that one quarter to one fifth of all south koreans are christians .
the organisation 's leader , park eun-jo , said he was working hard for the hostages ' release .
" we will try our best to clear up this crisis and comfort the families as we hope to resolve this crisis here in korea and in afghanistan , " he said .
this is a difficult situation for the south korean government .
it can not directly control events on the ground in afghanistan .
the afghan government has already said it does not want to give in to taleban demands to swap the hostages for prisoners held in afghan jails .
kabul worries that it might lead to more kidnappings .
so seoul 's room for manoeuvre is limited .
" through our contacts , our foremost goal is to make it clear that there is a limit as to what our government can do to meet their demands of releasing the prisoners , " said official south korean spokesman cheon ho-seon .
american angle seoul does not want a military operation to free the hostages , fearing more loss of life .
the father of slain hostage shim sung-min weeps at his funeral instead , politicians here in seoul have mounted a diplomatic offensive in an attempt to influence the outcome of the crisis .
eight senior south korean legislators flew to washington last week to lobby for support .
south korean foreign minister song min-soon has also had meetings with a top official at the us state department .
and a delegation , including the south korean ambassador to kabul , has been in negotiations with the taleban .
there is a growing belief both among some politicians and ordinary south koreans that the us has a crucial role to play in finding a resolution to the stand-off .
some think that the current hostage crisis is a direct result of south korean president roh moo-hyun 's decision to send south korean troops to help us lead forces in afghanistan .
they argue that seoul should commit to withdrawing its small force of just over 200 troops .
but the reality is that no-one knows how or when this stand-off might end .

fourteen people were still missing in daklak province , where at least two people have been killed , feared swept away by rising river waters .
four people were also killed in the neighbouring province of lam dong .
weather officials are warning that more heavy rain is expected in the region in the coming days .
both daklak and lam dong are key coffee-growing areas in vietnam , accounting for half of the country 's output , reuters news agency reports .
however , industry experts say the coffee crop is safe as most of the trees are planted on hillsides .
officials in daklak said up to 62cm -lrb- 24 inches -rrb- of rain had been dumped on the province in the past four days , forcing some 5,000 people to flee their homes .
a new tropical storm with wind speeds of 72km / h -lrb- 45m / h -rrb- was reported to be making its way along the central coast of vietnam .
the government said all fishing boats had been moved out of the path of the storm .

by nick baker bbc radio 4 a controversial project for " nightmare " council tenants in dundee is being rolled out across scotland at the cost of millions of pounds .
for bbc radio 4 's fixing families programme , nick baker joined the dundee families unit as it worked with families whose noise-making , drug habits , fights and failure to control their wayward children have driven neighbours to distraction . "
the notion that parenthood is a skill , like driving or speaking a foreign language , is a controversial one .
it is an entertaining idea , but giving teenagers pretend babies - and in a recent tv series , real ones - to look after 24/7 smacks more of reality television than real life .
all the same there are those who can benefit from formal family teaching .
the dundee families project takes a more practical approach and teaches families how to operate effectively by close monitoring , teaching and support .
this includes , and goes beyond , teaching parenting skills .
the whole family learns .
these are families whose problems manifest themselves as anti-social behaviour .
deeper problem it goes further than loud music .
it is punch-ups with the neighbours , children wildly out of control , long-running disputes that can start with a borrowed cigarette and end up in eviction , or court , or both .
deputy manager john wallace stresses that some anti-social behaviour is a symptom of a deeper problem .
the team of social workers and other qualified carers has to spot the families capable of change and work out what they need . "
the atmosphere in the core block can be superficially jolly but at the same time oddly intense " cathy , for example , a mum in her 30s , said she simply did n't know how to be a mother to her 12-year-old son .
she had been severely deprived and violently abused as a child , ran away from home and as a teenager got into all sorts of trouble .
now , having settled her own life a bit , she found herself unable to control her son because she had been the victim of too much discipline herself .
she tried hard to break the cycle of abuse .
her son ran wild .
she had to learn the practicalities of tough love .
some families are brought into the project 's core unit , labelled by some in the press as colditz , where they are monitored 24 hours a day .
it is an ordinary dundee tenement block , but the downstairs flats are offices and bedrooms for the staff , with some neutral sitting rooms for chat and training .
staff have constant access to tenants and vice versa , so there is a lot of popping in and out .
teaching how to be a good neighbour is also on the curriculum , and constant borrowing of cigarettes and the like can be an irritant , families are told .
overall , the teaching is friendly and informal , sometimes done in groups , and ranges from cooking mince to timekeeping for teenagers .
in the core block , there is an expectation -lrb- not a curfew , that is a taboo word -rrb- that everyone is home by 11 .
visitors to tenants are monitored and some turned away , and tenants on methadone are watched carefully for signs of " topping up " with illegal drugs .
routines , diet , children 's activities are closely watched .
children 's welfare informally , staff -lrb- a high proportion are parents as well as qualified carers -rrb- dispense cuddles , sweets , fruit and veg , chat and help with anything from hairdressing to nappies , alongside the positive messages .
the atmosphere in the core block can be superficially jolly but at the same time oddly intense .
staff - put under some stress by the work - counsel each other .
innocent-seeming conversations between staff and tenants , about what is for tea or who is at home and who is out , have added significance .
tenants know they are being watched .
it is not sinister though .
families know that once they have been deemed fixed -lrb- and a high proportion are , according to a glasgow university study -rrb- , they can go back to a council tenancy , usually removed from where the trouble flared .
it is a powerful inducement in a city , like many others , where social housing is in short supply .
and project staff are n't perceived by those they help as official social workers , with the hated power to take children away .
the project is run by nch , formerly national children 's homes , and children 's welfare is paramount .
there has to be a child under 16 in the family to qualify for the fixing families treatment . "
nick baker reports on fixing families on monday 6 august at 1100 bst on bbc radio 4 .

the poll found fewer than half of nhs trusts fund the freezing of spare embryos created during treatment , and their implantation if required .
the national institute for health and clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- says this should be part of nhs-funded care .
the poll also found some people are being denied ivf completely . "

the letter also highlighted continuing wide variations in the provision of ivf treatment across england .
it revealed confusion over how to implement the nice guidance and variations over which couples are deemed suitable for ivf .

the then health secretary john reid said couples would be offered one free ivf cycle with a view to three cycles being offered in future .
standardised rules the department of health is working with the charity infertility network uk to develop standardised rules on access for ivf .
the government also announced last month it would be monitoring fertility treatment provision across the country .
a recent all-party committee of mps concluded that ivf remains a low priority for many in the nhs .
and the difference in provision across england was highlighted by work carried out by conservative mp grant shapps earlier this year .
he said : " when i undertook a review earlier in the year , i was alarmed to see the extent to which pcts varied their level of treatment .
" this latest research seems to indicate that the disparity of provision of important elements like frozen embryo transfer is even greater than first thought .
" the idea that , in half of cases , frozen embryo transfer is not included in a single cycle will alarm couples undergoing ivf treatment . "
clare brown , chief executive of infertility network uk , said : " it is unacceptable that many pcts are failing to include frozen embryo transfers as part of their ivf cycles .
" this is vitally important given the likely move towards single embryo transfer for appropriate patients .
" we also believe it is unacceptable to create something as special as an embryo on the nhs but only to allow it to be transferred if you have the ability to pay . "

i 've been in love with games for half my life .
in the time it 's taken me to get from a swotty kid to a professional journalist , they 've been a hobby and a job , a distraction and an inspiration .
they 've made me friends , taught me chinese history , and helped me conquer my phobia of slugs .
but the more i play , the more i 'm struck by an unavoidable realisation .
games are rubbish .
really , dismally , rubbish .
they 're expensive .
extraordinarily expensive , once you factor in the hardware you need to play them .
they 're massively - and awkwardly - time consuming .
there are games with 24 hour day / night cycles which you may need to play at particular times .
save points there are games with badly spaced save-points so you 're left with the choice of switching off when it suits you and losing an hour of progress , or playing on even if it does n't .
and they 're boring .
so , very , very boring .
even setting aside the fact that all you do is sit still and twitch your fingers , for hours on end , there 's the fact that what you do in games is so relentlessly repetitive .
kill the same enemies hundreds and hundreds of times .
race round and round and round the same circuits .
and then you buy a new game , with new exciting possibilities , and you kill some new enemies hundreds and hundreds of times , and race round some new tracks till you 're dizzy .
and - here 's the kicker - games are n't just boring , inconvenient , and over-priced .
they 're designed to make you feel like a failure .
there 's a very good chance - a certainty in most games - that there will come a point where the game will beat you .
where you 'll sit in your own house while a bit of software you paid big money for , and devoted hours to , calls you a loser .
why on earth would you want to do this stuff ?
everyone has their own answer to that , of course - that the violence is therapeutic , that the levelling-up is good for your self esteem , that the stories are better than they 're reputed to be , that the spectacle on offer outdoes the best that producer jerry bruckheimer has to offer .
factual learning but my answer is considerably swottier than that .
it 's that games are educational .
it 's not what they teach - since what they teach -lrb- a smattering of chinese history excepted -rrb- is largely useless .
it 's that they teach .
brains love to learn .
for everyone , there 's some kind of learning that is as satisfying for their brains as running all day is for a border collie .
it might be rote , factual learning , soaking up thousands of item stats and proc rates ; it might be wordless , spatial learning , perfecting the arc of grenade .
it might be tessellating and testing strategies for defeating rome or building new york ; it might be pattern recognition , nailing combos in virtua fighter or bass lines in amplitude .
brains love information - finding connections , mapping relationships and once you find the one that suits you , the feeling is narcotic .
brains love information - finding connections , mapping relationships - and games let you mainline a fat flow of pure , perfected data , all deliberately contrived to be rich with exactly those kinds of interconnections .
and as you learn , you 're given an incredible window into your own capabilities .
games are a test-bed where you can endlessly explore what an extraordinary machine you are .
take something like nintendo 's brain training .
the ' low to high ' test shows you a grid of numbers for two or three seconds , then blanks them out , and you need to tap the boxes in the order , low to high , of the numbers they contained .
when i play it , i know , as a matter of certainty , that i ca n't do it .
rather proud i do n't even have time to read the numbers , let alone order them , let alone memorise them .
but somehow , even though i ca n't do it , my brain can .
and so i get to watch , astonished and really rather proud , as my hand taps out the right sequence .
if i 'm playing guitar hero on the expert setting , i know as a matter of certainty that i ca n't keep up with the sequence of notes streaming by .
not least because my eyes go completely out of focus within about a minute .
and yet , somehow , my brain and my hand have done a deal , and notes are streaming out of the screen and my score is through the roof .
check me out - i 'm amazing .
and that 's not arrogance .
i do n't take any credit for it .
i ca n't .
same as i ca n't take credit for the million biological and chemical wonders that my body sorts out for me day in , day out , and the gallons of maths and physics my brain processes to get me across a road safely .
games let you be a spectator in your own head .
they 're laboratories which let you contrive test after test - tweak a condition here and a parameter there - and give you a visible , beautiful read-out on just how smart your brain really is .
and in doing that , they give you more insight into your own capabilities than i 've ever found in any work of literature or any piece of music .
and that 's why i play games .

i 've been in love with games for half my life .
in the time it 's taken me to get from a swotty kid to a professional journalist , they 've been a hobby and a job , a distraction and an inspiration .
they 've made me friends , taught me chinese history , and helped me conquer my phobia of slugs .
but the more i play , the more i 'm struck by an unavoidable realisation .
games are rubbish .
really , dismally , rubbish .
they 're expensive .
extraordinarily expensive , once you factor in the hardware you need to play them .
they 're massively - and awkwardly - time consuming .
there are games with 24 hour day / night cycles which you may need to play at particular times .
save points there are games with badly spaced save-points so you 're left with the choice of switching off when it suits you and losing an hour of progress , or playing on even if it does n't .
and they 're boring .
so , very , very boring .
even setting aside the fact that all you do is sit still and twitch your fingers , for hours on end , there 's the fact that what you do in games is so relentlessly repetitive .
kill the same enemies hundreds and hundreds of times .
race round and round and round the same circuits .
and then you buy a new game , with new exciting possibilities , and you kill some new enemies hundreds and hundreds of times , and race round some new tracks till you 're dizzy .
and - here 's the kicker - games are n't just boring , inconvenient , and over-priced .
they 're designed to make you feel like a failure .
there 's a very good chance - a certainty in most games - that there will come a point where the game will beat you .
where you 'll sit in your own house while a bit of software you paid big money for , and devoted hours to , calls you a loser .
why on earth would you want to do this stuff ?
everyone has their own answer to that , of course - that the violence is therapeutic , that the levelling-up is good for your self esteem , that the stories are better than they 're reputed to be , that the spectacle on offer outdoes the best that producer jerry bruckheimer has to offer .
factual learning but my answer is considerably swottier than that .
it 's that games are educational .
it 's not what they teach - since what they teach -lrb- a smattering of chinese history excepted -rrb- is largely useless .
it 's that they teach .
brains love to learn .
for everyone , there 's some kind of learning that is as satisfying for their brains as running all day is for a border collie .
it might be rote , factual learning , soaking up thousands of item stats and proc rates ; it might be wordless , spatial learning , perfecting the arc of grenade .
it might be tessellating and testing strategies for defeating rome or building new york ; it might be pattern recognition , nailing combos in virtua fighter or bass lines in amplitude .
brains love information - finding connections , mapping relationships and once you find the one that suits you , the feeling is narcotic .
brains love information - finding connections , mapping relationships - and games let you mainline a fat flow of pure , perfected data , all deliberately contrived to be rich with exactly those kinds of interconnections .
and as you learn , you 're given an incredible window into your own capabilities .
games are a test-bed where you can endlessly explore what an extraordinary machine you are .
take something like nintendo 's brain training .
the ' low to high ' test shows you a grid of numbers for two or three seconds , then blanks them out , and you need to tap the boxes in the order , low to high , of the numbers they contained .
when i play it , i know , as a matter of certainty , that i ca n't do it .
rather proud i do n't even have time to read the numbers , let alone order them , let alone memorise them .
but somehow , even though i ca n't do it , my brain can .
and so i get to watch , astonished and really rather proud , as my hand taps out the right sequence .
if i 'm playing guitar hero on the expert setting , i know as a matter of certainty that i ca n't keep up with the sequence of notes streaming by .
not least because my eyes go completely out of focus within about a minute .
and yet , somehow , my brain and my hand have done a deal , and notes are streaming out of the screen and my score is through the roof .
check me out - i 'm amazing .
and that 's not arrogance .
i do n't take any credit for it .
i ca n't .
same as i ca n't take credit for the million biological and chemical wonders that my body sorts out for me day in , day out , and the gallons of maths and physics my brain processes to get me across a road safely .
games let you be a spectator in your own head .
they 're laboratories which let you contrive test after test - tweak a condition here and a parameter there - and give you a visible , beautiful read-out on just how smart your brain really is .
and in doing that , they give you more insight into your own capabilities than i 've ever found in any work of literature or any piece of music .
and that 's why i play games .

it might be rote , factual learning , soaking up thousands of item stats and proc rates ; it might be wordless , spatial learning , perfecting the arc of grenade .
it might be tessellating and testing strategies for defeating rome or building new york ; it might be pattern recognition , nailing combos in virtua fighter or bass lines in amplitude .
brains love information - finding connections , mapping relationships and once you find the one that suits you , the feeling is narcotic .
brains love information - finding connections , mapping relationships - and games let you mainline a fat flow of pure , perfected data , all deliberately contrived to be rich with exactly those kinds of interconnections .
and as you learn , you 're given an incredible window into your own capabilities .
games are a test-bed where you can endlessly explore what an extraordinary machine you are .
take something like nintendo 's brain training .
the ' low to high ' test shows you a grid of numbers for two or three seconds , then blanks them out , and you need to tap the boxes in the order , low to high , of the numbers they contained .
when i play it , i know , as a matter of certainty , that i ca n't do it .
rather proud i do n't even have time to read the numbers , let alone order them , let alone memorise them .
but somehow , even though i ca n't do it , my brain can .
and so i get to watch , astonished and really rather proud , as my hand taps out the right sequence .
if i 'm playing guitar hero on the expert setting , i know as a matter of certainty that i ca n't keep up with the sequence of notes streaming by .
not least because my eyes go completely out of focus within about a minute .
and yet , somehow , my brain and my hand have done a deal , and notes are streaming out of the screen and my score is through the roof .
check me out - i 'm amazing .
and that 's not arrogance .
i do n't take any credit for it .
i ca n't .
same as i ca n't take credit for the million biological and chemical wonders that my body sorts out for me day in , day out , and the gallons of maths and physics my brain processes to get me across a road safely .
games let you be a spectator in your own head .
they 're laboratories which let you contrive test after test - tweak a condition here and a parameter there - and give you a visible , beautiful read-out on just how smart your brain really is .
and in doing that , they give you more insight into your own capabilities than i 've ever found in any work of literature or any piece of music .
and that 's why i play games .

i 've been in love with games for half my life .
in the time it 's taken me to get from a swotty kid to a professional journalist , they 've been a hobby and a job , a distraction and an inspiration .
they 've made me friends , taught me chinese history , and helped me conquer my phobia of slugs .
but the more i play , the more i 'm struck by an unavoidable realisation .
games are rubbish .
really , dismally , rubbish .
they 're expensive .
extraordinarily expensive , once you factor in the hardware you need to play them .
they 're massively - and awkwardly - time consuming .
there are games with 24 hour day / night cycles which you may need to play at particular times .
save points there are games with badly spaced save-points so you 're left with the choice of switching off when it suits you and losing an hour of progress , or playing on even if it does n't .
and they 're boring .
so , very , very boring .
even setting aside the fact that all you do is sit still and twitch your fingers , for hours on end , there 's the fact that what you do in games is so relentlessly repetitive .
kill the same enemies hundreds and hundreds of times .
race round and round and round the same circuits .
and then you buy a new game , with new exciting possibilities , and you kill some new enemies hundreds and hundreds of times , and race round some new tracks till you 're dizzy .
and - here 's the kicker - games are n't just boring , inconvenient , and over-priced .
they 're designed to make you feel like a failure .
there 's a very good chance - a certainty in most games - that there will come a point where the game will beat you .
where you 'll sit in your own house while a bit of software you paid big money for , and devoted hours to , calls you a loser .
why on earth would you want to do this stuff ?
everyone has their own answer to that , of course - that the violence is therapeutic , that the levelling-up is good for your self esteem , that the stories are better than they 're reputed to be , that the spectacle on offer outdoes the best that producer jerry bruckheimer has to offer .
factual learning but my answer is considerably swottier than that .
it 's that games are educational .
it 's not what they teach - since what they teach -lrb- a smattering of chinese history excepted -rrb- is largely useless .
it 's that they teach .
