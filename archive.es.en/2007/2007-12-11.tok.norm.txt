the expected declaration of independence by kosovo has a number of nations on edge .
those who oppose kosovo 's autonomy harbor separatists of their own .
a free kosovo could be just the rallying call these movements need . with all the signs pointing towards a declaration of independence from kosovo after the un-set deadline for reaching a settlement passes on monday , the european union is bracing itself for a wave of renewed calls for autonomy from separatist movements across europe .
if kosovo declares independence from serbia , it will set a powerful precedent for movements from spain to scotland , all wanting to rewrite the map of europe and form their own independent states , according to experts .
" there is a real risk that the quasi-dogma of the intangibility of borders which has existed since the end of the world war ii will fall , " french political scientist jean-yves camus of the paris-based iris institute told afp .
" this would benefit movements which seek to rewrite the map of europe based on ethnic , linguistic or cultural criteria , " added camus , a specialist on separatist movements in europe .
the emergence of similar lifestyles and english as a common language in europe , combined with the disappearance of borders and the lack of democratic legitimacy of eu bodies , had fueled " the development of micro-distinctive identities , " said camus .

liz mohn leads family-run bertelsmann ag , the world 's fifth largest media conglomerate .
in an interview for dw-world.de 's chinese web site , she explained why love and respect are vital for global business success . dw-world.de : you 've spent a lot of time in china - what are your impressions ?
liz mohn : i am in awe of the chinese for making such an enormous economic leap .
it takes time to change a culture - you ca n't do it from one day to the next .
but they are really accomplishing a lot there .
it shows that the chinese people today are well educated .
without brains and talent , they could n't do it .
i also think the government learned they need to be careful about how to make people follow their ideas .
do germans see china 's economic growth and political importance as a challenge - or a threat ?
neither nor .
we have such a huge market in china .
it offers huge opportunities for both europe and china , not just on one side .
it is a unique experience .
there has n't been anything like it , any time since -lsb- world war ii -rsb- : that a whole world opens up , and we have the good fortune to experience it .
german chancellor angela merkel recently invited the dalai lama to visit germany , which has been hard on the relationship between china and germany .
what is your take on that ?
i think when different cultures come together , mistakes can be made on both sides .
in the christian religion , we say people should forgive .
without mistakes , we ca n't learn .
but i think different cultures do n't learn to understand each other overnight .
does bertelsmann have a long-term strategy in china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing once had bikes , now there are cars bertelsmann has been growing in china since 1995 and it is a market that we want to get into even more .
i think everything we do there is on a long-term basis .
there are so many questions you ca n't answer immediately .
things change so quickly with globalization .
bertelsmann has a long history .
what are you particularly proud of ?
we are the only media concern world-wide that is involved with so many different cultures .
when we went overseas , we respected the other cultures .
that was the strength of our company after the war .
despite the age of digitalization , statistics show germans still read a lot .
that is different in china though .
is your china strategy successful ?
as far as i know , the chinese like to read .
they are a cultured people .
but today people may be more likely to take an audio book , sure .
new times call for new measures .
i 'm amazed when i see the changes on the streets in china today .
how full they are with cars .
when i first started going to china , 12 or 13 years ago , it was bikes , then mopeds .
i found it fascinating to watch the changes - and i am amazed as how much they have achieved .
before china opened up to the west , people had little freedom .
now , young people are colorful .
they 've gotten more room to think , to live .
you claim that bertelsmann 's management culture relies on individuality and creativity .
how can we know that this is n't just lip service ?
after all , centralized leadership and hierarchy can be practical .
because without this management culture , bertelsmann would never have been as successful as it has been .
through our wartime experiences , and before the war , we saw what it meant to have a dictatorship .
no freedom .
later we saw that if you give people freedom to be creative and to think , then they are motivated .
when you are fair to people , and respect them , then people come together and work together , and you get a great success .
you have worked alongside your husband -lrb- bertelsmann owner reinhard mohn -rrb- , and been increasingly active , for years .
what aspect of your own personality is visible in bertelsmann 's culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard mohn , now 85 , has handed much power to his wife first i think that it is important to teach basic values - love and respect .
and to know that it is important to give something to society , not just take .
now , china is starting to develop charitable foundations .
i find that great .
and citizens are starting to create businesses that also help society .
these are huge advances .
you 've said creating a management style is bertelsmann 's most important business tool , given globalization .
is that true ?
yes .
for example , from our headquarters , we can not simply order around one of our managers in china .
he has to use his own head , his own ideas .
but at the same time , he needs to keep in mind the greater goals for company are .
he needs to know … what kind of mental and spiritual orientation we have , our values .
what are some other challenges for bertelsmann ?
finding good talent .
people who can lead worldwide .
you have sometimes been called an " iron lady " - is this an accurate description ?
well , i would n't say i am " ironclad . "
i might say : you need to use power to get something done .
otherwise you do n't get anywhere in this world .
you need to have a goal , and bring people along with you .
what other qualities make a good business leader ?
i like dealing with people very much , and that 's why i like my job so much .
i get to dialog with people from all over the world .
and i see that the more i learn , the more i have the feeling that i know nothing at all .
your story - you were a telephone operator who has become the head of a fifth-generation business family - is widely known .
is your life really like a fairy tale ?
no .
the people who know me well , know that you never get to the top without discipline and hard work .
you just ca n't do it any other way .
you also have to make mistakes .
that is a burden .
i think i was fortunate to meet a man who both helped me come into more responsibility in this part of my life , and to experience what i do today .
next year we will have been married for 50 years .
that is a long time .
you still appreciate your husband so much after 50 years of marriage ?
that 's unusual these days .
he is a great businessman , a great person , a great philosopher , he is never arrogant , always humble .
he 's always working on behalf of the workers in our company , and many of our employees look up to him as an example . interview : zhu hong -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

liz mohn leads family-run bertelsmann ag , the world 's fifth largest media conglomerate .
in an interview for dw-world.de 's chinese web site , she explained why love and respect are vital for global business success . dw-world.de : you 've spent a lot of time in china - what are your impressions ?
liz mohn : i am in awe of the chinese for making such an enormous economic leap .
it takes time to change a culture - you ca n't do it from one day to the next .
but they are really accomplishing a lot there .
it shows that the chinese people today are well educated .
without brains and talent , they could n't do it .
i also think the government learned they need to be careful about how to make people follow their ideas .
do germans see china 's economic growth and political importance as a challenge - or a threat ?
neither nor .
we have such a huge market in china .
it offers huge opportunities for both europe and china , not just on one side .
it is a unique experience .
there has n't been anything like it , any time since -lsb- world war ii -rsb- : that a whole world opens up , and we have the good fortune to experience it .
german chancellor angela merkel recently invited the dalai lama to visit germany , which has been hard on the relationship between china and germany .
what is your take on that ?
i think when different cultures come together , mistakes can be made on both sides .
in the christian religion , we say people should forgive .
without mistakes , we ca n't learn .
but i think different cultures do n't learn to understand each other overnight .
does bertelsmann have a long-term strategy in china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing once had bikes , now there are cars bertelsmann has been growing in china since 1995 and it is a market that we want to get into even more .
i think everything we do there is on a long-term basis .
there are so many questions you ca n't answer immediately .
things change so quickly with globalization .
bertelsmann has a long history .
what are you particularly proud of ?
we are the only media concern world-wide that is involved with so many different cultures .
when we went overseas , we respected the other cultures .
that was the strength of our company after the war .

is your china strategy successful ?
as far as i know , the chinese like to read .
they are a cultured people .

i 'm amazed when i see the changes on the streets in china today .
how full they are with cars .
when i first started going to china , 12 or 13 years ago , it was bikes , then mopeds .
i found it fascinating to watch the changes - and i am amazed as how much they have achieved .
before china opened up to the west , people had little freedom .
now , young people are colorful .
they 've gotten more room to think , to live .
you claim that bertelsmann 's management culture relies on individuality and creativity .
how can we know that this is n't just lip service ?
after all , centralized leadership and hierarchy can be practical .
because without this management culture , bertelsmann would never have been as successful as it has been .
through our wartime experiences , and before the war , we saw what it meant to have a dictatorship .
no freedom .
later we saw that if you give people freedom to be creative and to think , then they are motivated .
when you are fair to people , and respect them , then people come together and work together , and you get a great success .

i find that great .
and citizens are starting to create businesses that also help society .

finding good talent .
people who can lead worldwide .
you have sometimes been called an " iron lady " - is this an accurate description ?
well , i would n't say i am " ironclad . "
i might say : you need to use power to get something done .
otherwise you do n't get anywhere in this world .
you need to have a goal , and bring people along with you .
what other qualities make a good business leader ?
i like dealing with people very much , and that 's why i like my job so much .
i get to dialog with people from all over the world .

the expected declaration of independence by kosovo has a number of nations on edge .
those who oppose kosovo 's autonomy harbor separatists of their own .
a free kosovo could be just the rallying call these movements need . with all the signs pointing towards a declaration of independence from kosovo after the un-set deadline for reaching a settlement passes on monday , the european union is bracing itself for a wave of renewed calls for autonomy from separatist movements across europe .
if kosovo declares independence from serbia , it will set a powerful precedent for movements from spain to scotland , all wanting to rewrite the map of europe and form their own independent states , according to experts .
" there is a real risk that the quasi-dogma of the intangibility of borders which has existed since the end of the world war ii will fall , " french political scientist jean-yves camus of the paris-based iris institute told afp .
" this would benefit movements which seek to rewrite the map of europe based on ethnic , linguistic or cultural criteria , " added camus , a specialist on separatist movements in europe .
the emergence of similar lifestyles and english as a common language in europe , combined with the disappearance of borders and the lack of democratic legitimacy of eu bodies , had fueled " the development of micro-distinctive identities , " said camus .
while kosovo 's ethnic majority leaders have vowed not to unilaterally declare independence from serbia without us and european union approval , they are expected to announce their intentions to form a new state in early 2008 .
opposition includes fear of own breakaway states many of the countries which oppose the creation of an independent state of kosovo have at least one separatist movement working towards autonomy within their own borders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has been fighting chechen separatists for years serbia 's ally russia , which leads the opposition , has problems with separatists in chechnya and the caucasus region while spain has had a long-running dispute with the armed eta movement .
other countries against kosovo 's independence such as cyprus and greece have ethnic minorities which demand more power .
" in the west , this -lsb- kosovo -rsb- solution will set off separatists in europe , ” russian president vladimir putin said in an interview published in french newspaper le figaro earlier this year . ” look at scotland , catalonia and the basque country . "
spain is currently experiencing a period of unease as its northern basque country and its wealthy northeastern region of catalonia have stepped up their demands for more autonomy .
last year catalan voters overwhelmingly backed a new charter which recognized the region as a " nation " within spain and grants it enhanced powers in taxation and judicial matters .
separatists claim eu structure makes autonomy possible as in other separatist regions of europe like flanders , the dutch-speaking northern part of belgium , and northern italy , supporters said catalonia deserved extra powers because it makes a bigger contribution to the economy .
the armed basque separatist group eta ended a 15-month ceasefire in june while the scottish national party , which came to power in may , plans to hold a referendum on independence in 2010 .

for many nationalists , membership in the 27-nation european union has only served to make separation seem more viable .
" europe can regulate our functionings and transfer payments .
why must we maintain this intermediate roof we call belgium , " the leader of the flemish nationalist party , bart de wever , told french daily le monde last month .
russia to block independence at un level meanwhile , russia stepped up its opposition tuesday by announcing that it would demand that the un security council annul any unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo .
" russia will of course demand the annulment of such a decision .
we will demand a meeting of the security council because it would be a violation of a council resolution , " russia 's interfax news agency quoted the country 's chief kosovo negotiator alexander botsan-kharchenko as saying . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 11.12.2007 polish pm calls for world war ii museum ahead of berlin visit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the battle of gdansk in 1939 is considered the start of world war ii poland 's new prime minister thinks that the baltic port city of gdansk is the perfect location for a museum commemorating the war and its consequences .
berlin would rather stick to its own plans for remembrance . poland 's prime minister , donald tusk , called on monday , dec .
10 , for a grand-scale world war ii museum in the northern polish city of gdansk , the site of the nazi invasion on sept .
1 , 1939 . other countries , including germany , russia and israel could have a part in the museum , which was proposed as an alternative to a plan for an exhibition in berlin to remember german expellees from central and eastern europe during and just after world war ii . in the large gdansk museum , " the fate of expellees would have a place in a conclusive and comprehensive context , " said tusk in an interview with the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . the coastal city of gdansk , located on the baltic sea , is ripe with symbolic meaning . " the war began here , but in a sense it also ended here when the solidarity movement was founded in 1980 , " tusk said . started by polish laborers under lech walesa , solidarity , or solidarnosc , played a key role in the fall of communism in the former east-bloc country . berlin adamant about expulsion center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk became prime minister last month in response , the german government made it clear that tusk 's statement would have no bearing on plans for the expulsion center .
the governing coalition agreed in their founding contract in 2005 to set up a " visible sign of remembrance against expulsion " in berlin , said government spokesman thomas steg . the conflict began some seven years ago when the league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- started a foundation for a proposed expellee center .
the organization , which campaigns for the rights and remembrance of ethnic german expellees , has been seen in poland as overstating german suffering surrounding the holocaust . " the problem is not that anyone wants to prevent the germans from remembering the suffering of their own people , " tusk said .
" it becomes problematic when this remembrance of the german suffering diminishes another memory - namely that of the collective responsibility of the germans . " points of contention on tusk-merkel agenda the question of remembrance is likely to be a major agenda point when tusk meets with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin on tuesday . the two leaders are also slated to broach the ongoing issue of restitution claims for german expellees and re-settlers . the prussian claims society submitted claims for 22 individual claims cases to the european court for human rights in strasbourg in 2006 , requesting the return of land and property in present-day poland to ethnic germans who were forced out of their homes during the war . several more cases have been submitted since then , and still others are being reviewed in polish courts . " the german government has to take responsibility for the possible financial consequences arising from the compensation claims , " tusk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should expelled german be compensated for what they lost ?
berlin has maintained repeatedly that it does n't support such claims , with then german chancellor gerhard schröder making a binding statement to that effect in warsaw in 2004 . according to german estimates , some 15 million ethnic germans were expelled from their homes during or directly following the war .
some two million are thought to have died in the process . poland fears pipeline puts gas supply at risk plans for a joint russian-german gas pipeline along the baltic sea will be another matter of discussion at tuesday 's meeting . currently , russia sends gas to western europe via poland , but the baltic sea pipeline would circumvent the central european country .
poland has expressed concern that , in a political crisis , russia could shut its gas supply without affecting delivery to - and , hence , relations with - western europe . ahead of tuesday 's talks , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed optimism over the future of bilateral relations . " a concrete program to improve cooperation between the governments is being worked on , " he told the polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza on monday .

berlin would rather stick to its own plans for remembrance . poland 's prime minister , donald tusk , called on monday , dec .
10 , for a grand-scale world war ii museum in the northern polish city of gdansk , the site of the nazi invasion on sept .
1 , 1939 . other countries , including germany , russia and israel could have a part in the museum , which was proposed as an alternative to a plan for an exhibition in berlin to remember german expellees from central and eastern europe during and just after world war ii . in the large gdansk museum , " the fate of expellees would have a place in a conclusive and comprehensive context , " said tusk in an interview with the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . the coastal city of gdansk , located on the baltic sea , is ripe with symbolic meaning . " the war began here , but in a sense it also ended here when the solidarity movement was founded in 1980 , " tusk said . started by polish laborers under lech walesa , solidarity , or solidarnosc , played a key role in the fall of communism in the former east-bloc country . berlin adamant about expulsion center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk became prime minister last month in response , the german government made it clear that tusk 's statement would have no bearing on plans for the expulsion center .
the governing coalition agreed in their founding contract in 2005 to set up a " visible sign of remembrance against expulsion " in berlin , said government spokesman thomas steg . the conflict began some seven years ago when the league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- started a foundation for a proposed expellee center .
the organization , which campaigns for the rights and remembrance of ethnic german expellees , has been seen in poland as overstating german suffering surrounding the holocaust . " the problem is not that anyone wants to prevent the germans from remembering the suffering of their own people , " tusk said .
" it becomes problematic when this remembrance of the german suffering diminishes another memory - namely that of the collective responsibility of the germans . " points of contention on tusk-merkel agenda the question of remembrance is likely to be a major agenda point when tusk meets with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin on tuesday . the two leaders are also slated to broach the ongoing issue of restitution claims for german expellees and re-settlers . the prussian claims society submitted claims for 22 individual claims cases to the european court for human rights in strasbourg in 2006 , requesting the return of land and property in present-day poland to ethnic germans who were forced out of their homes during the war . several more cases have been submitted since then , and still others are being reviewed in polish courts . " the german government has to take responsibility for the possible financial consequences arising from the compensation claims , " tusk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should expelled german be compensated for what they lost ?
berlin has maintained repeatedly that it does n't support such claims , with then german chancellor gerhard schröder making a binding statement to that effect in warsaw in 2004 . according to german estimates , some 15 million ethnic germans were expelled from their homes during or directly following the war .
some two million are thought to have died in the process . poland fears pipeline puts gas supply at risk plans for a joint russian-german gas pipeline along the baltic sea will be another matter of discussion at tuesday 's meeting . currently , russia sends gas to western europe via poland , but the baltic sea pipeline would circumvent the central european country .
poland has expressed concern that , in a political crisis , russia could shut its gas supply without affecting delivery to - and , hence , relations with - western europe . ahead of tuesday 's talks , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed optimism over the future of bilateral relations . " a concrete program to improve cooperation between the governments is being worked on , " he told the polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza on monday .

berlin would rather stick to its own plans for remembrance . poland 's prime minister , donald tusk , called on monday , dec .
10 , for a grand-scale world war ii museum in the northern polish city of gdansk , the site of the nazi invasion on sept .
1 , 1939 . other countries , including germany , russia and israel could have a part in the museum , which was proposed as an alternative to a plan for an exhibition in berlin to remember german expellees from central and eastern europe during and just after world war ii . in the large gdansk museum , " the fate of expellees would have a place in a conclusive and comprehensive context , " said tusk in an interview with the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . the coastal city of gdansk , located on the baltic sea , is ripe with symbolic meaning . " the war began here , but in a sense it also ended here when the solidarity movement was founded in 1980 , " tusk said . started by polish laborers under lech walesa , solidarity , or solidarnosc , played a key role in the fall of communism in the former east-bloc country . berlin adamant about expulsion center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk became prime minister last month in response , the german government made it clear that tusk 's statement would have no bearing on plans for the expulsion center .
the governing coalition agreed in their founding contract in 2005 to set up a " visible sign of remembrance against expulsion " in berlin , said government spokesman thomas steg . the conflict began some seven years ago when the league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- started a foundation for a proposed expellee center .
the organization , which campaigns for the rights and remembrance of ethnic german expellees , has been seen in poland as overstating german suffering surrounding the holocaust . " the problem is not that anyone wants to prevent the germans from remembering the suffering of their own people , " tusk said .
" it becomes problematic when this remembrance of the german suffering diminishes another memory - namely that of the collective responsibility of the germans . " points of contention on tusk-merkel agenda the question of remembrance is likely to be a major agenda point when tusk meets with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin on tuesday . the two leaders are also slated to broach the ongoing issue of restitution claims for german expellees and re-settlers . the prussian claims society submitted claims for 22 individual claims cases to the european court for human rights in strasbourg in 2006 , requesting the return of land and property in present-day poland to ethnic germans who were forced out of their homes during the war . several more cases have been submitted since then , and still others are being reviewed in polish courts . " the german government has to take responsibility for the possible financial consequences arising from the compensation claims , " tusk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should expelled german be compensated for what they lost ?
berlin has maintained repeatedly that it does n't support such claims , with then german chancellor gerhard schröder making a binding statement to that effect in warsaw in 2004 . according to german estimates , some 15 million ethnic germans were expelled from their homes during or directly following the war .
some two million are thought to have died in the process . poland fears pipeline puts gas supply at risk plans for a joint russian-german gas pipeline along the baltic sea will be another matter of discussion at tuesday 's meeting . currently , russia sends gas to western europe via poland , but the baltic sea pipeline would circumvent the central european country .
poland has expressed concern that , in a political crisis , russia could shut its gas supply without affecting delivery to - and , hence , relations with - western europe . ahead of tuesday 's talks , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed optimism over the future of bilateral relations . " a concrete program to improve cooperation between the governments is being worked on , " he told the polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza on monday .
" the german and polish ministers will now meet together frequently and regularly . " topics of friction , such as expellee claims and the baltic pipeline would be dealt with " openly and constructively , " he added . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world 's ingo mannteufel says the liberal technocrat will uphold putin 's political course - with or without him as pm . the guessing game is over .
for months now , russian politics have been dominated by the question of who will succeed russian president vladimir putin in march 2008 .
russian law prevents presidents from standing for a third term of office .
speculation was rife about putin 's next move .
one scenario put forward was that putin would alter the constitution .
another saw putin naming a stand-in president , then returning to office after having fulfilled the constitution 's technical requirements .
it was difficult to imagine russia being governed by another politician after eight years of putin .
medvedev certain to be elected the russian president has decided to back dmitry medvedev , first deputy prime minister and board chairman of gas giant gazprom , to stand as a presidential candidate in march 2008 .
given what happened in russian parliamentary poll in early december , it is practically certain that medvedev will be elected in the first round of the elections on march 2 .
the kremlin propaganda machine functions magnificently , the administrative apparatus runs smoothly , and the significant size of russian security forces remove any lingering doubt about the outcome of the poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel there is no point in bemoaning the poor prospects for democracy in russia in the light of such political relations .
the vague and possibly premature hopes for a rapid democratization of russia were snuffed out some time ago .
with his decision in favor of medvedev , president putin has made a bold move and answered a number of questions about himself and russia 's future course .
not just a fill-in president putin will step down as president in march 2008 .
the intention is that 42-year-old medvedev should be president for the next four years - in all likelihood much longer .
medvedev is completely unsuited to just act as a stand-in who would keep the presidential post warm for putin .
in this respect , putin has remained true to himself - in spite of what all his opponents and his sycophantic supporters have said .
after all , he always said he would not violate the constitution in order to remain in office .
however , the end of putin 's presidential era does not spell the end of putin as the leading light in russian politics .
he will retain considerable influence over russian politics as head of united russia , or possibly as prime minister .
we will have to wait and see if putin will take up medvedev 's offer to take on the job of pm under him .
at any rate , medvedev is not expected to usher in any decisive course change .
putin 's longstanding ally has always been directly involved from the outset in shaping and representing putin 's policies in his previous posts .
medvedev looks set to continue pursuing putin 's goal of modernizing russia because he shares his convictions .
the loyal technocrat is the ideal candidate to ensure that putin 's course is maintained without the current president having to resort to any trickery with the constitution .
past will burden relations with europe president medvedev will be blemished by the fact that he has emerged from putin 's powerhouse .
his previous role as chair of the board at gazprom will also not help his popularity in europe given the poor image of the russia energy giant here .
on the other hand , medvedev is not the worst candidate from amongst the current russian elite .
the former law professor from st. petersburg is reputed to be one of the more liberal spirits in the kremlin .
in addition , he has no direct contacts to the soviet or the post-soviet security services .
and given his relative youth , he also stands for a new russia that europe - and the west in general - will have to learn to live with .
the russian president 's decision to select medvedev is not likely to find favor with all of the factions who putin can currently rally behind him .
the effects of a change in president in terms of who has what access to important financial and business resources are not likely to be clear for a while , and the process will not be without its tensions .
the question is whether the first cracks within russia 's kremlin elite will already have become apparent ahead of the elections in march , thus threatening the transfer of power .
then things could get tricky for putin as the one responsible for naming medvedev his political heir .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 11.12.2007 opinion : medvedev will uphold putin 's legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president vladimir putin has chosen dmitry medvedev to stand as presidential candidate next march .
dw-world 's ingo mannteufel says the liberal technocrat will uphold putin 's political course - with or without him as pm . the guessing game is over .
for months now , russian politics have been dominated by the question of who will succeed russian president vladimir putin in march 2008 .
russian law prevents presidents from standing for a third term of office .
speculation was rife about putin 's next move .
one scenario put forward was that putin would alter the constitution .
another saw putin naming a stand-in president , then returning to office after having fulfilled the constitution 's technical requirements .
it was difficult to imagine russia being governed by another politician after eight years of putin .
medvedev certain to be elected the russian president has decided to back dmitry medvedev , first deputy prime minister and board chairman of gas giant gazprom , to stand as a presidential candidate in march 2008 .
given what happened in russian parliamentary poll in early december , it is practically certain that medvedev will be elected in the first round of the elections on march 2 .
the kremlin propaganda machine functions magnificently , the administrative apparatus runs smoothly , and the significant size of russian security forces remove any lingering doubt about the outcome of the poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel there is no point in bemoaning the poor prospects for democracy in russia in the light of such political relations .
the vague and possibly premature hopes for a rapid democratization of russia were snuffed out some time ago .
with his decision in favor of medvedev , president putin has made a bold move and answered a number of questions about himself and russia 's future course .
not just a fill-in president putin will step down as president in march 2008 .
the intention is that 42-year-old medvedev should be president for the next four years - in all likelihood much longer .
medvedev is completely unsuited to just act as a stand-in who would keep the presidential post warm for putin .
in this respect , putin has remained true to himself - in spite of what all his opponents and his sycophantic supporters have said .
after all , he always said he would not violate the constitution in order to remain in office .
however , the end of putin 's presidential era does not spell the end of putin as the leading light in russian politics .
he will retain considerable influence over russian politics as head of united russia , or possibly as prime minister .
we will have to wait and see if putin will take up medvedev 's offer to take on the job of pm under him .
at any rate , medvedev is not expected to usher in any decisive course change .
putin 's longstanding ally has always been directly involved from the outset in shaping and representing putin 's policies in his previous posts .
medvedev looks set to continue pursuing putin 's goal of modernizing russia because he shares his convictions .
the loyal technocrat is the ideal candidate to ensure that putin 's course is maintained without the current president having to resort to any trickery with the constitution .
past will burden relations with europe president medvedev will be blemished by the fact that he has emerged from putin 's powerhouse .
his previous role as chair of the board at gazprom will also not help his popularity in europe given the poor image of the russia energy giant here .
on the other hand , medvedev is not the worst candidate from amongst the current russian elite .
the former law professor from st. petersburg is reputed to be one of the more liberal spirits in the kremlin .
in addition , he has no direct contacts to the soviet or the post-soviet security services .
and given his relative youth , he also stands for a new russia that europe - and the west in general - will have to learn to live with .
the russian president 's decision to select medvedev is not likely to find favor with all of the factions who putin can currently rally behind him .
the effects of a change in president in terms of who has what access to important financial and business resources are not likely to be clear for a while , and the process will not be without its tensions .
the question is whether the first cracks within russia 's kremlin elite will already have become apparent ahead of the elections in march , thus threatening the transfer of power .
then things could get tricky for putin as the one responsible for naming medvedev his political heir .

dw-world.de putin endorses loyalist medvedev as presidential candidate russian president vladimir putin has backed his ally dimitry medvedev to succeed him next march .
the fact that medvedev 's not a member of putin 's party makes it even more likely that he 'll become russia 's next leader .

chancellor angela merkel was all ears .
but will talking about disagreements solve anything ? " there should be no taboo subjects , " tusk said at the press conference after the two-hour meeting with merkel in berlin on tuesday , dec .
11 .
" we are friends , and friends ca n't get themselves into a situation of not talking to one another . "
tusk 's tone stood in marked contrast to that of his conservative predecessor , jaroslav kaczynski , who often seemed to go out of his way to offend german sensibilities .
the more eu-friendly tusk defeated kaczynski in poland 's hotly contested national election in november .
merkel was keen to echo the theme of a new polish-german frankness and friendship .
" we 've pledged not dodge any problems , " merkel said .
" together we can get a lot accomplished . "
a problematic past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as per the schengen agreement , the german-polish border will be opened in 2008 tusk and merkel arranged to meet with czech prime minister mirek topolanek on dec .
21 to discuss the opening of borders between the three countries .
and they also addressed two of the most contentious issues dividing poland and germany .
one of them is how to remember the past and , specifically , a planned memorial in berlin to expellees during world war ii - including germans driven from their homes in poland .
many poles see the project as an attempt to revise history and lessen germany 's wartime culpability .
tusk said he favored treating the subject of expellees of all nationalities in a museum about world war ii to be built in the city of gdansk , which used to be part of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is no doubt happy to have a new counterpart in warsaw merkel asserted that a museum could not replace the berlin memorial , but said that she supported the museum idea .
she also promised to send a delegation to warsaw to keep poland informed about the memorial and said germany had no interest in reviving past conflicts .
" there are no demands whatsoever for reparations from poland -lsb- to german refugees -rsb- , " merkel said .
" no german government is going to take a position that deviates from this . "
tusk said he welcomed the assurance as a " moment with symbolic value . "
a present pipeline merkel also discussed the natural-gas pipeline to be built under the baltic sea , which would connect germany with russia but bypass poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic pipeline remains a major sticking point tusk suggested that a meeting be arranged between the three countries to discuss the project in its current form .
such a meeting , he said , could bring about " positive corrections on both sides . "
the pipeline , which was negotiated by merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , has angered many poles , who worry about being held hostage on energy policy by russia and feel they have been ignored by their more powerful neighbors .
clearly , much work needs to be done to resolve such conflicts of interest , but tusk 's visit did re-establish a more civil tone between germany and poland .

chancellor angela merkel was all ears .
but will talking about disagreements solve anything ? " there should be no taboo subjects , " tusk said at the press conference after the two-hour meeting with merkel in berlin on tuesday , dec .
11 .
" we are friends , and friends ca n't get themselves into a situation of not talking to one another . "
tusk 's tone stood in marked contrast to that of his conservative predecessor , jaroslav kaczynski , who often seemed to go out of his way to offend german sensibilities .
the more eu-friendly tusk defeated kaczynski in poland 's hotly contested national election in november .
merkel was keen to echo the theme of a new polish-german frankness and friendship .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 11.12.2007 opinion : medvedev will uphold putin 's legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president vladimir putin has chosen dmitry medvedev to stand as presidential candidate next march .
dw-world 's ingo mannteufel says the liberal technocrat will uphold putin 's political course - with or without him as pm . the guessing game is over .
for months now , russian politics have been dominated by the question of who will succeed russian president vladimir putin in march 2008 .
russian law prevents presidents from standing for a third term of office .
speculation was rife about putin 's next move .
one scenario put forward was that putin would alter the constitution .
another saw putin naming a stand-in president , then returning to office after having fulfilled the constitution 's technical requirements .
it was difficult to imagine russia being governed by another politician after eight years of putin .
medvedev certain to be elected the russian president has decided to back dmitry medvedev , first deputy prime minister and board chairman of gas giant gazprom , to stand as a presidential candidate in march 2008 .
given what happened in russian parliamentary poll in early december , it is practically certain that medvedev will be elected in the first round of the elections on march 2 .
the kremlin propaganda machine functions magnificently , the administrative apparatus runs smoothly , and the significant size of russian security forces remove any lingering doubt about the outcome of the poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel there is no point in bemoaning the poor prospects for democracy in russia in the light of such political relations .
the vague and possibly premature hopes for a rapid democratization of russia were snuffed out some time ago .
with his decision in favor of medvedev , president putin has made a bold move and answered a number of questions about himself and russia 's future course .
not just a fill-in president putin will step down as president in march 2008 .
the intention is that 42-year-old medvedev should be president for the next four years - in all likelihood much longer .
medvedev is completely unsuited to just act as a stand-in who would keep the presidential post warm for putin .
in this respect , putin has remained true to himself - in spite of what all his opponents and his sycophantic supporters have said .
after all , he always said he would not violate the constitution in order to remain in office .
however , the end of putin 's presidential era does not spell the end of putin as the leading light in russian politics .
he will retain considerable influence over russian politics as head of united russia , or possibly as prime minister .
we will have to wait and see if putin will take up medvedev 's offer to take on the job of pm under him .
at any rate , medvedev is not expected to usher in any decisive course change .
putin 's longstanding ally has always been directly involved from the outset in shaping and representing putin 's policies in his previous posts .
medvedev looks set to continue pursuing putin 's goal of modernizing russia because he shares his convictions .
the loyal technocrat is the ideal candidate to ensure that putin 's course is maintained without the current president having to resort to any trickery with the constitution .
past will burden relations with europe president medvedev will be blemished by the fact that he has emerged from putin 's powerhouse .
his previous role as chair of the board at gazprom will also not help his popularity in europe given the poor image of the russia energy giant here .
on the other hand , medvedev is not the worst candidate from amongst the current russian elite .
the former law professor from st. petersburg is reputed to be one of the more liberal spirits in the kremlin .
in addition , he has no direct contacts to the soviet or the post-soviet security services .
and given his relative youth , he also stands for a new russia that europe - and the west in general - will have to learn to live with .
the russian president 's decision to select medvedev is not likely to find favor with all of the factions who putin can currently rally behind him .
the effects of a change in president in terms of who has what access to important financial and business resources are not likely to be clear for a while , and the process will not be without its tensions .
the question is whether the first cracks within russia 's kremlin elite will already have become apparent ahead of the elections in march , thus threatening the transfer of power .
then things could get tricky for putin as the one responsible for naming medvedev his political heir .

dw-world.de putin endorses loyalist medvedev as presidential candidate russian president vladimir putin has backed his ally dimitry medvedev to succeed him next march .
the fact that medvedev 's not a member of putin 's party makes it even more likely that he 'll become russia 's next leader .
-lrb- 10.12.2007 -rrb- putin 's party wins russia elections amid vote-rigging claims vladimir putin 's united russia party won a landslide majority in parliamentary elections , but opposition parties , observers and western nations have criticized the lack of transparency in the election .

liz mohn leads family-run bertelsmann ag , the world 's fifth largest media conglomerate .
in an interview for dw-world.de 's chinese web site , she explained why love and respect are vital for global business success . dw-world.de : you 've spent a lot of time in china - what are your impressions ?
liz mohn : i am in awe of the chinese for making such an enormous economic leap .
it takes time to change a culture - you ca n't do it from one day to the next .
but they are really accomplishing a lot there .
it shows that the chinese people today are well educated .
without brains and talent , they could n't do it .
i also think the government learned they need to be careful about how to make people follow their ideas .
do germans see china 's economic growth and political importance as a challenge - or a threat ?
neither nor .
we have such a huge market in china .
it offers huge opportunities for both europe and china , not just on one side .
it is a unique experience .
there has n't been anything like it , any time since -lsb- world war ii -rsb- : that a whole world opens up , and we have the good fortune to experience it .
german chancellor angela merkel recently invited the dalai lama to visit germany , which has been hard on the relationship between china and germany .
what is your take on that ?
i think when different cultures come together , mistakes can be made on both sides .
in the christian religion , we say people should forgive .
without mistakes , we ca n't learn .
but i think different cultures do n't learn to understand each other overnight .
does bertelsmann have a long-term strategy in china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing once had bikes , now there are cars bertelsmann has been growing in china since 1995 and it is a market that we want to get into even more .
i think everything we do there is on a long-term basis .
there are so many questions you ca n't answer immediately .
things change so quickly with globalization .
bertelsmann has a long history .
what are you particularly proud of ?
we are the only media concern world-wide that is involved with so many different cultures .
when we went overseas , we respected the other cultures .
that was the strength of our company after the war .
despite the age of digitalization , statistics show germans still read a lot .
that is different in china though .
is your china strategy successful ?
as far as i know , the chinese like to read .
they are a cultured people .
but today people may be more likely to take an audio book , sure .
new times call for new measures .
i 'm amazed when i see the changes on the streets in china today .
how full they are with cars .
when i first started going to china , 12 or 13 years ago , it was bikes , then mopeds .
i found it fascinating to watch the changes - and i am amazed as how much they have achieved .
before china opened up to the west , people had little freedom .
now , young people are colorful .
they 've gotten more room to think , to live .
you claim that bertelsmann 's management culture relies on individuality and creativity .
how can we know that this is n't just lip service ?
after all , centralized leadership and hierarchy can be practical .
because without this management culture , bertelsmann would never have been as successful as it has been .
through our wartime experiences , and before the war , we saw what it meant to have a dictatorship .
no freedom .
later we saw that if you give people freedom to be creative and to think , then they are motivated .
when you are fair to people , and respect them , then people come together and work together , and you get a great success .
you have worked alongside your husband -lrb- bertelsmann owner reinhard mohn -rrb- , and been increasingly active , for years .
what aspect of your own personality is visible in bertelsmann 's culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard mohn , now 85 , has handed much power to his wife first i think that it is important to teach basic values - love and respect .
and to know that it is important to give something to society , not just take .
now , china is starting to develop charitable foundations .
i find that great .
and citizens are starting to create businesses that also help society .
these are huge advances .
you 've said creating a management style is bertelsmann 's most important business tool , given globalization .
is that true ?
yes .
for example , from our headquarters , we can not simply order around one of our managers in china .
he has to use his own head , his own ideas .
but at the same time , he needs to keep in mind the greater goals for company are .
he needs to know … what kind of mental and spiritual orientation we have , our values .
what are some other challenges for bertelsmann ?
finding good talent .
people who can lead worldwide .
you have sometimes been called an " iron lady " - is this an accurate description ?
well , i would n't say i am " ironclad . "
i might say : you need to use power to get something done .
otherwise you do n't get anywhere in this world .
you need to have a goal , and bring people along with you .
what other qualities make a good business leader ?
i like dealing with people very much , and that 's why i like my job so much .
i get to dialog with people from all over the world .
and i see that the more i learn , the more i have the feeling that i know nothing at all .
your story - you were a telephone operator who has become the head of a fifth-generation business family - is widely known .
is your life really like a fairy tale ?
no .
the people who know me well , know that you never get to the top without discipline and hard work .
you just ca n't do it any other way .
you also have to make mistakes .
that is a burden .
i think i was fortunate to meet a man who both helped me come into more responsibility in this part of my life , and to experience what i do today .
next year we will have been married for 50 years .
that is a long time .
you still appreciate your husband so much after 50 years of marriage ?
that 's unusual these days .
he is a great businessman , a great person , a great philosopher , he is never arrogant , always humble .
he 's always working on behalf of the workers in our company , and many of our employees look up to him as an example . interview : zhu hong -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview for dw-world.de 's chinese web site , she explained why love and respect are vital for global business success . dw-world.de : you 've spent a lot of time in china - what are your impressions ?
liz mohn : i am in awe of the chinese for making such an enormous economic leap .
it takes time to change a culture - you ca n't do it from one day to the next .
but they are really accomplishing a lot there .
it shows that the chinese people today are well educated .
without brains and talent , they could n't do it .
i also think the government learned they need to be careful about how to make people follow their ideas .
do germans see china 's economic growth and political importance as a challenge - or a threat ?
neither nor .
we have such a huge market in china .
it offers huge opportunities for both europe and china , not just on one side .
it is a unique experience .
there has n't been anything like it , any time since -lsb- world war ii -rsb- : that a whole world opens up , and we have the good fortune to experience it .
german chancellor angela merkel recently invited the dalai lama to visit germany , which has been hard on the relationship between china and germany .
what is your take on that ?
i think when different cultures come together , mistakes can be made on both sides .
in the christian religion , we say people should forgive .
without mistakes , we ca n't learn .
but i think different cultures do n't learn to understand each other overnight .
does bertelsmann have a long-term strategy in china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing once had bikes , now there are cars bertelsmann has been growing in china since 1995 and it is a market that we want to get into even more .
i think everything we do there is on a long-term basis .
there are so many questions you ca n't answer immediately .
things change so quickly with globalization .
bertelsmann has a long history .
what are you particularly proud of ?
we are the only media concern world-wide that is involved with so many different cultures .
when we went overseas , we respected the other cultures .
that was the strength of our company after the war .
despite the age of digitalization , statistics show germans still read a lot .
that is different in china though .
is your china strategy successful ?
as far as i know , the chinese like to read .
they are a cultured people .
but today people may be more likely to take an audio book , sure .
new times call for new measures .
i 'm amazed when i see the changes on the streets in china today .
how full they are with cars .
when i first started going to china , 12 or 13 years ago , it was bikes , then mopeds .
i found it fascinating to watch the changes - and i am amazed as how much they have achieved .
before china opened up to the west , people had little freedom .
now , young people are colorful .
they 've gotten more room to think , to live .
you claim that bertelsmann 's management culture relies on individuality and creativity .
how can we know that this is n't just lip service ?
after all , centralized leadership and hierarchy can be practical .
because without this management culture , bertelsmann would never have been as successful as it has been .
through our wartime experiences , and before the war , we saw what it meant to have a dictatorship .
no freedom .
later we saw that if you give people freedom to be creative and to think , then they are motivated .
when you are fair to people , and respect them , then people come together and work together , and you get a great success .
you have worked alongside your husband -lrb- bertelsmann owner reinhard mohn -rrb- , and been increasingly active , for years .
what aspect of your own personality is visible in bertelsmann 's culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard mohn , now 85 , has handed much power to his wife first i think that it is important to teach basic values - love and respect .
and to know that it is important to give something to society , not just take .
now , china is starting to develop charitable foundations .
i find that great .
and citizens are starting to create businesses that also help society .
these are huge advances .
you 've said creating a management style is bertelsmann 's most important business tool , given globalization .
is that true ?
yes .
for example , from our headquarters , we can not simply order around one of our managers in china .
he has to use his own head , his own ideas .
but at the same time , he needs to keep in mind the greater goals for company are .
he needs to know … what kind of mental and spiritual orientation we have , our values .
what are some other challenges for bertelsmann ?
finding good talent .
people who can lead worldwide .
you have sometimes been called an " iron lady " - is this an accurate description ?
well , i would n't say i am " ironclad . "
i might say : you need to use power to get something done .
otherwise you do n't get anywhere in this world .
you need to have a goal , and bring people along with you .
what other qualities make a good business leader ?
i like dealing with people very much , and that 's why i like my job so much .
i get to dialog with people from all over the world .
and i see that the more i learn , the more i have the feeling that i know nothing at all .
your story - you were a telephone operator who has become the head of a fifth-generation business family - is widely known .
is your life really like a fairy tale ?
no .
the people who know me well , know that you never get to the top without discipline and hard work .
you just ca n't do it any other way .
you also have to make mistakes .
that is a burden .
i think i was fortunate to meet a man who both helped me come into more responsibility in this part of my life , and to experience what i do today .
next year we will have been married for 50 years .
that is a long time .
you still appreciate your husband so much after 50 years of marriage ?
that 's unusual these days .
he is a great businessman , a great person , a great philosopher , he is never arrogant , always humble .
he 's always working on behalf of the workers in our company , and many of our employees look up to him as an example . interview : zhu hong -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is a good treaty for denmark and for europe , and the government has decided its ratification will take place in parliament and not by way of referendum , " danish premier anders fogh rasmussen said on tuesday , dec .

a majority in parliament supports the eu treaty , replacing the planned new constitution , which was rejected by french and danish voters in referenda in 2005 , triggering an institutional crisis .
on monday the leading opposition party , the social democrats , threw their weight behind parliamentary ratification .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . senator barack obama is by a wide margin the best candidate in the us presidential race .
his views on the environment , foreign policy , the war in iraq , and several other domestic issues , i.e. health care , are all the reasons that he is very popular with young and old alike . - douglas grieser , us i ca n't believe that europeans are so foolish as to believe that mrs. clinton would be a good president .
she has lied and twisted the truth from the very beginning .
she has no experience at all .
she has done nothing as senator either for new york or the us .
europeans are liberal , i know .
but , honestly - wake up ! - brent donohoe , us hillary all the way ! - willy much , canada if the objective is to win the nomination , hillary has the edge at this point .
if , however , we democrats actually want to win the election then obama is the only possible choice .
hillary would fire up the republicans like nothing ever has .
obama , on the other hand , is very charismatic and is already showing signs of picking up a few republican votes .
we democrats have a very bad habit of nominating candidates who have zero chance of winning the election .
hopefully that lesson has at last been learned .
many of us like hillary , but not enough to see another republican president !
obama is the only candidate who can prevent another two-term republican president . - steven morgan , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no readers mentioned the republican party front-runners ron paul is the only person i can vote for in the 2008 presidential race .
willi fausz , us hillary clinton has more government experience than mr. obama .
it 's too bad that mr. obama does n't want to be vice president , they would make a great team running for office together . - glen s. poskarbiewicz , us hillary clinton sold out to insurance and pharmaceutical company pressure when she was working on a national health plan and has received a lot of money from them for her campaign .
barack obama is the only candidate , as far as i know , who will not accept contributions from big business interests .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 11.12.2007 hamburg bans weapons in tough neighborhoods großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law goes way beyond traditional weaponry a new law aims to make hamburg 's red-light district , the reeperbahn , completely weapons free .
the ban encompasses not only guns and knives , but baseball bats as well .
some say that 's not going far enough . the law is based on federal legislation , passed earlier this year , allowing local states to prohibit items that can be used to endanger public safety - including fake guns .
hamburg took the lead in pushing for such legislation and is the first state within germany to enact a prohibition on the local level .
the ban covers air rifles , billy clubs , brass knuckles , baseball bats , pepper spray and most forms of mace .
carrying any of those items in the neighborhoods affected by the law can be punished with a fine of up to 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,700 -rrb- .
" this is a further element promoting the safety of people in our city , " hamburg 's interior minister , udo nagel , told the ap news agency .
" by changing the laws we finally have the possibility of reigning in violence in areas that are especially at risk . "
criminal gangs are active on the reeperbahn , and knife fights and attacks with dangerous items occur with relative frequency .
too little or waste of time ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's reeperbahn is a popular attraction - despite crime rates hamburg 's governing conservatives and police hope the bans will reduce violent crime in troubled neighborhoods .
but not everyone likes the prohibition in its current form .
green party parliamentary and interior affairs experts antje möller has called for the ban to be extended to the entire city .
she also says that something should be done about shops that sell the items concerned - of which there are a number on and near the reeperbahn .
" it ca n't be the case that you 're not allowed to carry weapons , but trading in them is publicly accepted , " möller told the german public broadcaster ndr .
others question whether the ban will have any practical affect .
" anyone serious bent on robbing , raping or murdering others is n't interested in legislation - and certainly not in weapons legislation , " wrote one blogger on the german internet news site shortnews .
it will take time to see if the weapons ban succeeds in reducing crime in hamburg .
in the meantime , anyone wanting a pick up game of baseball in the city should probably steer clear of the reeperbahn . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 11.12.2007 opinion : medvedev will uphold putin 's legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president vladimir putin has chosen dmitry medvedev to stand as presidential candidate next march .
dw-world 's ingo mannteufel says the liberal technocrat will uphold putin 's political course - with or without him as pm . the guessing game is over .
for months now , russian politics have been dominated by the question of who will succeed russian president vladimir putin in march 2008 .
russian law prevents presidents from standing for a third term of office .
speculation was rife about putin 's next move .
one scenario put forward was that putin would alter the constitution .
another saw putin naming a stand-in president , then returning to office after having fulfilled the constitution 's technical requirements .
it was difficult to imagine russia being governed by another politician after eight years of putin .
medvedev certain to be elected the russian president has decided to back dmitry medvedev , first deputy prime minister and board chairman of gas giant gazprom , to stand as a presidential candidate in march 2008 .
given what happened in russian parliamentary poll in early december , it is practically certain that medvedev will be elected in the first round of the elections on march 2 .
the kremlin propaganda machine functions magnificently , the administrative apparatus runs smoothly , and the significant size of russian security forces remove any lingering doubt about the outcome of the poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel there is no point in bemoaning the poor prospects for democracy in russia in the light of such political relations .
the vague and possibly premature hopes for a rapid democratization of russia were snuffed out some time ago .
with his decision in favor of medvedev , president putin has made a bold move and answered a number of questions about himself and russia 's future course .
not just a fill-in president putin will step down as president in march 2008 .
the intention is that 42-year-old medvedev should be president for the next four years - in all likelihood much longer .
medvedev is completely unsuited to just act as a stand-in who would keep the presidential post warm for putin .
in this respect , putin has remained true to himself - in spite of what all his opponents and his sycophantic supporters have said .
after all , he always said he would not violate the constitution in order to remain in office .
however , the end of putin 's presidential era does not spell the end of putin as the leading light in russian politics .
he will retain considerable influence over russian politics as head of united russia , or possibly as prime minister .
we will have to wait and see if putin will take up medvedev 's offer to take on the job of pm under him .
at any rate , medvedev is not expected to usher in any decisive course change .
putin 's longstanding ally has always been directly involved from the outset in shaping and representing putin 's policies in his previous posts .
medvedev looks set to continue pursuing putin 's goal of modernizing russia because he shares his convictions .
the loyal technocrat is the ideal candidate to ensure that putin 's course is maintained without the current president having to resort to any trickery with the constitution .
past will burden relations with europe president medvedev will be blemished by the fact that he has emerged from putin 's powerhouse .
his previous role as chair of the board at gazprom will also not help his popularity in europe given the poor image of the russia energy giant here .
on the other hand , medvedev is not the worst candidate from amongst the current russian elite .
the former law professor from st. petersburg is reputed to be one of the more liberal spirits in the kremlin .
in addition , he has no direct contacts to the soviet or the post-soviet security services .
and given his relative youth , he also stands for a new russia that europe - and the west in general - will have to learn to live with .
the russian president 's decision to select medvedev is not likely to find favor with all of the factions who putin can currently rally behind him .
the effects of a change in president in terms of who has what access to important financial and business resources are not likely to be clear for a while , and the process will not be without its tensions .
the question is whether the first cracks within russia 's kremlin elite will already have become apparent ahead of the elections in march , thus threatening the transfer of power .
then things could get tricky for putin as the one responsible for naming medvedev his political heir .

dw-world.de putin endorses loyalist medvedev as presidential candidate russian president vladimir putin has backed his ally dimitry medvedev to succeed him next march .
the fact that medvedev 's not a member of putin 's party makes it even more likely that he 'll become russia 's next leader .
-lrb- 10.12.2007 -rrb- putin 's party wins russia elections amid vote-rigging claims vladimir putin 's united russia party won a landslide majority in parliamentary elections , but opposition parties , observers and western nations have criticized the lack of transparency in the election .
-lrb- 03.12.2007 -rrb- russia 's power is greatly exaggerated , say experts sunday 's parliamentary elections in russia may well leave much to be desired in terms of democracy .
but experts on the country say there 's little need to fear the kremlin 's long-term plans .

the ban encompasses not only guns and knives , but baseball bats as well .
some say that 's not going far enough . the law is based on federal legislation , passed earlier this year , allowing local states to prohibit items that can be used to endanger public safety - including fake guns .
hamburg took the lead in pushing for such legislation and is the first state within germany to enact a prohibition on the local level .
the ban covers air rifles , billy clubs , brass knuckles , baseball bats , pepper spray and most forms of mace .
carrying any of those items in the neighborhoods affected by the law can be punished with a fine of up to 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,700 -rrb- .
" this is a further element promoting the safety of people in our city , " hamburg 's interior minister , udo nagel , told the ap news agency .
" by changing the laws we finally have the possibility of reigning in violence in areas that are especially at risk . "
criminal gangs are active on the reeperbahn , and knife fights and attacks with dangerous items occur with relative frequency .

criminal gangs are active on the reeperbahn , and knife fights and attacks with dangerous items occur with relative frequency .
too little or waste of time ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's reeperbahn is a popular attraction - despite crime rates hamburg 's governing conservatives and police hope the bans will reduce violent crime in troubled neighborhoods .
but not everyone likes the prohibition in its current form .
green party parliamentary and interior affairs experts antje möller has called for the ban to be extended to the entire city .
she also says that something should be done about shops that sell the items concerned - of which there are a number on and near the reeperbahn .
" it ca n't be the case that you 're not allowed to carry weapons , but trading in them is publicly accepted , " möller told the german public broadcaster ndr .
others question whether the ban will have any practical affect .
" anyone serious bent on robbing , raping or murdering others is n't interested in legislation - and certainly not in weapons legislation , " wrote one blogger on the german internet news site shortnews .
it will take time to see if the weapons ban succeeds in reducing crime in hamburg .
in the meantime , anyone wanting a pick up game of baseball in the city should probably steer clear of the reeperbahn . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" within 24 hours , russia appears to have ended months of speculation over the country 's political future . putin has not yet given his response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin will retain some power after stepping down in march in a televised speech following medvedev 's surprise statement , putin did not comment on this suggestion and no timeframe was suggested for the switch .
but putin has long said that he wanted to retain an important role after leaving the kremlin . analyst vyacheslav nikonov told the interfax news agency : " if medvedev announced it , then the likelihood is that it will take place . " the decision raises questions of whether medvedev would act as an independent leader or merely as a figurehead for putin .
this was fueled by the president-in-waiting 's additional announcement on tuesday that russia must pursue the course set by putin over the past eight years . putin , who is constitutionally barred from standing for a third term of office , gave his endorsement to medvedev on monday , saying he " fully and completely " supported him .

" putin first appointed medvedev in the early 1990s in st. petersburg , where both attended the same law school .

dw-world 's ingo mannteufel says the liberal technocrat will uphold putin 's political course - with or without him as pm . the guessing game is over .
for months now , russian politics have been dominated by the question of who will succeed russian president vladimir putin in march 2008 .
russian law prevents presidents from standing for a third term of office .
speculation was rife about putin 's next move .
one scenario put forward was that putin would alter the constitution .
another saw putin naming a stand-in president , then returning to office after having fulfilled the constitution 's technical requirements .
it was difficult to imagine russia being governed by another politician after eight years of putin .
medvedev certain to be elected the russian president has decided to back dmitry medvedev , first deputy prime minister and board chairman of gas giant gazprom , to stand as a presidential candidate in march 2008 .
given what happened in russian parliamentary poll in early december , it is practically certain that medvedev will be elected in the first round of the elections on march 2 .
the kremlin propaganda machine functions magnificently , the administrative apparatus runs smoothly , and the significant size of russian security forces remove any lingering doubt about the outcome of the poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel there is no point in bemoaning the poor prospects for democracy in russia in the light of such political relations .
the vague and possibly premature hopes for a rapid democratization of russia were snuffed out some time ago .
with his decision in favor of medvedev , president putin has made a bold move and answered a number of questions about himself and russia 's future course .
not just a fill-in president putin will step down as president in march 2008 .
the intention is that 42-year-old medvedev should be president for the next four years - in all likelihood much longer .
medvedev is completely unsuited to just act as a stand-in who would keep the presidential post warm for putin .
in this respect , putin has remained true to himself - in spite of what all his opponents and his sycophantic supporters have said .
after all , he always said he would not violate the constitution in order to remain in office .
however , the end of putin 's presidential era does not spell the end of putin as the leading light in russian politics .
he will retain considerable influence over russian politics as head of united russia , or possibly as prime minister .
we will have to wait and see if putin will take up medvedev 's offer to take on the job of pm under him .
at any rate , medvedev is not expected to usher in any decisive course change .
putin 's longstanding ally has always been directly involved from the outset in shaping and representing putin 's policies in his previous posts .
medvedev looks set to continue pursuing putin 's goal of modernizing russia because he shares his convictions .
the loyal technocrat is the ideal candidate to ensure that putin 's course is maintained without the current president having to resort to any trickery with the constitution .
past will burden relations with europe president medvedev will be blemished by the fact that he has emerged from putin 's powerhouse .
his previous role as chair of the board at gazprom will also not help his popularity in europe given the poor image of the russia energy giant here .
on the other hand , medvedev is not the worst candidate from amongst the current russian elite .
the former law professor from st. petersburg is reputed to be one of the more liberal spirits in the kremlin .
in addition , he has no direct contacts to the soviet or the post-soviet security services .
and given his relative youth , he also stands for a new russia that europe - and the west in general - will have to learn to live with .
the russian president 's decision to select medvedev is not likely to find favor with all of the factions who putin can currently rally behind him .
the effects of a change in president in terms of who has what access to important financial and business resources are not likely to be clear for a while , and the process will not be without its tensions .
the question is whether the first cracks within russia 's kremlin elite will already have become apparent ahead of the elections in march , thus threatening the transfer of power .
then things could get tricky for putin as the one responsible for naming medvedev his political heir .

the expected declaration of independence by kosovo has a number of nations on edge .
those who oppose kosovo 's autonomy harbor separatists of their own .
a free kosovo could be just the rallying call these movements need . with all the signs pointing towards a declaration of independence from kosovo after the un-set deadline for reaching a settlement passes on monday , the european union is bracing itself for a wave of renewed calls for autonomy from separatist movements across europe .
if kosovo declares independence from serbia , it will set a powerful precedent for movements from spain to scotland , all wanting to rewrite the map of europe and form their own independent states , according to experts .
" there is a real risk that the quasi-dogma of the intangibility of borders which has existed since the end of the world war ii will fall , " french political scientist jean-yves camus of the paris-based iris institute told afp .
" this would benefit movements which seek to rewrite the map of europe based on ethnic , linguistic or cultural criteria , " added camus , a specialist on separatist movements in europe .
the emergence of similar lifestyles and english as a common language in europe , combined with the disappearance of borders and the lack of democratic legitimacy of eu bodies , had fueled " the development of micro-distinctive identities , " said camus .

while some countries bank on cash incentives , some german car experts believe there are better ways to go . the auto industry has plenty to lose sleep over .
not only is public discourse over the new dirty word " co2 " laying on pressure for change , sales are down as well . the german association of the automotive industry announced last week that car sales have dropped 9 percent this year - a record year - naming consumers ' uncertainty over planned vehicle tax reform , climate concerns and the 3-percent sales tax increase last january . it 's not surprising , then , that a plan recently came under discussion that would theoretically solve both environmental and economic concerns : the government would pay drivers a premium for scrapping their old , pollutant vehicles - or at least taking them off the road - in the hope that they put the money into a new car . the carbon dioxide-based vehicle tax , which the german government is currently considering , would provide an incentive for the buyer to select a low-emissions vehicle .
scrapping premiums would come from the vehicle tax pot , thereby being paid for by heavy emitters . potential two-pronged benefit for scrapping premium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim of a premium is to get old cars off the road , not necessarily destroy them " on the one hand , old cars are taken off the market and new cars , which generally have lower emissions , enter the market .
secondly , business would experience a boom , at least in the short term , " said willi diez , director of the german automobile industry institute , of the plan his organization proposed last month . a similar , reportedly successful project in italy serves as a model .
there , consumers are paid 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,170 -rrb- and given a two-year vehicle tax exemption when they scrap their old cars and buy new ones with emissions rates of less than 140 grams per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- . the incentive has gotten 500,000 old cars off italy 's streets since it started in january , according to a report by germany 's motorzeitung.de.
diez predicted that , if a premium of 1,000 euros was introduced in germany , it could lead to an additional 250,000 cars sold , with at least as many taken off the road . car expert slams scrapping plan for ferdinand dudenhöffer , co-founder and director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- at the gelsenkirchen technical college , the premium to scrap cars sounds like a marketing ploy . " the car industry is n't an industry that needs subsidies , " said dudenhöffer .
" there are much better ways to get customers to buy new cars . " a driver could take the premium and buy a big gas-guzzler if he or she wanted to , added dudenhöffer , who did n't see the proposed tax-break of 50 to 100 euros for more ecologically sound cars as enough of an incentive .
as for the old polluter , it 's more likely to end up on the road in eastern europe than to get scrapped , he said . " and russian co2 is just like german co2 , " he said . emissions trading could help europe reach target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to reach an average 130 grams of co2 per kilometer driven by 2012 the auto expert has been an outspoken proponent of emissions trading as the best way to reduce co2 output across europe .
that scenario would have carmakers buy certificates from an independent exchange for every vehicle they produce with a co2 emissions rate of more than 130 grams per kilometer , and sell one back for every car under the emissions limit . ultimately , said dudenhöffer , the emissions trading plan would help europe attain the 130-gram-per vehicle average it is striving for by 2012 . by making high-emission cars more expensive than clean ones , the customer bears the financial burden . " environmental consciousness may be getting a bit stronger , but you have to assume that when i buy something i pay attention to my needs and not to my neighbor 's , " dudenhöffer said .
" that 's why it 's better not to leave the environmental decision to the consumer but to set prices for co2 that allow these emission goals to be reached . " the plan 's weakness , countered diez , is that it 's too difficult to come up with a basis of calculation to determine a price for the so-called emissions certificates .
emissions trading already exists in stationary industries like power plants , but he said he did n't consider it a practical option for the auto sector . co2-based vehicle tax coming soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who want to drive big cars will have to pay more for them diez conceded , however , that the scrapping premium has n't been well received .
while politicians worry about where the money will come from , carmakers fear that the temporary boom caused by it will be followed by a painful dip in sales . meanwhile , the german government is in the process of approving a law , to take effect in january 2009 , that would adjust the annual vehicle tax according to a new car 's co2 emission rate . while dudenhöffer called it a " german solution to a european problem , " the sliding tax plays a key role in diez 's scrapping premium .
since old cars would continue to be charged according to their cubic capacity , buyers of new low-emissions cars would benefit the most . german auto club adac said it strongly supports the vehicle tax reform - a plan it had suggested to the government already in 2004 . but there 's even another , perhaps simpler way to cut emissions that does n't involve government-initiated incentives : " driving style should n't be underestimated , " said an adac spokesman .

that scenario would have carmakers buy certificates from an independent exchange for every vehicle they produce with a co2 emissions rate of more than 130 grams per kilometer , and sell one back for every car under the emissions limit . ultimately , said dudenhöffer , the emissions trading plan would help europe attain the 130-gram-per vehicle average it is striving for by 2012 . by making high-emission cars more expensive than clean ones , the customer bears the financial burden .

while some countries bank on cash incentives , some german car experts believe there are better ways to go . the auto industry has plenty to lose sleep over .
not only is public discourse over the new dirty word " co2 " laying on pressure for change , sales are down as well . the german association of the automotive industry announced last week that car sales have dropped 9 percent this year - a record year - naming consumers ' uncertainty over planned vehicle tax reform , climate concerns and the 3-percent sales tax increase last january . it 's not surprising , then , that a plan recently came under discussion that would theoretically solve both environmental and economic concerns : the government would pay drivers a premium for scrapping their old , pollutant vehicles - or at least taking them off the road - in the hope that they put the money into a new car . the carbon dioxide-based vehicle tax , which the german government is currently considering , would provide an incentive for the buyer to select a low-emissions vehicle .

diez predicted that , if a premium of 1,000 euros was introduced in germany , it could lead to an additional 250,000 cars sold , with at least as many taken off the road . car expert slams scrapping plan for ferdinand dudenhöffer , co-founder and director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- at the gelsenkirchen technical college , the premium to scrap cars sounds like a marketing ploy .

the expected declaration of independence by kosovo has a number of nations on edge .
those who oppose kosovo 's autonomy harbor separatists of their own .
a free kosovo could be just the rallying call these movements need . with all the signs pointing towards a declaration of independence from kosovo after the un-set deadline for reaching a settlement passes on monday , the european union is bracing itself for a wave of renewed calls for autonomy from separatist movements across europe .
if kosovo declares independence from serbia , it will set a powerful precedent for movements from spain to scotland , all wanting to rewrite the map of europe and form their own independent states , according to experts .
" there is a real risk that the quasi-dogma of the intangibility of borders which has existed since the end of the world war ii will fall , " french political scientist jean-yves camus of the paris-based iris institute told afp .
" this would benefit movements which seek to rewrite the map of europe based on ethnic , linguistic or cultural criteria , " added camus , a specialist on separatist movements in europe .
the emergence of similar lifestyles and english as a common language in europe , combined with the disappearance of borders and the lack of democratic legitimacy of eu bodies , had fueled " the development of micro-distinctive identities , " said camus .
while kosovo 's ethnic majority leaders have vowed not to unilaterally declare independence from serbia without us and european union approval , they are expected to announce their intentions to form a new state in early 2008 .
opposition includes fear of own breakaway states many of the countries which oppose the creation of an independent state of kosovo have at least one separatist movement working towards autonomy within their own borders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has been fighting chechen separatists for years serbia 's ally russia , which leads the opposition , has problems with separatists in chechnya and the caucasus region while spain has had a long-running dispute with the armed eta movement .
other countries against kosovo 's independence such as cyprus and greece have ethnic minorities which demand more power .
" in the west , this -lsb- kosovo -rsb- solution will set off separatists in europe , ” russian president vladimir putin said in an interview published in french newspaper le figaro earlier this year . ” look at scotland , catalonia and the basque country . "
spain is currently experiencing a period of unease as its northern basque country and its wealthy northeastern region of catalonia have stepped up their demands for more autonomy .
last year catalan voters overwhelmingly backed a new charter which recognized the region as a " nation " within spain and grants it enhanced powers in taxation and judicial matters .
separatists claim eu structure makes autonomy possible as in other separatist regions of europe like flanders , the dutch-speaking northern part of belgium , and northern italy , supporters said catalonia deserved extra powers because it makes a bigger contribution to the economy .
the armed basque separatist group eta ended a 15-month ceasefire in june while the scottish national party , which came to power in may , plans to hold a referendum on independence in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lingusitic divisions have led to a debate on splitting belgium belgium meanwhile has been without a government for six months after a general election on june 10 highlighted deep divisions between the nation 's majority dutch-speakers and francophones .
for many nationalists , membership in the 27-nation european union has only served to make separation seem more viable .
" europe can regulate our functionings and transfer payments .
why must we maintain this intermediate roof we call belgium , " the leader of the flemish nationalist party , bart de wever , told french daily le monde last month .
russia to block independence at un level meanwhile , russia stepped up its opposition tuesday by announcing that it would demand that the un security council annul any unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo .
" russia will of course demand the annulment of such a decision .
we will demand a meeting of the security council because it would be a violation of a council resolution , " russia 's interfax news agency quoted the country 's chief kosovo negotiator alexander botsan-kharchenko as saying . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 11.12.2007 polish pm calls for world war ii museum ahead of berlin visit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the battle of gdansk in 1939 is considered the start of world war ii poland 's new prime minister thinks that the baltic port city of gdansk is the perfect location for a museum commemorating the war and its consequences .
berlin would rather stick to its own plans for remembrance . poland 's prime minister , donald tusk , called on monday , dec .
10 , for a grand-scale world war ii museum in the northern polish city of gdansk , the site of the nazi invasion on sept .
1 , 1939 . other countries , including germany , russia and israel could have a part in the museum , which was proposed as an alternative to a plan for an exhibition in berlin to remember german expellees from central and eastern europe during and just after world war ii . in the large gdansk museum , " the fate of expellees would have a place in a conclusive and comprehensive context , " said tusk in an interview with the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . the coastal city of gdansk , located on the baltic sea , is ripe with symbolic meaning . " the war began here , but in a sense it also ended here when the solidarity movement was founded in 1980 , " tusk said . started by polish laborers under lech walesa , solidarity , or solidarnosc , played a key role in the fall of communism in the former east-bloc country . berlin adamant about expulsion center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk became prime minister last month in response , the german government made it clear that tusk 's statement would have no bearing on plans for the expulsion center .
the governing coalition agreed in their founding contract in 2005 to set up a " visible sign of remembrance against expulsion " in berlin , said government spokesman thomas steg . the conflict began some seven years ago when the league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- started a foundation for a proposed expellee center .
the organization , which campaigns for the rights and remembrance of ethnic german expellees , has been seen in poland as overstating german suffering surrounding the holocaust . " the problem is not that anyone wants to prevent the germans from remembering the suffering of their own people , " tusk said .
" it becomes problematic when this remembrance of the german suffering diminishes another memory - namely that of the collective responsibility of the germans . " points of contention on tusk-merkel agenda the question of remembrance is likely to be a major agenda point when tusk meets with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin on tuesday . the two leaders are also slated to broach the ongoing issue of restitution claims for german expellees and re-settlers . the prussian claims society submitted claims for 22 individual claims cases to the european court for human rights in strasbourg in 2006 , requesting the return of land and property in present-day poland to ethnic germans who were forced out of their homes during the war . several more cases have been submitted since then , and still others are being reviewed in polish courts . " the german government has to take responsibility for the possible financial consequences arising from the compensation claims , " tusk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should expelled german be compensated for what they lost ?
berlin has maintained repeatedly that it does n't support such claims , with then german chancellor gerhard schröder making a binding statement to that effect in warsaw in 2004 . according to german estimates , some 15 million ethnic germans were expelled from their homes during or directly following the war .
some two million are thought to have died in the process . poland fears pipeline puts gas supply at risk plans for a joint russian-german gas pipeline along the baltic sea will be another matter of discussion at tuesday 's meeting . currently , russia sends gas to western europe via poland , but the baltic sea pipeline would circumvent the central european country .
poland has expressed concern that , in a political crisis , russia could shut its gas supply without affecting delivery to - and , hence , relations with - western europe . ahead of tuesday 's talks , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed optimism over the future of bilateral relations . " a concrete program to improve cooperation between the governments is being worked on , " he told the polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza on monday .
" the german and polish ministers will now meet together frequently and regularly . " topics of friction , such as expellee claims and the baltic pipeline would be dealt with " openly and constructively , " he added . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

secondly , business would experience a boom , at least in the short term , " said willi diez , director of the german automobile industry institute , of the plan his organization proposed last month . a similar , reportedly successful project in italy serves as a model .
there , consumers are paid 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,170 -rrb- and given a two-year vehicle tax exemption when they scrap their old cars and buy new ones with emissions rates of less than 140 grams per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- . the incentive has gotten 500,000 old cars off italy 's streets since it started in january , according to a report by germany 's motorzeitung.de.
diez predicted that , if a premium of 1,000 euros was introduced in germany , it could lead to an additional 250,000 cars sold , with at least as many taken off the road . car expert slams scrapping plan for ferdinand dudenhöffer , co-founder and director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- at the gelsenkirchen technical college , the premium to scrap cars sounds like a marketing ploy . " the car industry is n't an industry that needs subsidies , " said dudenhöffer .
" there are much better ways to get customers to buy new cars . " a driver could take the premium and buy a big gas-guzzler if he or she wanted to , added dudenhöffer , who did n't see the proposed tax-break of 50 to 100 euros for more ecologically sound cars as enough of an incentive .
as for the old polluter , it 's more likely to end up on the road in eastern europe than to get scrapped , he said .

that scenario would have carmakers buy certificates from an independent exchange for every vehicle they produce with a co2 emissions rate of more than 130 grams per kilometer , and sell one back for every car under the emissions limit . ultimately , said dudenhöffer , the emissions trading plan would help europe attain the 130-gram-per vehicle average it is striving for by 2012 . by making high-emission cars more expensive than clean ones , the customer bears the financial burden . " environmental consciousness may be getting a bit stronger , but you have to assume that when i buy something i pay attention to my needs and not to my neighbor 's , " dudenhöffer said .
" that 's why it 's better not to leave the environmental decision to the consumer but to set prices for co2 that allow these emission goals to be reached . " the plan 's weakness , countered diez , is that it 's too difficult to come up with a basis of calculation to determine a price for the so-called emissions certificates .
emissions trading already exists in stationary industries like power plants , but he said he did n't consider it a practical option for the auto sector . co2-based vehicle tax coming soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who want to drive big cars will have to pay more for them diez conceded , however , that the scrapping premium has n't been well received .

while some countries bank on cash incentives , some german car experts believe there are better ways to go . the auto industry has plenty to lose sleep over .
not only is public discourse over the new dirty word " co2 " laying on pressure for change , sales are down as well . the german association of the automotive industry announced last week that car sales have dropped 9 percent this year - a record year - naming consumers ' uncertainty over planned vehicle tax reform , climate concerns and the 3-percent sales tax increase last january . it 's not surprising , then , that a plan recently came under discussion that would theoretically solve both environmental and economic concerns : the government would pay drivers a premium for scrapping their old , pollutant vehicles - or at least taking them off the road - in the hope that they put the money into a new car . the carbon dioxide-based vehicle tax , which the german government is currently considering , would provide an incentive for the buyer to select a low-emissions vehicle .
scrapping premiums would come from the vehicle tax pot , thereby being paid for by heavy emitters . potential two-pronged benefit for scrapping premium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim of a premium is to get old cars off the road , not necessarily destroy them " on the one hand , old cars are taken off the market and new cars , which generally have lower emissions , enter the market .
secondly , business would experience a boom , at least in the short term , " said willi diez , director of the german automobile industry institute , of the plan his organization proposed last month . a similar , reportedly successful project in italy serves as a model .
there , consumers are paid 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,170 -rrb- and given a two-year vehicle tax exemption when they scrap their old cars and buy new ones with emissions rates of less than 140 grams per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- . the incentive has gotten 500,000 old cars off italy 's streets since it started in january , according to a report by germany 's motorzeitung.de.
diez predicted that , if a premium of 1,000 euros was introduced in germany , it could lead to an additional 250,000 cars sold , with at least as many taken off the road . car expert slams scrapping plan for ferdinand dudenhöffer , co-founder and director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- at the gelsenkirchen technical college , the premium to scrap cars sounds like a marketing ploy . " the car industry is n't an industry that needs subsidies , " said dudenhöffer .
" there are much better ways to get customers to buy new cars . " a driver could take the premium and buy a big gas-guzzler if he or she wanted to , added dudenhöffer , who did n't see the proposed tax-break of 50 to 100 euros for more ecologically sound cars as enough of an incentive .
as for the old polluter , it 's more likely to end up on the road in eastern europe than to get scrapped , he said . " and russian co2 is just like german co2 , " he said . emissions trading could help europe reach target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to reach an average 130 grams of co2 per kilometer driven by 2012 the auto expert has been an outspoken proponent of emissions trading as the best way to reduce co2 output across europe .
that scenario would have carmakers buy certificates from an independent exchange for every vehicle they produce with a co2 emissions rate of more than 130 grams per kilometer , and sell one back for every car under the emissions limit . ultimately , said dudenhöffer , the emissions trading plan would help europe attain the 130-gram-per vehicle average it is striving for by 2012 . by making high-emission cars more expensive than clean ones , the customer bears the financial burden . " environmental consciousness may be getting a bit stronger , but you have to assume that when i buy something i pay attention to my needs and not to my neighbor 's , " dudenhöffer said .
" that 's why it 's better not to leave the environmental decision to the consumer but to set prices for co2 that allow these emission goals to be reached . " the plan 's weakness , countered diez , is that it 's too difficult to come up with a basis of calculation to determine a price for the so-called emissions certificates .
emissions trading already exists in stationary industries like power plants , but he said he did n't consider it a practical option for the auto sector . co2-based vehicle tax coming soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who want to drive big cars will have to pay more for them diez conceded , however , that the scrapping premium has n't been well received .
while politicians worry about where the money will come from , carmakers fear that the temporary boom caused by it will be followed by a painful dip in sales . meanwhile , the german government is in the process of approving a law , to take effect in january 2009 , that would adjust the annual vehicle tax according to a new car 's co2 emission rate . while dudenhöffer called it a " german solution to a european problem , " the sliding tax plays a key role in diez 's scrapping premium .
since old cars would continue to be charged according to their cubic capacity , buyers of new low-emissions cars would benefit the most . german auto club adac said it strongly supports the vehicle tax reform - a plan it had suggested to the government already in 2004 . but there 's even another , perhaps simpler way to cut emissions that does n't involve government-initiated incentives : " driving style should n't be underestimated , " said an adac spokesman .

" within 24 hours , russia appears to have ended months of speculation over the country 's political future . putin has not yet given his response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin will retain some power after stepping down in march in a televised speech following medvedev 's surprise statement , putin did not comment on this suggestion and no timeframe was suggested for the switch .
but putin has long said that he wanted to retain an important role after leaving the kremlin . analyst vyacheslav nikonov told the interfax news agency : " if medvedev announced it , then the likelihood is that it will take place . " the decision raises questions of whether medvedev would act as an independent leader or merely as a figurehead for putin .
this was fueled by the president-in-waiting 's additional announcement on tuesday that russia must pursue the course set by putin over the past eight years . putin , who is constitutionally barred from standing for a third term of office , gave his endorsement to medvedev on monday , saying he " fully and completely " supported him .
given the current president 's huge domestic popularity , medvedev is practically guaranteed to be elected . putin enjoys a huge following at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : years of plotting for others have paid off for medvedev tuesday 's shake-up comes a week after the united russia party won a landslide victory in parliamentary elections on a ticket headed by putin , who campaigned on the buzz words of " stability " and " continuity . " putin first appointed medvedev in the early 1990s in st. petersburg , where both attended the same law school .
he quickly rose from campaign manager in 2000 to head of the presidential administration and gazprom chairman . he is reputed to be relatively liberal-minded in comparison with his main competitor , fellow putin advisor and former defense minister sergei ivanov . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the world 's greatest challenge germany : allowances for co2 emissions during nuke phase-out german environment minister calls off biofuel plans cebit features green computing possibilities eu wants to set pace in protecting environment auto industry -pipe- 11.12.2007 experts split on best way to get cleaner cars on europe 's roads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those old cars may be cool , but many of them are also dirty europeans are struggling to find the best way to get high-pollutant cars off the streets .
while some countries bank on cash incentives , some german car experts believe there are better ways to go . the auto industry has plenty to lose sleep over .
not only is public discourse over the new dirty word " co2 " laying on pressure for change , sales are down as well . the german association of the automotive industry announced last week that car sales have dropped 9 percent this year - a record year - naming consumers ' uncertainty over planned vehicle tax reform , climate concerns and the 3-percent sales tax increase last january . it 's not surprising , then , that a plan recently came under discussion that would theoretically solve both environmental and economic concerns : the government would pay drivers a premium for scrapping their old , pollutant vehicles - or at least taking them off the road - in the hope that they put the money into a new car . the carbon dioxide-based vehicle tax , which the german government is currently considering , would provide an incentive for the buyer to select a low-emissions vehicle .
scrapping premiums would come from the vehicle tax pot , thereby being paid for by heavy emitters . potential two-pronged benefit for scrapping premium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim of a premium is to get old cars off the road , not necessarily destroy them " on the one hand , old cars are taken off the market and new cars , which generally have lower emissions , enter the market .
secondly , business would experience a boom , at least in the short term , " said willi diez , director of the german automobile industry institute , of the plan his organization proposed last month . a similar , reportedly successful project in italy serves as a model .
there , consumers are paid 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,170 -rrb- and given a two-year vehicle tax exemption when they scrap their old cars and buy new ones with emissions rates of less than 140 grams per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- . the incentive has gotten 500,000 old cars off italy 's streets since it started in january , according to a report by germany 's motorzeitung.de.
diez predicted that , if a premium of 1,000 euros was introduced in germany , it could lead to an additional 250,000 cars sold , with at least as many taken off the road . car expert slams scrapping plan for ferdinand dudenhöffer , co-founder and director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- at the gelsenkirchen technical college , the premium to scrap cars sounds like a marketing ploy . " the car industry is n't an industry that needs subsidies , " said dudenhöffer .
" there are much better ways to get customers to buy new cars . " a driver could take the premium and buy a big gas-guzzler if he or she wanted to , added dudenhöffer , who did n't see the proposed tax-break of 50 to 100 euros for more ecologically sound cars as enough of an incentive .
as for the old polluter , it 's more likely to end up on the road in eastern europe than to get scrapped , he said . " and russian co2 is just like german co2 , " he said . emissions trading could help europe reach target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to reach an average 130 grams of co2 per kilometer driven by 2012 the auto expert has been an outspoken proponent of emissions trading as the best way to reduce co2 output across europe .
that scenario would have carmakers buy certificates from an independent exchange for every vehicle they produce with a co2 emissions rate of more than 130 grams per kilometer , and sell one back for every car under the emissions limit . ultimately , said dudenhöffer , the emissions trading plan would help europe attain the 130-gram-per vehicle average it is striving for by 2012 . by making high-emission cars more expensive than clean ones , the customer bears the financial burden . " environmental consciousness may be getting a bit stronger , but you have to assume that when i buy something i pay attention to my needs and not to my neighbor 's , " dudenhöffer said .
" that 's why it 's better not to leave the environmental decision to the consumer but to set prices for co2 that allow these emission goals to be reached . " the plan 's weakness , countered diez , is that it 's too difficult to come up with a basis of calculation to determine a price for the so-called emissions certificates .
emissions trading already exists in stationary industries like power plants , but he said he did n't consider it a practical option for the auto sector . co2-based vehicle tax coming soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who want to drive big cars will have to pay more for them diez conceded , however , that the scrapping premium has n't been well received .
while politicians worry about where the money will come from , carmakers fear that the temporary boom caused by it will be followed by a painful dip in sales . meanwhile , the german government is in the process of approving a law , to take effect in january 2009 , that would adjust the annual vehicle tax according to a new car 's co2 emission rate . while dudenhöffer called it a " german solution to a european problem , " the sliding tax plays a key role in diez 's scrapping premium .
since old cars would continue to be charged according to their cubic capacity , buyers of new low-emissions cars would benefit the most . german auto club adac said it strongly supports the vehicle tax reform - a plan it had suggested to the government already in 2004 . but there 's even another , perhaps simpler way to cut emissions that does n't involve government-initiated incentives : " driving style should n't be underestimated , " said an adac spokesman .
driving ecologically - not accelerating quickly , shifting early and avoiding traffic - can save 20 to 30 percent on gas , he said .
and less gas means fewer emissions . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . senator barack obama is by a wide margin the best candidate in the us presidential race .
his views on the environment , foreign policy , the war in iraq , and several other domestic issues , i.e. health care , are all the reasons that he is very popular with young and old alike . - douglas grieser , us i ca n't believe that europeans are so foolish as to believe that mrs. clinton would be a good president .
she has lied and twisted the truth from the very beginning .
she has no experience at all .
she has done nothing as senator either for new york or the us .
europeans are liberal , i know .
but , honestly - wake up ! - brent donohoe , us hillary all the way ! - willy much , canada if the objective is to win the nomination , hillary has the edge at this point .
if , however , we democrats actually want to win the election then obama is the only possible choice .
hillary would fire up the republicans like nothing ever has .
obama , on the other hand , is very charismatic and is already showing signs of picking up a few republican votes .
we democrats have a very bad habit of nominating candidates who have zero chance of winning the election .
hopefully that lesson has at last been learned .
many of us like hillary , but not enough to see another republican president !
obama is the only candidate who can prevent another two-term republican president . - steven morgan , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no readers mentioned the republican party front-runners ron paul is the only person i can vote for in the 2008 presidential race .
willi fausz , us hillary clinton has more government experience than mr. obama .
it 's too bad that mr. obama does n't want to be vice president , they would make a great team running for office together . - glen s. poskarbiewicz , us hillary clinton sold out to insurance and pharmaceutical company pressure when she was working on a national health plan and has received a lot of money from them for her campaign .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . senator barack obama is by a wide margin the best candidate in the us presidential race .
his views on the environment , foreign policy , the war in iraq , and several other domestic issues , i.e. health care , are all the reasons that he is very popular with young and old alike . - douglas grieser , us i ca n't believe that europeans are so foolish as to believe that mrs. clinton would be a good president .
she has lied and twisted the truth from the very beginning .
she has no experience at all .
she has done nothing as senator either for new york or the us .
europeans are liberal , i know .
but , honestly - wake up ! - brent donohoe , us hillary all the way ! - willy much , canada if the objective is to win the nomination , hillary has the edge at this point .
if , however , we democrats actually want to win the election then obama is the only possible choice .
hillary would fire up the republicans like nothing ever has .
obama , on the other hand , is very charismatic and is already showing signs of picking up a few republican votes .
we democrats have a very bad habit of nominating candidates who have zero chance of winning the election .

berlin would rather stick to its own plans for remembrance . poland 's prime minister , donald tusk , called on monday , dec .
10 , for a grand-scale world war ii museum in the northern polish city of gdansk , the site of the nazi invasion on sept .
1 , 1939 . other countries , including germany , russia and israel could have a part in the museum , which was proposed as an alternative to a plan for an exhibition in berlin to remember german expellees from central and eastern europe during and just after world war ii . in the large gdansk museum , " the fate of expellees would have a place in a conclusive and comprehensive context , " said tusk in an interview with the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . the coastal city of gdansk , located on the baltic sea , is ripe with symbolic meaning . " the war began here , but in a sense it also ended here when the solidarity movement was founded in 1980 , " tusk said . started by polish laborers under lech walesa , solidarity , or solidarnosc , played a key role in the fall of communism in the former east-bloc country . berlin adamant about expulsion center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk became prime minister last month in response , the german government made it clear that tusk 's statement would have no bearing on plans for the expulsion center .
the governing coalition agreed in their founding contract in 2005 to set up a " visible sign of remembrance against expulsion " in berlin , said government spokesman thomas steg . the conflict began some seven years ago when the league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- started a foundation for a proposed expellee center .
the organization , which campaigns for the rights and remembrance of ethnic german expellees , has been seen in poland as overstating german suffering surrounding the holocaust . " the problem is not that anyone wants to prevent the germans from remembering the suffering of their own people , " tusk said .
" it becomes problematic when this remembrance of the german suffering diminishes another memory - namely that of the collective responsibility of the germans . " points of contention on tusk-merkel agenda the question of remembrance is likely to be a major agenda point when tusk meets with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin on tuesday . the two leaders are also slated to broach the ongoing issue of restitution claims for german expellees and re-settlers . the prussian claims society submitted claims for 22 individual claims cases to the european court for human rights in strasbourg in 2006 , requesting the return of land and property in present-day poland to ethnic germans who were forced out of their homes during the war . several more cases have been submitted since then , and still others are being reviewed in polish courts . " the german government has to take responsibility for the possible financial consequences arising from the compensation claims , " tusk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should expelled german be compensated for what they lost ?
berlin has maintained repeatedly that it does n't support such claims , with then german chancellor gerhard schröder making a binding statement to that effect in warsaw in 2004 . according to german estimates , some 15 million ethnic germans were expelled from their homes during or directly following the war .
some two million are thought to have died in the process . poland fears pipeline puts gas supply at risk plans for a joint russian-german gas pipeline along the baltic sea will be another matter of discussion at tuesday 's meeting . currently , russia sends gas to western europe via poland , but the baltic sea pipeline would circumvent the central european country .
poland has expressed concern that , in a political crisis , russia could shut its gas supply without affecting delivery to - and , hence , relations with - western europe . ahead of tuesday 's talks , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed optimism over the future of bilateral relations . " a concrete program to improve cooperation between the governments is being worked on , " he told the polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza on monday .
" the german and polish ministers will now meet together frequently and regularly . " topics of friction , such as expellee claims and the baltic pipeline would be dealt with " openly and constructively , " he added . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the expected declaration of independence by kosovo has a number of nations on edge .
those who oppose kosovo 's autonomy harbor separatists of their own .
a free kosovo could be just the rallying call these movements need . with all the signs pointing towards a declaration of independence from kosovo after the un-set deadline for reaching a settlement passes on monday , the european union is bracing itself for a wave of renewed calls for autonomy from separatist movements across europe .
if kosovo declares independence from serbia , it will set a powerful precedent for movements from spain to scotland , all wanting to rewrite the map of europe and form their own independent states , according to experts .
" there is a real risk that the quasi-dogma of the intangibility of borders which has existed since the end of the world war ii will fall , " french political scientist jean-yves camus of the paris-based iris institute told afp .
" this would benefit movements which seek to rewrite the map of europe based on ethnic , linguistic or cultural criteria , " added camus , a specialist on separatist movements in europe .
the emergence of similar lifestyles and english as a common language in europe , combined with the disappearance of borders and the lack of democratic legitimacy of eu bodies , had fueled " the development of micro-distinctive identities , " said camus .
while kosovo 's ethnic majority leaders have vowed not to unilaterally declare independence from serbia without us and european union approval , they are expected to announce their intentions to form a new state in early 2008 .
opposition includes fear of own breakaway states many of the countries which oppose the creation of an independent state of kosovo have at least one separatist movement working towards autonomy within their own borders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has been fighting chechen separatists for years serbia 's ally russia , which leads the opposition , has problems with separatists in chechnya and the caucasus region while spain has had a long-running dispute with the armed eta movement .
other countries against kosovo 's independence such as cyprus and greece have ethnic minorities which demand more power .
" in the west , this -lsb- kosovo -rsb- solution will set off separatists in europe , ” russian president vladimir putin said in an interview published in french newspaper le figaro earlier this year . ” look at scotland , catalonia and the basque country . "
spain is currently experiencing a period of unease as its northern basque country and its wealthy northeastern region of catalonia have stepped up their demands for more autonomy .
last year catalan voters overwhelmingly backed a new charter which recognized the region as a " nation " within spain and grants it enhanced powers in taxation and judicial matters .
separatists claim eu structure makes autonomy possible as in other separatist regions of europe like flanders , the dutch-speaking northern part of belgium , and northern italy , supporters said catalonia deserved extra powers because it makes a bigger contribution to the economy .
the armed basque separatist group eta ended a 15-month ceasefire in june while the scottish national party , which came to power in may , plans to hold a referendum on independence in 2010 .

" europe can regulate our functionings and transfer payments .
why must we maintain this intermediate roof we call belgium , " the leader of the flemish nationalist party , bart de wever , told french daily le monde last month .
russia to block independence at un level meanwhile , russia stepped up its opposition tuesday by announcing that it would demand that the un security council annul any unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo .
" russia will of course demand the annulment of such a decision .
we will demand a meeting of the security council because it would be a violation of a council resolution , " russia 's interfax news agency quoted the country 's chief kosovo negotiator alexander botsan-kharchenko as saying . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

liz mohn leads family-run bertelsmann ag , the world 's fifth largest media conglomerate .
in an interview for dw-world.de 's chinese web site , she explained why love and respect are vital for global business success . dw-world.de : you 've spent a lot of time in china - what are your impressions ?
liz mohn : i am in awe of the chinese for making such an enormous economic leap .
it takes time to change a culture - you ca n't do it from one day to the next .
but they are really accomplishing a lot there .
it shows that the chinese people today are well educated .
without brains and talent , they could n't do it .
i also think the government learned they need to be careful about how to make people follow their ideas .
do germans see china 's economic growth and political importance as a challenge - or a threat ?
neither nor .
we have such a huge market in china .
it offers huge opportunities for both europe and china , not just on one side .
it is a unique experience .
there has n't been anything like it , any time since -lsb- world war ii -rsb- : that a whole world opens up , and we have the good fortune to experience it .
german chancellor angela merkel recently invited the dalai lama to visit germany , which has been hard on the relationship between china and germany .
what is your take on that ?
i think when different cultures come together , mistakes can be made on both sides .
in the christian religion , we say people should forgive .
without mistakes , we ca n't learn .
but i think different cultures do n't learn to understand each other overnight .
does bertelsmann have a long-term strategy in china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing once had bikes , now there are cars bertelsmann has been growing in china since 1995 and it is a market that we want to get into even more .
i think everything we do there is on a long-term basis .
there are so many questions you ca n't answer immediately .
things change so quickly with globalization .
bertelsmann has a long history .
what are you particularly proud of ?
we are the only media concern world-wide that is involved with so many different cultures .
when we went overseas , we respected the other cultures .
that was the strength of our company after the war .
despite the age of digitalization , statistics show germans still read a lot .
that is different in china though .
is your china strategy successful ?
as far as i know , the chinese like to read .
they are a cultured people .
but today people may be more likely to take an audio book , sure .
new times call for new measures .
i 'm amazed when i see the changes on the streets in china today .
how full they are with cars .
when i first started going to china , 12 or 13 years ago , it was bikes , then mopeds .
i found it fascinating to watch the changes - and i am amazed as how much they have achieved .
before china opened up to the west , people had little freedom .
now , young people are colorful .
they 've gotten more room to think , to live .
you claim that bertelsmann 's management culture relies on individuality and creativity .
how can we know that this is n't just lip service ?
after all , centralized leadership and hierarchy can be practical .
because without this management culture , bertelsmann would never have been as successful as it has been .
through our wartime experiences , and before the war , we saw what it meant to have a dictatorship .
no freedom .
later we saw that if you give people freedom to be creative and to think , then they are motivated .
when you are fair to people , and respect them , then people come together and work together , and you get a great success .
you have worked alongside your husband -lrb- bertelsmann owner reinhard mohn -rrb- , and been increasingly active , for years .
what aspect of your own personality is visible in bertelsmann 's culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard mohn , now 85 , has handed much power to his wife first i think that it is important to teach basic values - love and respect .
and to know that it is important to give something to society , not just take .
now , china is starting to develop charitable foundations .
i find that great .
and citizens are starting to create businesses that also help society .
these are huge advances .
you 've said creating a management style is bertelsmann 's most important business tool , given globalization .
is that true ?
yes .
for example , from our headquarters , we can not simply order around one of our managers in china .
he has to use his own head , his own ideas .
but at the same time , he needs to keep in mind the greater goals for company are .
he needs to know … what kind of mental and spiritual orientation we have , our values .
what are some other challenges for bertelsmann ?
finding good talent .
people who can lead worldwide .
you have sometimes been called an " iron lady " - is this an accurate description ?
well , i would n't say i am " ironclad . "
i might say : you need to use power to get something done .
otherwise you do n't get anywhere in this world .
you need to have a goal , and bring people along with you .
what other qualities make a good business leader ?
i like dealing with people very much , and that 's why i like my job so much .
i get to dialog with people from all over the world .
and i see that the more i learn , the more i have the feeling that i know nothing at all .
your story - you were a telephone operator who has become the head of a fifth-generation business family - is widely known .
is your life really like a fairy tale ?
no .
the people who know me well , know that you never get to the top without discipline and hard work .
you just ca n't do it any other way .
you also have to make mistakes .
that is a burden .
i think i was fortunate to meet a man who both helped me come into more responsibility in this part of my life , and to experience what i do today .
next year we will have been married for 50 years .
that is a long time .
you still appreciate your husband so much after 50 years of marriage ?
that 's unusual these days .
he is a great businessman , a great person , a great philosopher , he is never arrogant , always humble .
he 's always working on behalf of the workers in our company , and many of our employees look up to him as an example . interview : zhu hong -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while some countries bank on cash incentives , some german car experts believe there are better ways to go . the auto industry has plenty to lose sleep over .
not only is public discourse over the new dirty word " co2 " laying on pressure for change , sales are down as well . the german association of the automotive industry announced last week that car sales have dropped 9 percent this year - a record year - naming consumers ' uncertainty over planned vehicle tax reform , climate concerns and the 3-percent sales tax increase last january . it 's not surprising , then , that a plan recently came under discussion that would theoretically solve both environmental and economic concerns : the government would pay drivers a premium for scrapping their old , pollutant vehicles - or at least taking them off the road - in the hope that they put the money into a new car . the carbon dioxide-based vehicle tax , which the german government is currently considering , would provide an incentive for the buyer to select a low-emissions vehicle .
scrapping premiums would come from the vehicle tax pot , thereby being paid for by heavy emitters . potential two-pronged benefit for scrapping premium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim of a premium is to get old cars off the road , not necessarily destroy them " on the one hand , old cars are taken off the market and new cars , which generally have lower emissions , enter the market .
secondly , business would experience a boom , at least in the short term , " said willi diez , director of the german automobile industry institute , of the plan his organization proposed last month . a similar , reportedly successful project in italy serves as a model .
there , consumers are paid 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,170 -rrb- and given a two-year vehicle tax exemption when they scrap their old cars and buy new ones with emissions rates of less than 140 grams per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- . the incentive has gotten 500,000 old cars off italy 's streets since it started in january , according to a report by germany 's motorzeitung.de.
diez predicted that , if a premium of 1,000 euros was introduced in germany , it could lead to an additional 250,000 cars sold , with at least as many taken off the road . car expert slams scrapping plan for ferdinand dudenhöffer , co-founder and director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- at the gelsenkirchen technical college , the premium to scrap cars sounds like a marketing ploy . " the car industry is n't an industry that needs subsidies , " said dudenhöffer .
" there are much better ways to get customers to buy new cars . " a driver could take the premium and buy a big gas-guzzler if he or she wanted to , added dudenhöffer , who did n't see the proposed tax-break of 50 to 100 euros for more ecologically sound cars as enough of an incentive .
as for the old polluter , it 's more likely to end up on the road in eastern europe than to get scrapped , he said . " and russian co2 is just like german co2 , " he said . emissions trading could help europe reach target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to reach an average 130 grams of co2 per kilometer driven by 2012 the auto expert has been an outspoken proponent of emissions trading as the best way to reduce co2 output across europe .
that scenario would have carmakers buy certificates from an independent exchange for every vehicle they produce with a co2 emissions rate of more than 130 grams per kilometer , and sell one back for every car under the emissions limit . ultimately , said dudenhöffer , the emissions trading plan would help europe attain the 130-gram-per vehicle average it is striving for by 2012 . by making high-emission cars more expensive than clean ones , the customer bears the financial burden . " environmental consciousness may be getting a bit stronger , but you have to assume that when i buy something i pay attention to my needs and not to my neighbor 's , " dudenhöffer said .
" that 's why it 's better not to leave the environmental decision to the consumer but to set prices for co2 that allow these emission goals to be reached . " the plan 's weakness , countered diez , is that it 's too difficult to come up with a basis of calculation to determine a price for the so-called emissions certificates .
emissions trading already exists in stationary industries like power plants , but he said he did n't consider it a practical option for the auto sector . co2-based vehicle tax coming soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who want to drive big cars will have to pay more for them diez conceded , however , that the scrapping premium has n't been well received .
while politicians worry about where the money will come from , carmakers fear that the temporary boom caused by it will be followed by a painful dip in sales . meanwhile , the german government is in the process of approving a law , to take effect in january 2009 , that would adjust the annual vehicle tax according to a new car 's co2 emission rate . while dudenhöffer called it a " german solution to a european problem , " the sliding tax plays a key role in diez 's scrapping premium .
since old cars would continue to be charged according to their cubic capacity , buyers of new low-emissions cars would benefit the most . german auto club adac said it strongly supports the vehicle tax reform - a plan it had suggested to the government already in 2004 . but there 's even another , perhaps simpler way to cut emissions that does n't involve government-initiated incentives : " driving style should n't be underestimated , " said an adac spokesman .
driving ecologically - not accelerating quickly , shifting early and avoiding traffic - can save 20 to 30 percent on gas , he said .

berlin would rather stick to its own plans for remembrance . poland 's prime minister , donald tusk , called on monday , dec .
10 , for a grand-scale world war ii museum in the northern polish city of gdansk , the site of the nazi invasion on sept .
1 , 1939 . other countries , including germany , russia and israel could have a part in the museum , which was proposed as an alternative to a plan for an exhibition in berlin to remember german expellees from central and eastern europe during and just after world war ii . in the large gdansk museum , " the fate of expellees would have a place in a conclusive and comprehensive context , " said tusk in an interview with the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . the coastal city of gdansk , located on the baltic sea , is ripe with symbolic meaning . " the war began here , but in a sense it also ended here when the solidarity movement was founded in 1980 , " tusk said . started by polish laborers under lech walesa , solidarity , or solidarnosc , played a key role in the fall of communism in the former east-bloc country . berlin adamant about expulsion center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk became prime minister last month in response , the german government made it clear that tusk 's statement would have no bearing on plans for the expulsion center .
the governing coalition agreed in their founding contract in 2005 to set up a " visible sign of remembrance against expulsion " in berlin , said government spokesman thomas steg . the conflict began some seven years ago when the league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- started a foundation for a proposed expellee center .
the organization , which campaigns for the rights and remembrance of ethnic german expellees , has been seen in poland as overstating german suffering surrounding the holocaust . " the problem is not that anyone wants to prevent the germans from remembering the suffering of their own people , " tusk said .
" it becomes problematic when this remembrance of the german suffering diminishes another memory - namely that of the collective responsibility of the germans . " points of contention on tusk-merkel agenda the question of remembrance is likely to be a major agenda point when tusk meets with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin on tuesday . the two leaders are also slated to broach the ongoing issue of restitution claims for german expellees and re-settlers . the prussian claims society submitted claims for 22 individual claims cases to the european court for human rights in strasbourg in 2006 , requesting the return of land and property in present-day poland to ethnic germans who were forced out of their homes during the war . several more cases have been submitted since then , and still others are being reviewed in polish courts . " the german government has to take responsibility for the possible financial consequences arising from the compensation claims , " tusk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should expelled german be compensated for what they lost ?
berlin has maintained repeatedly that it does n't support such claims , with then german chancellor gerhard schröder making a binding statement to that effect in warsaw in 2004 . according to german estimates , some 15 million ethnic germans were expelled from their homes during or directly following the war .
some two million are thought to have died in the process . poland fears pipeline puts gas supply at risk plans for a joint russian-german gas pipeline along the baltic sea will be another matter of discussion at tuesday 's meeting . currently , russia sends gas to western europe via poland , but the baltic sea pipeline would circumvent the central european country .
poland has expressed concern that , in a political crisis , russia could shut its gas supply without affecting delivery to - and , hence , relations with - western europe . ahead of tuesday 's talks , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed optimism over the future of bilateral relations . " a concrete program to improve cooperation between the governments is being worked on , " he told the polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza on monday .
" the german and polish ministers will now meet together frequently and regularly . " topics of friction , such as expellee claims and the baltic pipeline would be dealt with " openly and constructively , " he added . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin would rather stick to its own plans for remembrance . poland 's prime minister , donald tusk , called on monday , dec .
10 , for a grand-scale world war ii museum in the northern polish city of gdansk , the site of the nazi invasion on sept .
1 , 1939 . other countries , including germany , russia and israel could have a part in the museum , which was proposed as an alternative to a plan for an exhibition in berlin to remember german expellees from central and eastern europe during and just after world war ii . in the large gdansk museum , " the fate of expellees would have a place in a conclusive and comprehensive context , " said tusk in an interview with the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . the coastal city of gdansk , located on the baltic sea , is ripe with symbolic meaning . " the war began here , but in a sense it also ended here when the solidarity movement was founded in 1980 , " tusk said . started by polish laborers under lech walesa , solidarity , or solidarnosc , played a key role in the fall of communism in the former east-bloc country . berlin adamant about expulsion center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk became prime minister last month in response , the german government made it clear that tusk 's statement would have no bearing on plans for the expulsion center .
the governing coalition agreed in their founding contract in 2005 to set up a " visible sign of remembrance against expulsion " in berlin , said government spokesman thomas steg . the conflict began some seven years ago when the league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- started a foundation for a proposed expellee center .
the organization , which campaigns for the rights and remembrance of ethnic german expellees , has been seen in poland as overstating german suffering surrounding the holocaust . " the problem is not that anyone wants to prevent the germans from remembering the suffering of their own people , " tusk said .
" it becomes problematic when this remembrance of the german suffering diminishes another memory - namely that of the collective responsibility of the germans . " points of contention on tusk-merkel agenda the question of remembrance is likely to be a major agenda point when tusk meets with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin on tuesday . the two leaders are also slated to broach the ongoing issue of restitution claims for german expellees and re-settlers . the prussian claims society submitted claims for 22 individual claims cases to the european court for human rights in strasbourg in 2006 , requesting the return of land and property in present-day poland to ethnic germans who were forced out of their homes during the war . several more cases have been submitted since then , and still others are being reviewed in polish courts . " the german government has to take responsibility for the possible financial consequences arising from the compensation claims , " tusk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should expelled german be compensated for what they lost ?
berlin has maintained repeatedly that it does n't support such claims , with then german chancellor gerhard schröder making a binding statement to that effect in warsaw in 2004 . according to german estimates , some 15 million ethnic germans were expelled from their homes during or directly following the war .
some two million are thought to have died in the process . poland fears pipeline puts gas supply at risk plans for a joint russian-german gas pipeline along the baltic sea will be another matter of discussion at tuesday 's meeting . currently , russia sends gas to western europe via poland , but the baltic sea pipeline would circumvent the central european country .
poland has expressed concern that , in a political crisis , russia could shut its gas supply without affecting delivery to - and , hence , relations with - western europe . ahead of tuesday 's talks , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed optimism over the future of bilateral relations . " a concrete program to improve cooperation between the governments is being worked on , " he told the polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza on monday .
" the german and polish ministers will now meet together frequently and regularly . " topics of friction , such as expellee claims and the baltic pipeline would be dealt with " openly and constructively , " he added . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

liz mohn leads family-run bertelsmann ag , the world 's fifth largest media conglomerate .
in an interview for dw-world.de 's chinese web site , she explained why love and respect are vital for global business success . dw-world.de : you 've spent a lot of time in china - what are your impressions ?
liz mohn : i am in awe of the chinese for making such an enormous economic leap .
it takes time to change a culture - you ca n't do it from one day to the next .
but they are really accomplishing a lot there .
it shows that the chinese people today are well educated .
without brains and talent , they could n't do it .
i also think the government learned they need to be careful about how to make people follow their ideas .
do germans see china 's economic growth and political importance as a challenge - or a threat ?
neither nor .
we have such a huge market in china .
it offers huge opportunities for both europe and china , not just on one side .
it is a unique experience .
there has n't been anything like it , any time since -lsb- world war ii -rsb- : that a whole world opens up , and we have the good fortune to experience it .
german chancellor angela merkel recently invited the dalai lama to visit germany , which has been hard on the relationship between china and germany .
what is your take on that ?
i think when different cultures come together , mistakes can be made on both sides .
in the christian religion , we say people should forgive .
without mistakes , we ca n't learn .
but i think different cultures do n't learn to understand each other overnight .
does bertelsmann have a long-term strategy in china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing once had bikes , now there are cars bertelsmann has been growing in china since 1995 and it is a market that we want to get into even more .
i think everything we do there is on a long-term basis .
there are so many questions you ca n't answer immediately .
things change so quickly with globalization .
bertelsmann has a long history .
what are you particularly proud of ?
we are the only media concern world-wide that is involved with so many different cultures .
when we went overseas , we respected the other cultures .
that was the strength of our company after the war .
despite the age of digitalization , statistics show germans still read a lot .
that is different in china though .
is your china strategy successful ?
as far as i know , the chinese like to read .
they are a cultured people .
but today people may be more likely to take an audio book , sure .
new times call for new measures .
i 'm amazed when i see the changes on the streets in china today .
how full they are with cars .
when i first started going to china , 12 or 13 years ago , it was bikes , then mopeds .
i found it fascinating to watch the changes - and i am amazed as how much they have achieved .
before china opened up to the west , people had little freedom .
now , young people are colorful .
they 've gotten more room to think , to live .
you claim that bertelsmann 's management culture relies on individuality and creativity .
how can we know that this is n't just lip service ?
after all , centralized leadership and hierarchy can be practical .
because without this management culture , bertelsmann would never have been as successful as it has been .
through our wartime experiences , and before the war , we saw what it meant to have a dictatorship .
no freedom .
later we saw that if you give people freedom to be creative and to think , then they are motivated .
when you are fair to people , and respect them , then people come together and work together , and you get a great success .
you have worked alongside your husband -lrb- bertelsmann owner reinhard mohn -rrb- , and been increasingly active , for years .
what aspect of your own personality is visible in bertelsmann 's culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard mohn , now 85 , has handed much power to his wife first i think that it is important to teach basic values - love and respect .
and to know that it is important to give something to society , not just take .
now , china is starting to develop charitable foundations .
i find that great .
and citizens are starting to create businesses that also help society .
these are huge advances .
you 've said creating a management style is bertelsmann 's most important business tool , given globalization .
is that true ?
yes .
for example , from our headquarters , we can not simply order around one of our managers in china .
he has to use his own head , his own ideas .
but at the same time , he needs to keep in mind the greater goals for company are .
he needs to know … what kind of mental and spiritual orientation we have , our values .
what are some other challenges for bertelsmann ?
finding good talent .
people who can lead worldwide .
you have sometimes been called an " iron lady " - is this an accurate description ?
well , i would n't say i am " ironclad . "
i might say : you need to use power to get something done .
otherwise you do n't get anywhere in this world .
you need to have a goal , and bring people along with you .
what other qualities make a good business leader ?
i like dealing with people very much , and that 's why i like my job so much .
i get to dialog with people from all over the world .
and i see that the more i learn , the more i have the feeling that i know nothing at all .
your story - you were a telephone operator who has become the head of a fifth-generation business family - is widely known .
is your life really like a fairy tale ?
no .
the people who know me well , know that you never get to the top without discipline and hard work .
you just ca n't do it any other way .
you also have to make mistakes .
that is a burden .
i think i was fortunate to meet a man who both helped me come into more responsibility in this part of my life , and to experience what i do today .
next year we will have been married for 50 years .
that is a long time .
you still appreciate your husband so much after 50 years of marriage ?
that 's unusual these days .
he is a great businessman , a great person , a great philosopher , he is never arrogant , always humble .
he 's always working on behalf of the workers in our company , and many of our employees look up to him as an example . interview : zhu hong -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speculation was rife about putin 's next move .
one scenario put forward was that putin would alter the constitution .
another saw putin naming a stand-in president , then returning to office after having fulfilled the constitution 's technical requirements .
it was difficult to imagine russia being governed by another politician after eight years of putin .
medvedev certain to be elected the russian president has decided to back dmitry medvedev , first deputy prime minister and board chairman of gas giant gazprom , to stand as a presidential candidate in march 2008 .
given what happened in russian parliamentary poll in early december , it is practically certain that medvedev will be elected in the first round of the elections on march 2 .
the kremlin propaganda machine functions magnificently , the administrative apparatus runs smoothly , and the significant size of russian security forces remove any lingering doubt about the outcome of the poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel there is no point in bemoaning the poor prospects for democracy in russia in the light of such political relations .
the vague and possibly premature hopes for a rapid democratization of russia were snuffed out some time ago .
with his decision in favor of medvedev , president putin has made a bold move and answered a number of questions about himself and russia 's future course .
not just a fill-in president putin will step down as president in march 2008 .
the intention is that 42-year-old medvedev should be president for the next four years - in all likelihood much longer .
medvedev is completely unsuited to just act as a stand-in who would keep the presidential post warm for putin .
in this respect , putin has remained true to himself - in spite of what all his opponents and his sycophantic supporters have said .
after all , he always said he would not violate the constitution in order to remain in office .
however , the end of putin 's presidential era does not spell the end of putin as the leading light in russian politics .
he will retain considerable influence over russian politics as head of united russia , or possibly as prime minister .
we will have to wait and see if putin will take up medvedev 's offer to take on the job of pm under him .
at any rate , medvedev is not expected to usher in any decisive course change .
putin 's longstanding ally has always been directly involved from the outset in shaping and representing putin 's policies in his previous posts .
medvedev looks set to continue pursuing putin 's goal of modernizing russia because he shares his convictions .
the loyal technocrat is the ideal candidate to ensure that putin 's course is maintained without the current president having to resort to any trickery with the constitution .
past will burden relations with europe president medvedev will be blemished by the fact that he has emerged from putin 's powerhouse .
his previous role as chair of the board at gazprom will also not help his popularity in europe given the poor image of the russia energy giant here .
on the other hand , medvedev is not the worst candidate from amongst the current russian elite .
the former law professor from st. petersburg is reputed to be one of the more liberal spirits in the kremlin .
in addition , he has no direct contacts to the soviet or the post-soviet security services .
and given his relative youth , he also stands for a new russia that europe - and the west in general - will have to learn to live with .
the russian president 's decision to select medvedev is not likely to find favor with all of the factions who putin can currently rally behind him .
the effects of a change in president in terms of who has what access to important financial and business resources are not likely to be clear for a while , and the process will not be without its tensions .
the question is whether the first cracks within russia 's kremlin elite will already have become apparent ahead of the elections in march , thus threatening the transfer of power .
then things could get tricky for putin as the one responsible for naming medvedev his political heir .

liz mohn leads family-run bertelsmann ag , the world 's fifth largest media conglomerate .
in an interview for dw-world.de 's chinese web site , she explained why love and respect are vital for global business success . dw-world.de : you 've spent a lot of time in china - what are your impressions ?
liz mohn : i am in awe of the chinese for making such an enormous economic leap .
it takes time to change a culture - you ca n't do it from one day to the next .
but they are really accomplishing a lot there .
it shows that the chinese people today are well educated .
without brains and talent , they could n't do it .
i also think the government learned they need to be careful about how to make people follow their ideas .
do germans see china 's economic growth and political importance as a challenge - or a threat ?
neither nor .
we have such a huge market in china .
it offers huge opportunities for both europe and china , not just on one side .
it is a unique experience .
there has n't been anything like it , any time since -lsb- world war ii -rsb- : that a whole world opens up , and we have the good fortune to experience it .
german chancellor angela merkel recently invited the dalai lama to visit germany , which has been hard on the relationship between china and germany .
what is your take on that ?
i think when different cultures come together , mistakes can be made on both sides .
in the christian religion , we say people should forgive .
without mistakes , we ca n't learn .
but i think different cultures do n't learn to understand each other overnight .
does bertelsmann have a long-term strategy in china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing once had bikes , now there are cars bertelsmann has been growing in china since 1995 and it is a market that we want to get into even more .
i think everything we do there is on a long-term basis .
there are so many questions you ca n't answer immediately .
things change so quickly with globalization .
bertelsmann has a long history .
what are you particularly proud of ?
we are the only media concern world-wide that is involved with so many different cultures .
when we went overseas , we respected the other cultures .
that was the strength of our company after the war .
despite the age of digitalization , statistics show germans still read a lot .
that is different in china though .
is your china strategy successful ?
as far as i know , the chinese like to read .
they are a cultured people .
but today people may be more likely to take an audio book , sure .
new times call for new measures .
i 'm amazed when i see the changes on the streets in china today .
how full they are with cars .
when i first started going to china , 12 or 13 years ago , it was bikes , then mopeds .
i found it fascinating to watch the changes - and i am amazed as how much they have achieved .
before china opened up to the west , people had little freedom .
now , young people are colorful .
they 've gotten more room to think , to live .
you claim that bertelsmann 's management culture relies on individuality and creativity .
how can we know that this is n't just lip service ?
after all , centralized leadership and hierarchy can be practical .
because without this management culture , bertelsmann would never have been as successful as it has been .
through our wartime experiences , and before the war , we saw what it meant to have a dictatorship .
no freedom .
later we saw that if you give people freedom to be creative and to think , then they are motivated .
when you are fair to people , and respect them , then people come together and work together , and you get a great success .
you have worked alongside your husband -lrb- bertelsmann owner reinhard mohn -rrb- , and been increasingly active , for years .
what aspect of your own personality is visible in bertelsmann 's culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard mohn , now 85 , has handed much power to his wife first i think that it is important to teach basic values - love and respect .
and to know that it is important to give something to society , not just take .
now , china is starting to develop charitable foundations .
i find that great .
and citizens are starting to create businesses that also help society .
these are huge advances .
you 've said creating a management style is bertelsmann 's most important business tool , given globalization .
is that true ?
yes .
for example , from our headquarters , we can not simply order around one of our managers in china .
he has to use his own head , his own ideas .
but at the same time , he needs to keep in mind the greater goals for company are .
he needs to know … what kind of mental and spiritual orientation we have , our values .
what are some other challenges for bertelsmann ?
finding good talent .
people who can lead worldwide .
you have sometimes been called an " iron lady " - is this an accurate description ?
well , i would n't say i am " ironclad . "
i might say : you need to use power to get something done .
otherwise you do n't get anywhere in this world .
you need to have a goal , and bring people along with you .
what other qualities make a good business leader ?
i like dealing with people very much , and that 's why i like my job so much .
i get to dialog with people from all over the world .
and i see that the more i learn , the more i have the feeling that i know nothing at all .
your story - you were a telephone operator who has become the head of a fifth-generation business family - is widely known .
is your life really like a fairy tale ?
no .
the people who know me well , know that you never get to the top without discipline and hard work .
you just ca n't do it any other way .
you also have to make mistakes .
that is a burden .
i think i was fortunate to meet a man who both helped me come into more responsibility in this part of my life , and to experience what i do today .
next year we will have been married for 50 years .
that is a long time .
you still appreciate your husband so much after 50 years of marriage ?
that 's unusual these days .
he is a great businessman , a great person , a great philosopher , he is never arrogant , always humble .
he 's always working on behalf of the workers in our company , and many of our employees look up to him as an example . interview : zhu hong -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russian law prevents presidents from standing for a third term of office .
speculation was rife about putin 's next move .
one scenario put forward was that putin would alter the constitution .
another saw putin naming a stand-in president , then returning to office after having fulfilled the constitution 's technical requirements .
it was difficult to imagine russia being governed by another politician after eight years of putin .
medvedev certain to be elected the russian president has decided to back dmitry medvedev , first deputy prime minister and board chairman of gas giant gazprom , to stand as a presidential candidate in march 2008 .
given what happened in russian parliamentary poll in early december , it is practically certain that medvedev will be elected in the first round of the elections on march 2 .
the kremlin propaganda machine functions magnificently , the administrative apparatus runs smoothly , and the significant size of russian security forces remove any lingering doubt about the outcome of the poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel there is no point in bemoaning the poor prospects for democracy in russia in the light of such political relations .
the vague and possibly premature hopes for a rapid democratization of russia were snuffed out some time ago .
with his decision in favor of medvedev , president putin has made a bold move and answered a number of questions about himself and russia 's future course .
not just a fill-in president putin will step down as president in march 2008 .
the intention is that 42-year-old medvedev should be president for the next four years - in all likelihood much longer .
medvedev is completely unsuited to just act as a stand-in who would keep the presidential post warm for putin .
in this respect , putin has remained true to himself - in spite of what all his opponents and his sycophantic supporters have said .
after all , he always said he would not violate the constitution in order to remain in office .
however , the end of putin 's presidential era does not spell the end of putin as the leading light in russian politics .
he will retain considerable influence over russian politics as head of united russia , or possibly as prime minister .
we will have to wait and see if putin will take up medvedev 's offer to take on the job of pm under him .
at any rate , medvedev is not expected to usher in any decisive course change .
putin 's longstanding ally has always been directly involved from the outset in shaping and representing putin 's policies in his previous posts .
medvedev looks set to continue pursuing putin 's goal of modernizing russia because he shares his convictions .
the loyal technocrat is the ideal candidate to ensure that putin 's course is maintained without the current president having to resort to any trickery with the constitution .
past will burden relations with europe president medvedev will be blemished by the fact that he has emerged from putin 's powerhouse .
his previous role as chair of the board at gazprom will also not help his popularity in europe given the poor image of the russia energy giant here .
on the other hand , medvedev is not the worst candidate from amongst the current russian elite .
the former law professor from st. petersburg is reputed to be one of the more liberal spirits in the kremlin .
in addition , he has no direct contacts to the soviet or the post-soviet security services .
and given his relative youth , he also stands for a new russia that europe - and the west in general - will have to learn to live with .
the russian president 's decision to select medvedev is not likely to find favor with all of the factions who putin can currently rally behind him .
the effects of a change in president in terms of who has what access to important financial and business resources are not likely to be clear for a while , and the process will not be without its tensions .
the question is whether the first cracks within russia 's kremlin elite will already have become apparent ahead of the elections in march , thus threatening the transfer of power .
then things could get tricky for putin as the one responsible for naming medvedev his political heir .

chancellor angela merkel was all ears .
but will talking about disagreements solve anything ? " there should be no taboo subjects , " tusk said at the press conference after the two-hour meeting with merkel in berlin on tuesday , dec .
11 .
" we are friends , and friends ca n't get themselves into a situation of not talking to one another . "
tusk 's tone stood in marked contrast to that of his conservative predecessor , jaroslav kaczynski , who often seemed to go out of his way to offend german sensibilities .
the more eu-friendly tusk defeated kaczynski in poland 's hotly contested national election in november .
merkel was keen to echo the theme of a new polish-german frankness and friendship .
" we 've pledged not dodge any problems , " merkel said .
" together we can get a lot accomplished . "
a problematic past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as per the schengen agreement , the german-polish border will be opened in 2008 tusk and merkel arranged to meet with czech prime minister mirek topolanek on dec .
21 to discuss the opening of borders between the three countries .
and they also addressed two of the most contentious issues dividing poland and germany .
one of them is how to remember the past and , specifically , a planned memorial in berlin to expellees during world war ii - including germans driven from their homes in poland .
many poles see the project as an attempt to revise history and lessen germany 's wartime culpability .
tusk said he favored treating the subject of expellees of all nationalities in a museum about world war ii to be built in the city of gdansk , which used to be part of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is no doubt happy to have a new counterpart in warsaw merkel asserted that a museum could not replace the berlin memorial , but said that she supported the museum idea .
she also promised to send a delegation to warsaw to keep poland informed about the memorial and said germany had no interest in reviving past conflicts .
" there are no demands whatsoever for reparations from poland -lsb- to german refugees -rsb- , " merkel said .
" no german government is going to take a position that deviates from this . "
tusk said he welcomed the assurance as a " moment with symbolic value . "
a present pipeline merkel also discussed the natural-gas pipeline to be built under the baltic sea , which would connect germany with russia but bypass poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic pipeline remains a major sticking point tusk suggested that a meeting be arranged between the three countries to discuss the project in its current form .
such a meeting , he said , could bring about " positive corrections on both sides . "
the pipeline , which was negotiated by merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , has angered many poles , who worry about being held hostage on energy policy by russia and feel they have been ignored by their more powerful neighbors .
clearly , much work needs to be done to resolve such conflicts of interest , but tusk 's visit did re-establish a more civil tone between germany and poland .
he and merkel will have a chance to continue their open exchanges when they meet in the eastern german city of zittau in 10 days ' time . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 11.12.2007 opponents of kosovo independence fear separatist reaction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will an independent kosovo give rise to separatist movements elsewhere ?
the expected declaration of independence by kosovo has a number of nations on edge .
those who oppose kosovo 's autonomy harbor separatists of their own .
a free kosovo could be just the rallying call these movements need . with all the signs pointing towards a declaration of independence from kosovo after the un-set deadline for reaching a settlement passes on monday , the european union is bracing itself for a wave of renewed calls for autonomy from separatist movements across europe .
if kosovo declares independence from serbia , it will set a powerful precedent for movements from spain to scotland , all wanting to rewrite the map of europe and form their own independent states , according to experts .
" there is a real risk that the quasi-dogma of the intangibility of borders which has existed since the end of the world war ii will fall , " french political scientist jean-yves camus of the paris-based iris institute told afp .
" this would benefit movements which seek to rewrite the map of europe based on ethnic , linguistic or cultural criteria , " added camus , a specialist on separatist movements in europe .
the emergence of similar lifestyles and english as a common language in europe , combined with the disappearance of borders and the lack of democratic legitimacy of eu bodies , had fueled " the development of micro-distinctive identities , " said camus .
while kosovo 's ethnic majority leaders have vowed not to unilaterally declare independence from serbia without us and european union approval , they are expected to announce their intentions to form a new state in early 2008 .
opposition includes fear of own breakaway states many of the countries which oppose the creation of an independent state of kosovo have at least one separatist movement working towards autonomy within their own borders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has been fighting chechen separatists for years serbia 's ally russia , which leads the opposition , has problems with separatists in chechnya and the caucasus region while spain has had a long-running dispute with the armed eta movement .
other countries against kosovo 's independence such as cyprus and greece have ethnic minorities which demand more power .
" in the west , this -lsb- kosovo -rsb- solution will set off separatists in europe , ” russian president vladimir putin said in an interview published in french newspaper le figaro earlier this year . ” look at scotland , catalonia and the basque country . "
spain is currently experiencing a period of unease as its northern basque country and its wealthy northeastern region of catalonia have stepped up their demands for more autonomy .
last year catalan voters overwhelmingly backed a new charter which recognized the region as a " nation " within spain and grants it enhanced powers in taxation and judicial matters .
separatists claim eu structure makes autonomy possible as in other separatist regions of europe like flanders , the dutch-speaking northern part of belgium , and northern italy , supporters said catalonia deserved extra powers because it makes a bigger contribution to the economy .
the armed basque separatist group eta ended a 15-month ceasefire in june while the scottish national party , which came to power in may , plans to hold a referendum on independence in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lingusitic divisions have led to a debate on splitting belgium belgium meanwhile has been without a government for six months after a general election on june 10 highlighted deep divisions between the nation 's majority dutch-speakers and francophones .
for many nationalists , membership in the 27-nation european union has only served to make separation seem more viable .
" europe can regulate our functionings and transfer payments .
why must we maintain this intermediate roof we call belgium , " the leader of the flemish nationalist party , bart de wever , told french daily le monde last month .
russia to block independence at un level meanwhile , russia stepped up its opposition tuesday by announcing that it would demand that the un security council annul any unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo .
" russia will of course demand the annulment of such a decision .
we will demand a meeting of the security council because it would be a violation of a council resolution , " russia 's interfax news agency quoted the country 's chief kosovo negotiator alexander botsan-kharchenko as saying . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

liz mohn leads family-run bertelsmann ag , the world 's fifth largest media conglomerate .
in an interview for dw-world.de 's chinese web site , she explained why love and respect are vital for global business success . dw-world.de : you 've spent a lot of time in china - what are your impressions ?
liz mohn : i am in awe of the chinese for making such an enormous economic leap .
it takes time to change a culture - you ca n't do it from one day to the next .
but they are really accomplishing a lot there .
it shows that the chinese people today are well educated .
without brains and talent , they could n't do it .
i also think the government learned they need to be careful about how to make people follow their ideas .
do germans see china 's economic growth and political importance as a challenge - or a threat ?
neither nor .
we have such a huge market in china .
it offers huge opportunities for both europe and china , not just on one side .
it is a unique experience .
there has n't been anything like it , any time since -lsb- world war ii -rsb- : that a whole world opens up , and we have the good fortune to experience it .
german chancellor angela merkel recently invited the dalai lama to visit germany , which has been hard on the relationship between china and germany .
what is your take on that ?
i think when different cultures come together , mistakes can be made on both sides .
in the christian religion , we say people should forgive .
without mistakes , we ca n't learn .
but i think different cultures do n't learn to understand each other overnight .
does bertelsmann have a long-term strategy in china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing once had bikes , now there are cars bertelsmann has been growing in china since 1995 and it is a market that we want to get into even more .
i think everything we do there is on a long-term basis .
there are so many questions you ca n't answer immediately .
things change so quickly with globalization .
bertelsmann has a long history .
what are you particularly proud of ?
we are the only media concern world-wide that is involved with so many different cultures .
when we went overseas , we respected the other cultures .
that was the strength of our company after the war .
despite the age of digitalization , statistics show germans still read a lot .
that is different in china though .
is your china strategy successful ?
as far as i know , the chinese like to read .
they are a cultured people .
but today people may be more likely to take an audio book , sure .
new times call for new measures .
i 'm amazed when i see the changes on the streets in china today .
how full they are with cars .
when i first started going to china , 12 or 13 years ago , it was bikes , then mopeds .
i found it fascinating to watch the changes - and i am amazed as how much they have achieved .
before china opened up to the west , people had little freedom .
now , young people are colorful .
they 've gotten more room to think , to live .
you claim that bertelsmann 's management culture relies on individuality and creativity .
how can we know that this is n't just lip service ?
after all , centralized leadership and hierarchy can be practical .
because without this management culture , bertelsmann would never have been as successful as it has been .
through our wartime experiences , and before the war , we saw what it meant to have a dictatorship .
no freedom .
later we saw that if you give people freedom to be creative and to think , then they are motivated .
when you are fair to people , and respect them , then people come together and work together , and you get a great success .
you have worked alongside your husband -lrb- bertelsmann owner reinhard mohn -rrb- , and been increasingly active , for years .
what aspect of your own personality is visible in bertelsmann 's culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard mohn , now 85 , has handed much power to his wife first i think that it is important to teach basic values - love and respect .
and to know that it is important to give something to society , not just take .
now , china is starting to develop charitable foundations .
i find that great .
and citizens are starting to create businesses that also help society .
these are huge advances .
you 've said creating a management style is bertelsmann 's most important business tool , given globalization .
is that true ?
yes .
for example , from our headquarters , we can not simply order around one of our managers in china .
he has to use his own head , his own ideas .
but at the same time , he needs to keep in mind the greater goals for company are .
he needs to know … what kind of mental and spiritual orientation we have , our values .
what are some other challenges for bertelsmann ?
finding good talent .
people who can lead worldwide .
you have sometimes been called an " iron lady " - is this an accurate description ?
well , i would n't say i am " ironclad . "
i might say : you need to use power to get something done .
otherwise you do n't get anywhere in this world .
you need to have a goal , and bring people along with you .
what other qualities make a good business leader ?
i like dealing with people very much , and that 's why i like my job so much .
i get to dialog with people from all over the world .
and i see that the more i learn , the more i have the feeling that i know nothing at all .
your story - you were a telephone operator who has become the head of a fifth-generation business family - is widely known .
is your life really like a fairy tale ?
no .
the people who know me well , know that you never get to the top without discipline and hard work .
you just ca n't do it any other way .
you also have to make mistakes .
that is a burden .
i think i was fortunate to meet a man who both helped me come into more responsibility in this part of my life , and to experience what i do today .
next year we will have been married for 50 years .
that is a long time .
you still appreciate your husband so much after 50 years of marriage ?
that 's unusual these days .
he is a great businessman , a great person , a great philosopher , he is never arrogant , always humble .

liz mohn leads family-run bertelsmann ag , the world 's fifth largest media conglomerate .
in an interview for dw-world.de 's chinese web site , she explained why love and respect are vital for global business success . dw-world.de : you 've spent a lot of time in china - what are your impressions ?
liz mohn : i am in awe of the chinese for making such an enormous economic leap .
it takes time to change a culture - you ca n't do it from one day to the next .
but they are really accomplishing a lot there .
it shows that the chinese people today are well educated .
without brains and talent , they could n't do it .
i also think the government learned they need to be careful about how to make people follow their ideas .
do germans see china 's economic growth and political importance as a challenge - or a threat ?
neither nor .
we have such a huge market in china .
it offers huge opportunities for both europe and china , not just on one side .
it is a unique experience .
there has n't been anything like it , any time since -lsb- world war ii -rsb- : that a whole world opens up , and we have the good fortune to experience it .
german chancellor angela merkel recently invited the dalai lama to visit germany , which has been hard on the relationship between china and germany .
what is your take on that ?
i think when different cultures come together , mistakes can be made on both sides .
in the christian religion , we say people should forgive .
without mistakes , we ca n't learn .
but i think different cultures do n't learn to understand each other overnight .
does bertelsmann have a long-term strategy in china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing once had bikes , now there are cars bertelsmann has been growing in china since 1995 and it is a market that we want to get into even more .
i think everything we do there is on a long-term basis .
there are so many questions you ca n't answer immediately .
things change so quickly with globalization .
bertelsmann has a long history .
what are you particularly proud of ?
we are the only media concern world-wide that is involved with so many different cultures .
when we went overseas , we respected the other cultures .
that was the strength of our company after the war .
despite the age of digitalization , statistics show germans still read a lot .
that is different in china though .
is your china strategy successful ?
as far as i know , the chinese like to read .
they are a cultured people .
but today people may be more likely to take an audio book , sure .
new times call for new measures .
i 'm amazed when i see the changes on the streets in china today .
how full they are with cars .
when i first started going to china , 12 or 13 years ago , it was bikes , then mopeds .
i found it fascinating to watch the changes - and i am amazed as how much they have achieved .
before china opened up to the west , people had little freedom .
now , young people are colorful .
they 've gotten more room to think , to live .
you claim that bertelsmann 's management culture relies on individuality and creativity .
how can we know that this is n't just lip service ?
after all , centralized leadership and hierarchy can be practical .
because without this management culture , bertelsmann would never have been as successful as it has been .
through our wartime experiences , and before the war , we saw what it meant to have a dictatorship .
no freedom .
later we saw that if you give people freedom to be creative and to think , then they are motivated .
when you are fair to people , and respect them , then people come together and work together , and you get a great success .
you have worked alongside your husband -lrb- bertelsmann owner reinhard mohn -rrb- , and been increasingly active , for years .
what aspect of your own personality is visible in bertelsmann 's culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard mohn , now 85 , has handed much power to his wife first i think that it is important to teach basic values - love and respect .
and to know that it is important to give something to society , not just take .
now , china is starting to develop charitable foundations .
i find that great .
and citizens are starting to create businesses that also help society .
these are huge advances .
you 've said creating a management style is bertelsmann 's most important business tool , given globalization .
is that true ?
yes .
for example , from our headquarters , we can not simply order around one of our managers in china .
he has to use his own head , his own ideas .
but at the same time , he needs to keep in mind the greater goals for company are .
he needs to know … what kind of mental and spiritual orientation we have , our values .
what are some other challenges for bertelsmann ?
finding good talent .
people who can lead worldwide .
you have sometimes been called an " iron lady " - is this an accurate description ?
well , i would n't say i am " ironclad . "
i might say : you need to use power to get something done .
otherwise you do n't get anywhere in this world .
you need to have a goal , and bring people along with you .
what other qualities make a good business leader ?
i like dealing with people very much , and that 's why i like my job so much .
i get to dialog with people from all over the world .
and i see that the more i learn , the more i have the feeling that i know nothing at all .
your story - you were a telephone operator who has become the head of a fifth-generation business family - is widely known .

berlin would rather stick to its own plans for remembrance . poland 's prime minister , donald tusk , called on monday , dec .
10 , for a grand-scale world war ii museum in the northern polish city of gdansk , the site of the nazi invasion on sept .
1 , 1939 . other countries , including germany , russia and israel could have a part in the museum , which was proposed as an alternative to a plan for an exhibition in berlin to remember german expellees from central and eastern europe during and just after world war ii . in the large gdansk museum , " the fate of expellees would have a place in a conclusive and comprehensive context , " said tusk in an interview with the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . the coastal city of gdansk , located on the baltic sea , is ripe with symbolic meaning . " the war began here , but in a sense it also ended here when the solidarity movement was founded in 1980 , " tusk said . started by polish laborers under lech walesa , solidarity , or solidarnosc , played a key role in the fall of communism in the former east-bloc country . berlin adamant about expulsion center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk became prime minister last month in response , the german government made it clear that tusk 's statement would have no bearing on plans for the expulsion center .
the governing coalition agreed in their founding contract in 2005 to set up a " visible sign of remembrance against expulsion " in berlin , said government spokesman thomas steg . the conflict began some seven years ago when the league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- started a foundation for a proposed expellee center .
the organization , which campaigns for the rights and remembrance of ethnic german expellees , has been seen in poland as overstating german suffering surrounding the holocaust . " the problem is not that anyone wants to prevent the germans from remembering the suffering of their own people , " tusk said .
" it becomes problematic when this remembrance of the german suffering diminishes another memory - namely that of the collective responsibility of the germans . " points of contention on tusk-merkel agenda the question of remembrance is likely to be a major agenda point when tusk meets with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin on tuesday . the two leaders are also slated to broach the ongoing issue of restitution claims for german expellees and re-settlers . the prussian claims society submitted claims for 22 individual claims cases to the european court for human rights in strasbourg in 2006 , requesting the return of land and property in present-day poland to ethnic germans who were forced out of their homes during the war . several more cases have been submitted since then , and still others are being reviewed in polish courts . " the german government has to take responsibility for the possible financial consequences arising from the compensation claims , " tusk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should expelled german be compensated for what they lost ?
berlin has maintained repeatedly that it does n't support such claims , with then german chancellor gerhard schröder making a binding statement to that effect in warsaw in 2004 . according to german estimates , some 15 million ethnic germans were expelled from their homes during or directly following the war .
some two million are thought to have died in the process . poland fears pipeline puts gas supply at risk plans for a joint russian-german gas pipeline along the baltic sea will be another matter of discussion at tuesday 's meeting . currently , russia sends gas to western europe via poland , but the baltic sea pipeline would circumvent the central european country .
poland has expressed concern that , in a political crisis , russia could shut its gas supply without affecting delivery to - and , hence , relations with - western europe . ahead of tuesday 's talks , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed optimism over the future of bilateral relations . " a concrete program to improve cooperation between the governments is being worked on , " he told the polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza on monday .
" the german and polish ministers will now meet together frequently and regularly . " topics of friction , such as expellee claims and the baltic pipeline would be dealt with " openly and constructively , " he added . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , 1939 . other countries , including germany , russia and israel could have a part in the museum , which was proposed as an alternative to a plan for an exhibition in berlin to remember german expellees from central and eastern europe during and just after world war ii . in the large gdansk museum , " the fate of expellees would have a place in a conclusive and comprehensive context , " said tusk in an interview with the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . the coastal city of gdansk , located on the baltic sea , is ripe with symbolic meaning . " the war began here , but in a sense it also ended here when the solidarity movement was founded in 1980 , " tusk said . started by polish laborers under lech walesa , solidarity , or solidarnosc , played a key role in the fall of communism in the former east-bloc country . berlin adamant about expulsion center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk became prime minister last month in response , the german government made it clear that tusk 's statement would have no bearing on plans for the expulsion center .
the governing coalition agreed in their founding contract in 2005 to set up a " visible sign of remembrance against expulsion " in berlin , said government spokesman thomas steg . the conflict began some seven years ago when the league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- started a foundation for a proposed expellee center .
the organization , which campaigns for the rights and remembrance of ethnic german expellees , has been seen in poland as overstating german suffering surrounding the holocaust . " the problem is not that anyone wants to prevent the germans from remembering the suffering of their own people , " tusk said .
" it becomes problematic when this remembrance of the german suffering diminishes another memory - namely that of the collective responsibility of the germans . " points of contention on tusk-merkel agenda the question of remembrance is likely to be a major agenda point when tusk meets with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin on tuesday . the two leaders are also slated to broach the ongoing issue of restitution claims for german expellees and re-settlers . the prussian claims society submitted claims for 22 individual claims cases to the european court for human rights in strasbourg in 2006 , requesting the return of land and property in present-day poland to ethnic germans who were forced out of their homes during the war . several more cases have been submitted since then , and still others are being reviewed in polish courts . " the german government has to take responsibility for the possible financial consequences arising from the compensation claims , " tusk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should expelled german be compensated for what they lost ?
berlin has maintained repeatedly that it does n't support such claims , with then german chancellor gerhard schröder making a binding statement to that effect in warsaw in 2004 . according to german estimates , some 15 million ethnic germans were expelled from their homes during or directly following the war .
some two million are thought to have died in the process . poland fears pipeline puts gas supply at risk plans for a joint russian-german gas pipeline along the baltic sea will be another matter of discussion at tuesday 's meeting . currently , russia sends gas to western europe via poland , but the baltic sea pipeline would circumvent the central european country .
poland has expressed concern that , in a political crisis , russia could shut its gas supply without affecting delivery to - and , hence , relations with - western europe . ahead of tuesday 's talks , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed optimism over the future of bilateral relations . " a concrete program to improve cooperation between the governments is being worked on , " he told the polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza on monday .
" the german and polish ministers will now meet together frequently and regularly . " topics of friction , such as expellee claims and the baltic pipeline would be dealt with " openly and constructively , " he added . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor angela merkel was all ears .
but will talking about disagreements solve anything ? " there should be no taboo subjects , " tusk said at the press conference after the two-hour meeting with merkel in berlin on tuesday , dec .
11 .
" we are friends , and friends ca n't get themselves into a situation of not talking to one another . "
tusk 's tone stood in marked contrast to that of his conservative predecessor , jaroslav kaczynski , who often seemed to go out of his way to offend german sensibilities .
the more eu-friendly tusk defeated kaczynski in poland 's hotly contested national election in november .
merkel was keen to echo the theme of a new polish-german frankness and friendship .
" we 've pledged not dodge any problems , " merkel said .
" together we can get a lot accomplished . "
a problematic past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as per the schengen agreement , the german-polish border will be opened in 2008 tusk and merkel arranged to meet with czech prime minister mirek topolanek on dec .
21 to discuss the opening of borders between the three countries .
and they also addressed two of the most contentious issues dividing poland and germany .
one of them is how to remember the past and , specifically , a planned memorial in berlin to expellees during world war ii - including germans driven from their homes in poland .
many poles see the project as an attempt to revise history and lessen germany 's wartime culpability .
tusk said he favored treating the subject of expellees of all nationalities in a museum about world war ii to be built in the city of gdansk , which used to be part of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is no doubt happy to have a new counterpart in warsaw merkel asserted that a museum could not replace the berlin memorial , but said that she supported the museum idea .
she also promised to send a delegation to warsaw to keep poland informed about the memorial and said germany had no interest in reviving past conflicts .
" there are no demands whatsoever for reparations from poland -lsb- to german refugees -rsb- , " merkel said .
" no german government is going to take a position that deviates from this . "
tusk said he welcomed the assurance as a " moment with symbolic value . "
a present pipeline merkel also discussed the natural-gas pipeline to be built under the baltic sea , which would connect germany with russia but bypass poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic pipeline remains a major sticking point tusk suggested that a meeting be arranged between the three countries to discuss the project in its current form .
such a meeting , he said , could bring about " positive corrections on both sides . "
the pipeline , which was negotiated by merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , has angered many poles , who worry about being held hostage on energy policy by russia and feel they have been ignored by their more powerful neighbors .
clearly , much work needs to be done to resolve such conflicts of interest , but tusk 's visit did re-establish a more civil tone between germany and poland .

chancellor angela merkel was all ears .
but will talking about disagreements solve anything ? " there should be no taboo subjects , " tusk said at the press conference after the two-hour meeting with merkel in berlin on tuesday , dec .
11 .
" we are friends , and friends ca n't get themselves into a situation of not talking to one another . "
tusk 's tone stood in marked contrast to that of his conservative predecessor , jaroslav kaczynski , who often seemed to go out of his way to offend german sensibilities .
the more eu-friendly tusk defeated kaczynski in poland 's hotly contested national election in november .
merkel was keen to echo the theme of a new polish-german frankness and friendship .
" we 've pledged not dodge any problems , " merkel said .
" together we can get a lot accomplished . "
a problematic past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as per the schengen agreement , the german-polish border will be opened in 2008 tusk and merkel arranged to meet with czech prime minister mirek topolanek on dec .
21 to discuss the opening of borders between the three countries .
and they also addressed two of the most contentious issues dividing poland and germany .
one of them is how to remember the past and , specifically , a planned memorial in berlin to expellees during world war ii - including germans driven from their homes in poland .
many poles see the project as an attempt to revise history and lessen germany 's wartime culpability .
tusk said he favored treating the subject of expellees of all nationalities in a museum about world war ii to be built in the city of gdansk , which used to be part of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is no doubt happy to have a new counterpart in warsaw merkel asserted that a museum could not replace the berlin memorial , but said that she supported the museum idea .
she also promised to send a delegation to warsaw to keep poland informed about the memorial and said germany had no interest in reviving past conflicts .
" there are no demands whatsoever for reparations from poland -lsb- to german refugees -rsb- , " merkel said .
" no german government is going to take a position that deviates from this . "
tusk said he welcomed the assurance as a " moment with symbolic value . "
a present pipeline merkel also discussed the natural-gas pipeline to be built under the baltic sea , which would connect germany with russia but bypass poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic pipeline remains a major sticking point tusk suggested that a meeting be arranged between the three countries to discuss the project in its current form .
such a meeting , he said , could bring about " positive corrections on both sides . "
the pipeline , which was negotiated by merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , has angered many poles , who worry about being held hostage on energy policy by russia and feel they have been ignored by their more powerful neighbors .
clearly , much work needs to be done to resolve such conflicts of interest , but tusk 's visit did re-establish a more civil tone between germany and poland .
he and merkel will have a chance to continue their open exchanges when they meet in the eastern german city of zittau in 10 days ' time . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the expected declaration of independence by kosovo has a number of nations on edge .
those who oppose kosovo 's autonomy harbor separatists of their own .
a free kosovo could be just the rallying call these movements need . with all the signs pointing towards a declaration of independence from kosovo after the un-set deadline for reaching a settlement passes on monday , the european union is bracing itself for a wave of renewed calls for autonomy from separatist movements across europe .
if kosovo declares independence from serbia , it will set a powerful precedent for movements from spain to scotland , all wanting to rewrite the map of europe and form their own independent states , according to experts .
" there is a real risk that the quasi-dogma of the intangibility of borders which has existed since the end of the world war ii will fall , " french political scientist jean-yves camus of the paris-based iris institute told afp .
" this would benefit movements which seek to rewrite the map of europe based on ethnic , linguistic or cultural criteria , " added camus , a specialist on separatist movements in europe .
the emergence of similar lifestyles and english as a common language in europe , combined with the disappearance of borders and the lack of democratic legitimacy of eu bodies , had fueled " the development of micro-distinctive identities , " said camus .
while kosovo 's ethnic majority leaders have vowed not to unilaterally declare independence from serbia without us and european union approval , they are expected to announce their intentions to form a new state in early 2008 .
opposition includes fear of own breakaway states many of the countries which oppose the creation of an independent state of kosovo have at least one separatist movement working towards autonomy within their own borders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has been fighting chechen separatists for years serbia 's ally russia , which leads the opposition , has problems with separatists in chechnya and the caucasus region while spain has had a long-running dispute with the armed eta movement .
other countries against kosovo 's independence such as cyprus and greece have ethnic minorities which demand more power .
" in the west , this -lsb- kosovo -rsb- solution will set off separatists in europe , ” russian president vladimir putin said in an interview published in french newspaper le figaro earlier this year . ” look at scotland , catalonia and the basque country . "
spain is currently experiencing a period of unease as its northern basque country and its wealthy northeastern region of catalonia have stepped up their demands for more autonomy .
last year catalan voters overwhelmingly backed a new charter which recognized the region as a " nation " within spain and grants it enhanced powers in taxation and judicial matters .
separatists claim eu structure makes autonomy possible as in other separatist regions of europe like flanders , the dutch-speaking northern part of belgium , and northern italy , supporters said catalonia deserved extra powers because it makes a bigger contribution to the economy .
the armed basque separatist group eta ended a 15-month ceasefire in june while the scottish national party , which came to power in may , plans to hold a referendum on independence in 2010 .

" europe can regulate our functionings and transfer payments .
why must we maintain this intermediate roof we call belgium , " the leader of the flemish nationalist party , bart de wever , told french daily le monde last month .
russia to block independence at un level meanwhile , russia stepped up its opposition tuesday by announcing that it would demand that the un security council annul any unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo .
" russia will of course demand the annulment of such a decision .

liz mohn leads family-run bertelsmann ag , the world 's fifth largest media conglomerate .
in an interview for dw-world.de 's chinese web site , she explained why love and respect are vital for global business success . dw-world.de : you 've spent a lot of time in china - what are your impressions ?
liz mohn : i am in awe of the chinese for making such an enormous economic leap .
it takes time to change a culture - you ca n't do it from one day to the next .
but they are really accomplishing a lot there .
it shows that the chinese people today are well educated .
without brains and talent , they could n't do it .
i also think the government learned they need to be careful about how to make people follow their ideas .
do germans see china 's economic growth and political importance as a challenge - or a threat ?
neither nor .
we have such a huge market in china .
it offers huge opportunities for both europe and china , not just on one side .
it is a unique experience .
there has n't been anything like it , any time since -lsb- world war ii -rsb- : that a whole world opens up , and we have the good fortune to experience it .
german chancellor angela merkel recently invited the dalai lama to visit germany , which has been hard on the relationship between china and germany .
what is your take on that ?
i think when different cultures come together , mistakes can be made on both sides .
in the christian religion , we say people should forgive .
without mistakes , we ca n't learn .
but i think different cultures do n't learn to understand each other overnight .
does bertelsmann have a long-term strategy in china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing once had bikes , now there are cars bertelsmann has been growing in china since 1995 and it is a market that we want to get into even more .
i think everything we do there is on a long-term basis .
there are so many questions you ca n't answer immediately .
things change so quickly with globalization .
bertelsmann has a long history .
what are you particularly proud of ?
we are the only media concern world-wide that is involved with so many different cultures .
when we went overseas , we respected the other cultures .
that was the strength of our company after the war .
despite the age of digitalization , statistics show germans still read a lot .
that is different in china though .
is your china strategy successful ?
as far as i know , the chinese like to read .
they are a cultured people .
but today people may be more likely to take an audio book , sure .
new times call for new measures .
i 'm amazed when i see the changes on the streets in china today .
how full they are with cars .
when i first started going to china , 12 or 13 years ago , it was bikes , then mopeds .
i found it fascinating to watch the changes - and i am amazed as how much they have achieved .
before china opened up to the west , people had little freedom .
now , young people are colorful .
they 've gotten more room to think , to live .
you claim that bertelsmann 's management culture relies on individuality and creativity .
how can we know that this is n't just lip service ?
after all , centralized leadership and hierarchy can be practical .
because without this management culture , bertelsmann would never have been as successful as it has been .
through our wartime experiences , and before the war , we saw what it meant to have a dictatorship .
no freedom .
later we saw that if you give people freedom to be creative and to think , then they are motivated .
when you are fair to people , and respect them , then people come together and work together , and you get a great success .
you have worked alongside your husband -lrb- bertelsmann owner reinhard mohn -rrb- , and been increasingly active , for years .
what aspect of your own personality is visible in bertelsmann 's culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard mohn , now 85 , has handed much power to his wife first i think that it is important to teach basic values - love and respect .
and to know that it is important to give something to society , not just take .
now , china is starting to develop charitable foundations .
i find that great .
and citizens are starting to create businesses that also help society .
these are huge advances .
you 've said creating a management style is bertelsmann 's most important business tool , given globalization .
is that true ?
yes .
for example , from our headquarters , we can not simply order around one of our managers in china .
he has to use his own head , his own ideas .
but at the same time , he needs to keep in mind the greater goals for company are .
he needs to know … what kind of mental and spiritual orientation we have , our values .
what are some other challenges for bertelsmann ?
finding good talent .
people who can lead worldwide .
you have sometimes been called an " iron lady " - is this an accurate description ?
well , i would n't say i am " ironclad . "
i might say : you need to use power to get something done .
otherwise you do n't get anywhere in this world .
you need to have a goal , and bring people along with you .
what other qualities make a good business leader ?
i like dealing with people very much , and that 's why i like my job so much .
i get to dialog with people from all over the world .
and i see that the more i learn , the more i have the feeling that i know nothing at all .
your story - you were a telephone operator who has become the head of a fifth-generation business family - is widely known .
is your life really like a fairy tale ?
no .
the people who know me well , know that you never get to the top without discipline and hard work .
you just ca n't do it any other way .
you also have to make mistakes .
that is a burden .
i think i was fortunate to meet a man who both helped me come into more responsibility in this part of my life , and to experience what i do today .
next year we will have been married for 50 years .
that is a long time .
you still appreciate your husband so much after 50 years of marriage ?
that 's unusual these days .
he is a great businessman , a great person , a great philosopher , he is never arrogant , always humble .
he 's always working on behalf of the workers in our company , and many of our employees look up to him as an example . interview : zhu hong -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we are the only media concern world-wide that is involved with so many different cultures .
when we went overseas , we respected the other cultures .
that was the strength of our company after the war .
despite the age of digitalization , statistics show germans still read a lot .
that is different in china though .
is your china strategy successful ?
as far as i know , the chinese like to read .
they are a cultured people .
but today people may be more likely to take an audio book , sure .
new times call for new measures .
i 'm amazed when i see the changes on the streets in china today .
how full they are with cars .
when i first started going to china , 12 or 13 years ago , it was bikes , then mopeds .
i found it fascinating to watch the changes - and i am amazed as how much they have achieved .
before china opened up to the west , people had little freedom .
now , young people are colorful .
they 've gotten more room to think , to live .
you claim that bertelsmann 's management culture relies on individuality and creativity .
how can we know that this is n't just lip service ?
after all , centralized leadership and hierarchy can be practical .
because without this management culture , bertelsmann would never have been as successful as it has been .
through our wartime experiences , and before the war , we saw what it meant to have a dictatorship .
no freedom .
later we saw that if you give people freedom to be creative and to think , then they are motivated .
when you are fair to people , and respect them , then people come together and work together , and you get a great success .
you have worked alongside your husband -lrb- bertelsmann owner reinhard mohn -rrb- , and been increasingly active , for years .
what aspect of your own personality is visible in bertelsmann 's culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard mohn , now 85 , has handed much power to his wife first i think that it is important to teach basic values - love and respect .
and to know that it is important to give something to society , not just take .
now , china is starting to develop charitable foundations .
i find that great .
and citizens are starting to create businesses that also help society .
these are huge advances .
you 've said creating a management style is bertelsmann 's most important business tool , given globalization .
is that true ?
yes .
for example , from our headquarters , we can not simply order around one of our managers in china .
he has to use his own head , his own ideas .
but at the same time , he needs to keep in mind the greater goals for company are .
he needs to know … what kind of mental and spiritual orientation we have , our values .
what are some other challenges for bertelsmann ?
finding good talent .
people who can lead worldwide .
you have sometimes been called an " iron lady " - is this an accurate description ?
well , i would n't say i am " ironclad . "
i might say : you need to use power to get something done .
otherwise you do n't get anywhere in this world .
you need to have a goal , and bring people along with you .
what other qualities make a good business leader ?
i like dealing with people very much , and that 's why i like my job so much .
i get to dialog with people from all over the world .
and i see that the more i learn , the more i have the feeling that i know nothing at all .
your story - you were a telephone operator who has become the head of a fifth-generation business family - is widely known .
is your life really like a fairy tale ?
no .
the people who know me well , know that you never get to the top without discipline and hard work .
you just ca n't do it any other way .
you also have to make mistakes .
that is a burden .
i think i was fortunate to meet a man who both helped me come into more responsibility in this part of my life , and to experience what i do today .
next year we will have been married for 50 years .
that is a long time .
you still appreciate your husband so much after 50 years of marriage ?
that 's unusual these days .
he is a great businessman , a great person , a great philosopher , he is never arrogant , always humble .
he 's always working on behalf of the workers in our company , and many of our employees look up to him as an example . interview : zhu hong -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

liz mohn leads family-run bertelsmann ag , the world 's fifth largest media conglomerate .
in an interview for dw-world.de 's chinese web site , she explained why love and respect are vital for global business success . dw-world.de : you 've spent a lot of time in china - what are your impressions ?
liz mohn : i am in awe of the chinese for making such an enormous economic leap .
it takes time to change a culture - you ca n't do it from one day to the next .
but they are really accomplishing a lot there .
it shows that the chinese people today are well educated .
without brains and talent , they could n't do it .
i also think the government learned they need to be careful about how to make people follow their ideas .
do germans see china 's economic growth and political importance as a challenge - or a threat ?
neither nor .
we have such a huge market in china .
it offers huge opportunities for both europe and china , not just on one side .
it is a unique experience .
there has n't been anything like it , any time since -lsb- world war ii -rsb- : that a whole world opens up , and we have the good fortune to experience it .
german chancellor angela merkel recently invited the dalai lama to visit germany , which has been hard on the relationship between china and germany .
what is your take on that ?
i think when different cultures come together , mistakes can be made on both sides .
in the christian religion , we say people should forgive .
without mistakes , we ca n't learn .
but i think different cultures do n't learn to understand each other overnight .
does bertelsmann have a long-term strategy in china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing once had bikes , now there are cars bertelsmann has been growing in china since 1995 and it is a market that we want to get into even more .
i think everything we do there is on a long-term basis .
there are so many questions you ca n't answer immediately .
things change so quickly with globalization .
bertelsmann has a long history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the world 's greatest challenge germany : allowances for co2 emissions during nuke phase-out german environment minister calls off biofuel plans cebit features green computing possibilities eu wants to set pace in protecting environment auto industry -pipe- 11.12.2007 experts split on best way to get cleaner cars on europe 's roads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those old cars may be cool , but many of them are also dirty europeans are struggling to find the best way to get high-pollutant cars off the streets .
while some countries bank on cash incentives , some german car experts believe there are better ways to go . the auto industry has plenty to lose sleep over .
not only is public discourse over the new dirty word " co2 " laying on pressure for change , sales are down as well . the german association of the automotive industry announced last week that car sales have dropped 9 percent this year - a record year - naming consumers ' uncertainty over planned vehicle tax reform , climate concerns and the 3-percent sales tax increase last january . it 's not surprising , then , that a plan recently came under discussion that would theoretically solve both environmental and economic concerns : the government would pay drivers a premium for scrapping their old , pollutant vehicles - or at least taking them off the road - in the hope that they put the money into a new car . the carbon dioxide-based vehicle tax , which the german government is currently considering , would provide an incentive for the buyer to select a low-emissions vehicle .
scrapping premiums would come from the vehicle tax pot , thereby being paid for by heavy emitters . potential two-pronged benefit for scrapping premium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim of a premium is to get old cars off the road , not necessarily destroy them " on the one hand , old cars are taken off the market and new cars , which generally have lower emissions , enter the market .
secondly , business would experience a boom , at least in the short term , " said willi diez , director of the german automobile industry institute , of the plan his organization proposed last month . a similar , reportedly successful project in italy serves as a model .
there , consumers are paid 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,170 -rrb- and given a two-year vehicle tax exemption when they scrap their old cars and buy new ones with emissions rates of less than 140 grams per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- . the incentive has gotten 500,000 old cars off italy 's streets since it started in january , according to a report by germany 's motorzeitung.de.
diez predicted that , if a premium of 1,000 euros was introduced in germany , it could lead to an additional 250,000 cars sold , with at least as many taken off the road . car expert slams scrapping plan for ferdinand dudenhöffer , co-founder and director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- at the gelsenkirchen technical college , the premium to scrap cars sounds like a marketing ploy . " the car industry is n't an industry that needs subsidies , " said dudenhöffer .
" there are much better ways to get customers to buy new cars . " a driver could take the premium and buy a big gas-guzzler if he or she wanted to , added dudenhöffer , who did n't see the proposed tax-break of 50 to 100 euros for more ecologically sound cars as enough of an incentive .
as for the old polluter , it 's more likely to end up on the road in eastern europe than to get scrapped , he said . " and russian co2 is just like german co2 , " he said . emissions trading could help europe reach target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to reach an average 130 grams of co2 per kilometer driven by 2012 the auto expert has been an outspoken proponent of emissions trading as the best way to reduce co2 output across europe .
that scenario would have carmakers buy certificates from an independent exchange for every vehicle they produce with a co2 emissions rate of more than 130 grams per kilometer , and sell one back for every car under the emissions limit . ultimately , said dudenhöffer , the emissions trading plan would help europe attain the 130-gram-per vehicle average it is striving for by 2012 . by making high-emission cars more expensive than clean ones , the customer bears the financial burden . " environmental consciousness may be getting a bit stronger , but you have to assume that when i buy something i pay attention to my needs and not to my neighbor 's , " dudenhöffer said .
" that 's why it 's better not to leave the environmental decision to the consumer but to set prices for co2 that allow these emission goals to be reached . " the plan 's weakness , countered diez , is that it 's too difficult to come up with a basis of calculation to determine a price for the so-called emissions certificates .
emissions trading already exists in stationary industries like power plants , but he said he did n't consider it a practical option for the auto sector . co2-based vehicle tax coming soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who want to drive big cars will have to pay more for them diez conceded , however , that the scrapping premium has n't been well received .
while politicians worry about where the money will come from , carmakers fear that the temporary boom caused by it will be followed by a painful dip in sales . meanwhile , the german government is in the process of approving a law , to take effect in january 2009 , that would adjust the annual vehicle tax according to a new car 's co2 emission rate . while dudenhöffer called it a " german solution to a european problem , " the sliding tax plays a key role in diez 's scrapping premium .
since old cars would continue to be charged according to their cubic capacity , buyers of new low-emissions cars would benefit the most . german auto club adac said it strongly supports the vehicle tax reform - a plan it had suggested to the government already in 2004 . but there 's even another , perhaps simpler way to cut emissions that does n't involve government-initiated incentives : " driving style should n't be underestimated , " said an adac spokesman .
driving ecologically - not accelerating quickly , shifting early and avoiding traffic - can save 20 to 30 percent on gas , he said .
and less gas means fewer emissions . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 11.12.2007 opinion : medvedev will uphold putin 's legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president vladimir putin has chosen dmitry medvedev to stand as presidential candidate next march .
dw-world 's ingo mannteufel says the liberal technocrat will uphold putin 's political course - with or without him as pm . the guessing game is over .
for months now , russian politics have been dominated by the question of who will succeed russian president vladimir putin in march 2008 .
russian law prevents presidents from standing for a third term of office .
speculation was rife about putin 's next move .
one scenario put forward was that putin would alter the constitution .
another saw putin naming a stand-in president , then returning to office after having fulfilled the constitution 's technical requirements .
it was difficult to imagine russia being governed by another politician after eight years of putin .
medvedev certain to be elected the russian president has decided to back dmitry medvedev , first deputy prime minister and board chairman of gas giant gazprom , to stand as a presidential candidate in march 2008 .
given what happened in russian parliamentary poll in early december , it is practically certain that medvedev will be elected in the first round of the elections on march 2 .
the kremlin propaganda machine functions magnificently , the administrative apparatus runs smoothly , and the significant size of russian security forces remove any lingering doubt about the outcome of the poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel there is no point in bemoaning the poor prospects for democracy in russia in the light of such political relations .
the vague and possibly premature hopes for a rapid democratization of russia were snuffed out some time ago .
with his decision in favor of medvedev , president putin has made a bold move and answered a number of questions about himself and russia 's future course .
not just a fill-in president putin will step down as president in march 2008 .
the intention is that 42-year-old medvedev should be president for the next four years - in all likelihood much longer .
medvedev is completely unsuited to just act as a stand-in who would keep the presidential post warm for putin .
in this respect , putin has remained true to himself - in spite of what all his opponents and his sycophantic supporters have said .
after all , he always said he would not violate the constitution in order to remain in office .
however , the end of putin 's presidential era does not spell the end of putin as the leading light in russian politics .
he will retain considerable influence over russian politics as head of united russia , or possibly as prime minister .
we will have to wait and see if putin will take up medvedev 's offer to take on the job of pm under him .
at any rate , medvedev is not expected to usher in any decisive course change .
putin 's longstanding ally has always been directly involved from the outset in shaping and representing putin 's policies in his previous posts .
medvedev looks set to continue pursuing putin 's goal of modernizing russia because he shares his convictions .
the loyal technocrat is the ideal candidate to ensure that putin 's course is maintained without the current president having to resort to any trickery with the constitution .
past will burden relations with europe president medvedev will be blemished by the fact that he has emerged from putin 's powerhouse .
his previous role as chair of the board at gazprom will also not help his popularity in europe given the poor image of the russia energy giant here .
on the other hand , medvedev is not the worst candidate from amongst the current russian elite .
the former law professor from st. petersburg is reputed to be one of the more liberal spirits in the kremlin .
in addition , he has no direct contacts to the soviet or the post-soviet security services .
and given his relative youth , he also stands for a new russia that europe - and the west in general - will have to learn to live with .
the russian president 's decision to select medvedev is not likely to find favor with all of the factions who putin can currently rally behind him .
the effects of a change in president in terms of who has what access to important financial and business resources are not likely to be clear for a while , and the process will not be without its tensions .
the question is whether the first cracks within russia 's kremlin elite will already have become apparent ahead of the elections in march , thus threatening the transfer of power .
then things could get tricky for putin as the one responsible for naming medvedev his political heir .

dw-world.de putin endorses loyalist medvedev as presidential candidate russian president vladimir putin has backed his ally dimitry medvedev to succeed him next march .
the fact that medvedev 's not a member of putin 's party makes it even more likely that he 'll become russia 's next leader .
-lrb- 10.12.2007 -rrb- putin 's party wins russia elections amid vote-rigging claims vladimir putin 's united russia party won a landslide majority in parliamentary elections , but opposition parties , observers and western nations have criticized the lack of transparency in the election .

but experts on the country say there 's little need to fear the kremlin 's long-term plans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the world 's greatest challenge germany : allowances for co2 emissions during nuke phase-out german environment minister calls off biofuel plans cebit features green computing possibilities eu wants to set pace in protecting environment auto industry -pipe- 11.12.2007 experts split on best way to get cleaner cars on europe 's roads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those old cars may be cool , but many of them are also dirty europeans are struggling to find the best way to get high-pollutant cars off the streets .
while some countries bank on cash incentives , some german car experts believe there are better ways to go . the auto industry has plenty to lose sleep over .
not only is public discourse over the new dirty word " co2 " laying on pressure for change , sales are down as well . the german association of the automotive industry announced last week that car sales have dropped 9 percent this year - a record year - naming consumers ' uncertainty over planned vehicle tax reform , climate concerns and the 3-percent sales tax increase last january . it 's not surprising , then , that a plan recently came under discussion that would theoretically solve both environmental and economic concerns : the government would pay drivers a premium for scrapping their old , pollutant vehicles - or at least taking them off the road - in the hope that they put the money into a new car . the carbon dioxide-based vehicle tax , which the german government is currently considering , would provide an incentive for the buyer to select a low-emissions vehicle .
scrapping premiums would come from the vehicle tax pot , thereby being paid for by heavy emitters . potential two-pronged benefit for scrapping premium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim of a premium is to get old cars off the road , not necessarily destroy them " on the one hand , old cars are taken off the market and new cars , which generally have lower emissions , enter the market .
secondly , business would experience a boom , at least in the short term , " said willi diez , director of the german automobile industry institute , of the plan his organization proposed last month . a similar , reportedly successful project in italy serves as a model .
there , consumers are paid 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,170 -rrb- and given a two-year vehicle tax exemption when they scrap their old cars and buy new ones with emissions rates of less than 140 grams per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- . the incentive has gotten 500,000 old cars off italy 's streets since it started in january , according to a report by germany 's motorzeitung.de.
diez predicted that , if a premium of 1,000 euros was introduced in germany , it could lead to an additional 250,000 cars sold , with at least as many taken off the road . car expert slams scrapping plan for ferdinand dudenhöffer , co-founder and director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- at the gelsenkirchen technical college , the premium to scrap cars sounds like a marketing ploy . " the car industry is n't an industry that needs subsidies , " said dudenhöffer .
" there are much better ways to get customers to buy new cars . " a driver could take the premium and buy a big gas-guzzler if he or she wanted to , added dudenhöffer , who did n't see the proposed tax-break of 50 to 100 euros for more ecologically sound cars as enough of an incentive .
as for the old polluter , it 's more likely to end up on the road in eastern europe than to get scrapped , he said . " and russian co2 is just like german co2 , " he said . emissions trading could help europe reach target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to reach an average 130 grams of co2 per kilometer driven by 2012 the auto expert has been an outspoken proponent of emissions trading as the best way to reduce co2 output across europe .
that scenario would have carmakers buy certificates from an independent exchange for every vehicle they produce with a co2 emissions rate of more than 130 grams per kilometer , and sell one back for every car under the emissions limit . ultimately , said dudenhöffer , the emissions trading plan would help europe attain the 130-gram-per vehicle average it is striving for by 2012 . by making high-emission cars more expensive than clean ones , the customer bears the financial burden . " environmental consciousness may be getting a bit stronger , but you have to assume that when i buy something i pay attention to my needs and not to my neighbor 's , " dudenhöffer said .
" that 's why it 's better not to leave the environmental decision to the consumer but to set prices for co2 that allow these emission goals to be reached . " the plan 's weakness , countered diez , is that it 's too difficult to come up with a basis of calculation to determine a price for the so-called emissions certificates .
emissions trading already exists in stationary industries like power plants , but he said he did n't consider it a practical option for the auto sector . co2-based vehicle tax coming soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who want to drive big cars will have to pay more for them diez conceded , however , that the scrapping premium has n't been well received .
while politicians worry about where the money will come from , carmakers fear that the temporary boom caused by it will be followed by a painful dip in sales . meanwhile , the german government is in the process of approving a law , to take effect in january 2009 , that would adjust the annual vehicle tax according to a new car 's co2 emission rate . while dudenhöffer called it a " german solution to a european problem , " the sliding tax plays a key role in diez 's scrapping premium .
since old cars would continue to be charged according to their cubic capacity , buyers of new low-emissions cars would benefit the most . german auto club adac said it strongly supports the vehicle tax reform - a plan it had suggested to the government already in 2004 . but there 's even another , perhaps simpler way to cut emissions that does n't involve government-initiated incentives : " driving style should n't be underestimated , " said an adac spokesman .
driving ecologically - not accelerating quickly , shifting early and avoiding traffic - can save 20 to 30 percent on gas , he said .
and less gas means fewer emissions . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor angela merkel was all ears .
but will talking about disagreements solve anything ? " there should be no taboo subjects , " tusk said at the press conference after the two-hour meeting with merkel in berlin on tuesday , dec .
11 .
" we are friends , and friends ca n't get themselves into a situation of not talking to one another . "
tusk 's tone stood in marked contrast to that of his conservative predecessor , jaroslav kaczynski , who often seemed to go out of his way to offend german sensibilities .
the more eu-friendly tusk defeated kaczynski in poland 's hotly contested national election in november .
merkel was keen to echo the theme of a new polish-german frankness and friendship .
" we 've pledged not dodge any problems , " merkel said .
" together we can get a lot accomplished . "
a problematic past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as per the schengen agreement , the german-polish border will be opened in 2008 tusk and merkel arranged to meet with czech prime minister mirek topolanek on dec .
21 to discuss the opening of borders between the three countries .
and they also addressed two of the most contentious issues dividing poland and germany .
one of them is how to remember the past and , specifically , a planned memorial in berlin to expellees during world war ii - including germans driven from their homes in poland .
many poles see the project as an attempt to revise history and lessen germany 's wartime culpability .
tusk said he favored treating the subject of expellees of all nationalities in a museum about world war ii to be built in the city of gdansk , which used to be part of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is no doubt happy to have a new counterpart in warsaw merkel asserted that a museum could not replace the berlin memorial , but said that she supported the museum idea .
she also promised to send a delegation to warsaw to keep poland informed about the memorial and said germany had no interest in reviving past conflicts .
" there are no demands whatsoever for reparations from poland -lsb- to german refugees -rsb- , " merkel said .
" no german government is going to take a position that deviates from this . "
tusk said he welcomed the assurance as a " moment with symbolic value . "
a present pipeline merkel also discussed the natural-gas pipeline to be built under the baltic sea , which would connect germany with russia but bypass poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic pipeline remains a major sticking point tusk suggested that a meeting be arranged between the three countries to discuss the project in its current form .
such a meeting , he said , could bring about " positive corrections on both sides . "
the pipeline , which was negotiated by merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , has angered many poles , who worry about being held hostage on energy policy by russia and feel they have been ignored by their more powerful neighbors .
clearly , much work needs to be done to resolve such conflicts of interest , but tusk 's visit did re-establish a more civil tone between germany and poland .
he and merkel will have a chance to continue their open exchanges when they meet in the eastern german city of zittau in 10 days ' time . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 , for a grand-scale world war ii museum in the northern polish city of gdansk , the site of the nazi invasion on sept .
1 , 1939 . other countries , including germany , russia and israel could have a part in the museum , which was proposed as an alternative to a plan for an exhibition in berlin to remember german expellees from central and eastern europe during and just after world war ii . in the large gdansk museum , " the fate of expellees would have a place in a conclusive and comprehensive context , " said tusk in an interview with the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . the coastal city of gdansk , located on the baltic sea , is ripe with symbolic meaning . " the war began here , but in a sense it also ended here when the solidarity movement was founded in 1980 , " tusk said . started by polish laborers under lech walesa , solidarity , or solidarnosc , played a key role in the fall of communism in the former east-bloc country . berlin adamant about expulsion center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk became prime minister last month in response , the german government made it clear that tusk 's statement would have no bearing on plans for the expulsion center .
the governing coalition agreed in their founding contract in 2005 to set up a " visible sign of remembrance against expulsion " in berlin , said government spokesman thomas steg . the conflict began some seven years ago when the league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- started a foundation for a proposed expellee center .
the organization , which campaigns for the rights and remembrance of ethnic german expellees , has been seen in poland as overstating german suffering surrounding the holocaust . " the problem is not that anyone wants to prevent the germans from remembering the suffering of their own people , " tusk said .
" it becomes problematic when this remembrance of the german suffering diminishes another memory - namely that of the collective responsibility of the germans . " points of contention on tusk-merkel agenda the question of remembrance is likely to be a major agenda point when tusk meets with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin on tuesday . the two leaders are also slated to broach the ongoing issue of restitution claims for german expellees and re-settlers . the prussian claims society submitted claims for 22 individual claims cases to the european court for human rights in strasbourg in 2006 , requesting the return of land and property in present-day poland to ethnic germans who were forced out of their homes during the war . several more cases have been submitted since then , and still others are being reviewed in polish courts . " the german government has to take responsibility for the possible financial consequences arising from the compensation claims , " tusk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should expelled german be compensated for what they lost ?
berlin has maintained repeatedly that it does n't support such claims , with then german chancellor gerhard schröder making a binding statement to that effect in warsaw in 2004 . according to german estimates , some 15 million ethnic germans were expelled from their homes during or directly following the war .
some two million are thought to have died in the process . poland fears pipeline puts gas supply at risk plans for a joint russian-german gas pipeline along the baltic sea will be another matter of discussion at tuesday 's meeting . currently , russia sends gas to western europe via poland , but the baltic sea pipeline would circumvent the central european country .
poland has expressed concern that , in a political crisis , russia could shut its gas supply without affecting delivery to - and , hence , relations with - western europe . ahead of tuesday 's talks , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed optimism over the future of bilateral relations . " a concrete program to improve cooperation between the governments is being worked on , " he told the polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza on monday .

chancellor angela merkel was all ears .
but will talking about disagreements solve anything ? " there should be no taboo subjects , " tusk said at the press conference after the two-hour meeting with merkel in berlin on tuesday , dec .
11 .
" we are friends , and friends ca n't get themselves into a situation of not talking to one another . "
tusk 's tone stood in marked contrast to that of his conservative predecessor , jaroslav kaczynski , who often seemed to go out of his way to offend german sensibilities .
the more eu-friendly tusk defeated kaczynski in poland 's hotly contested national election in november .
merkel was keen to echo the theme of a new polish-german frankness and friendship .
" we 've pledged not dodge any problems , " merkel said .
" together we can get a lot accomplished . "
a problematic past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as per the schengen agreement , the german-polish border will be opened in 2008 tusk and merkel arranged to meet with czech prime minister mirek topolanek on dec .
21 to discuss the opening of borders between the three countries .
and they also addressed two of the most contentious issues dividing poland and germany .
one of them is how to remember the past and , specifically , a planned memorial in berlin to expellees during world war ii - including germans driven from their homes in poland .
many poles see the project as an attempt to revise history and lessen germany 's wartime culpability .
tusk said he favored treating the subject of expellees of all nationalities in a museum about world war ii to be built in the city of gdansk , which used to be part of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is no doubt happy to have a new counterpart in warsaw merkel asserted that a museum could not replace the berlin memorial , but said that she supported the museum idea .
she also promised to send a delegation to warsaw to keep poland informed about the memorial and said germany had no interest in reviving past conflicts .
" there are no demands whatsoever for reparations from poland -lsb- to german refugees -rsb- , " merkel said .
" no german government is going to take a position that deviates from this . "
tusk said he welcomed the assurance as a " moment with symbolic value . "
a present pipeline merkel also discussed the natural-gas pipeline to be built under the baltic sea , which would connect germany with russia but bypass poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic pipeline remains a major sticking point tusk suggested that a meeting be arranged between the three countries to discuss the project in its current form .
such a meeting , he said , could bring about " positive corrections on both sides . "
the pipeline , which was negotiated by merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , has angered many poles , who worry about being held hostage on energy policy by russia and feel they have been ignored by their more powerful neighbors .
clearly , much work needs to be done to resolve such conflicts of interest , but tusk 's visit did re-establish a more civil tone between germany and poland .
he and merkel will have a chance to continue their open exchanges when they meet in the eastern german city of zittau in 10 days ' time . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor angela merkel was all ears .
but will talking about disagreements solve anything ? " there should be no taboo subjects , " tusk said at the press conference after the two-hour meeting with merkel in berlin on tuesday , dec .
11 .
" we are friends , and friends ca n't get themselves into a situation of not talking to one another . "
tusk 's tone stood in marked contrast to that of his conservative predecessor , jaroslav kaczynski , who often seemed to go out of his way to offend german sensibilities .
the more eu-friendly tusk defeated kaczynski in poland 's hotly contested national election in november .
merkel was keen to echo the theme of a new polish-german frankness and friendship .
" we 've pledged not dodge any problems , " merkel said .
" together we can get a lot accomplished . "
a problematic past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as per the schengen agreement , the german-polish border will be opened in 2008 tusk and merkel arranged to meet with czech prime minister mirek topolanek on dec .
21 to discuss the opening of borders between the three countries .
and they also addressed two of the most contentious issues dividing poland and germany .
one of them is how to remember the past and , specifically , a planned memorial in berlin to expellees during world war ii - including germans driven from their homes in poland .
many poles see the project as an attempt to revise history and lessen germany 's wartime culpability .
tusk said he favored treating the subject of expellees of all nationalities in a museum about world war ii to be built in the city of gdansk , which used to be part of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is no doubt happy to have a new counterpart in warsaw merkel asserted that a museum could not replace the berlin memorial , but said that she supported the museum idea .
she also promised to send a delegation to warsaw to keep poland informed about the memorial and said germany had no interest in reviving past conflicts .
" there are no demands whatsoever for reparations from poland -lsb- to german refugees -rsb- , " merkel said .
" no german government is going to take a position that deviates from this . "
tusk said he welcomed the assurance as a " moment with symbolic value . "
a present pipeline merkel also discussed the natural-gas pipeline to be built under the baltic sea , which would connect germany with russia but bypass poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic pipeline remains a major sticking point tusk suggested that a meeting be arranged between the three countries to discuss the project in its current form .
such a meeting , he said , could bring about " positive corrections on both sides . "
the pipeline , which was negotiated by merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , has angered many poles , who worry about being held hostage on energy policy by russia and feel they have been ignored by their more powerful neighbors .
clearly , much work needs to be done to resolve such conflicts of interest , but tusk 's visit did re-establish a more civil tone between germany and poland .
he and merkel will have a chance to continue their open exchanges when they meet in the eastern german city of zittau in 10 days ' time . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while some countries bank on cash incentives , some german car experts believe there are better ways to go . the auto industry has plenty to lose sleep over .
not only is public discourse over the new dirty word " co2 " laying on pressure for change , sales are down as well . the german association of the automotive industry announced last week that car sales have dropped 9 percent this year - a record year - naming consumers ' uncertainty over planned vehicle tax reform , climate concerns and the 3-percent sales tax increase last january . it 's not surprising , then , that a plan recently came under discussion that would theoretically solve both environmental and economic concerns : the government would pay drivers a premium for scrapping their old , pollutant vehicles - or at least taking them off the road - in the hope that they put the money into a new car . the carbon dioxide-based vehicle tax , which the german government is currently considering , would provide an incentive for the buyer to select a low-emissions vehicle .
scrapping premiums would come from the vehicle tax pot , thereby being paid for by heavy emitters . potential two-pronged benefit for scrapping premium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim of a premium is to get old cars off the road , not necessarily destroy them " on the one hand , old cars are taken off the market and new cars , which generally have lower emissions , enter the market .
secondly , business would experience a boom , at least in the short term , " said willi diez , director of the german automobile industry institute , of the plan his organization proposed last month . a similar , reportedly successful project in italy serves as a model .
there , consumers are paid 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,170 -rrb- and given a two-year vehicle tax exemption when they scrap their old cars and buy new ones with emissions rates of less than 140 grams per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- . the incentive has gotten 500,000 old cars off italy 's streets since it started in january , according to a report by germany 's motorzeitung.de.
diez predicted that , if a premium of 1,000 euros was introduced in germany , it could lead to an additional 250,000 cars sold , with at least as many taken off the road . car expert slams scrapping plan for ferdinand dudenhöffer , co-founder and director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- at the gelsenkirchen technical college , the premium to scrap cars sounds like a marketing ploy . " the car industry is n't an industry that needs subsidies , " said dudenhöffer .
" there are much better ways to get customers to buy new cars . " a driver could take the premium and buy a big gas-guzzler if he or she wanted to , added dudenhöffer , who did n't see the proposed tax-break of 50 to 100 euros for more ecologically sound cars as enough of an incentive .
as for the old polluter , it 's more likely to end up on the road in eastern europe than to get scrapped , he said . " and russian co2 is just like german co2 , " he said . emissions trading could help europe reach target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to reach an average 130 grams of co2 per kilometer driven by 2012 the auto expert has been an outspoken proponent of emissions trading as the best way to reduce co2 output across europe .
that scenario would have carmakers buy certificates from an independent exchange for every vehicle they produce with a co2 emissions rate of more than 130 grams per kilometer , and sell one back for every car under the emissions limit . ultimately , said dudenhöffer , the emissions trading plan would help europe attain the 130-gram-per vehicle average it is striving for by 2012 . by making high-emission cars more expensive than clean ones , the customer bears the financial burden . " environmental consciousness may be getting a bit stronger , but you have to assume that when i buy something i pay attention to my needs and not to my neighbor 's , " dudenhöffer said .
" that 's why it 's better not to leave the environmental decision to the consumer but to set prices for co2 that allow these emission goals to be reached . " the plan 's weakness , countered diez , is that it 's too difficult to come up with a basis of calculation to determine a price for the so-called emissions certificates .
emissions trading already exists in stationary industries like power plants , but he said he did n't consider it a practical option for the auto sector . co2-based vehicle tax coming soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who want to drive big cars will have to pay more for them diez conceded , however , that the scrapping premium has n't been well received .
while politicians worry about where the money will come from , carmakers fear that the temporary boom caused by it will be followed by a painful dip in sales . meanwhile , the german government is in the process of approving a law , to take effect in january 2009 , that would adjust the annual vehicle tax according to a new car 's co2 emission rate . while dudenhöffer called it a " german solution to a european problem , " the sliding tax plays a key role in diez 's scrapping premium .
since old cars would continue to be charged according to their cubic capacity , buyers of new low-emissions cars would benefit the most . german auto club adac said it strongly supports the vehicle tax reform - a plan it had suggested to the government already in 2004 . but there 's even another , perhaps simpler way to cut emissions that does n't involve government-initiated incentives : " driving style should n't be underestimated , " said an adac spokesman .
driving ecologically - not accelerating quickly , shifting early and avoiding traffic - can save 20 to 30 percent on gas , he said .
and less gas means fewer emissions . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 11.12.2007 russian presidential candidate offers putin premiership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev has been behind putin 's rise to power and has earned his endorsement the man endorsed by russian president vladimir putin to stand as his successor in march 's presidential elections has said putin should take up the job of prime minister after stepping down . dmitry medvedev , currently first deputy prime minister and supervisory board chairman of energy giant gazprom , declared that he would stand for president next year in a televised address on tuesday , dec 11 . in a surprise statement he added : " i consider it of utmost importance for our country to keep vladimir vladimorovich putin in the highest post of executive power , the post of head of government of the russian federation . " within 24 hours , russia appears to have ended months of speculation over the country 's political future . putin has not yet given his response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin will retain some power after stepping down in march in a televised speech following medvedev 's surprise statement , putin did not comment on this suggestion and no timeframe was suggested for the switch .
but putin has long said that he wanted to retain an important role after leaving the kremlin . analyst vyacheslav nikonov told the interfax news agency : " if medvedev announced it , then the likelihood is that it will take place .

the ban encompasses not only guns and knives , but baseball bats as well .
some say that 's not going far enough . the law is based on federal legislation , passed earlier this year , allowing local states to prohibit items that can be used to endanger public safety - including fake guns .
hamburg took the lead in pushing for such legislation and is the first state within germany to enact a prohibition on the local level .
the ban covers air rifles , billy clubs , brass knuckles , baseball bats , pepper spray and most forms of mace .
carrying any of those items in the neighborhoods affected by the law can be punished with a fine of up to 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,700 -rrb- .

the ban encompasses not only guns and knives , but baseball bats as well .
some say that 's not going far enough . the law is based on federal legislation , passed earlier this year , allowing local states to prohibit items that can be used to endanger public safety - including fake guns .
hamburg took the lead in pushing for such legislation and is the first state within germany to enact a prohibition on the local level .
the ban covers air rifles , billy clubs , brass knuckles , baseball bats , pepper spray and most forms of mace .
carrying any of those items in the neighborhoods affected by the law can be punished with a fine of up to 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,700 -rrb- .

" by changing the laws we finally have the possibility of reigning in violence in areas that are especially at risk . "
criminal gangs are active on the reeperbahn , and knife fights and attacks with dangerous items occur with relative frequency .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's reeperbahn is a popular attraction - despite crime rates hamburg 's governing conservatives and police hope the bans will reduce violent crime in troubled neighborhoods .
but not everyone likes the prohibition in its current form .
green party parliamentary and interior affairs experts antje möller has called for the ban to be extended to the entire city .

" it ca n't be the case that you 're not allowed to carry weapons , but trading in them is publicly accepted , " möller told the german public broadcaster ndr .
others question whether the ban will have any practical affect .
" anyone serious bent on robbing , raping or murdering others is n't interested in legislation - and certainly not in weapons legislation , " wrote one blogger on the german internet news site shortnews .

the expected declaration of independence by kosovo has a number of nations on edge .
those who oppose kosovo 's autonomy harbor separatists of their own .
a free kosovo could be just the rallying call these movements need . with all the signs pointing towards a declaration of independence from kosovo after the un-set deadline for reaching a settlement passes on monday , the european union is bracing itself for a wave of renewed calls for autonomy from separatist movements across europe .
if kosovo declares independence from serbia , it will set a powerful precedent for movements from spain to scotland , all wanting to rewrite the map of europe and form their own independent states , according to experts .
" there is a real risk that the quasi-dogma of the intangibility of borders which has existed since the end of the world war ii will fall , " french political scientist jean-yves camus of the paris-based iris institute told afp .
" this would benefit movements which seek to rewrite the map of europe based on ethnic , linguistic or cultural criteria , " added camus , a specialist on separatist movements in europe .
the emergence of similar lifestyles and english as a common language in europe , combined with the disappearance of borders and the lack of democratic legitimacy of eu bodies , had fueled " the development of micro-distinctive identities , " said camus .
while kosovo 's ethnic majority leaders have vowed not to unilaterally declare independence from serbia without us and european union approval , they are expected to announce their intentions to form a new state in early 2008 .
opposition includes fear of own breakaway states many of the countries which oppose the creation of an independent state of kosovo have at least one separatist movement working towards autonomy within their own borders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has been fighting chechen separatists for years serbia 's ally russia , which leads the opposition , has problems with separatists in chechnya and the caucasus region while spain has had a long-running dispute with the armed eta movement .
other countries against kosovo 's independence such as cyprus and greece have ethnic minorities which demand more power .
" in the west , this -lsb- kosovo -rsb- solution will set off separatists in europe , ” russian president vladimir putin said in an interview published in french newspaper le figaro earlier this year . ” look at scotland , catalonia and the basque country . "
spain is currently experiencing a period of unease as its northern basque country and its wealthy northeastern region of catalonia have stepped up their demands for more autonomy .
last year catalan voters overwhelmingly backed a new charter which recognized the region as a " nation " within spain and grants it enhanced powers in taxation and judicial matters .
separatists claim eu structure makes autonomy possible as in other separatist regions of europe like flanders , the dutch-speaking northern part of belgium , and northern italy , supporters said catalonia deserved extra powers because it makes a bigger contribution to the economy .
the armed basque separatist group eta ended a 15-month ceasefire in june while the scottish national party , which came to power in may , plans to hold a referendum on independence in 2010 .

" europe can regulate our functionings and transfer payments .
why must we maintain this intermediate roof we call belgium , " the leader of the flemish nationalist party , bart de wever , told french daily le monde last month .
russia to block independence at un level meanwhile , russia stepped up its opposition tuesday by announcing that it would demand that the un security council annul any unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo .
" russia will of course demand the annulment of such a decision .
we will demand a meeting of the security council because it would be a violation of a council resolution , " russia 's interfax news agency quoted the country 's chief kosovo negotiator alexander botsan-kharchenko as saying . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the world 's greatest challenge germany : allowances for co2 emissions during nuke phase-out german environment minister calls off biofuel plans cebit features green computing possibilities eu wants to set pace in protecting environment auto industry -pipe- 11.12.2007 experts split on best way to get cleaner cars on europe 's roads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those old cars may be cool , but many of them are also dirty europeans are struggling to find the best way to get high-pollutant cars off the streets .
while some countries bank on cash incentives , some german car experts believe there are better ways to go . the auto industry has plenty to lose sleep over .
not only is public discourse over the new dirty word " co2 " laying on pressure for change , sales are down as well . the german association of the automotive industry announced last week that car sales have dropped 9 percent this year - a record year - naming consumers ' uncertainty over planned vehicle tax reform , climate concerns and the 3-percent sales tax increase last january . it 's not surprising , then , that a plan recently came under discussion that would theoretically solve both environmental and economic concerns : the government would pay drivers a premium for scrapping their old , pollutant vehicles - or at least taking them off the road - in the hope that they put the money into a new car . the carbon dioxide-based vehicle tax , which the german government is currently considering , would provide an incentive for the buyer to select a low-emissions vehicle .
scrapping premiums would come from the vehicle tax pot , thereby being paid for by heavy emitters . potential two-pronged benefit for scrapping premium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim of a premium is to get old cars off the road , not necessarily destroy them " on the one hand , old cars are taken off the market and new cars , which generally have lower emissions , enter the market .
secondly , business would experience a boom , at least in the short term , " said willi diez , director of the german automobile industry institute , of the plan his organization proposed last month . a similar , reportedly successful project in italy serves as a model .
there , consumers are paid 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,170 -rrb- and given a two-year vehicle tax exemption when they scrap their old cars and buy new ones with emissions rates of less than 140 grams per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- . the incentive has gotten 500,000 old cars off italy 's streets since it started in january , according to a report by germany 's motorzeitung.de.
diez predicted that , if a premium of 1,000 euros was introduced in germany , it could lead to an additional 250,000 cars sold , with at least as many taken off the road . car expert slams scrapping plan for ferdinand dudenhöffer , co-founder and director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- at the gelsenkirchen technical college , the premium to scrap cars sounds like a marketing ploy . " the car industry is n't an industry that needs subsidies , " said dudenhöffer .
" there are much better ways to get customers to buy new cars . " a driver could take the premium and buy a big gas-guzzler if he or she wanted to , added dudenhöffer , who did n't see the proposed tax-break of 50 to 100 euros for more ecologically sound cars as enough of an incentive .
as for the old polluter , it 's more likely to end up on the road in eastern europe than to get scrapped , he said . " and russian co2 is just like german co2 , " he said . emissions trading could help europe reach target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to reach an average 130 grams of co2 per kilometer driven by 2012 the auto expert has been an outspoken proponent of emissions trading as the best way to reduce co2 output across europe .
that scenario would have carmakers buy certificates from an independent exchange for every vehicle they produce with a co2 emissions rate of more than 130 grams per kilometer , and sell one back for every car under the emissions limit . ultimately , said dudenhöffer , the emissions trading plan would help europe attain the 130-gram-per vehicle average it is striving for by 2012 . by making high-emission cars more expensive than clean ones , the customer bears the financial burden . " environmental consciousness may be getting a bit stronger , but you have to assume that when i buy something i pay attention to my needs and not to my neighbor 's , " dudenhöffer said .
" that 's why it 's better not to leave the environmental decision to the consumer but to set prices for co2 that allow these emission goals to be reached . " the plan 's weakness , countered diez , is that it 's too difficult to come up with a basis of calculation to determine a price for the so-called emissions certificates .
emissions trading already exists in stationary industries like power plants , but he said he did n't consider it a practical option for the auto sector . co2-based vehicle tax coming soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who want to drive big cars will have to pay more for them diez conceded , however , that the scrapping premium has n't been well received .
while politicians worry about where the money will come from , carmakers fear that the temporary boom caused by it will be followed by a painful dip in sales . meanwhile , the german government is in the process of approving a law , to take effect in january 2009 , that would adjust the annual vehicle tax according to a new car 's co2 emission rate . while dudenhöffer called it a " german solution to a european problem , " the sliding tax plays a key role in diez 's scrapping premium .
since old cars would continue to be charged according to their cubic capacity , buyers of new low-emissions cars would benefit the most . german auto club adac said it strongly supports the vehicle tax reform - a plan it had suggested to the government already in 2004 . but there 's even another , perhaps simpler way to cut emissions that does n't involve government-initiated incentives : " driving style should n't be underestimated , " said an adac spokesman .
driving ecologically - not accelerating quickly , shifting early and avoiding traffic - can save 20 to 30 percent on gas , he said .
and less gas means fewer emissions . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the world 's greatest challenge germany : allowances for co2 emissions during nuke phase-out german environment minister calls off biofuel plans cebit features green computing possibilities eu wants to set pace in protecting environment auto industry -pipe- 11.12.2007 experts split on best way to get cleaner cars on europe 's roads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those old cars may be cool , but many of them are also dirty europeans are struggling to find the best way to get high-pollutant cars off the streets .
while some countries bank on cash incentives , some german car experts believe there are better ways to go . the auto industry has plenty to lose sleep over .
not only is public discourse over the new dirty word " co2 " laying on pressure for change , sales are down as well . the german association of the automotive industry announced last week that car sales have dropped 9 percent this year - a record year - naming consumers ' uncertainty over planned vehicle tax reform , climate concerns and the 3-percent sales tax increase last january . it 's not surprising , then , that a plan recently came under discussion that would theoretically solve both environmental and economic concerns : the government would pay drivers a premium for scrapping their old , pollutant vehicles - or at least taking them off the road - in the hope that they put the money into a new car . the carbon dioxide-based vehicle tax , which the german government is currently considering , would provide an incentive for the buyer to select a low-emissions vehicle .
scrapping premiums would come from the vehicle tax pot , thereby being paid for by heavy emitters . potential two-pronged benefit for scrapping premium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim of a premium is to get old cars off the road , not necessarily destroy them " on the one hand , old cars are taken off the market and new cars , which generally have lower emissions , enter the market .
secondly , business would experience a boom , at least in the short term , " said willi diez , director of the german automobile industry institute , of the plan his organization proposed last month . a similar , reportedly successful project in italy serves as a model .
there , consumers are paid 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,170 -rrb- and given a two-year vehicle tax exemption when they scrap their old cars and buy new ones with emissions rates of less than 140 grams per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- . the incentive has gotten 500,000 old cars off italy 's streets since it started in january , according to a report by germany 's motorzeitung.de.
diez predicted that , if a premium of 1,000 euros was introduced in germany , it could lead to an additional 250,000 cars sold , with at least as many taken off the road . car expert slams scrapping plan for ferdinand dudenhöffer , co-founder and director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- at the gelsenkirchen technical college , the premium to scrap cars sounds like a marketing ploy . " the car industry is n't an industry that needs subsidies , " said dudenhöffer .
" there are much better ways to get customers to buy new cars . " a driver could take the premium and buy a big gas-guzzler if he or she wanted to , added dudenhöffer , who did n't see the proposed tax-break of 50 to 100 euros for more ecologically sound cars as enough of an incentive .
as for the old polluter , it 's more likely to end up on the road in eastern europe than to get scrapped , he said . " and russian co2 is just like german co2 , " he said . emissions trading could help europe reach target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to reach an average 130 grams of co2 per kilometer driven by 2012 the auto expert has been an outspoken proponent of emissions trading as the best way to reduce co2 output across europe .
that scenario would have carmakers buy certificates from an independent exchange for every vehicle they produce with a co2 emissions rate of more than 130 grams per kilometer , and sell one back for every car under the emissions limit . ultimately , said dudenhöffer , the emissions trading plan would help europe attain the 130-gram-per vehicle average it is striving for by 2012 . by making high-emission cars more expensive than clean ones , the customer bears the financial burden . " environmental consciousness may be getting a bit stronger , but you have to assume that when i buy something i pay attention to my needs and not to my neighbor 's , " dudenhöffer said .
" that 's why it 's better not to leave the environmental decision to the consumer but to set prices for co2 that allow these emission goals to be reached . " the plan 's weakness , countered diez , is that it 's too difficult to come up with a basis of calculation to determine a price for the so-called emissions certificates .
emissions trading already exists in stationary industries like power plants , but he said he did n't consider it a practical option for the auto sector . co2-based vehicle tax coming soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who want to drive big cars will have to pay more for them diez conceded , however , that the scrapping premium has n't been well received .
while politicians worry about where the money will come from , carmakers fear that the temporary boom caused by it will be followed by a painful dip in sales . meanwhile , the german government is in the process of approving a law , to take effect in january 2009 , that would adjust the annual vehicle tax according to a new car 's co2 emission rate . while dudenhöffer called it a " german solution to a european problem , " the sliding tax plays a key role in diez 's scrapping premium .
since old cars would continue to be charged according to their cubic capacity , buyers of new low-emissions cars would benefit the most . german auto club adac said it strongly supports the vehicle tax reform - a plan it had suggested to the government already in 2004 . but there 's even another , perhaps simpler way to cut emissions that does n't involve government-initiated incentives : " driving style should n't be underestimated , " said an adac spokesman .
driving ecologically - not accelerating quickly , shifting early and avoiding traffic - can save 20 to 30 percent on gas , he said .

dw-world 's ingo mannteufel says the liberal technocrat will uphold putin 's political course - with or without him as pm . the guessing game is over .
for months now , russian politics have been dominated by the question of who will succeed russian president vladimir putin in march 2008 .
russian law prevents presidents from standing for a third term of office .
speculation was rife about putin 's next move .

dw-world 's ingo mannteufel says the liberal technocrat will uphold putin 's political course - with or without him as pm . the guessing game is over .
for months now , russian politics have been dominated by the question of who will succeed russian president vladimir putin in march 2008 .
russian law prevents presidents from standing for a third term of office .
speculation was rife about putin 's next move .
one scenario put forward was that putin would alter the constitution .
another saw putin naming a stand-in president , then returning to office after having fulfilled the constitution 's technical requirements .
it was difficult to imagine russia being governed by another politician after eight years of putin .
medvedev certain to be elected the russian president has decided to back dmitry medvedev , first deputy prime minister and board chairman of gas giant gazprom , to stand as a presidential candidate in march 2008 .
given what happened in russian parliamentary poll in early december , it is practically certain that medvedev will be elected in the first round of the elections on march 2 .
the kremlin propaganda machine functions magnificently , the administrative apparatus runs smoothly , and the significant size of russian security forces remove any lingering doubt about the outcome of the poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel there is no point in bemoaning the poor prospects for democracy in russia in the light of such political relations .
the vague and possibly premature hopes for a rapid democratization of russia were snuffed out some time ago .
with his decision in favor of medvedev , president putin has made a bold move and answered a number of questions about himself and russia 's future course .
not just a fill-in president putin will step down as president in march 2008 .
the intention is that 42-year-old medvedev should be president for the next four years - in all likelihood much longer .
medvedev is completely unsuited to just act as a stand-in who would keep the presidential post warm for putin .
in this respect , putin has remained true to himself - in spite of what all his opponents and his sycophantic supporters have said .
after all , he always said he would not violate the constitution in order to remain in office .

liz mohn leads family-run bertelsmann ag , the world 's fifth largest media conglomerate .
in an interview for dw-world.de 's chinese web site , she explained why love and respect are vital for global business success . dw-world.de : you 've spent a lot of time in china - what are your impressions ?
liz mohn : i am in awe of the chinese for making such an enormous economic leap .
it takes time to change a culture - you ca n't do it from one day to the next .
but they are really accomplishing a lot there .
it shows that the chinese people today are well educated .
without brains and talent , they could n't do it .
i also think the government learned they need to be careful about how to make people follow their ideas .
do germans see china 's economic growth and political importance as a challenge - or a threat ?
neither nor .
we have such a huge market in china .
it offers huge opportunities for both europe and china , not just on one side .
it is a unique experience .
there has n't been anything like it , any time since -lsb- world war ii -rsb- : that a whole world opens up , and we have the good fortune to experience it .
german chancellor angela merkel recently invited the dalai lama to visit germany , which has been hard on the relationship between china and germany .
what is your take on that ?
i think when different cultures come together , mistakes can be made on both sides .
in the christian religion , we say people should forgive .
without mistakes , we ca n't learn .
but i think different cultures do n't learn to understand each other overnight .
does bertelsmann have a long-term strategy in china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing once had bikes , now there are cars bertelsmann has been growing in china since 1995 and it is a market that we want to get into even more .
i think everything we do there is on a long-term basis .
there are so many questions you ca n't answer immediately .
things change so quickly with globalization .
bertelsmann has a long history .
what are you particularly proud of ?
we are the only media concern world-wide that is involved with so many different cultures .
when we went overseas , we respected the other cultures .
that was the strength of our company after the war .
despite the age of digitalization , statistics show germans still read a lot .
that is different in china though .
is your china strategy successful ?
as far as i know , the chinese like to read .
they are a cultured people .
but today people may be more likely to take an audio book , sure .
new times call for new measures .
i 'm amazed when i see the changes on the streets in china today .
how full they are with cars .
when i first started going to china , 12 or 13 years ago , it was bikes , then mopeds .
i found it fascinating to watch the changes - and i am amazed as how much they have achieved .
before china opened up to the west , people had little freedom .
now , young people are colorful .
they 've gotten more room to think , to live .
you claim that bertelsmann 's management culture relies on individuality and creativity .
how can we know that this is n't just lip service ?
after all , centralized leadership and hierarchy can be practical .
because without this management culture , bertelsmann would never have been as successful as it has been .
through our wartime experiences , and before the war , we saw what it meant to have a dictatorship .
no freedom .
later we saw that if you give people freedom to be creative and to think , then they are motivated .
when you are fair to people , and respect them , then people come together and work together , and you get a great success .
you have worked alongside your husband -lrb- bertelsmann owner reinhard mohn -rrb- , and been increasingly active , for years .
what aspect of your own personality is visible in bertelsmann 's culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard mohn , now 85 , has handed much power to his wife first i think that it is important to teach basic values - love and respect .
and to know that it is important to give something to society , not just take .
now , china is starting to develop charitable foundations .
i find that great .
and citizens are starting to create businesses that also help society .
these are huge advances .
you 've said creating a management style is bertelsmann 's most important business tool , given globalization .
is that true ?
yes .
for example , from our headquarters , we can not simply order around one of our managers in china .
he has to use his own head , his own ideas .
but at the same time , he needs to keep in mind the greater goals for company are .
he needs to know … what kind of mental and spiritual orientation we have , our values .
what are some other challenges for bertelsmann ?
finding good talent .
people who can lead worldwide .
you have sometimes been called an " iron lady " - is this an accurate description ?
well , i would n't say i am " ironclad . "
i might say : you need to use power to get something done .
otherwise you do n't get anywhere in this world .
you need to have a goal , and bring people along with you .
what other qualities make a good business leader ?
i like dealing with people very much , and that 's why i like my job so much .
i get to dialog with people from all over the world .
and i see that the more i learn , the more i have the feeling that i know nothing at all .
your story - you were a telephone operator who has become the head of a fifth-generation business family - is widely known .
is your life really like a fairy tale ?
no .
the people who know me well , know that you never get to the top without discipline and hard work .
you just ca n't do it any other way .
you also have to make mistakes .
that is a burden .
i think i was fortunate to meet a man who both helped me come into more responsibility in this part of my life , and to experience what i do today .
next year we will have been married for 50 years .
that is a long time .
you still appreciate your husband so much after 50 years of marriage ?
that 's unusual these days .
he is a great businessman , a great person , a great philosopher , he is never arrogant , always humble .
he 's always working on behalf of the workers in our company , and many of our employees look up to him as an example . interview : zhu hong -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

liz mohn leads family-run bertelsmann ag , the world 's fifth largest media conglomerate .
in an interview for dw-world.de 's chinese web site , she explained why love and respect are vital for global business success . dw-world.de : you 've spent a lot of time in china - what are your impressions ?
liz mohn : i am in awe of the chinese for making such an enormous economic leap .
it takes time to change a culture - you ca n't do it from one day to the next .
but they are really accomplishing a lot there .
it shows that the chinese people today are well educated .
without brains and talent , they could n't do it .
i also think the government learned they need to be careful about how to make people follow their ideas .
do germans see china 's economic growth and political importance as a challenge - or a threat ?
neither nor .
we have such a huge market in china .
it offers huge opportunities for both europe and china , not just on one side .
it is a unique experience .
there has n't been anything like it , any time since -lsb- world war ii -rsb- : that a whole world opens up , and we have the good fortune to experience it .
german chancellor angela merkel recently invited the dalai lama to visit germany , which has been hard on the relationship between china and germany .
what is your take on that ?
i think when different cultures come together , mistakes can be made on both sides .
in the christian religion , we say people should forgive .
without mistakes , we ca n't learn .
but i think different cultures do n't learn to understand each other overnight .
does bertelsmann have a long-term strategy in china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing once had bikes , now there are cars bertelsmann has been growing in china since 1995 and it is a market that we want to get into even more .
i think everything we do there is on a long-term basis .
there are so many questions you ca n't answer immediately .
things change so quickly with globalization .
bertelsmann has a long history .
what are you particularly proud of ?
we are the only media concern world-wide that is involved with so many different cultures .
when we went overseas , we respected the other cultures .
that was the strength of our company after the war .
despite the age of digitalization , statistics show germans still read a lot .
that is different in china though .
is your china strategy successful ?
as far as i know , the chinese like to read .
they are a cultured people .
but today people may be more likely to take an audio book , sure .
new times call for new measures .
i 'm amazed when i see the changes on the streets in china today .
how full they are with cars .
when i first started going to china , 12 or 13 years ago , it was bikes , then mopeds .
i found it fascinating to watch the changes - and i am amazed as how much they have achieved .
before china opened up to the west , people had little freedom .
now , young people are colorful .
they 've gotten more room to think , to live .
you claim that bertelsmann 's management culture relies on individuality and creativity .
how can we know that this is n't just lip service ?
after all , centralized leadership and hierarchy can be practical .
because without this management culture , bertelsmann would never have been as successful as it has been .
through our wartime experiences , and before the war , we saw what it meant to have a dictatorship .
no freedom .
later we saw that if you give people freedom to be creative and to think , then they are motivated .
when you are fair to people , and respect them , then people come together and work together , and you get a great success .
you have worked alongside your husband -lrb- bertelsmann owner reinhard mohn -rrb- , and been increasingly active , for years .
what aspect of your own personality is visible in bertelsmann 's culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard mohn , now 85 , has handed much power to his wife first i think that it is important to teach basic values - love and respect .
and to know that it is important to give something to society , not just take .
now , china is starting to develop charitable foundations .
i find that great .
and citizens are starting to create businesses that also help society .
these are huge advances .
you 've said creating a management style is bertelsmann 's most important business tool , given globalization .
is that true ?
yes .
for example , from our headquarters , we can not simply order around one of our managers in china .
he has to use his own head , his own ideas .
but at the same time , he needs to keep in mind the greater goals for company are .
he needs to know … what kind of mental and spiritual orientation we have , our values .
what are some other challenges for bertelsmann ?
finding good talent .
people who can lead worldwide .
you have sometimes been called an " iron lady " - is this an accurate description ?
well , i would n't say i am " ironclad . "
i might say : you need to use power to get something done .
otherwise you do n't get anywhere in this world .
you need to have a goal , and bring people along with you .
what other qualities make a good business leader ?
i like dealing with people very much , and that 's why i like my job so much .
i get to dialog with people from all over the world .
and i see that the more i learn , the more i have the feeling that i know nothing at all .
your story - you were a telephone operator who has become the head of a fifth-generation business family - is widely known .
is your life really like a fairy tale ?
no .
the people who know me well , know that you never get to the top without discipline and hard work .
you just ca n't do it any other way .
you also have to make mistakes .
that is a burden .
i think i was fortunate to meet a man who both helped me come into more responsibility in this part of my life , and to experience what i do today .
next year we will have been married for 50 years .
that is a long time .
you still appreciate your husband so much after 50 years of marriage ?
that 's unusual these days .
he is a great businessman , a great person , a great philosopher , he is never arrogant , always humble .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 11.12.2007 hamburg bans weapons in tough neighborhoods großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law goes way beyond traditional weaponry a new law aims to make hamburg 's red-light district , the reeperbahn , completely weapons free .
the ban encompasses not only guns and knives , but baseball bats as well .
some say that 's not going far enough . the law is based on federal legislation , passed earlier this year , allowing local states to prohibit items that can be used to endanger public safety - including fake guns .
hamburg took the lead in pushing for such legislation and is the first state within germany to enact a prohibition on the local level .
the ban covers air rifles , billy clubs , brass knuckles , baseball bats , pepper spray and most forms of mace .
carrying any of those items in the neighborhoods affected by the law can be punished with a fine of up to 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,700 -rrb- .
" this is a further element promoting the safety of people in our city , " hamburg 's interior minister , udo nagel , told the ap news agency .
" by changing the laws we finally have the possibility of reigning in violence in areas that are especially at risk . "
criminal gangs are active on the reeperbahn , and knife fights and attacks with dangerous items occur with relative frequency .
too little or waste of time ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's reeperbahn is a popular attraction - despite crime rates hamburg 's governing conservatives and police hope the bans will reduce violent crime in troubled neighborhoods .
but not everyone likes the prohibition in its current form .
green party parliamentary and interior affairs experts antje möller has called for the ban to be extended to the entire city .
she also says that something should be done about shops that sell the items concerned - of which there are a number on and near the reeperbahn .
" it ca n't be the case that you 're not allowed to carry weapons , but trading in them is publicly accepted , " möller told the german public broadcaster ndr .
others question whether the ban will have any practical affect .
" anyone serious bent on robbing , raping or murdering others is n't interested in legislation - and certainly not in weapons legislation , " wrote one blogger on the german internet news site shortnews .
it will take time to see if the weapons ban succeeds in reducing crime in hamburg .
in the meantime , anyone wanting a pick up game of baseball in the city should probably steer clear of the reeperbahn . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the world 's greatest challenge germany : allowances for co2 emissions during nuke phase-out german environment minister calls off biofuel plans cebit features green computing possibilities eu wants to set pace in protecting environment auto industry -pipe- 11.12.2007 experts split on best way to get cleaner cars on europe 's roads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those old cars may be cool , but many of them are also dirty europeans are struggling to find the best way to get high-pollutant cars off the streets .
while some countries bank on cash incentives , some german car experts believe there are better ways to go . the auto industry has plenty to lose sleep over .
not only is public discourse over the new dirty word " co2 " laying on pressure for change , sales are down as well . the german association of the automotive industry announced last week that car sales have dropped 9 percent this year - a record year - naming consumers ' uncertainty over planned vehicle tax reform , climate concerns and the 3-percent sales tax increase last january . it 's not surprising , then , that a plan recently came under discussion that would theoretically solve both environmental and economic concerns : the government would pay drivers a premium for scrapping their old , pollutant vehicles - or at least taking them off the road - in the hope that they put the money into a new car . the carbon dioxide-based vehicle tax , which the german government is currently considering , would provide an incentive for the buyer to select a low-emissions vehicle .
scrapping premiums would come from the vehicle tax pot , thereby being paid for by heavy emitters . potential two-pronged benefit for scrapping premium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim of a premium is to get old cars off the road , not necessarily destroy them " on the one hand , old cars are taken off the market and new cars , which generally have lower emissions , enter the market .
secondly , business would experience a boom , at least in the short term , " said willi diez , director of the german automobile industry institute , of the plan his organization proposed last month . a similar , reportedly successful project in italy serves as a model .
there , consumers are paid 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,170 -rrb- and given a two-year vehicle tax exemption when they scrap their old cars and buy new ones with emissions rates of less than 140 grams per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- . the incentive has gotten 500,000 old cars off italy 's streets since it started in january , according to a report by germany 's motorzeitung.de.
diez predicted that , if a premium of 1,000 euros was introduced in germany , it could lead to an additional 250,000 cars sold , with at least as many taken off the road . car expert slams scrapping plan for ferdinand dudenhöffer , co-founder and director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- at the gelsenkirchen technical college , the premium to scrap cars sounds like a marketing ploy . " the car industry is n't an industry that needs subsidies , " said dudenhöffer .
" there are much better ways to get customers to buy new cars . " a driver could take the premium and buy a big gas-guzzler if he or she wanted to , added dudenhöffer , who did n't see the proposed tax-break of 50 to 100 euros for more ecologically sound cars as enough of an incentive .
as for the old polluter , it 's more likely to end up on the road in eastern europe than to get scrapped , he said . " and russian co2 is just like german co2 , " he said . emissions trading could help europe reach target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to reach an average 130 grams of co2 per kilometer driven by 2012 the auto expert has been an outspoken proponent of emissions trading as the best way to reduce co2 output across europe .
that scenario would have carmakers buy certificates from an independent exchange for every vehicle they produce with a co2 emissions rate of more than 130 grams per kilometer , and sell one back for every car under the emissions limit . ultimately , said dudenhöffer , the emissions trading plan would help europe attain the 130-gram-per vehicle average it is striving for by 2012 . by making high-emission cars more expensive than clean ones , the customer bears the financial burden . " environmental consciousness may be getting a bit stronger , but you have to assume that when i buy something i pay attention to my needs and not to my neighbor 's , " dudenhöffer said .
" that 's why it 's better not to leave the environmental decision to the consumer but to set prices for co2 that allow these emission goals to be reached . " the plan 's weakness , countered diez , is that it 's too difficult to come up with a basis of calculation to determine a price for the so-called emissions certificates .
emissions trading already exists in stationary industries like power plants , but he said he did n't consider it a practical option for the auto sector . co2-based vehicle tax coming soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who want to drive big cars will have to pay more for them diez conceded , however , that the scrapping premium has n't been well received .
while politicians worry about where the money will come from , carmakers fear that the temporary boom caused by it will be followed by a painful dip in sales . meanwhile , the german government is in the process of approving a law , to take effect in january 2009 , that would adjust the annual vehicle tax according to a new car 's co2 emission rate . while dudenhöffer called it a " german solution to a european problem , " the sliding tax plays a key role in diez 's scrapping premium .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 11.12.2007 polish pm calls for world war ii museum ahead of berlin visit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the battle of gdansk in 1939 is considered the start of world war ii poland 's new prime minister thinks that the baltic port city of gdansk is the perfect location for a museum commemorating the war and its consequences .
berlin would rather stick to its own plans for remembrance . poland 's prime minister , donald tusk , called on monday , dec .
10 , for a grand-scale world war ii museum in the northern polish city of gdansk , the site of the nazi invasion on sept .
1 , 1939 . other countries , including germany , russia and israel could have a part in the museum , which was proposed as an alternative to a plan for an exhibition in berlin to remember german expellees from central and eastern europe during and just after world war ii . in the large gdansk museum , " the fate of expellees would have a place in a conclusive and comprehensive context , " said tusk in an interview with the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . the coastal city of gdansk , located on the baltic sea , is ripe with symbolic meaning . " the war began here , but in a sense it also ended here when the solidarity movement was founded in 1980 , " tusk said . started by polish laborers under lech walesa , solidarity , or solidarnosc , played a key role in the fall of communism in the former east-bloc country . berlin adamant about expulsion center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk became prime minister last month in response , the german government made it clear that tusk 's statement would have no bearing on plans for the expulsion center .
the governing coalition agreed in their founding contract in 2005 to set up a " visible sign of remembrance against expulsion " in berlin , said government spokesman thomas steg . the conflict began some seven years ago when the league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- started a foundation for a proposed expellee center .
the organization , which campaigns for the rights and remembrance of ethnic german expellees , has been seen in poland as overstating german suffering surrounding the holocaust . " the problem is not that anyone wants to prevent the germans from remembering the suffering of their own people , " tusk said .
" it becomes problematic when this remembrance of the german suffering diminishes another memory - namely that of the collective responsibility of the germans . " points of contention on tusk-merkel agenda the question of remembrance is likely to be a major agenda point when tusk meets with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin on tuesday . the two leaders are also slated to broach the ongoing issue of restitution claims for german expellees and re-settlers . the prussian claims society submitted claims for 22 individual claims cases to the european court for human rights in strasbourg in 2006 , requesting the return of land and property in present-day poland to ethnic germans who were forced out of their homes during the war . several more cases have been submitted since then , and still others are being reviewed in polish courts . " the german government has to take responsibility for the possible financial consequences arising from the compensation claims , " tusk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should expelled german be compensated for what they lost ?
berlin has maintained repeatedly that it does n't support such claims , with then german chancellor gerhard schröder making a binding statement to that effect in warsaw in 2004 . according to german estimates , some 15 million ethnic germans were expelled from their homes during or directly following the war .
some two million are thought to have died in the process . poland fears pipeline puts gas supply at risk plans for a joint russian-german gas pipeline along the baltic sea will be another matter of discussion at tuesday 's meeting . currently , russia sends gas to western europe via poland , but the baltic sea pipeline would circumvent the central european country .
poland has expressed concern that , in a political crisis , russia could shut its gas supply without affecting delivery to - and , hence , relations with - western europe . ahead of tuesday 's talks , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed optimism over the future of bilateral relations . " a concrete program to improve cooperation between the governments is being worked on , " he told the polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza on monday .
" the german and polish ministers will now meet together frequently and regularly . " topics of friction , such as expellee claims and the baltic pipeline would be dealt with " openly and constructively , " he added . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor angela merkel was all ears .
but will talking about disagreements solve anything ? " there should be no taboo subjects , " tusk said at the press conference after the two-hour meeting with merkel in berlin on tuesday , dec .
11 .
" we are friends , and friends ca n't get themselves into a situation of not talking to one another . "
tusk 's tone stood in marked contrast to that of his conservative predecessor , jaroslav kaczynski , who often seemed to go out of his way to offend german sensibilities .
the more eu-friendly tusk defeated kaczynski in poland 's hotly contested national election in november .
merkel was keen to echo the theme of a new polish-german frankness and friendship .
" we 've pledged not dodge any problems , " merkel said .
" together we can get a lot accomplished . "
a problematic past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as per the schengen agreement , the german-polish border will be opened in 2008 tusk and merkel arranged to meet with czech prime minister mirek topolanek on dec .
21 to discuss the opening of borders between the three countries .
and they also addressed two of the most contentious issues dividing poland and germany .
one of them is how to remember the past and , specifically , a planned memorial in berlin to expellees during world war ii - including germans driven from their homes in poland .
many poles see the project as an attempt to revise history and lessen germany 's wartime culpability .
tusk said he favored treating the subject of expellees of all nationalities in a museum about world war ii to be built in the city of gdansk , which used to be part of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is no doubt happy to have a new counterpart in warsaw merkel asserted that a museum could not replace the berlin memorial , but said that she supported the museum idea .
she also promised to send a delegation to warsaw to keep poland informed about the memorial and said germany had no interest in reviving past conflicts .
" there are no demands whatsoever for reparations from poland -lsb- to german refugees -rsb- , " merkel said .
" no german government is going to take a position that deviates from this . "
tusk said he welcomed the assurance as a " moment with symbolic value . "
a present pipeline merkel also discussed the natural-gas pipeline to be built under the baltic sea , which would connect germany with russia but bypass poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic pipeline remains a major sticking point tusk suggested that a meeting be arranged between the three countries to discuss the project in its current form .
such a meeting , he said , could bring about " positive corrections on both sides . "
the pipeline , which was negotiated by merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , has angered many poles , who worry about being held hostage on energy policy by russia and feel they have been ignored by their more powerful neighbors .
clearly , much work needs to be done to resolve such conflicts of interest , but tusk 's visit did re-establish a more civil tone between germany and poland .
he and merkel will have a chance to continue their open exchanges when they meet in the eastern german city of zittau in 10 days ' time . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" within 24 hours , russia appears to have ended months of speculation over the country 's political future . putin has not yet given his response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin will retain some power after stepping down in march in a televised speech following medvedev 's surprise statement , putin did not comment on this suggestion and no timeframe was suggested for the switch .
but putin has long said that he wanted to retain an important role after leaving the kremlin . analyst vyacheslav nikonov told the interfax news agency : " if medvedev announced it , then the likelihood is that it will take place . " the decision raises questions of whether medvedev would act as an independent leader or merely as a figurehead for putin .
this was fueled by the president-in-waiting 's additional announcement on tuesday that russia must pursue the course set by putin over the past eight years . putin , who is constitutionally barred from standing for a third term of office , gave his endorsement to medvedev on monday , saying he " fully and completely " supported him .

" putin first appointed medvedev in the early 1990s in st. petersburg , where both attended the same law school .
he quickly rose from campaign manager in 2000 to head of the presidential administration and gazprom chairman . he is reputed to be relatively liberal-minded in comparison with his main competitor , fellow putin advisor and former defense minister sergei ivanov . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin would rather stick to its own plans for remembrance . poland 's prime minister , donald tusk , called on monday , dec .
10 , for a grand-scale world war ii museum in the northern polish city of gdansk , the site of the nazi invasion on sept .
1 , 1939 . other countries , including germany , russia and israel could have a part in the museum , which was proposed as an alternative to a plan for an exhibition in berlin to remember german expellees from central and eastern europe during and just after world war ii . in the large gdansk museum , " the fate of expellees would have a place in a conclusive and comprehensive context , " said tusk in an interview with the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . the coastal city of gdansk , located on the baltic sea , is ripe with symbolic meaning . " the war began here , but in a sense it also ended here when the solidarity movement was founded in 1980 , " tusk said . started by polish laborers under lech walesa , solidarity , or solidarnosc , played a key role in the fall of communism in the former east-bloc country . berlin adamant about expulsion center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk became prime minister last month in response , the german government made it clear that tusk 's statement would have no bearing on plans for the expulsion center .
the governing coalition agreed in their founding contract in 2005 to set up a " visible sign of remembrance against expulsion " in berlin , said government spokesman thomas steg . the conflict began some seven years ago when the league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- started a foundation for a proposed expellee center .
the organization , which campaigns for the rights and remembrance of ethnic german expellees , has been seen in poland as overstating german suffering surrounding the holocaust . " the problem is not that anyone wants to prevent the germans from remembering the suffering of their own people , " tusk said .
" it becomes problematic when this remembrance of the german suffering diminishes another memory - namely that of the collective responsibility of the germans . " points of contention on tusk-merkel agenda the question of remembrance is likely to be a major agenda point when tusk meets with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin on tuesday . the two leaders are also slated to broach the ongoing issue of restitution claims for german expellees and re-settlers . the prussian claims society submitted claims for 22 individual claims cases to the european court for human rights in strasbourg in 2006 , requesting the return of land and property in present-day poland to ethnic germans who were forced out of their homes during the war . several more cases have been submitted since then , and still others are being reviewed in polish courts . " the german government has to take responsibility for the possible financial consequences arising from the compensation claims , " tusk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should expelled german be compensated for what they lost ?
berlin has maintained repeatedly that it does n't support such claims , with then german chancellor gerhard schröder making a binding statement to that effect in warsaw in 2004 . according to german estimates , some 15 million ethnic germans were expelled from their homes during or directly following the war .
some two million are thought to have died in the process . poland fears pipeline puts gas supply at risk plans for a joint russian-german gas pipeline along the baltic sea will be another matter of discussion at tuesday 's meeting . currently , russia sends gas to western europe via poland , but the baltic sea pipeline would circumvent the central european country .
poland has expressed concern that , in a political crisis , russia could shut its gas supply without affecting delivery to - and , hence , relations with - western europe . ahead of tuesday 's talks , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed optimism over the future of bilateral relations . " a concrete program to improve cooperation between the governments is being worked on , " he told the polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza on monday .
" the german and polish ministers will now meet together frequently and regularly . " topics of friction , such as expellee claims and the baltic pipeline would be dealt with " openly and constructively , " he added . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the expected declaration of independence by kosovo has a number of nations on edge .
those who oppose kosovo 's autonomy harbor separatists of their own .
a free kosovo could be just the rallying call these movements need . with all the signs pointing towards a declaration of independence from kosovo after the un-set deadline for reaching a settlement passes on monday , the european union is bracing itself for a wave of renewed calls for autonomy from separatist movements across europe .
if kosovo declares independence from serbia , it will set a powerful precedent for movements from spain to scotland , all wanting to rewrite the map of europe and form their own independent states , according to experts .
" there is a real risk that the quasi-dogma of the intangibility of borders which has existed since the end of the world war ii will fall , " french political scientist jean-yves camus of the paris-based iris institute told afp .
" this would benefit movements which seek to rewrite the map of europe based on ethnic , linguistic or cultural criteria , " added camus , a specialist on separatist movements in europe .
the emergence of similar lifestyles and english as a common language in europe , combined with the disappearance of borders and the lack of democratic legitimacy of eu bodies , had fueled " the development of micro-distinctive identities , " said camus .
while kosovo 's ethnic majority leaders have vowed not to unilaterally declare independence from serbia without us and european union approval , they are expected to announce their intentions to form a new state in early 2008 .
opposition includes fear of own breakaway states many of the countries which oppose the creation of an independent state of kosovo have at least one separatist movement working towards autonomy within their own borders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has been fighting chechen separatists for years serbia 's ally russia , which leads the opposition , has problems with separatists in chechnya and the caucasus region while spain has had a long-running dispute with the armed eta movement .
other countries against kosovo 's independence such as cyprus and greece have ethnic minorities which demand more power .
" in the west , this -lsb- kosovo -rsb- solution will set off separatists in europe , ” russian president vladimir putin said in an interview published in french newspaper le figaro earlier this year . ” look at scotland , catalonia and the basque country . "
spain is currently experiencing a period of unease as its northern basque country and its wealthy northeastern region of catalonia have stepped up their demands for more autonomy .
last year catalan voters overwhelmingly backed a new charter which recognized the region as a " nation " within spain and grants it enhanced powers in taxation and judicial matters .
separatists claim eu structure makes autonomy possible as in other separatist regions of europe like flanders , the dutch-speaking northern part of belgium , and northern italy , supporters said catalonia deserved extra powers because it makes a bigger contribution to the economy .
the armed basque separatist group eta ended a 15-month ceasefire in june while the scottish national party , which came to power in may , plans to hold a referendum on independence in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lingusitic divisions have led to a debate on splitting belgium belgium meanwhile has been without a government for six months after a general election on june 10 highlighted deep divisions between the nation 's majority dutch-speakers and francophones .
for many nationalists , membership in the 27-nation european union has only served to make separation seem more viable .
" europe can regulate our functionings and transfer payments .
why must we maintain this intermediate roof we call belgium , " the leader of the flemish nationalist party , bart de wever , told french daily le monde last month .
russia to block independence at un level meanwhile , russia stepped up its opposition tuesday by announcing that it would demand that the un security council annul any unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo .
" russia will of course demand the annulment of such a decision .
we will demand a meeting of the security council because it would be a violation of a council resolution , " russia 's interfax news agency quoted the country 's chief kosovo negotiator alexander botsan-kharchenko as saying . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while some countries bank on cash incentives , some german car experts believe there are better ways to go . the auto industry has plenty to lose sleep over .
not only is public discourse over the new dirty word " co2 " laying on pressure for change , sales are down as well . the german association of the automotive industry announced last week that car sales have dropped 9 percent this year - a record year - naming consumers ' uncertainty over planned vehicle tax reform , climate concerns and the 3-percent sales tax increase last january . it 's not surprising , then , that a plan recently came under discussion that would theoretically solve both environmental and economic concerns : the government would pay drivers a premium for scrapping their old , pollutant vehicles - or at least taking them off the road - in the hope that they put the money into a new car . the carbon dioxide-based vehicle tax , which the german government is currently considering , would provide an incentive for the buyer to select a low-emissions vehicle .
scrapping premiums would come from the vehicle tax pot , thereby being paid for by heavy emitters . potential two-pronged benefit for scrapping premium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim of a premium is to get old cars off the road , not necessarily destroy them " on the one hand , old cars are taken off the market and new cars , which generally have lower emissions , enter the market .
secondly , business would experience a boom , at least in the short term , " said willi diez , director of the german automobile industry institute , of the plan his organization proposed last month . a similar , reportedly successful project in italy serves as a model .
there , consumers are paid 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,170 -rrb- and given a two-year vehicle tax exemption when they scrap their old cars and buy new ones with emissions rates of less than 140 grams per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- . the incentive has gotten 500,000 old cars off italy 's streets since it started in january , according to a report by germany 's motorzeitung.de.
diez predicted that , if a premium of 1,000 euros was introduced in germany , it could lead to an additional 250,000 cars sold , with at least as many taken off the road . car expert slams scrapping plan for ferdinand dudenhöffer , co-founder and director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- at the gelsenkirchen technical college , the premium to scrap cars sounds like a marketing ploy . " the car industry is n't an industry that needs subsidies , " said dudenhöffer .
" there are much better ways to get customers to buy new cars . " a driver could take the premium and buy a big gas-guzzler if he or she wanted to , added dudenhöffer , who did n't see the proposed tax-break of 50 to 100 euros for more ecologically sound cars as enough of an incentive .
as for the old polluter , it 's more likely to end up on the road in eastern europe than to get scrapped , he said . " and russian co2 is just like german co2 , " he said . emissions trading could help europe reach target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to reach an average 130 grams of co2 per kilometer driven by 2012 the auto expert has been an outspoken proponent of emissions trading as the best way to reduce co2 output across europe .
that scenario would have carmakers buy certificates from an independent exchange for every vehicle they produce with a co2 emissions rate of more than 130 grams per kilometer , and sell one back for every car under the emissions limit . ultimately , said dudenhöffer , the emissions trading plan would help europe attain the 130-gram-per vehicle average it is striving for by 2012 . by making high-emission cars more expensive than clean ones , the customer bears the financial burden . " environmental consciousness may be getting a bit stronger , but you have to assume that when i buy something i pay attention to my needs and not to my neighbor 's , " dudenhöffer said .
" that 's why it 's better not to leave the environmental decision to the consumer but to set prices for co2 that allow these emission goals to be reached . " the plan 's weakness , countered diez , is that it 's too difficult to come up with a basis of calculation to determine a price for the so-called emissions certificates .
emissions trading already exists in stationary industries like power plants , but he said he did n't consider it a practical option for the auto sector . co2-based vehicle tax coming soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who want to drive big cars will have to pay more for them diez conceded , however , that the scrapping premium has n't been well received .
while politicians worry about where the money will come from , carmakers fear that the temporary boom caused by it will be followed by a painful dip in sales . meanwhile , the german government is in the process of approving a law , to take effect in january 2009 , that would adjust the annual vehicle tax according to a new car 's co2 emission rate . while dudenhöffer called it a " german solution to a european problem , " the sliding tax plays a key role in diez 's scrapping premium .
since old cars would continue to be charged according to their cubic capacity , buyers of new low-emissions cars would benefit the most . german auto club adac said it strongly supports the vehicle tax reform - a plan it had suggested to the government already in 2004 . but there 's even another , perhaps simpler way to cut emissions that does n't involve government-initiated incentives : " driving style should n't be underestimated , " said an adac spokesman .

while some countries bank on cash incentives , some german car experts believe there are better ways to go . the auto industry has plenty to lose sleep over .
not only is public discourse over the new dirty word " co2 " laying on pressure for change , sales are down as well . the german association of the automotive industry announced last week that car sales have dropped 9 percent this year - a record year - naming consumers ' uncertainty over planned vehicle tax reform , climate concerns and the 3-percent sales tax increase last january . it 's not surprising , then , that a plan recently came under discussion that would theoretically solve both environmental and economic concerns : the government would pay drivers a premium for scrapping their old , pollutant vehicles - or at least taking them off the road - in the hope that they put the money into a new car . the carbon dioxide-based vehicle tax , which the german government is currently considering , would provide an incentive for the buyer to select a low-emissions vehicle .
scrapping premiums would come from the vehicle tax pot , thereby being paid for by heavy emitters . potential two-pronged benefit for scrapping premium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim of a premium is to get old cars off the road , not necessarily destroy them " on the one hand , old cars are taken off the market and new cars , which generally have lower emissions , enter the market .
secondly , business would experience a boom , at least in the short term , " said willi diez , director of the german automobile industry institute , of the plan his organization proposed last month . a similar , reportedly successful project in italy serves as a model .
there , consumers are paid 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,170 -rrb- and given a two-year vehicle tax exemption when they scrap their old cars and buy new ones with emissions rates of less than 140 grams per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- . the incentive has gotten 500,000 old cars off italy 's streets since it started in january , according to a report by germany 's motorzeitung.de.
diez predicted that , if a premium of 1,000 euros was introduced in germany , it could lead to an additional 250,000 cars sold , with at least as many taken off the road . car expert slams scrapping plan for ferdinand dudenhöffer , co-founder and director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- at the gelsenkirchen technical college , the premium to scrap cars sounds like a marketing ploy . " the car industry is n't an industry that needs subsidies , " said dudenhöffer .
" there are much better ways to get customers to buy new cars . " a driver could take the premium and buy a big gas-guzzler if he or she wanted to , added dudenhöffer , who did n't see the proposed tax-break of 50 to 100 euros for more ecologically sound cars as enough of an incentive .
as for the old polluter , it 's more likely to end up on the road in eastern europe than to get scrapped , he said . " and russian co2 is just like german co2 , " he said . emissions trading could help europe reach target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to reach an average 130 grams of co2 per kilometer driven by 2012 the auto expert has been an outspoken proponent of emissions trading as the best way to reduce co2 output across europe .
that scenario would have carmakers buy certificates from an independent exchange for every vehicle they produce with a co2 emissions rate of more than 130 grams per kilometer , and sell one back for every car under the emissions limit . ultimately , said dudenhöffer , the emissions trading plan would help europe attain the 130-gram-per vehicle average it is striving for by 2012 . by making high-emission cars more expensive than clean ones , the customer bears the financial burden . " environmental consciousness may be getting a bit stronger , but you have to assume that when i buy something i pay attention to my needs and not to my neighbor 's , " dudenhöffer said .
" that 's why it 's better not to leave the environmental decision to the consumer but to set prices for co2 that allow these emission goals to be reached . " the plan 's weakness , countered diez , is that it 's too difficult to come up with a basis of calculation to determine a price for the so-called emissions certificates .
emissions trading already exists in stationary industries like power plants , but he said he did n't consider it a practical option for the auto sector . co2-based vehicle tax coming soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who want to drive big cars will have to pay more for them diez conceded , however , that the scrapping premium has n't been well received .
while politicians worry about where the money will come from , carmakers fear that the temporary boom caused by it will be followed by a painful dip in sales . meanwhile , the german government is in the process of approving a law , to take effect in january 2009 , that would adjust the annual vehicle tax according to a new car 's co2 emission rate . while dudenhöffer called it a " german solution to a european problem , " the sliding tax plays a key role in diez 's scrapping premium .
since old cars would continue to be charged according to their cubic capacity , buyers of new low-emissions cars would benefit the most . german auto club adac said it strongly supports the vehicle tax reform - a plan it had suggested to the government already in 2004 . but there 's even another , perhaps simpler way to cut emissions that does n't involve government-initiated incentives : " driving style should n't be underestimated , " said an adac spokesman .
driving ecologically - not accelerating quickly , shifting early and avoiding traffic - can save 20 to 30 percent on gas , he said .

there , consumers are paid 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,170 -rrb- and given a two-year vehicle tax exemption when they scrap their old cars and buy new ones with emissions rates of less than 140 grams per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- . the incentive has gotten 500,000 old cars off italy 's streets since it started in january , according to a report by germany 's motorzeitung.de.
diez predicted that , if a premium of 1,000 euros was introduced in germany , it could lead to an additional 250,000 cars sold , with at least as many taken off the road . car expert slams scrapping plan for ferdinand dudenhöffer , co-founder and director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- at the gelsenkirchen technical college , the premium to scrap cars sounds like a marketing ploy . " the car industry is n't an industry that needs subsidies , " said dudenhöffer .
" there are much better ways to get customers to buy new cars . " a driver could take the premium and buy a big gas-guzzler if he or she wanted to , added dudenhöffer , who did n't see the proposed tax-break of 50 to 100 euros for more ecologically sound cars as enough of an incentive .
as for the old polluter , it 's more likely to end up on the road in eastern europe than to get scrapped , he said . " and russian co2 is just like german co2 , " he said . emissions trading could help europe reach target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to reach an average 130 grams of co2 per kilometer driven by 2012 the auto expert has been an outspoken proponent of emissions trading as the best way to reduce co2 output across europe .
that scenario would have carmakers buy certificates from an independent exchange for every vehicle they produce with a co2 emissions rate of more than 130 grams per kilometer , and sell one back for every car under the emissions limit . ultimately , said dudenhöffer , the emissions trading plan would help europe attain the 130-gram-per vehicle average it is striving for by 2012 . by making high-emission cars more expensive than clean ones , the customer bears the financial burden . " environmental consciousness may be getting a bit stronger , but you have to assume that when i buy something i pay attention to my needs and not to my neighbor 's , " dudenhöffer said .
" that 's why it 's better not to leave the environmental decision to the consumer but to set prices for co2 that allow these emission goals to be reached . " the plan 's weakness , countered diez , is that it 's too difficult to come up with a basis of calculation to determine a price for the so-called emissions certificates .
emissions trading already exists in stationary industries like power plants , but he said he did n't consider it a practical option for the auto sector . co2-based vehicle tax coming soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who want to drive big cars will have to pay more for them diez conceded , however , that the scrapping premium has n't been well received .
while politicians worry about where the money will come from , carmakers fear that the temporary boom caused by it will be followed by a painful dip in sales . meanwhile , the german government is in the process of approving a law , to take effect in january 2009 , that would adjust the annual vehicle tax according to a new car 's co2 emission rate . while dudenhöffer called it a " german solution to a european problem , " the sliding tax plays a key role in diez 's scrapping premium .
since old cars would continue to be charged according to their cubic capacity , buyers of new low-emissions cars would benefit the most . german auto club adac said it strongly supports the vehicle tax reform - a plan it had suggested to the government already in 2004 . but there 's even another , perhaps simpler way to cut emissions that does n't involve government-initiated incentives : " driving style should n't be underestimated , " said an adac spokesman .
driving ecologically - not accelerating quickly , shifting early and avoiding traffic - can save 20 to 30 percent on gas , he said .
and less gas means fewer emissions . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor angela merkel was all ears .

" we are friends , and friends ca n't get themselves into a situation of not talking to one another . "
tusk 's tone stood in marked contrast to that of his conservative predecessor , jaroslav kaczynski , who often seemed to go out of his way to offend german sensibilities .
the more eu-friendly tusk defeated kaczynski in poland 's hotly contested national election in november .
merkel was keen to echo the theme of a new polish-german frankness and friendship .
" we 've pledged not dodge any problems , " merkel said .
" together we can get a lot accomplished . "

one of them is how to remember the past and , specifically , a planned memorial in berlin to expellees during world war ii - including germans driven from their homes in poland .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is no doubt happy to have a new counterpart in warsaw merkel asserted that a museum could not replace the berlin memorial , but said that she supported the museum idea .
she also promised to send a delegation to warsaw to keep poland informed about the memorial and said germany had no interest in reviving past conflicts .
" there are no demands whatsoever for reparations from poland -lsb- to german refugees -rsb- , " merkel said .
" no german government is going to take a position that deviates from this . "

the pipeline , which was negotiated by merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , has angered many poles , who worry about being held hostage on energy policy by russia and feel they have been ignored by their more powerful neighbors .

the expected declaration of independence by kosovo has a number of nations on edge .
those who oppose kosovo 's autonomy harbor separatists of their own .
a free kosovo could be just the rallying call these movements need . with all the signs pointing towards a declaration of independence from kosovo after the un-set deadline for reaching a settlement passes on monday , the european union is bracing itself for a wave of renewed calls for autonomy from separatist movements across europe .
if kosovo declares independence from serbia , it will set a powerful precedent for movements from spain to scotland , all wanting to rewrite the map of europe and form their own independent states , according to experts .
" there is a real risk that the quasi-dogma of the intangibility of borders which has existed since the end of the world war ii will fall , " french political scientist jean-yves camus of the paris-based iris institute told afp .
" this would benefit movements which seek to rewrite the map of europe based on ethnic , linguistic or cultural criteria , " added camus , a specialist on separatist movements in europe .
the emergence of similar lifestyles and english as a common language in europe , combined with the disappearance of borders and the lack of democratic legitimacy of eu bodies , had fueled " the development of micro-distinctive identities , " said camus .
while kosovo 's ethnic majority leaders have vowed not to unilaterally declare independence from serbia without us and european union approval , they are expected to announce their intentions to form a new state in early 2008 .
opposition includes fear of own breakaway states many of the countries which oppose the creation of an independent state of kosovo have at least one separatist movement working towards autonomy within their own borders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 11.12.2007 tusk , merkel call for new beginning for polish-german relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and tusk seemed to get along along well on his first visit to germany as poland 's new premier , donald tusk stressed the need for frankness between the two neighbors .
chancellor angela merkel was all ears .
but will talking about disagreements solve anything ? " there should be no taboo subjects , " tusk said at the press conference after the two-hour meeting with merkel in berlin on tuesday , dec .
11 .
" we are friends , and friends ca n't get themselves into a situation of not talking to one another . "
tusk 's tone stood in marked contrast to that of his conservative predecessor , jaroslav kaczynski , who often seemed to go out of his way to offend german sensibilities .
the more eu-friendly tusk defeated kaczynski in poland 's hotly contested national election in november .
merkel was keen to echo the theme of a new polish-german frankness and friendship .
" we 've pledged not dodge any problems , " merkel said .
" together we can get a lot accomplished . "
a problematic past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as per the schengen agreement , the german-polish border will be opened in 2008 tusk and merkel arranged to meet with czech prime minister mirek topolanek on dec .
21 to discuss the opening of borders between the three countries .
and they also addressed two of the most contentious issues dividing poland and germany .
one of them is how to remember the past and , specifically , a planned memorial in berlin to expellees during world war ii - including germans driven from their homes in poland .
many poles see the project as an attempt to revise history and lessen germany 's wartime culpability .
tusk said he favored treating the subject of expellees of all nationalities in a museum about world war ii to be built in the city of gdansk , which used to be part of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is no doubt happy to have a new counterpart in warsaw merkel asserted that a museum could not replace the berlin memorial , but said that she supported the museum idea .
she also promised to send a delegation to warsaw to keep poland informed about the memorial and said germany had no interest in reviving past conflicts .
" there are no demands whatsoever for reparations from poland -lsb- to german refugees -rsb- , " merkel said .
" no german government is going to take a position that deviates from this . "
tusk said he welcomed the assurance as a " moment with symbolic value . "
a present pipeline merkel also discussed the natural-gas pipeline to be built under the baltic sea , which would connect germany with russia but bypass poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic pipeline remains a major sticking point tusk suggested that a meeting be arranged between the three countries to discuss the project in its current form .
such a meeting , he said , could bring about " positive corrections on both sides . "
the pipeline , which was negotiated by merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , has angered many poles , who worry about being held hostage on energy policy by russia and feel they have been ignored by their more powerful neighbors .
clearly , much work needs to be done to resolve such conflicts of interest , but tusk 's visit did re-establish a more civil tone between germany and poland .
he and merkel will have a chance to continue their open exchanges when they meet in the eastern german city of zittau in 10 days ' time . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world 's ingo mannteufel says the liberal technocrat will uphold putin 's political course - with or without him as pm . the guessing game is over .
for months now , russian politics have been dominated by the question of who will succeed russian president vladimir putin in march 2008 .
russian law prevents presidents from standing for a third term of office .
speculation was rife about putin 's next move .
one scenario put forward was that putin would alter the constitution .
another saw putin naming a stand-in president , then returning to office after having fulfilled the constitution 's technical requirements .
it was difficult to imagine russia being governed by another politician after eight years of putin .
medvedev certain to be elected the russian president has decided to back dmitry medvedev , first deputy prime minister and board chairman of gas giant gazprom , to stand as a presidential candidate in march 2008 .
given what happened in russian parliamentary poll in early december , it is practically certain that medvedev will be elected in the first round of the elections on march 2 .
the kremlin propaganda machine functions magnificently , the administrative apparatus runs smoothly , and the significant size of russian security forces remove any lingering doubt about the outcome of the poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel there is no point in bemoaning the poor prospects for democracy in russia in the light of such political relations .
the vague and possibly premature hopes for a rapid democratization of russia were snuffed out some time ago .
with his decision in favor of medvedev , president putin has made a bold move and answered a number of questions about himself and russia 's future course .
not just a fill-in president putin will step down as president in march 2008 .
the intention is that 42-year-old medvedev should be president for the next four years - in all likelihood much longer .
medvedev is completely unsuited to just act as a stand-in who would keep the presidential post warm for putin .
in this respect , putin has remained true to himself - in spite of what all his opponents and his sycophantic supporters have said .
after all , he always said he would not violate the constitution in order to remain in office .
however , the end of putin 's presidential era does not spell the end of putin as the leading light in russian politics .
he will retain considerable influence over russian politics as head of united russia , or possibly as prime minister .
we will have to wait and see if putin will take up medvedev 's offer to take on the job of pm under him .
at any rate , medvedev is not expected to usher in any decisive course change .
putin 's longstanding ally has always been directly involved from the outset in shaping and representing putin 's policies in his previous posts .
medvedev looks set to continue pursuing putin 's goal of modernizing russia because he shares his convictions .
the loyal technocrat is the ideal candidate to ensure that putin 's course is maintained without the current president having to resort to any trickery with the constitution .
past will burden relations with europe president medvedev will be blemished by the fact that he has emerged from putin 's powerhouse .
his previous role as chair of the board at gazprom will also not help his popularity in europe given the poor image of the russia energy giant here .
on the other hand , medvedev is not the worst candidate from amongst the current russian elite .
the former law professor from st. petersburg is reputed to be one of the more liberal spirits in the kremlin .
in addition , he has no direct contacts to the soviet or the post-soviet security services .
and given his relative youth , he also stands for a new russia that europe - and the west in general - will have to learn to live with .
the russian president 's decision to select medvedev is not likely to find favor with all of the factions who putin can currently rally behind him .
the effects of a change in president in terms of who has what access to important financial and business resources are not likely to be clear for a while , and the process will not be without its tensions .
the question is whether the first cracks within russia 's kremlin elite will already have become apparent ahead of the elections in march , thus threatening the transfer of power .
then things could get tricky for putin as the one responsible for naming medvedev his political heir .

" the decision raises questions of whether medvedev would act as an independent leader or merely as a figurehead for putin .
this was fueled by the president-in-waiting 's additional announcement on tuesday that russia must pursue the course set by putin over the past eight years . putin , who is constitutionally barred from standing for a third term of office , gave his endorsement to medvedev on monday , saying he " fully and completely " supported him .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 11.12.2007 opponents of kosovo independence fear separatist reaction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will an independent kosovo give rise to separatist movements elsewhere ?
the expected declaration of independence by kosovo has a number of nations on edge .
those who oppose kosovo 's autonomy harbor separatists of their own .
a free kosovo could be just the rallying call these movements need . with all the signs pointing towards a declaration of independence from kosovo after the un-set deadline for reaching a settlement passes on monday , the european union is bracing itself for a wave of renewed calls for autonomy from separatist movements across europe .
if kosovo declares independence from serbia , it will set a powerful precedent for movements from spain to scotland , all wanting to rewrite the map of europe and form their own independent states , according to experts .
" there is a real risk that the quasi-dogma of the intangibility of borders which has existed since the end of the world war ii will fall , " french political scientist jean-yves camus of the paris-based iris institute told afp .
" this would benefit movements which seek to rewrite the map of europe based on ethnic , linguistic or cultural criteria , " added camus , a specialist on separatist movements in europe .
the emergence of similar lifestyles and english as a common language in europe , combined with the disappearance of borders and the lack of democratic legitimacy of eu bodies , had fueled " the development of micro-distinctive identities , " said camus .
while kosovo 's ethnic majority leaders have vowed not to unilaterally declare independence from serbia without us and european union approval , they are expected to announce their intentions to form a new state in early 2008 .

spain is currently experiencing a period of unease as its northern basque country and its wealthy northeastern region of catalonia have stepped up their demands for more autonomy .
last year catalan voters overwhelmingly backed a new charter which recognized the region as a " nation " within spain and grants it enhanced powers in taxation and judicial matters .
separatists claim eu structure makes autonomy possible as in other separatist regions of europe like flanders , the dutch-speaking northern part of belgium , and northern italy , supporters said catalonia deserved extra powers because it makes a bigger contribution to the economy .
the armed basque separatist group eta ended a 15-month ceasefire in june while the scottish national party , which came to power in may , plans to hold a referendum on independence in 2010 .

berlin would rather stick to its own plans for remembrance . poland 's prime minister , donald tusk , called on monday , dec .
10 , for a grand-scale world war ii museum in the northern polish city of gdansk , the site of the nazi invasion on sept .
1 , 1939 . other countries , including germany , russia and israel could have a part in the museum , which was proposed as an alternative to a plan for an exhibition in berlin to remember german expellees from central and eastern europe during and just after world war ii . in the large gdansk museum , " the fate of expellees would have a place in a conclusive and comprehensive context , " said tusk in an interview with the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . the coastal city of gdansk , located on the baltic sea , is ripe with symbolic meaning . " the war began here , but in a sense it also ended here when the solidarity movement was founded in 1980 , " tusk said . started by polish laborers under lech walesa , solidarity , or solidarnosc , played a key role in the fall of communism in the former east-bloc country . berlin adamant about expulsion center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk became prime minister last month in response , the german government made it clear that tusk 's statement would have no bearing on plans for the expulsion center .
the governing coalition agreed in their founding contract in 2005 to set up a " visible sign of remembrance against expulsion " in berlin , said government spokesman thomas steg . the conflict began some seven years ago when the league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- started a foundation for a proposed expellee center .
the organization , which campaigns for the rights and remembrance of ethnic german expellees , has been seen in poland as overstating german suffering surrounding the holocaust . " the problem is not that anyone wants to prevent the germans from remembering the suffering of their own people , " tusk said .
" it becomes problematic when this remembrance of the german suffering diminishes another memory - namely that of the collective responsibility of the germans . " points of contention on tusk-merkel agenda the question of remembrance is likely to be a major agenda point when tusk meets with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin on tuesday . the two leaders are also slated to broach the ongoing issue of restitution claims for german expellees and re-settlers . the prussian claims society submitted claims for 22 individual claims cases to the european court for human rights in strasbourg in 2006 , requesting the return of land and property in present-day poland to ethnic germans who were forced out of their homes during the war . several more cases have been submitted since then , and still others are being reviewed in polish courts . " the german government has to take responsibility for the possible financial consequences arising from the compensation claims , " tusk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should expelled german be compensated for what they lost ?
berlin has maintained repeatedly that it does n't support such claims , with then german chancellor gerhard schröder making a binding statement to that effect in warsaw in 2004 . according to german estimates , some 15 million ethnic germans were expelled from their homes during or directly following the war .
some two million are thought to have died in the process . poland fears pipeline puts gas supply at risk plans for a joint russian-german gas pipeline along the baltic sea will be another matter of discussion at tuesday 's meeting . currently , russia sends gas to western europe via poland , but the baltic sea pipeline would circumvent the central european country .
poland has expressed concern that , in a political crisis , russia could shut its gas supply without affecting delivery to - and , hence , relations with - western europe . ahead of tuesday 's talks , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed optimism over the future of bilateral relations . " a concrete program to improve cooperation between the governments is being worked on , " he told the polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza on monday .
" the german and polish ministers will now meet together frequently and regularly . " topics of friction , such as expellee claims and the baltic pipeline would be dealt with " openly and constructively , " he added . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world 's ingo mannteufel says the liberal technocrat will uphold putin 's political course - with or without him as pm . the guessing game is over .
for months now , russian politics have been dominated by the question of who will succeed russian president vladimir putin in march 2008 .
russian law prevents presidents from standing for a third term of office .
speculation was rife about putin 's next move .
one scenario put forward was that putin would alter the constitution .
another saw putin naming a stand-in president , then returning to office after having fulfilled the constitution 's technical requirements .
it was difficult to imagine russia being governed by another politician after eight years of putin .
medvedev certain to be elected the russian president has decided to back dmitry medvedev , first deputy prime minister and board chairman of gas giant gazprom , to stand as a presidential candidate in march 2008 .
given what happened in russian parliamentary poll in early december , it is practically certain that medvedev will be elected in the first round of the elections on march 2 .
the kremlin propaganda machine functions magnificently , the administrative apparatus runs smoothly , and the significant size of russian security forces remove any lingering doubt about the outcome of the poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel there is no point in bemoaning the poor prospects for democracy in russia in the light of such political relations .
the vague and possibly premature hopes for a rapid democratization of russia were snuffed out some time ago .
with his decision in favor of medvedev , president putin has made a bold move and answered a number of questions about himself and russia 's future course .
not just a fill-in president putin will step down as president in march 2008 .
the intention is that 42-year-old medvedev should be president for the next four years - in all likelihood much longer .
medvedev is completely unsuited to just act as a stand-in who would keep the presidential post warm for putin .
in this respect , putin has remained true to himself - in spite of what all his opponents and his sycophantic supporters have said .
after all , he always said he would not violate the constitution in order to remain in office .
however , the end of putin 's presidential era does not spell the end of putin as the leading light in russian politics .
he will retain considerable influence over russian politics as head of united russia , or possibly as prime minister .
we will have to wait and see if putin will take up medvedev 's offer to take on the job of pm under him .
at any rate , medvedev is not expected to usher in any decisive course change .
putin 's longstanding ally has always been directly involved from the outset in shaping and representing putin 's policies in his previous posts .
medvedev looks set to continue pursuing putin 's goal of modernizing russia because he shares his convictions .
the loyal technocrat is the ideal candidate to ensure that putin 's course is maintained without the current president having to resort to any trickery with the constitution .
past will burden relations with europe president medvedev will be blemished by the fact that he has emerged from putin 's powerhouse .
his previous role as chair of the board at gazprom will also not help his popularity in europe given the poor image of the russia energy giant here .
on the other hand , medvedev is not the worst candidate from amongst the current russian elite .
the former law professor from st. petersburg is reputed to be one of the more liberal spirits in the kremlin .
in addition , he has no direct contacts to the soviet or the post-soviet security services .
and given his relative youth , he also stands for a new russia that europe - and the west in general - will have to learn to live with .
the russian president 's decision to select medvedev is not likely to find favor with all of the factions who putin can currently rally behind him .
the effects of a change in president in terms of who has what access to important financial and business resources are not likely to be clear for a while , and the process will not be without its tensions .
the question is whether the first cracks within russia 's kremlin elite will already have become apparent ahead of the elections in march , thus threatening the transfer of power .
then things could get tricky for putin as the one responsible for naming medvedev his political heir .

dw-world 's ingo mannteufel says the liberal technocrat will uphold putin 's political course - with or without him as pm . the guessing game is over .
for months now , russian politics have been dominated by the question of who will succeed russian president vladimir putin in march 2008 .
russian law prevents presidents from standing for a third term of office .
speculation was rife about putin 's next move .
one scenario put forward was that putin would alter the constitution .
another saw putin naming a stand-in president , then returning to office after having fulfilled the constitution 's technical requirements .
it was difficult to imagine russia being governed by another politician after eight years of putin .
medvedev certain to be elected the russian president has decided to back dmitry medvedev , first deputy prime minister and board chairman of gas giant gazprom , to stand as a presidential candidate in march 2008 .
given what happened in russian parliamentary poll in early december , it is practically certain that medvedev will be elected in the first round of the elections on march 2 .
the kremlin propaganda machine functions magnificently , the administrative apparatus runs smoothly , and the significant size of russian security forces remove any lingering doubt about the outcome of the poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel there is no point in bemoaning the poor prospects for democracy in russia in the light of such political relations .
the vague and possibly premature hopes for a rapid democratization of russia were snuffed out some time ago .
with his decision in favor of medvedev , president putin has made a bold move and answered a number of questions about himself and russia 's future course .
not just a fill-in president putin will step down as president in march 2008 .
the intention is that 42-year-old medvedev should be president for the next four years - in all likelihood much longer .
medvedev is completely unsuited to just act as a stand-in who would keep the presidential post warm for putin .
in this respect , putin has remained true to himself - in spite of what all his opponents and his sycophantic supporters have said .
after all , he always said he would not violate the constitution in order to remain in office .
however , the end of putin 's presidential era does not spell the end of putin as the leading light in russian politics .
he will retain considerable influence over russian politics as head of united russia , or possibly as prime minister .
we will have to wait and see if putin will take up medvedev 's offer to take on the job of pm under him .
at any rate , medvedev is not expected to usher in any decisive course change .
putin 's longstanding ally has always been directly involved from the outset in shaping and representing putin 's policies in his previous posts .
medvedev looks set to continue pursuing putin 's goal of modernizing russia because he shares his convictions .
the loyal technocrat is the ideal candidate to ensure that putin 's course is maintained without the current president having to resort to any trickery with the constitution .
past will burden relations with europe president medvedev will be blemished by the fact that he has emerged from putin 's powerhouse .
his previous role as chair of the board at gazprom will also not help his popularity in europe given the poor image of the russia energy giant here .
on the other hand , medvedev is not the worst candidate from amongst the current russian elite .
the former law professor from st. petersburg is reputed to be one of the more liberal spirits in the kremlin .
in addition , he has no direct contacts to the soviet or the post-soviet security services .
and given his relative youth , he also stands for a new russia that europe - and the west in general - will have to learn to live with .
the russian president 's decision to select medvedev is not likely to find favor with all of the factions who putin can currently rally behind him .
the effects of a change in president in terms of who has what access to important financial and business resources are not likely to be clear for a while , and the process will not be without its tensions .
the question is whether the first cracks within russia 's kremlin elite will already have become apparent ahead of the elections in march , thus threatening the transfer of power .
then things could get tricky for putin as the one responsible for naming medvedev his political heir .

dw-world.de putin endorses loyalist medvedev as presidential candidate russian president vladimir putin has backed his ally dimitry medvedev to succeed him next march .
the fact that medvedev 's not a member of putin 's party makes it even more likely that he 'll become russia 's next leader .
-lrb- 10.12.2007 -rrb- putin 's party wins russia elections amid vote-rigging claims vladimir putin 's united russia party won a landslide majority in parliamentary elections , but opposition parties , observers and western nations have criticized the lack of transparency in the election .
-lrb- 03.12.2007 -rrb- russia 's power is greatly exaggerated , say experts sunday 's parliamentary elections in russia may well leave much to be desired in terms of democracy .
but experts on the country say there 's little need to fear the kremlin 's long-term plans .

berlin would rather stick to its own plans for remembrance . poland 's prime minister , donald tusk , called on monday , dec .
10 , for a grand-scale world war ii museum in the northern polish city of gdansk , the site of the nazi invasion on sept .
1 , 1939 . other countries , including germany , russia and israel could have a part in the museum , which was proposed as an alternative to a plan for an exhibition in berlin to remember german expellees from central and eastern europe during and just after world war ii . in the large gdansk museum , " the fate of expellees would have a place in a conclusive and comprehensive context , " said tusk in an interview with the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . the coastal city of gdansk , located on the baltic sea , is ripe with symbolic meaning . " the war began here , but in a sense it also ended here when the solidarity movement was founded in 1980 , " tusk said . started by polish laborers under lech walesa , solidarity , or solidarnosc , played a key role in the fall of communism in the former east-bloc country . berlin adamant about expulsion center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk became prime minister last month in response , the german government made it clear that tusk 's statement would have no bearing on plans for the expulsion center .
the governing coalition agreed in their founding contract in 2005 to set up a " visible sign of remembrance against expulsion " in berlin , said government spokesman thomas steg . the conflict began some seven years ago when the league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- started a foundation for a proposed expellee center .
the organization , which campaigns for the rights and remembrance of ethnic german expellees , has been seen in poland as overstating german suffering surrounding the holocaust . " the problem is not that anyone wants to prevent the germans from remembering the suffering of their own people , " tusk said .
" it becomes problematic when this remembrance of the german suffering diminishes another memory - namely that of the collective responsibility of the germans . " points of contention on tusk-merkel agenda the question of remembrance is likely to be a major agenda point when tusk meets with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin on tuesday . the two leaders are also slated to broach the ongoing issue of restitution claims for german expellees and re-settlers . the prussian claims society submitted claims for 22 individual claims cases to the european court for human rights in strasbourg in 2006 , requesting the return of land and property in present-day poland to ethnic germans who were forced out of their homes during the war . several more cases have been submitted since then , and still others are being reviewed in polish courts . " the german government has to take responsibility for the possible financial consequences arising from the compensation claims , " tusk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should expelled german be compensated for what they lost ?
berlin has maintained repeatedly that it does n't support such claims , with then german chancellor gerhard schröder making a binding statement to that effect in warsaw in 2004 . according to german estimates , some 15 million ethnic germans were expelled from their homes during or directly following the war .
some two million are thought to have died in the process . poland fears pipeline puts gas supply at risk plans for a joint russian-german gas pipeline along the baltic sea will be another matter of discussion at tuesday 's meeting . currently , russia sends gas to western europe via poland , but the baltic sea pipeline would circumvent the central european country .
poland has expressed concern that , in a political crisis , russia could shut its gas supply without affecting delivery to - and , hence , relations with - western europe . ahead of tuesday 's talks , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed optimism over the future of bilateral relations . " a concrete program to improve cooperation between the governments is being worked on , " he told the polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza on monday .

liz mohn leads family-run bertelsmann ag , the world 's fifth largest media conglomerate .
in an interview for dw-world.de 's chinese web site , she explained why love and respect are vital for global business success . dw-world.de : you 've spent a lot of time in china - what are your impressions ?
liz mohn : i am in awe of the chinese for making such an enormous economic leap .
it takes time to change a culture - you ca n't do it from one day to the next .
but they are really accomplishing a lot there .
it shows that the chinese people today are well educated .
without brains and talent , they could n't do it .
i also think the government learned they need to be careful about how to make people follow their ideas .
do germans see china 's economic growth and political importance as a challenge - or a threat ?
neither nor .
we have such a huge market in china .
it offers huge opportunities for both europe and china , not just on one side .
it is a unique experience .
there has n't been anything like it , any time since -lsb- world war ii -rsb- : that a whole world opens up , and we have the good fortune to experience it .
german chancellor angela merkel recently invited the dalai lama to visit germany , which has been hard on the relationship between china and germany .
what is your take on that ?
i think when different cultures come together , mistakes can be made on both sides .
in the christian religion , we say people should forgive .
without mistakes , we ca n't learn .
but i think different cultures do n't learn to understand each other overnight .
does bertelsmann have a long-term strategy in china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing once had bikes , now there are cars bertelsmann has been growing in china since 1995 and it is a market that we want to get into even more .
i think everything we do there is on a long-term basis .
there are so many questions you ca n't answer immediately .
things change so quickly with globalization .
bertelsmann has a long history .
what are you particularly proud of ?
we are the only media concern world-wide that is involved with so many different cultures .
when we went overseas , we respected the other cultures .
that was the strength of our company after the war .
despite the age of digitalization , statistics show germans still read a lot .
that is different in china though .
is your china strategy successful ?
as far as i know , the chinese like to read .
they are a cultured people .
but today people may be more likely to take an audio book , sure .
new times call for new measures .
i 'm amazed when i see the changes on the streets in china today .
how full they are with cars .
when i first started going to china , 12 or 13 years ago , it was bikes , then mopeds .
i found it fascinating to watch the changes - and i am amazed as how much they have achieved .
before china opened up to the west , people had little freedom .
now , young people are colorful .
they 've gotten more room to think , to live .
you claim that bertelsmann 's management culture relies on individuality and creativity .
how can we know that this is n't just lip service ?
after all , centralized leadership and hierarchy can be practical .
because without this management culture , bertelsmann would never have been as successful as it has been .
through our wartime experiences , and before the war , we saw what it meant to have a dictatorship .
no freedom .
later we saw that if you give people freedom to be creative and to think , then they are motivated .
when you are fair to people , and respect them , then people come together and work together , and you get a great success .
you have worked alongside your husband -lrb- bertelsmann owner reinhard mohn -rrb- , and been increasingly active , for years .
what aspect of your own personality is visible in bertelsmann 's culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard mohn , now 85 , has handed much power to his wife first i think that it is important to teach basic values - love and respect .
and to know that it is important to give something to society , not just take .
now , china is starting to develop charitable foundations .
i find that great .
and citizens are starting to create businesses that also help society .
these are huge advances .
you 've said creating a management style is bertelsmann 's most important business tool , given globalization .
is that true ?
yes .
for example , from our headquarters , we can not simply order around one of our managers in china .
he has to use his own head , his own ideas .
but at the same time , he needs to keep in mind the greater goals for company are .
he needs to know … what kind of mental and spiritual orientation we have , our values .
what are some other challenges for bertelsmann ?
finding good talent .
people who can lead worldwide .
you have sometimes been called an " iron lady " - is this an accurate description ?
well , i would n't say i am " ironclad . "
i might say : you need to use power to get something done .
otherwise you do n't get anywhere in this world .
you need to have a goal , and bring people along with you .
what other qualities make a good business leader ?
i like dealing with people very much , and that 's why i like my job so much .
i get to dialog with people from all over the world .
and i see that the more i learn , the more i have the feeling that i know nothing at all .
your story - you were a telephone operator who has become the head of a fifth-generation business family - is widely known .
is your life really like a fairy tale ?
no .
the people who know me well , know that you never get to the top without discipline and hard work .
you just ca n't do it any other way .
you also have to make mistakes .
that is a burden .
i think i was fortunate to meet a man who both helped me come into more responsibility in this part of my life , and to experience what i do today .
next year we will have been married for 50 years .
that is a long time .
you still appreciate your husband so much after 50 years of marriage ?
that 's unusual these days .
he is a great businessman , a great person , a great philosopher , he is never arrogant , always humble .
he 's always working on behalf of the workers in our company , and many of our employees look up to him as an example . interview : zhu hong -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

liz mohn leads family-run bertelsmann ag , the world 's fifth largest media conglomerate .
in an interview for dw-world.de 's chinese web site , she explained why love and respect are vital for global business success . dw-world.de : you 've spent a lot of time in china - what are your impressions ?
liz mohn : i am in awe of the chinese for making such an enormous economic leap .
it takes time to change a culture - you ca n't do it from one day to the next .
but they are really accomplishing a lot there .
it shows that the chinese people today are well educated .
without brains and talent , they could n't do it .
i also think the government learned they need to be careful about how to make people follow their ideas .
do germans see china 's economic growth and political importance as a challenge - or a threat ?
neither nor .
we have such a huge market in china .
it offers huge opportunities for both europe and china , not just on one side .
it is a unique experience .
there has n't been anything like it , any time since -lsb- world war ii -rsb- : that a whole world opens up , and we have the good fortune to experience it .
german chancellor angela merkel recently invited the dalai lama to visit germany , which has been hard on the relationship between china and germany .
what is your take on that ?
i think when different cultures come together , mistakes can be made on both sides .
in the christian religion , we say people should forgive .
without mistakes , we ca n't learn .
but i think different cultures do n't learn to understand each other overnight .
does bertelsmann have a long-term strategy in china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing once had bikes , now there are cars bertelsmann has been growing in china since 1995 and it is a market that we want to get into even more .
i think everything we do there is on a long-term basis .
there are so many questions you ca n't answer immediately .
things change so quickly with globalization .
bertelsmann has a long history .
what are you particularly proud of ?
we are the only media concern world-wide that is involved with so many different cultures .
when we went overseas , we respected the other cultures .
that was the strength of our company after the war .
despite the age of digitalization , statistics show germans still read a lot .
that is different in china though .
is your china strategy successful ?
as far as i know , the chinese like to read .
they are a cultured people .
but today people may be more likely to take an audio book , sure .
new times call for new measures .
i 'm amazed when i see the changes on the streets in china today .
how full they are with cars .
when i first started going to china , 12 or 13 years ago , it was bikes , then mopeds .
i found it fascinating to watch the changes - and i am amazed as how much they have achieved .
before china opened up to the west , people had little freedom .
now , young people are colorful .
they 've gotten more room to think , to live .
you claim that bertelsmann 's management culture relies on individuality and creativity .
how can we know that this is n't just lip service ?
after all , centralized leadership and hierarchy can be practical .
because without this management culture , bertelsmann would never have been as successful as it has been .
through our wartime experiences , and before the war , we saw what it meant to have a dictatorship .
no freedom .
later we saw that if you give people freedom to be creative and to think , then they are motivated .
when you are fair to people , and respect them , then people come together and work together , and you get a great success .
you have worked alongside your husband -lrb- bertelsmann owner reinhard mohn -rrb- , and been increasingly active , for years .
what aspect of your own personality is visible in bertelsmann 's culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard mohn , now 85 , has handed much power to his wife first i think that it is important to teach basic values - love and respect .
and to know that it is important to give something to society , not just take .
now , china is starting to develop charitable foundations .
i find that great .
and citizens are starting to create businesses that also help society .
these are huge advances .
you 've said creating a management style is bertelsmann 's most important business tool , given globalization .
is that true ?
yes .
for example , from our headquarters , we can not simply order around one of our managers in china .
he has to use his own head , his own ideas .
but at the same time , he needs to keep in mind the greater goals for company are .
he needs to know … what kind of mental and spiritual orientation we have , our values .
what are some other challenges for bertelsmann ?
finding good talent .
people who can lead worldwide .
you have sometimes been called an " iron lady " - is this an accurate description ?
well , i would n't say i am " ironclad . "
i might say : you need to use power to get something done .
otherwise you do n't get anywhere in this world .
you need to have a goal , and bring people along with you .
what other qualities make a good business leader ?
i like dealing with people very much , and that 's why i like my job so much .
i get to dialog with people from all over the world .
and i see that the more i learn , the more i have the feeling that i know nothing at all .
your story - you were a telephone operator who has become the head of a fifth-generation business family - is widely known .
is your life really like a fairy tale ?
no .
the people who know me well , know that you never get to the top without discipline and hard work .
you just ca n't do it any other way .
you also have to make mistakes .
that is a burden .
i think i was fortunate to meet a man who both helped me come into more responsibility in this part of my life , and to experience what i do today .
next year we will have been married for 50 years .
that is a long time .
you still appreciate your husband so much after 50 years of marriage ?
that 's unusual these days .
he is a great businessman , a great person , a great philosopher , he is never arrogant , always humble .
he 's always working on behalf of the workers in our company , and many of our employees look up to him as an example . interview : zhu hong -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing once had bikes , now there are cars bertelsmann has been growing in china since 1995 and it is a market that we want to get into even more .
i think everything we do there is on a long-term basis .
there are so many questions you ca n't answer immediately .
things change so quickly with globalization .
bertelsmann has a long history .
what are you particularly proud of ?
we are the only media concern world-wide that is involved with so many different cultures .
when we went overseas , we respected the other cultures .
that was the strength of our company after the war .
despite the age of digitalization , statistics show germans still read a lot .
that is different in china though .
is your china strategy successful ?
as far as i know , the chinese like to read .
they are a cultured people .
but today people may be more likely to take an audio book , sure .
new times call for new measures .
i 'm amazed when i see the changes on the streets in china today .
how full they are with cars .
when i first started going to china , 12 or 13 years ago , it was bikes , then mopeds .
i found it fascinating to watch the changes - and i am amazed as how much they have achieved .
before china opened up to the west , people had little freedom .
now , young people are colorful .
they 've gotten more room to think , to live .
you claim that bertelsmann 's management culture relies on individuality and creativity .
how can we know that this is n't just lip service ?
after all , centralized leadership and hierarchy can be practical .
because without this management culture , bertelsmann would never have been as successful as it has been .
through our wartime experiences , and before the war , we saw what it meant to have a dictatorship .
no freedom .
later we saw that if you give people freedom to be creative and to think , then they are motivated .
when you are fair to people , and respect them , then people come together and work together , and you get a great success .
you have worked alongside your husband -lrb- bertelsmann owner reinhard mohn -rrb- , and been increasingly active , for years .
what aspect of your own personality is visible in bertelsmann 's culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard mohn , now 85 , has handed much power to his wife first i think that it is important to teach basic values - love and respect .
and to know that it is important to give something to society , not just take .
now , china is starting to develop charitable foundations .
i find that great .
and citizens are starting to create businesses that also help society .
these are huge advances .
you 've said creating a management style is bertelsmann 's most important business tool , given globalization .
is that true ?
yes .
for example , from our headquarters , we can not simply order around one of our managers in china .
he has to use his own head , his own ideas .
but at the same time , he needs to keep in mind the greater goals for company are .
he needs to know … what kind of mental and spiritual orientation we have , our values .
what are some other challenges for bertelsmann ?
finding good talent .
people who can lead worldwide .
you have sometimes been called an " iron lady " - is this an accurate description ?
well , i would n't say i am " ironclad . "
i might say : you need to use power to get something done .
otherwise you do n't get anywhere in this world .
you need to have a goal , and bring people along with you .
what other qualities make a good business leader ?
i like dealing with people very much , and that 's why i like my job so much .
i get to dialog with people from all over the world .
and i see that the more i learn , the more i have the feeling that i know nothing at all .
your story - you were a telephone operator who has become the head of a fifth-generation business family - is widely known .
is your life really like a fairy tale ?
no .
the people who know me well , know that you never get to the top without discipline and hard work .
you just ca n't do it any other way .
you also have to make mistakes .
that is a burden .
i think i was fortunate to meet a man who both helped me come into more responsibility in this part of my life , and to experience what i do today .
next year we will have been married for 50 years .
that is a long time .
you still appreciate your husband so much after 50 years of marriage ?
that 's unusual these days .
he is a great businessman , a great person , a great philosopher , he is never arrogant , always humble .
he 's always working on behalf of the workers in our company , and many of our employees look up to him as an example . interview : zhu hong -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

liz mohn leads family-run bertelsmann ag , the world 's fifth largest media conglomerate .
in an interview for dw-world.de 's chinese web site , she explained why love and respect are vital for global business success . dw-world.de : you 've spent a lot of time in china - what are your impressions ?
liz mohn : i am in awe of the chinese for making such an enormous economic leap .
it takes time to change a culture - you ca n't do it from one day to the next .
but they are really accomplishing a lot there .
it shows that the chinese people today are well educated .
without brains and talent , they could n't do it .
i also think the government learned they need to be careful about how to make people follow their ideas .
do germans see china 's economic growth and political importance as a challenge - or a threat ?
neither nor .
we have such a huge market in china .
it offers huge opportunities for both europe and china , not just on one side .
it is a unique experience .

german chancellor angela merkel recently invited the dalai lama to visit germany , which has been hard on the relationship between china and germany .
what is your take on that ?

" within 24 hours , russia appears to have ended months of speculation over the country 's political future . putin has not yet given his response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin will retain some power after stepping down in march in a televised speech following medvedev 's surprise statement , putin did not comment on this suggestion and no timeframe was suggested for the switch .
but putin has long said that he wanted to retain an important role after leaving the kremlin . analyst vyacheslav nikonov told the interfax news agency : " if medvedev announced it , then the likelihood is that it will take place . " the decision raises questions of whether medvedev would act as an independent leader or merely as a figurehead for putin .
this was fueled by the president-in-waiting 's additional announcement on tuesday that russia must pursue the course set by putin over the past eight years . putin , who is constitutionally barred from standing for a third term of office , gave his endorsement to medvedev on monday , saying he " fully and completely " supported him .
given the current president 's huge domestic popularity , medvedev is practically guaranteed to be elected . putin enjoys a huge following at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : years of plotting for others have paid off for medvedev tuesday 's shake-up comes a week after the united russia party won a landslide victory in parliamentary elections on a ticket headed by putin , who campaigned on the buzz words of " stability " and " continuity . " putin first appointed medvedev in the early 1990s in st. petersburg , where both attended the same law school .
he quickly rose from campaign manager in 2000 to head of the presidential administration and gazprom chairman . he is reputed to be relatively liberal-minded in comparison with his main competitor , fellow putin advisor and former defense minister sergei ivanov . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" within 24 hours , russia appears to have ended months of speculation over the country 's political future . putin has not yet given his response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin will retain some power after stepping down in march in a televised speech following medvedev 's surprise statement , putin did not comment on this suggestion and no timeframe was suggested for the switch .
but putin has long said that he wanted to retain an important role after leaving the kremlin . analyst vyacheslav nikonov told the interfax news agency : " if medvedev announced it , then the likelihood is that it will take place . " the decision raises questions of whether medvedev would act as an independent leader or merely as a figurehead for putin .
this was fueled by the president-in-waiting 's additional announcement on tuesday that russia must pursue the course set by putin over the past eight years . putin , who is constitutionally barred from standing for a third term of office , gave his endorsement to medvedev on monday , saying he " fully and completely " supported him .
given the current president 's huge domestic popularity , medvedev is practically guaranteed to be elected . putin enjoys a huge following at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : years of plotting for others have paid off for medvedev tuesday 's shake-up comes a week after the united russia party won a landslide victory in parliamentary elections on a ticket headed by putin , who campaigned on the buzz words of " stability " and " continuity . " putin first appointed medvedev in the early 1990s in st. petersburg , where both attended the same law school .
he quickly rose from campaign manager in 2000 to head of the presidential administration and gazprom chairman . he is reputed to be relatively liberal-minded in comparison with his main competitor , fellow putin advisor and former defense minister sergei ivanov . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the expected declaration of independence by kosovo has a number of nations on edge .
those who oppose kosovo 's autonomy harbor separatists of their own .
a free kosovo could be just the rallying call these movements need . with all the signs pointing towards a declaration of independence from kosovo after the un-set deadline for reaching a settlement passes on monday , the european union is bracing itself for a wave of renewed calls for autonomy from separatist movements across europe .
if kosovo declares independence from serbia , it will set a powerful precedent for movements from spain to scotland , all wanting to rewrite the map of europe and form their own independent states , according to experts .
" there is a real risk that the quasi-dogma of the intangibility of borders which has existed since the end of the world war ii will fall , " french political scientist jean-yves camus of the paris-based iris institute told afp .
" this would benefit movements which seek to rewrite the map of europe based on ethnic , linguistic or cultural criteria , " added camus , a specialist on separatist movements in europe .
the emergence of similar lifestyles and english as a common language in europe , combined with the disappearance of borders and the lack of democratic legitimacy of eu bodies , had fueled " the development of micro-distinctive identities , " said camus .
while kosovo 's ethnic majority leaders have vowed not to unilaterally declare independence from serbia without us and european union approval , they are expected to announce their intentions to form a new state in early 2008 .
opposition includes fear of own breakaway states many of the countries which oppose the creation of an independent state of kosovo have at least one separatist movement working towards autonomy within their own borders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has been fighting chechen separatists for years serbia 's ally russia , which leads the opposition , has problems with separatists in chechnya and the caucasus region while spain has had a long-running dispute with the armed eta movement .
other countries against kosovo 's independence such as cyprus and greece have ethnic minorities which demand more power .
" in the west , this -lsb- kosovo -rsb- solution will set off separatists in europe , ” russian president vladimir putin said in an interview published in french newspaper le figaro earlier this year . ” look at scotland , catalonia and the basque country . "
spain is currently experiencing a period of unease as its northern basque country and its wealthy northeastern region of catalonia have stepped up their demands for more autonomy .
last year catalan voters overwhelmingly backed a new charter which recognized the region as a " nation " within spain and grants it enhanced powers in taxation and judicial matters .
separatists claim eu structure makes autonomy possible as in other separatist regions of europe like flanders , the dutch-speaking northern part of belgium , and northern italy , supporters said catalonia deserved extra powers because it makes a bigger contribution to the economy .
the armed basque separatist group eta ended a 15-month ceasefire in june while the scottish national party , which came to power in may , plans to hold a referendum on independence in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lingusitic divisions have led to a debate on splitting belgium belgium meanwhile has been without a government for six months after a general election on june 10 highlighted deep divisions between the nation 's majority dutch-speakers and francophones .
for many nationalists , membership in the 27-nation european union has only served to make separation seem more viable .
" europe can regulate our functionings and transfer payments .
why must we maintain this intermediate roof we call belgium , " the leader of the flemish nationalist party , bart de wever , told french daily le monde last month .
russia to block independence at un level meanwhile , russia stepped up its opposition tuesday by announcing that it would demand that the un security council annul any unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo .
" russia will of course demand the annulment of such a decision .
we will demand a meeting of the security council because it would be a violation of a council resolution , " russia 's interfax news agency quoted the country 's chief kosovo negotiator alexander botsan-kharchenko as saying . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the war began here , but in a sense it also ended here when the solidarity movement was founded in 1980 , " tusk said . started by polish laborers under lech walesa , solidarity , or solidarnosc , played a key role in the fall of communism in the former east-bloc country . berlin adamant about expulsion center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk became prime minister last month in response , the german government made it clear that tusk 's statement would have no bearing on plans for the expulsion center .
the governing coalition agreed in their founding contract in 2005 to set up a " visible sign of remembrance against expulsion " in berlin , said government spokesman thomas steg . the conflict began some seven years ago when the league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- started a foundation for a proposed expellee center .
the organization , which campaigns for the rights and remembrance of ethnic german expellees , has been seen in poland as overstating german suffering surrounding the holocaust . " the problem is not that anyone wants to prevent the germans from remembering the suffering of their own people , " tusk said .
" it becomes problematic when this remembrance of the german suffering diminishes another memory - namely that of the collective responsibility of the germans . " points of contention on tusk-merkel agenda the question of remembrance is likely to be a major agenda point when tusk meets with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin on tuesday . the two leaders are also slated to broach the ongoing issue of restitution claims for german expellees and re-settlers . the prussian claims society submitted claims for 22 individual claims cases to the european court for human rights in strasbourg in 2006 , requesting the return of land and property in present-day poland to ethnic germans who were forced out of their homes during the war . several more cases have been submitted since then , and still others are being reviewed in polish courts . " the german government has to take responsibility for the possible financial consequences arising from the compensation claims , " tusk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should expelled german be compensated for what they lost ?
berlin has maintained repeatedly that it does n't support such claims , with then german chancellor gerhard schröder making a binding statement to that effect in warsaw in 2004 . according to german estimates , some 15 million ethnic germans were expelled from their homes during or directly following the war .
some two million are thought to have died in the process . poland fears pipeline puts gas supply at risk plans for a joint russian-german gas pipeline along the baltic sea will be another matter of discussion at tuesday 's meeting . currently , russia sends gas to western europe via poland , but the baltic sea pipeline would circumvent the central european country .
poland has expressed concern that , in a political crisis , russia could shut its gas supply without affecting delivery to - and , hence , relations with - western europe . ahead of tuesday 's talks , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed optimism over the future of bilateral relations . " a concrete program to improve cooperation between the governments is being worked on , " he told the polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 11.12.2007 hamburg bans weapons in tough neighborhoods großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law goes way beyond traditional weaponry a new law aims to make hamburg 's red-light district , the reeperbahn , completely weapons free .
the ban encompasses not only guns and knives , but baseball bats as well .
some say that 's not going far enough . the law is based on federal legislation , passed earlier this year , allowing local states to prohibit items that can be used to endanger public safety - including fake guns .
hamburg took the lead in pushing for such legislation and is the first state within germany to enact a prohibition on the local level .
the ban covers air rifles , billy clubs , brass knuckles , baseball bats , pepper spray and most forms of mace .
carrying any of those items in the neighborhoods affected by the law can be punished with a fine of up to 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,700 -rrb- .
" this is a further element promoting the safety of people in our city , " hamburg 's interior minister , udo nagel , told the ap news agency .
" by changing the laws we finally have the possibility of reigning in violence in areas that are especially at risk . "
criminal gangs are active on the reeperbahn , and knife fights and attacks with dangerous items occur with relative frequency .
too little or waste of time ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's reeperbahn is a popular attraction - despite crime rates hamburg 's governing conservatives and police hope the bans will reduce violent crime in troubled neighborhoods .
but not everyone likes the prohibition in its current form .
green party parliamentary and interior affairs experts antje möller has called for the ban to be extended to the entire city .
she also says that something should be done about shops that sell the items concerned - of which there are a number on and near the reeperbahn .
" it ca n't be the case that you 're not allowed to carry weapons , but trading in them is publicly accepted , " möller told the german public broadcaster ndr .
others question whether the ban will have any practical affect .
" anyone serious bent on robbing , raping or murdering others is n't interested in legislation - and certainly not in weapons legislation , " wrote one blogger on the german internet news site shortnews .
it will take time to see if the weapons ban succeeds in reducing crime in hamburg .
in the meantime , anyone wanting a pick up game of baseball in the city should probably steer clear of the reeperbahn . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the intention is that 42-year-old medvedev should be president for the next four years - in all likelihood much longer .
medvedev is completely unsuited to just act as a stand-in who would keep the presidential post warm for putin .
in this respect , putin has remained true to himself - in spite of what all his opponents and his sycophantic supporters have said .

however , the end of putin 's presidential era does not spell the end of putin as the leading light in russian politics .
he will retain considerable influence over russian politics as head of united russia , or possibly as prime minister .
we will have to wait and see if putin will take up medvedev 's offer to take on the job of pm under him .

putin 's longstanding ally has always been directly involved from the outset in shaping and representing putin 's policies in his previous posts .

the former law professor from st. petersburg is reputed to be one of the more liberal spirits in the kremlin .

the expected declaration of independence by kosovo has a number of nations on edge .
those who oppose kosovo 's autonomy harbor separatists of their own .
a free kosovo could be just the rallying call these movements need . with all the signs pointing towards a declaration of independence from kosovo after the un-set deadline for reaching a settlement passes on monday , the european union is bracing itself for a wave of renewed calls for autonomy from separatist movements across europe .
if kosovo declares independence from serbia , it will set a powerful precedent for movements from spain to scotland , all wanting to rewrite the map of europe and form their own independent states , according to experts .
" there is a real risk that the quasi-dogma of the intangibility of borders which has existed since the end of the world war ii will fall , " french political scientist jean-yves camus of the paris-based iris institute told afp .
" this would benefit movements which seek to rewrite the map of europe based on ethnic , linguistic or cultural criteria , " added camus , a specialist on separatist movements in europe .
the emergence of similar lifestyles and english as a common language in europe , combined with the disappearance of borders and the lack of democratic legitimacy of eu bodies , had fueled " the development of micro-distinctive identities , " said camus .
while kosovo 's ethnic majority leaders have vowed not to unilaterally declare independence from serbia without us and european union approval , they are expected to announce their intentions to form a new state in early 2008 .
opposition includes fear of own breakaway states many of the countries which oppose the creation of an independent state of kosovo have at least one separatist movement working towards autonomy within their own borders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has been fighting chechen separatists for years serbia 's ally russia , which leads the opposition , has problems with separatists in chechnya and the caucasus region while spain has had a long-running dispute with the armed eta movement .
other countries against kosovo 's independence such as cyprus and greece have ethnic minorities which demand more power .
" in the west , this -lsb- kosovo -rsb- solution will set off separatists in europe , ” russian president vladimir putin said in an interview published in french newspaper le figaro earlier this year . ” look at scotland , catalonia and the basque country . "
spain is currently experiencing a period of unease as its northern basque country and its wealthy northeastern region of catalonia have stepped up their demands for more autonomy .
last year catalan voters overwhelmingly backed a new charter which recognized the region as a " nation " within spain and grants it enhanced powers in taxation and judicial matters .
separatists claim eu structure makes autonomy possible as in other separatist regions of europe like flanders , the dutch-speaking northern part of belgium , and northern italy , supporters said catalonia deserved extra powers because it makes a bigger contribution to the economy .
the armed basque separatist group eta ended a 15-month ceasefire in june while the scottish national party , which came to power in may , plans to hold a referendum on independence in 2010 .

" europe can regulate our functionings and transfer payments .
why must we maintain this intermediate roof we call belgium , " the leader of the flemish nationalist party , bart de wever , told french daily le monde last month .
russia to block independence at un level meanwhile , russia stepped up its opposition tuesday by announcing that it would demand that the un security council annul any unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo .

the expected declaration of independence by kosovo has a number of nations on edge .

a free kosovo could be just the rallying call these movements need . with all the signs pointing towards a declaration of independence from kosovo after the un-set deadline for reaching a settlement passes on monday , the european union is bracing itself for a wave of renewed calls for autonomy from separatist movements across europe .
if kosovo declares independence from serbia , it will set a powerful precedent for movements from spain to scotland , all wanting to rewrite the map of europe and form their own independent states , according to experts .
" there is a real risk that the quasi-dogma of the intangibility of borders which has existed since the end of the world war ii will fall , " french political scientist jean-yves camus of the paris-based iris institute told afp .
" this would benefit movements which seek to rewrite the map of europe based on ethnic , linguistic or cultural criteria , " added camus , a specialist on separatist movements in europe .
the emergence of similar lifestyles and english as a common language in europe , combined with the disappearance of borders and the lack of democratic legitimacy of eu bodies , had fueled " the development of micro-distinctive identities , " said camus .
while kosovo 's ethnic majority leaders have vowed not to unilaterally declare independence from serbia without us and european union approval , they are expected to announce their intentions to form a new state in early 2008 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 11.12.2007 hamburg bans weapons in tough neighborhoods großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law goes way beyond traditional weaponry a new law aims to make hamburg 's red-light district , the reeperbahn , completely weapons free .
the ban encompasses not only guns and knives , but baseball bats as well .
some say that 's not going far enough . the law is based on federal legislation , passed earlier this year , allowing local states to prohibit items that can be used to endanger public safety - including fake guns .
hamburg took the lead in pushing for such legislation and is the first state within germany to enact a prohibition on the local level .
the ban covers air rifles , billy clubs , brass knuckles , baseball bats , pepper spray and most forms of mace .
carrying any of those items in the neighborhoods affected by the law can be punished with a fine of up to 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,700 -rrb- .
" this is a further element promoting the safety of people in our city , " hamburg 's interior minister , udo nagel , told the ap news agency .
" by changing the laws we finally have the possibility of reigning in violence in areas that are especially at risk . "
criminal gangs are active on the reeperbahn , and knife fights and attacks with dangerous items occur with relative frequency .
too little or waste of time ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's reeperbahn is a popular attraction - despite crime rates hamburg 's governing conservatives and police hope the bans will reduce violent crime in troubled neighborhoods .
but not everyone likes the prohibition in its current form .
green party parliamentary and interior affairs experts antje möller has called for the ban to be extended to the entire city .
she also says that something should be done about shops that sell the items concerned - of which there are a number on and near the reeperbahn .
" it ca n't be the case that you 're not allowed to carry weapons , but trading in them is publicly accepted , " möller told the german public broadcaster ndr .
others question whether the ban will have any practical affect .
" anyone serious bent on robbing , raping or murdering others is n't interested in legislation - and certainly not in weapons legislation , " wrote one blogger on the german internet news site shortnews .
it will take time to see if the weapons ban succeeds in reducing crime in hamburg .
in the meantime , anyone wanting a pick up game of baseball in the city should probably steer clear of the reeperbahn . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . senator barack obama is by a wide margin the best candidate in the us presidential race .
his views on the environment , foreign policy , the war in iraq , and several other domestic issues , i.e. health care , are all the reasons that he is very popular with young and old alike . - douglas grieser , us i ca n't believe that europeans are so foolish as to believe that mrs. clinton would be a good president .
she has lied and twisted the truth from the very beginning .
she has no experience at all .
she has done nothing as senator either for new york or the us .
europeans are liberal , i know .
but , honestly - wake up ! - brent donohoe , us hillary all the way ! - willy much , canada if the objective is to win the nomination , hillary has the edge at this point .
if , however , we democrats actually want to win the election then obama is the only possible choice .
hillary would fire up the republicans like nothing ever has .
obama , on the other hand , is very charismatic and is already showing signs of picking up a few republican votes .
we democrats have a very bad habit of nominating candidates who have zero chance of winning the election .
hopefully that lesson has at last been learned .
many of us like hillary , but not enough to see another republican president !
obama is the only candidate who can prevent another two-term republican president . - steven morgan , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no readers mentioned the republican party front-runners ron paul is the only person i can vote for in the 2008 presidential race .
willi fausz , us hillary clinton has more government experience than mr. obama .
it 's too bad that mr. obama does n't want to be vice president , they would make a great team running for office together . - glen s. poskarbiewicz , us hillary clinton sold out to insurance and pharmaceutical company pressure when she was working on a national health plan and has received a lot of money from them for her campaign .
barack obama is the only candidate , as far as i know , who will not accept contributions from big business interests .
he has my vote . - loueda jensen , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de poll : europeans and americans prefer hillary clinton as president europeans and americans agreed that hillary clinton would make the best us president of those running for the position in a poll published on friday , dec .

chancellor angela merkel was all ears .
but will talking about disagreements solve anything ? " there should be no taboo subjects , " tusk said at the press conference after the two-hour meeting with merkel in berlin on tuesday , dec .
11 .
" we are friends , and friends ca n't get themselves into a situation of not talking to one another . "
tusk 's tone stood in marked contrast to that of his conservative predecessor , jaroslav kaczynski , who often seemed to go out of his way to offend german sensibilities .
the more eu-friendly tusk defeated kaczynski in poland 's hotly contested national election in november .
merkel was keen to echo the theme of a new polish-german frankness and friendship .
" we 've pledged not dodge any problems , " merkel said .
" together we can get a lot accomplished . "
a problematic past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as per the schengen agreement , the german-polish border will be opened in 2008 tusk and merkel arranged to meet with czech prime minister mirek topolanek on dec .
21 to discuss the opening of borders between the three countries .
and they also addressed two of the most contentious issues dividing poland and germany .
one of them is how to remember the past and , specifically , a planned memorial in berlin to expellees during world war ii - including germans driven from their homes in poland .
many poles see the project as an attempt to revise history and lessen germany 's wartime culpability .
tusk said he favored treating the subject of expellees of all nationalities in a museum about world war ii to be built in the city of gdansk , which used to be part of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is no doubt happy to have a new counterpart in warsaw merkel asserted that a museum could not replace the berlin memorial , but said that she supported the museum idea .
she also promised to send a delegation to warsaw to keep poland informed about the memorial and said germany had no interest in reviving past conflicts .
" there are no demands whatsoever for reparations from poland -lsb- to german refugees -rsb- , " merkel said .
" no german government is going to take a position that deviates from this . "
tusk said he welcomed the assurance as a " moment with symbolic value . "
a present pipeline merkel also discussed the natural-gas pipeline to be built under the baltic sea , which would connect germany with russia but bypass poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic pipeline remains a major sticking point tusk suggested that a meeting be arranged between the three countries to discuss the project in its current form .
such a meeting , he said , could bring about " positive corrections on both sides . "
the pipeline , which was negotiated by merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , has angered many poles , who worry about being held hostage on energy policy by russia and feel they have been ignored by their more powerful neighbors .
clearly , much work needs to be done to resolve such conflicts of interest , but tusk 's visit did re-establish a more civil tone between germany and poland .
he and merkel will have a chance to continue their open exchanges when they meet in the eastern german city of zittau in 10 days ' time . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world 's ingo mannteufel says the liberal technocrat will uphold putin 's political course - with or without him as pm . the guessing game is over .
for months now , russian politics have been dominated by the question of who will succeed russian president vladimir putin in march 2008 .
russian law prevents presidents from standing for a third term of office .
speculation was rife about putin 's next move .
one scenario put forward was that putin would alter the constitution .
another saw putin naming a stand-in president , then returning to office after having fulfilled the constitution 's technical requirements .
it was difficult to imagine russia being governed by another politician after eight years of putin .
medvedev certain to be elected the russian president has decided to back dmitry medvedev , first deputy prime minister and board chairman of gas giant gazprom , to stand as a presidential candidate in march 2008 .
given what happened in russian parliamentary poll in early december , it is practically certain that medvedev will be elected in the first round of the elections on march 2 .
the kremlin propaganda machine functions magnificently , the administrative apparatus runs smoothly , and the significant size of russian security forces remove any lingering doubt about the outcome of the poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel there is no point in bemoaning the poor prospects for democracy in russia in the light of such political relations .
the vague and possibly premature hopes for a rapid democratization of russia were snuffed out some time ago .
with his decision in favor of medvedev , president putin has made a bold move and answered a number of questions about himself and russia 's future course .
not just a fill-in president putin will step down as president in march 2008 .
the intention is that 42-year-old medvedev should be president for the next four years - in all likelihood much longer .
medvedev is completely unsuited to just act as a stand-in who would keep the presidential post warm for putin .
in this respect , putin has remained true to himself - in spite of what all his opponents and his sycophantic supporters have said .
after all , he always said he would not violate the constitution in order to remain in office .
however , the end of putin 's presidential era does not spell the end of putin as the leading light in russian politics .
he will retain considerable influence over russian politics as head of united russia , or possibly as prime minister .
we will have to wait and see if putin will take up medvedev 's offer to take on the job of pm under him .
at any rate , medvedev is not expected to usher in any decisive course change .
putin 's longstanding ally has always been directly involved from the outset in shaping and representing putin 's policies in his previous posts .
medvedev looks set to continue pursuing putin 's goal of modernizing russia because he shares his convictions .
the loyal technocrat is the ideal candidate to ensure that putin 's course is maintained without the current president having to resort to any trickery with the constitution .
past will burden relations with europe president medvedev will be blemished by the fact that he has emerged from putin 's powerhouse .
his previous role as chair of the board at gazprom will also not help his popularity in europe given the poor image of the russia energy giant here .
on the other hand , medvedev is not the worst candidate from amongst the current russian elite .
the former law professor from st. petersburg is reputed to be one of the more liberal spirits in the kremlin .
in addition , he has no direct contacts to the soviet or the post-soviet security services .
and given his relative youth , he also stands for a new russia that europe - and the west in general - will have to learn to live with .
the russian president 's decision to select medvedev is not likely to find favor with all of the factions who putin can currently rally behind him .
the effects of a change in president in terms of who has what access to important financial and business resources are not likely to be clear for a while , and the process will not be without its tensions .
the question is whether the first cracks within russia 's kremlin elite will already have become apparent ahead of the elections in march , thus threatening the transfer of power .
then things could get tricky for putin as the one responsible for naming medvedev his political heir .

" it is a good treaty for denmark and for europe , and the government has decided its ratification will take place in parliament and not by way of referendum , " danish premier anders fogh rasmussen said on tuesday , dec .
11 .
he added that the treaty did not cede sovereignty to the european union , and that therefore there was " no judicial reason to resort to a referendum . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pm anders fogh rasmussen is playing it safe denmark 's constitution stipulates that a referendum must be held if part of the country 's constitution is to be transferred to an international body .
the new charter was agreed in october and is due to be signed by heads of state this week in lisbon .
a majority in parliament supports the eu treaty , replacing the planned new constitution , which was rejected by french and danish voters in referenda in 2005 , triggering an institutional crisis .
on monday the leading opposition party , the social democrats , threw their weight behind parliamentary ratification .
last week , a danish government review said that denmark did not need to hold a referendum to ratify the pact as it did not transfer sovereignty from copenhagen to brussels . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor angela merkel was all ears .
but will talking about disagreements solve anything ? " there should be no taboo subjects , " tusk said at the press conference after the two-hour meeting with merkel in berlin on tuesday , dec .
11 .
" we are friends , and friends ca n't get themselves into a situation of not talking to one another . "
tusk 's tone stood in marked contrast to that of his conservative predecessor , jaroslav kaczynski , who often seemed to go out of his way to offend german sensibilities .
the more eu-friendly tusk defeated kaczynski in poland 's hotly contested national election in november .
merkel was keen to echo the theme of a new polish-german frankness and friendship .
" we 've pledged not dodge any problems , " merkel said .
" together we can get a lot accomplished . "
a problematic past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as per the schengen agreement , the german-polish border will be opened in 2008 tusk and merkel arranged to meet with czech prime minister mirek topolanek on dec .
21 to discuss the opening of borders between the three countries .
and they also addressed two of the most contentious issues dividing poland and germany .
one of them is how to remember the past and , specifically , a planned memorial in berlin to expellees during world war ii - including germans driven from their homes in poland .
many poles see the project as an attempt to revise history and lessen germany 's wartime culpability .
tusk said he favored treating the subject of expellees of all nationalities in a museum about world war ii to be built in the city of gdansk , which used to be part of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is no doubt happy to have a new counterpart in warsaw merkel asserted that a museum could not replace the berlin memorial , but said that she supported the museum idea .
she also promised to send a delegation to warsaw to keep poland informed about the memorial and said germany had no interest in reviving past conflicts .
" there are no demands whatsoever for reparations from poland -lsb- to german refugees -rsb- , " merkel said .
" no german government is going to take a position that deviates from this . "
tusk said he welcomed the assurance as a " moment with symbolic value . "
a present pipeline merkel also discussed the natural-gas pipeline to be built under the baltic sea , which would connect germany with russia but bypass poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic pipeline remains a major sticking point tusk suggested that a meeting be arranged between the three countries to discuss the project in its current form .
such a meeting , he said , could bring about " positive corrections on both sides . "
the pipeline , which was negotiated by merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , has angered many poles , who worry about being held hostage on energy policy by russia and feel they have been ignored by their more powerful neighbors .
clearly , much work needs to be done to resolve such conflicts of interest , but tusk 's visit did re-establish a more civil tone between germany and poland .
he and merkel will have a chance to continue their open exchanges when they meet in the eastern german city of zittau in 10 days ' time . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 11.12.2007 bertelsmann 's liz mohn looks east for success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the more i learn the less i know , " says mohn .
liz mohn leads family-run bertelsmann ag , the world 's fifth largest media conglomerate .
in an interview for dw-world.de 's chinese web site , she explained why love and respect are vital for global business success . dw-world.de : you 've spent a lot of time in china - what are your impressions ?
liz mohn : i am in awe of the chinese for making such an enormous economic leap .
it takes time to change a culture - you ca n't do it from one day to the next .
but they are really accomplishing a lot there .
it shows that the chinese people today are well educated .
without brains and talent , they could n't do it .
i also think the government learned they need to be careful about how to make people follow their ideas .
do germans see china 's economic growth and political importance as a challenge - or a threat ?
neither nor .
we have such a huge market in china .
it offers huge opportunities for both europe and china , not just on one side .
it is a unique experience .
there has n't been anything like it , any time since -lsb- world war ii -rsb- : that a whole world opens up , and we have the good fortune to experience it .
german chancellor angela merkel recently invited the dalai lama to visit germany , which has been hard on the relationship between china and germany .
what is your take on that ?
i think when different cultures come together , mistakes can be made on both sides .
in the christian religion , we say people should forgive .
without mistakes , we ca n't learn .
but i think different cultures do n't learn to understand each other overnight .
does bertelsmann have a long-term strategy in china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing once had bikes , now there are cars bertelsmann has been growing in china since 1995 and it is a market that we want to get into even more .
i think everything we do there is on a long-term basis .
there are so many questions you ca n't answer immediately .
things change so quickly with globalization .
bertelsmann has a long history .
what are you particularly proud of ?
we are the only media concern world-wide that is involved with so many different cultures .
when we went overseas , we respected the other cultures .
that was the strength of our company after the war .
despite the age of digitalization , statistics show germans still read a lot .
that is different in china though .
is your china strategy successful ?
as far as i know , the chinese like to read .
they are a cultured people .
but today people may be more likely to take an audio book , sure .
new times call for new measures .
i 'm amazed when i see the changes on the streets in china today .
how full they are with cars .
when i first started going to china , 12 or 13 years ago , it was bikes , then mopeds .
i found it fascinating to watch the changes - and i am amazed as how much they have achieved .
before china opened up to the west , people had little freedom .
now , young people are colorful .

you claim that bertelsmann 's management culture relies on individuality and creativity .
how can we know that this is n't just lip service ?
after all , centralized leadership and hierarchy can be practical .
because without this management culture , bertelsmann would never have been as successful as it has been .
through our wartime experiences , and before the war , we saw what it meant to have a dictatorship .
no freedom .
later we saw that if you give people freedom to be creative and to think , then they are motivated .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard mohn , now 85 , has handed much power to his wife first i think that it is important to teach basic values - love and respect .
and to know that it is important to give something to society , not just take .
now , china is starting to develop charitable foundations .
i find that great .
and citizens are starting to create businesses that also help society .
these are huge advances .
you 've said creating a management style is bertelsmann 's most important business tool , given globalization .
is that true ?
yes .
for example , from our headquarters , we can not simply order around one of our managers in china .
he has to use his own head , his own ideas .

what are some other challenges for bertelsmann ?
finding good talent .
people who can lead worldwide .
you have sometimes been called an " iron lady " - is this an accurate description ?
well , i would n't say i am " ironclad . "
i might say : you need to use power to get something done .
otherwise you do n't get anywhere in this world .
you need to have a goal , and bring people along with you .
what other qualities make a good business leader ?
i like dealing with people very much , and that 's why i like my job so much .
i get to dialog with people from all over the world .
and i see that the more i learn , the more i have the feeling that i know nothing at all .
your story - you were a telephone operator who has become the head of a fifth-generation business family - is widely known .
is your life really like a fairy tale ?
no .

you just ca n't do it any other way .
you also have to make mistakes .
that is a burden .
i think i was fortunate to meet a man who both helped me come into more responsibility in this part of my life , and to experience what i do today .

liz mohn leads family-run bertelsmann ag , the world 's fifth largest media conglomerate .
in an interview for dw-world.de 's chinese web site , she explained why love and respect are vital for global business success . dw-world.de : you 've spent a lot of time in china - what are your impressions ?
liz mohn : i am in awe of the chinese for making such an enormous economic leap .
it takes time to change a culture - you ca n't do it from one day to the next .
but they are really accomplishing a lot there .
it shows that the chinese people today are well educated .
without brains and talent , they could n't do it .
i also think the government learned they need to be careful about how to make people follow their ideas .
do germans see china 's economic growth and political importance as a challenge - or a threat ?
neither nor .
we have such a huge market in china .
it offers huge opportunities for both europe and china , not just on one side .
it is a unique experience .
there has n't been anything like it , any time since -lsb- world war ii -rsb- : that a whole world opens up , and we have the good fortune to experience it .
german chancellor angela merkel recently invited the dalai lama to visit germany , which has been hard on the relationship between china and germany .
what is your take on that ?
i think when different cultures come together , mistakes can be made on both sides .
in the christian religion , we say people should forgive .
without mistakes , we ca n't learn .
but i think different cultures do n't learn to understand each other overnight .
does bertelsmann have a long-term strategy in china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing once had bikes , now there are cars bertelsmann has been growing in china since 1995 and it is a market that we want to get into even more .
i think everything we do there is on a long-term basis .
there are so many questions you ca n't answer immediately .
things change so quickly with globalization .
bertelsmann has a long history .
what are you particularly proud of ?
we are the only media concern world-wide that is involved with so many different cultures .
when we went overseas , we respected the other cultures .
that was the strength of our company after the war .
despite the age of digitalization , statistics show germans still read a lot .
that is different in china though .
is your china strategy successful ?
as far as i know , the chinese like to read .
they are a cultured people .
but today people may be more likely to take an audio book , sure .
new times call for new measures .
i 'm amazed when i see the changes on the streets in china today .
how full they are with cars .
when i first started going to china , 12 or 13 years ago , it was bikes , then mopeds .
i found it fascinating to watch the changes - and i am amazed as how much they have achieved .
before china opened up to the west , people had little freedom .
now , young people are colorful .
they 've gotten more room to think , to live .
you claim that bertelsmann 's management culture relies on individuality and creativity .
how can we know that this is n't just lip service ?
after all , centralized leadership and hierarchy can be practical .
because without this management culture , bertelsmann would never have been as successful as it has been .

dw-world 's ingo mannteufel says the liberal technocrat will uphold putin 's political course - with or without him as pm . the guessing game is over .
for months now , russian politics have been dominated by the question of who will succeed russian president vladimir putin in march 2008 .
russian law prevents presidents from standing for a third term of office .
speculation was rife about putin 's next move .
one scenario put forward was that putin would alter the constitution .
another saw putin naming a stand-in president , then returning to office after having fulfilled the constitution 's technical requirements .
it was difficult to imagine russia being governed by another politician after eight years of putin .
medvedev certain to be elected the russian president has decided to back dmitry medvedev , first deputy prime minister and board chairman of gas giant gazprom , to stand as a presidential candidate in march 2008 .
given what happened in russian parliamentary poll in early december , it is practically certain that medvedev will be elected in the first round of the elections on march 2 .
the kremlin propaganda machine functions magnificently , the administrative apparatus runs smoothly , and the significant size of russian security forces remove any lingering doubt about the outcome of the poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel there is no point in bemoaning the poor prospects for democracy in russia in the light of such political relations .
the vague and possibly premature hopes for a rapid democratization of russia were snuffed out some time ago .
with his decision in favor of medvedev , president putin has made a bold move and answered a number of questions about himself and russia 's future course .
not just a fill-in president putin will step down as president in march 2008 .
the intention is that 42-year-old medvedev should be president for the next four years - in all likelihood much longer .
medvedev is completely unsuited to just act as a stand-in who would keep the presidential post warm for putin .
in this respect , putin has remained true to himself - in spite of what all his opponents and his sycophantic supporters have said .
after all , he always said he would not violate the constitution in order to remain in office .
however , the end of putin 's presidential era does not spell the end of putin as the leading light in russian politics .
he will retain considerable influence over russian politics as head of united russia , or possibly as prime minister .
we will have to wait and see if putin will take up medvedev 's offer to take on the job of pm under him .
at any rate , medvedev is not expected to usher in any decisive course change .
putin 's longstanding ally has always been directly involved from the outset in shaping and representing putin 's policies in his previous posts .
medvedev looks set to continue pursuing putin 's goal of modernizing russia because he shares his convictions .
the loyal technocrat is the ideal candidate to ensure that putin 's course is maintained without the current president having to resort to any trickery with the constitution .
past will burden relations with europe president medvedev will be blemished by the fact that he has emerged from putin 's powerhouse .
his previous role as chair of the board at gazprom will also not help his popularity in europe given the poor image of the russia energy giant here .
on the other hand , medvedev is not the worst candidate from amongst the current russian elite .
the former law professor from st. petersburg is reputed to be one of the more liberal spirits in the kremlin .
in addition , he has no direct contacts to the soviet or the post-soviet security services .
and given his relative youth , he also stands for a new russia that europe - and the west in general - will have to learn to live with .
the russian president 's decision to select medvedev is not likely to find favor with all of the factions who putin can currently rally behind him .
the effects of a change in president in terms of who has what access to important financial and business resources are not likely to be clear for a while , and the process will not be without its tensions .
the question is whether the first cracks within russia 's kremlin elite will already have become apparent ahead of the elections in march , thus threatening the transfer of power .
then things could get tricky for putin as the one responsible for naming medvedev his political heir .

it was difficult to imagine russia being governed by another politician after eight years of putin .
medvedev certain to be elected the russian president has decided to back dmitry medvedev , first deputy prime minister and board chairman of gas giant gazprom , to stand as a presidential candidate in march 2008 .
given what happened in russian parliamentary poll in early december , it is practically certain that medvedev will be elected in the first round of the elections on march 2 .
the kremlin propaganda machine functions magnificently , the administrative apparatus runs smoothly , and the significant size of russian security forces remove any lingering doubt about the outcome of the poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel there is no point in bemoaning the poor prospects for democracy in russia in the light of such political relations .
the vague and possibly premature hopes for a rapid democratization of russia were snuffed out some time ago .
with his decision in favor of medvedev , president putin has made a bold move and answered a number of questions about himself and russia 's future course .
not just a fill-in president putin will step down as president in march 2008 .
the intention is that 42-year-old medvedev should be president for the next four years - in all likelihood much longer .
medvedev is completely unsuited to just act as a stand-in who would keep the presidential post warm for putin .
in this respect , putin has remained true to himself - in spite of what all his opponents and his sycophantic supporters have said .
after all , he always said he would not violate the constitution in order to remain in office .
however , the end of putin 's presidential era does not spell the end of putin as the leading light in russian politics .
he will retain considerable influence over russian politics as head of united russia , or possibly as prime minister .
we will have to wait and see if putin will take up medvedev 's offer to take on the job of pm under him .
at any rate , medvedev is not expected to usher in any decisive course change .
putin 's longstanding ally has always been directly involved from the outset in shaping and representing putin 's policies in his previous posts .
medvedev looks set to continue pursuing putin 's goal of modernizing russia because he shares his convictions .
the loyal technocrat is the ideal candidate to ensure that putin 's course is maintained without the current president having to resort to any trickery with the constitution .
past will burden relations with europe president medvedev will be blemished by the fact that he has emerged from putin 's powerhouse .
his previous role as chair of the board at gazprom will also not help his popularity in europe given the poor image of the russia energy giant here .
on the other hand , medvedev is not the worst candidate from amongst the current russian elite .
the former law professor from st. petersburg is reputed to be one of the more liberal spirits in the kremlin .
in addition , he has no direct contacts to the soviet or the post-soviet security services .
and given his relative youth , he also stands for a new russia that europe - and the west in general - will have to learn to live with .
the russian president 's decision to select medvedev is not likely to find favor with all of the factions who putin can currently rally behind him .
the effects of a change in president in terms of who has what access to important financial and business resources are not likely to be clear for a while , and the process will not be without its tensions .
the question is whether the first cracks within russia 's kremlin elite will already have become apparent ahead of the elections in march , thus threatening the transfer of power .
then things could get tricky for putin as the one responsible for naming medvedev his political heir .

while some countries bank on cash incentives , some german car experts believe there are better ways to go . the auto industry has plenty to lose sleep over .
not only is public discourse over the new dirty word " co2 " laying on pressure for change , sales are down as well . the german association of the automotive industry announced last week that car sales have dropped 9 percent this year - a record year - naming consumers ' uncertainty over planned vehicle tax reform , climate concerns and the 3-percent sales tax increase last january . it 's not surprising , then , that a plan recently came under discussion that would theoretically solve both environmental and economic concerns : the government would pay drivers a premium for scrapping their old , pollutant vehicles - or at least taking them off the road - in the hope that they put the money into a new car . the carbon dioxide-based vehicle tax , which the german government is currently considering , would provide an incentive for the buyer to select a low-emissions vehicle .
scrapping premiums would come from the vehicle tax pot , thereby being paid for by heavy emitters . potential two-pronged benefit for scrapping premium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim of a premium is to get old cars off the road , not necessarily destroy them " on the one hand , old cars are taken off the market and new cars , which generally have lower emissions , enter the market .
secondly , business would experience a boom , at least in the short term , " said willi diez , director of the german automobile industry institute , of the plan his organization proposed last month . a similar , reportedly successful project in italy serves as a model .
there , consumers are paid 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,170 -rrb- and given a two-year vehicle tax exemption when they scrap their old cars and buy new ones with emissions rates of less than 140 grams per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- . the incentive has gotten 500,000 old cars off italy 's streets since it started in january , according to a report by germany 's motorzeitung.de.
diez predicted that , if a premium of 1,000 euros was introduced in germany , it could lead to an additional 250,000 cars sold , with at least as many taken off the road . car expert slams scrapping plan for ferdinand dudenhöffer , co-founder and director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- at the gelsenkirchen technical college , the premium to scrap cars sounds like a marketing ploy . " the car industry is n't an industry that needs subsidies , " said dudenhöffer .
" there are much better ways to get customers to buy new cars . " a driver could take the premium and buy a big gas-guzzler if he or she wanted to , added dudenhöffer , who did n't see the proposed tax-break of 50 to 100 euros for more ecologically sound cars as enough of an incentive .
as for the old polluter , it 's more likely to end up on the road in eastern europe than to get scrapped , he said . " and russian co2 is just like german co2 , " he said . emissions trading could help europe reach target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to reach an average 130 grams of co2 per kilometer driven by 2012 the auto expert has been an outspoken proponent of emissions trading as the best way to reduce co2 output across europe .
that scenario would have carmakers buy certificates from an independent exchange for every vehicle they produce with a co2 emissions rate of more than 130 grams per kilometer , and sell one back for every car under the emissions limit . ultimately , said dudenhöffer , the emissions trading plan would help europe attain the 130-gram-per vehicle average it is striving for by 2012 . by making high-emission cars more expensive than clean ones , the customer bears the financial burden . " environmental consciousness may be getting a bit stronger , but you have to assume that when i buy something i pay attention to my needs and not to my neighbor 's , " dudenhöffer said .
" that 's why it 's better not to leave the environmental decision to the consumer but to set prices for co2 that allow these emission goals to be reached . " the plan 's weakness , countered diez , is that it 's too difficult to come up with a basis of calculation to determine a price for the so-called emissions certificates .
emissions trading already exists in stationary industries like power plants , but he said he did n't consider it a practical option for the auto sector . co2-based vehicle tax coming soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who want to drive big cars will have to pay more for them diez conceded , however , that the scrapping premium has n't been well received .
while politicians worry about where the money will come from , carmakers fear that the temporary boom caused by it will be followed by a painful dip in sales . meanwhile , the german government is in the process of approving a law , to take effect in january 2009 , that would adjust the annual vehicle tax according to a new car 's co2 emission rate . while dudenhöffer called it a " german solution to a european problem , " the sliding tax plays a key role in diez 's scrapping premium .
since old cars would continue to be charged according to their cubic capacity , buyers of new low-emissions cars would benefit the most . german auto club adac said it strongly supports the vehicle tax reform - a plan it had suggested to the government already in 2004 . but there 's even another , perhaps simpler way to cut emissions that does n't involve government-initiated incentives : " driving style should n't be underestimated , " said an adac spokesman .
driving ecologically - not accelerating quickly , shifting early and avoiding traffic - can save 20 to 30 percent on gas , he said .

while some countries bank on cash incentives , some german car experts believe there are better ways to go . the auto industry has plenty to lose sleep over .
not only is public discourse over the new dirty word " co2 " laying on pressure for change , sales are down as well . the german association of the automotive industry announced last week that car sales have dropped 9 percent this year - a record year - naming consumers ' uncertainty over planned vehicle tax reform , climate concerns and the 3-percent sales tax increase last january . it 's not surprising , then , that a plan recently came under discussion that would theoretically solve both environmental and economic concerns : the government would pay drivers a premium for scrapping their old , pollutant vehicles - or at least taking them off the road - in the hope that they put the money into a new car . the carbon dioxide-based vehicle tax , which the german government is currently considering , would provide an incentive for the buyer to select a low-emissions vehicle .
scrapping premiums would come from the vehicle tax pot , thereby being paid for by heavy emitters . potential two-pronged benefit for scrapping premium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim of a premium is to get old cars off the road , not necessarily destroy them " on the one hand , old cars are taken off the market and new cars , which generally have lower emissions , enter the market .
secondly , business would experience a boom , at least in the short term , " said willi diez , director of the german automobile industry institute , of the plan his organization proposed last month . a similar , reportedly successful project in italy serves as a model .
there , consumers are paid 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,170 -rrb- and given a two-year vehicle tax exemption when they scrap their old cars and buy new ones with emissions rates of less than 140 grams per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- . the incentive has gotten 500,000 old cars off italy 's streets since it started in january , according to a report by germany 's motorzeitung.de.
diez predicted that , if a premium of 1,000 euros was introduced in germany , it could lead to an additional 250,000 cars sold , with at least as many taken off the road . car expert slams scrapping plan for ferdinand dudenhöffer , co-founder and director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- at the gelsenkirchen technical college , the premium to scrap cars sounds like a marketing ploy . " the car industry is n't an industry that needs subsidies , " said dudenhöffer .
" there are much better ways to get customers to buy new cars . " a driver could take the premium and buy a big gas-guzzler if he or she wanted to , added dudenhöffer , who did n't see the proposed tax-break of 50 to 100 euros for more ecologically sound cars as enough of an incentive .
as for the old polluter , it 's more likely to end up on the road in eastern europe than to get scrapped , he said . " and russian co2 is just like german co2 , " he said . emissions trading could help europe reach target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to reach an average 130 grams of co2 per kilometer driven by 2012 the auto expert has been an outspoken proponent of emissions trading as the best way to reduce co2 output across europe .
that scenario would have carmakers buy certificates from an independent exchange for every vehicle they produce with a co2 emissions rate of more than 130 grams per kilometer , and sell one back for every car under the emissions limit . ultimately , said dudenhöffer , the emissions trading plan would help europe attain the 130-gram-per vehicle average it is striving for by 2012 . by making high-emission cars more expensive than clean ones , the customer bears the financial burden . " environmental consciousness may be getting a bit stronger , but you have to assume that when i buy something i pay attention to my needs and not to my neighbor 's , " dudenhöffer said .
" that 's why it 's better not to leave the environmental decision to the consumer but to set prices for co2 that allow these emission goals to be reached . " the plan 's weakness , countered diez , is that it 's too difficult to come up with a basis of calculation to determine a price for the so-called emissions certificates .
emissions trading already exists in stationary industries like power plants , but he said he did n't consider it a practical option for the auto sector . co2-based vehicle tax coming soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who want to drive big cars will have to pay more for them diez conceded , however , that the scrapping premium has n't been well received .
while politicians worry about where the money will come from , carmakers fear that the temporary boom caused by it will be followed by a painful dip in sales . meanwhile , the german government is in the process of approving a law , to take effect in january 2009 , that would adjust the annual vehicle tax according to a new car 's co2 emission rate . while dudenhöffer called it a " german solution to a european problem , " the sliding tax plays a key role in diez 's scrapping premium .
since old cars would continue to be charged according to their cubic capacity , buyers of new low-emissions cars would benefit the most . german auto club adac said it strongly supports the vehicle tax reform - a plan it had suggested to the government already in 2004 . but there 's even another , perhaps simpler way to cut emissions that does n't involve government-initiated incentives : " driving style should n't be underestimated , " said an adac spokesman .
driving ecologically - not accelerating quickly , shifting early and avoiding traffic - can save 20 to 30 percent on gas , he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 11.12.2007 opinion : medvedev will uphold putin 's legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president vladimir putin has chosen dmitry medvedev to stand as presidential candidate next march .
dw-world 's ingo mannteufel says the liberal technocrat will uphold putin 's political course - with or without him as pm . the guessing game is over .
for months now , russian politics have been dominated by the question of who will succeed russian president vladimir putin in march 2008 .
russian law prevents presidents from standing for a third term of office .
speculation was rife about putin 's next move .
one scenario put forward was that putin would alter the constitution .
another saw putin naming a stand-in president , then returning to office after having fulfilled the constitution 's technical requirements .
it was difficult to imagine russia being governed by another politician after eight years of putin .
medvedev certain to be elected the russian president has decided to back dmitry medvedev , first deputy prime minister and board chairman of gas giant gazprom , to stand as a presidential candidate in march 2008 .
given what happened in russian parliamentary poll in early december , it is practically certain that medvedev will be elected in the first round of the elections on march 2 .
the kremlin propaganda machine functions magnificently , the administrative apparatus runs smoothly , and the significant size of russian security forces remove any lingering doubt about the outcome of the poll .

the vague and possibly premature hopes for a rapid democratization of russia were snuffed out some time ago .
with his decision in favor of medvedev , president putin has made a bold move and answered a number of questions about himself and russia 's future course .
not just a fill-in president putin will step down as president in march 2008 .
the intention is that 42-year-old medvedev should be president for the next four years - in all likelihood much longer .
medvedev is completely unsuited to just act as a stand-in who would keep the presidential post warm for putin .
in this respect , putin has remained true to himself - in spite of what all his opponents and his sycophantic supporters have said .
after all , he always said he would not violate the constitution in order to remain in office .
however , the end of putin 's presidential era does not spell the end of putin as the leading light in russian politics .
he will retain considerable influence over russian politics as head of united russia , or possibly as prime minister .
we will have to wait and see if putin will take up medvedev 's offer to take on the job of pm under him .
at any rate , medvedev is not expected to usher in any decisive course change .
putin 's longstanding ally has always been directly involved from the outset in shaping and representing putin 's policies in his previous posts .
medvedev looks set to continue pursuing putin 's goal of modernizing russia because he shares his convictions .
the loyal technocrat is the ideal candidate to ensure that putin 's course is maintained without the current president having to resort to any trickery with the constitution .
past will burden relations with europe president medvedev will be blemished by the fact that he has emerged from putin 's powerhouse .
his previous role as chair of the board at gazprom will also not help his popularity in europe given the poor image of the russia energy giant here .
on the other hand , medvedev is not the worst candidate from amongst the current russian elite .
the former law professor from st. petersburg is reputed to be one of the more liberal spirits in the kremlin .
in addition , he has no direct contacts to the soviet or the post-soviet security services .
and given his relative youth , he also stands for a new russia that europe - and the west in general - will have to learn to live with .
the russian president 's decision to select medvedev is not likely to find favor with all of the factions who putin can currently rally behind him .
the effects of a change in president in terms of who has what access to important financial and business resources are not likely to be clear for a while , and the process will not be without its tensions .
the question is whether the first cracks within russia 's kremlin elite will already have become apparent ahead of the elections in march , thus threatening the transfer of power .
then things could get tricky for putin as the one responsible for naming medvedev his political heir .

dw-world 's ingo mannteufel says the liberal technocrat will uphold putin 's political course - with or without him as pm . the guessing game is over .
for months now , russian politics have been dominated by the question of who will succeed russian president vladimir putin in march 2008 .
russian law prevents presidents from standing for a third term of office .
speculation was rife about putin 's next move .
one scenario put forward was that putin would alter the constitution .
another saw putin naming a stand-in president , then returning to office after having fulfilled the constitution 's technical requirements .
it was difficult to imagine russia being governed by another politician after eight years of putin .
medvedev certain to be elected the russian president has decided to back dmitry medvedev , first deputy prime minister and board chairman of gas giant gazprom , to stand as a presidential candidate in march 2008 .
given what happened in russian parliamentary poll in early december , it is practically certain that medvedev will be elected in the first round of the elections on march 2 .
the kremlin propaganda machine functions magnificently , the administrative apparatus runs smoothly , and the significant size of russian security forces remove any lingering doubt about the outcome of the poll .

liz mohn leads family-run bertelsmann ag , the world 's fifth largest media conglomerate .
in an interview for dw-world.de 's chinese web site , she explained why love and respect are vital for global business success . dw-world.de : you 've spent a lot of time in china - what are your impressions ?
liz mohn : i am in awe of the chinese for making such an enormous economic leap .
it takes time to change a culture - you ca n't do it from one day to the next .
but they are really accomplishing a lot there .
it shows that the chinese people today are well educated .
without brains and talent , they could n't do it .
i also think the government learned they need to be careful about how to make people follow their ideas .
do germans see china 's economic growth and political importance as a challenge - or a threat ?
neither nor .
we have such a huge market in china .
it offers huge opportunities for both europe and china , not just on one side .
it is a unique experience .
there has n't been anything like it , any time since -lsb- world war ii -rsb- : that a whole world opens up , and we have the good fortune to experience it .
german chancellor angela merkel recently invited the dalai lama to visit germany , which has been hard on the relationship between china and germany .
what is your take on that ?
i think when different cultures come together , mistakes can be made on both sides .
in the christian religion , we say people should forgive .
without mistakes , we ca n't learn .
but i think different cultures do n't learn to understand each other overnight .
does bertelsmann have a long-term strategy in china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing once had bikes , now there are cars bertelsmann has been growing in china since 1995 and it is a market that we want to get into even more .
i think everything we do there is on a long-term basis .
there are so many questions you ca n't answer immediately .
things change so quickly with globalization .
bertelsmann has a long history .
what are you particularly proud of ?
we are the only media concern world-wide that is involved with so many different cultures .
when we went overseas , we respected the other cultures .
that was the strength of our company after the war .
despite the age of digitalization , statistics show germans still read a lot .
that is different in china though .
is your china strategy successful ?
as far as i know , the chinese like to read .
they are a cultured people .
but today people may be more likely to take an audio book , sure .
new times call for new measures .
i 'm amazed when i see the changes on the streets in china today .
how full they are with cars .
when i first started going to china , 12 or 13 years ago , it was bikes , then mopeds .
i found it fascinating to watch the changes - and i am amazed as how much they have achieved .
before china opened up to the west , people had little freedom .
now , young people are colorful .
they 've gotten more room to think , to live .
you claim that bertelsmann 's management culture relies on individuality and creativity .
how can we know that this is n't just lip service ?
after all , centralized leadership and hierarchy can be practical .
because without this management culture , bertelsmann would never have been as successful as it has been .
through our wartime experiences , and before the war , we saw what it meant to have a dictatorship .
no freedom .
later we saw that if you give people freedom to be creative and to think , then they are motivated .
when you are fair to people , and respect them , then people come together and work together , and you get a great success .
you have worked alongside your husband -lrb- bertelsmann owner reinhard mohn -rrb- , and been increasingly active , for years .
what aspect of your own personality is visible in bertelsmann 's culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard mohn , now 85 , has handed much power to his wife first i think that it is important to teach basic values - love and respect .
and to know that it is important to give something to society , not just take .
now , china is starting to develop charitable foundations .
i find that great .
and citizens are starting to create businesses that also help society .
these are huge advances .
you 've said creating a management style is bertelsmann 's most important business tool , given globalization .
is that true ?
yes .
for example , from our headquarters , we can not simply order around one of our managers in china .
he has to use his own head , his own ideas .
but at the same time , he needs to keep in mind the greater goals for company are .
he needs to know … what kind of mental and spiritual orientation we have , our values .
what are some other challenges for bertelsmann ?
finding good talent .
people who can lead worldwide .
you have sometimes been called an " iron lady " - is this an accurate description ?
well , i would n't say i am " ironclad . "
i might say : you need to use power to get something done .
otherwise you do n't get anywhere in this world .
you need to have a goal , and bring people along with you .
what other qualities make a good business leader ?
i like dealing with people very much , and that 's why i like my job so much .
i get to dialog with people from all over the world .
and i see that the more i learn , the more i have the feeling that i know nothing at all .
your story - you were a telephone operator who has become the head of a fifth-generation business family - is widely known .
is your life really like a fairy tale ?
no .
the people who know me well , know that you never get to the top without discipline and hard work .
you just ca n't do it any other way .
you also have to make mistakes .
that is a burden .
i think i was fortunate to meet a man who both helped me come into more responsibility in this part of my life , and to experience what i do today .
next year we will have been married for 50 years .
that is a long time .
you still appreciate your husband so much after 50 years of marriage ?
that 's unusual these days .
he is a great businessman , a great person , a great philosopher , he is never arrogant , always humble .
he 's always working on behalf of the workers in our company , and many of our employees look up to him as an example . interview : zhu hong -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin would rather stick to its own plans for remembrance . poland 's prime minister , donald tusk , called on monday , dec .
10 , for a grand-scale world war ii museum in the northern polish city of gdansk , the site of the nazi invasion on sept .
1 , 1939 . other countries , including germany , russia and israel could have a part in the museum , which was proposed as an alternative to a plan for an exhibition in berlin to remember german expellees from central and eastern europe during and just after world war ii . in the large gdansk museum , " the fate of expellees would have a place in a conclusive and comprehensive context , " said tusk in an interview with the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . the coastal city of gdansk , located on the baltic sea , is ripe with symbolic meaning . " the war began here , but in a sense it also ended here when the solidarity movement was founded in 1980 , " tusk said . started by polish laborers under lech walesa , solidarity , or solidarnosc , played a key role in the fall of communism in the former east-bloc country . berlin adamant about expulsion center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk became prime minister last month in response , the german government made it clear that tusk 's statement would have no bearing on plans for the expulsion center .
the governing coalition agreed in their founding contract in 2005 to set up a " visible sign of remembrance against expulsion " in berlin , said government spokesman thomas steg . the conflict began some seven years ago when the league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- started a foundation for a proposed expellee center .
the organization , which campaigns for the rights and remembrance of ethnic german expellees , has been seen in poland as overstating german suffering surrounding the holocaust . " the problem is not that anyone wants to prevent the germans from remembering the suffering of their own people , " tusk said .
" it becomes problematic when this remembrance of the german suffering diminishes another memory - namely that of the collective responsibility of the germans . " points of contention on tusk-merkel agenda the question of remembrance is likely to be a major agenda point when tusk meets with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin on tuesday . the two leaders are also slated to broach the ongoing issue of restitution claims for german expellees and re-settlers . the prussian claims society submitted claims for 22 individual claims cases to the european court for human rights in strasbourg in 2006 , requesting the return of land and property in present-day poland to ethnic germans who were forced out of their homes during the war . several more cases have been submitted since then , and still others are being reviewed in polish courts . " the german government has to take responsibility for the possible financial consequences arising from the compensation claims , " tusk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should expelled german be compensated for what they lost ?
berlin has maintained repeatedly that it does n't support such claims , with then german chancellor gerhard schröder making a binding statement to that effect in warsaw in 2004 . according to german estimates , some 15 million ethnic germans were expelled from their homes during or directly following the war .
some two million are thought to have died in the process . poland fears pipeline puts gas supply at risk plans for a joint russian-german gas pipeline along the baltic sea will be another matter of discussion at tuesday 's meeting . currently , russia sends gas to western europe via poland , but the baltic sea pipeline would circumvent the central european country .
poland has expressed concern that , in a political crisis , russia could shut its gas supply without affecting delivery to - and , hence , relations with - western europe . ahead of tuesday 's talks , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed optimism over the future of bilateral relations . " a concrete program to improve cooperation between the governments is being worked on , " he told the polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza on monday .

berlin would rather stick to its own plans for remembrance . poland 's prime minister , donald tusk , called on monday , dec .
10 , for a grand-scale world war ii museum in the northern polish city of gdansk , the site of the nazi invasion on sept .
1 , 1939 . other countries , including germany , russia and israel could have a part in the museum , which was proposed as an alternative to a plan for an exhibition in berlin to remember german expellees from central and eastern europe during and just after world war ii . in the large gdansk museum , " the fate of expellees would have a place in a conclusive and comprehensive context , " said tusk in an interview with the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . the coastal city of gdansk , located on the baltic sea , is ripe with symbolic meaning . " the war began here , but in a sense it also ended here when the solidarity movement was founded in 1980 , " tusk said . started by polish laborers under lech walesa , solidarity , or solidarnosc , played a key role in the fall of communism in the former east-bloc country . berlin adamant about expulsion center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk became prime minister last month in response , the german government made it clear that tusk 's statement would have no bearing on plans for the expulsion center .
the governing coalition agreed in their founding contract in 2005 to set up a " visible sign of remembrance against expulsion " in berlin , said government spokesman thomas steg . the conflict began some seven years ago when the league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- started a foundation for a proposed expellee center .
the organization , which campaigns for the rights and remembrance of ethnic german expellees , has been seen in poland as overstating german suffering surrounding the holocaust . " the problem is not that anyone wants to prevent the germans from remembering the suffering of their own people , " tusk said .
" it becomes problematic when this remembrance of the german suffering diminishes another memory - namely that of the collective responsibility of the germans . " points of contention on tusk-merkel agenda the question of remembrance is likely to be a major agenda point when tusk meets with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin on tuesday . the two leaders are also slated to broach the ongoing issue of restitution claims for german expellees and re-settlers . the prussian claims society submitted claims for 22 individual claims cases to the european court for human rights in strasbourg in 2006 , requesting the return of land and property in present-day poland to ethnic germans who were forced out of their homes during the war . several more cases have been submitted since then , and still others are being reviewed in polish courts . " the german government has to take responsibility for the possible financial consequences arising from the compensation claims , " tusk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should expelled german be compensated for what they lost ?
berlin has maintained repeatedly that it does n't support such claims , with then german chancellor gerhard schröder making a binding statement to that effect in warsaw in 2004 . according to german estimates , some 15 million ethnic germans were expelled from their homes during or directly following the war .
some two million are thought to have died in the process . poland fears pipeline puts gas supply at risk plans for a joint russian-german gas pipeline along the baltic sea will be another matter of discussion at tuesday 's meeting . currently , russia sends gas to western europe via poland , but the baltic sea pipeline would circumvent the central european country .
poland has expressed concern that , in a political crisis , russia could shut its gas supply without affecting delivery to - and , hence , relations with - western europe . ahead of tuesday 's talks , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed optimism over the future of bilateral relations . " a concrete program to improve cooperation between the governments is being worked on , " he told the polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza on monday .

liz mohn leads family-run bertelsmann ag , the world 's fifth largest media conglomerate .
in an interview for dw-world.de 's chinese web site , she explained why love and respect are vital for global business success . dw-world.de : you 've spent a lot of time in china - what are your impressions ?
liz mohn : i am in awe of the chinese for making such an enormous economic leap .
it takes time to change a culture - you ca n't do it from one day to the next .
but they are really accomplishing a lot there .
it shows that the chinese people today are well educated .
without brains and talent , they could n't do it .
i also think the government learned they need to be careful about how to make people follow their ideas .
do germans see china 's economic growth and political importance as a challenge - or a threat ?
neither nor .
we have such a huge market in china .
it offers huge opportunities for both europe and china , not just on one side .
it is a unique experience .
there has n't been anything like it , any time since -lsb- world war ii -rsb- : that a whole world opens up , and we have the good fortune to experience it .
german chancellor angela merkel recently invited the dalai lama to visit germany , which has been hard on the relationship between china and germany .
what is your take on that ?
i think when different cultures come together , mistakes can be made on both sides .
in the christian religion , we say people should forgive .
without mistakes , we ca n't learn .
but i think different cultures do n't learn to understand each other overnight .
does bertelsmann have a long-term strategy in china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing once had bikes , now there are cars bertelsmann has been growing in china since 1995 and it is a market that we want to get into even more .
i think everything we do there is on a long-term basis .
there are so many questions you ca n't answer immediately .
things change so quickly with globalization .
bertelsmann has a long history .
what are you particularly proud of ?
we are the only media concern world-wide that is involved with so many different cultures .
when we went overseas , we respected the other cultures .
that was the strength of our company after the war .
despite the age of digitalization , statistics show germans still read a lot .
that is different in china though .
is your china strategy successful ?
as far as i know , the chinese like to read .
they are a cultured people .
but today people may be more likely to take an audio book , sure .
new times call for new measures .
i 'm amazed when i see the changes on the streets in china today .
how full they are with cars .
when i first started going to china , 12 or 13 years ago , it was bikes , then mopeds .
i found it fascinating to watch the changes - and i am amazed as how much they have achieved .
before china opened up to the west , people had little freedom .
now , young people are colorful .
they 've gotten more room to think , to live .
you claim that bertelsmann 's management culture relies on individuality and creativity .
how can we know that this is n't just lip service ?
after all , centralized leadership and hierarchy can be practical .
because without this management culture , bertelsmann would never have been as successful as it has been .
through our wartime experiences , and before the war , we saw what it meant to have a dictatorship .
no freedom .
later we saw that if you give people freedom to be creative and to think , then they are motivated .
when you are fair to people , and respect them , then people come together and work together , and you get a great success .
you have worked alongside your husband -lrb- bertelsmann owner reinhard mohn -rrb- , and been increasingly active , for years .
what aspect of your own personality is visible in bertelsmann 's culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard mohn , now 85 , has handed much power to his wife first i think that it is important to teach basic values - love and respect .
and to know that it is important to give something to society , not just take .
now , china is starting to develop charitable foundations .
i find that great .
and citizens are starting to create businesses that also help society .
these are huge advances .
you 've said creating a management style is bertelsmann 's most important business tool , given globalization .
is that true ?
yes .
for example , from our headquarters , we can not simply order around one of our managers in china .
he has to use his own head , his own ideas .
but at the same time , he needs to keep in mind the greater goals for company are .
he needs to know … what kind of mental and spiritual orientation we have , our values .
what are some other challenges for bertelsmann ?
finding good talent .
people who can lead worldwide .
you have sometimes been called an " iron lady " - is this an accurate description ?
well , i would n't say i am " ironclad . "
i might say : you need to use power to get something done .
otherwise you do n't get anywhere in this world .
you need to have a goal , and bring people along with you .
what other qualities make a good business leader ?
i like dealing with people very much , and that 's why i like my job so much .
i get to dialog with people from all over the world .
and i see that the more i learn , the more i have the feeling that i know nothing at all .
your story - you were a telephone operator who has become the head of a fifth-generation business family - is widely known .
is your life really like a fairy tale ?
no .
the people who know me well , know that you never get to the top without discipline and hard work .
you just ca n't do it any other way .
you also have to make mistakes .
that is a burden .
i think i was fortunate to meet a man who both helped me come into more responsibility in this part of my life , and to experience what i do today .
next year we will have been married for 50 years .
that is a long time .
you still appreciate your husband so much after 50 years of marriage ?
that 's unusual these days .
he is a great businessman , a great person , a great philosopher , he is never arrogant , always humble .
he 's always working on behalf of the workers in our company , and many of our employees look up to him as an example . interview : zhu hong -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor angela merkel was all ears .
but will talking about disagreements solve anything ? " there should be no taboo subjects , " tusk said at the press conference after the two-hour meeting with merkel in berlin on tuesday , dec .
11 .
" we are friends , and friends ca n't get themselves into a situation of not talking to one another . "
tusk 's tone stood in marked contrast to that of his conservative predecessor , jaroslav kaczynski , who often seemed to go out of his way to offend german sensibilities .
the more eu-friendly tusk defeated kaczynski in poland 's hotly contested national election in november .
merkel was keen to echo the theme of a new polish-german frankness and friendship .
" we 've pledged not dodge any problems , " merkel said .
" together we can get a lot accomplished . "
a problematic past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as per the schengen agreement , the german-polish border will be opened in 2008 tusk and merkel arranged to meet with czech prime minister mirek topolanek on dec .
21 to discuss the opening of borders between the three countries .
and they also addressed two of the most contentious issues dividing poland and germany .
one of them is how to remember the past and , specifically , a planned memorial in berlin to expellees during world war ii - including germans driven from their homes in poland .
many poles see the project as an attempt to revise history and lessen germany 's wartime culpability .
tusk said he favored treating the subject of expellees of all nationalities in a museum about world war ii to be built in the city of gdansk , which used to be part of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is no doubt happy to have a new counterpart in warsaw merkel asserted that a museum could not replace the berlin memorial , but said that she supported the museum idea .
she also promised to send a delegation to warsaw to keep poland informed about the memorial and said germany had no interest in reviving past conflicts .
" there are no demands whatsoever for reparations from poland -lsb- to german refugees -rsb- , " merkel said .
" no german government is going to take a position that deviates from this . "
tusk said he welcomed the assurance as a " moment with symbolic value . "
a present pipeline merkel also discussed the natural-gas pipeline to be built under the baltic sea , which would connect germany with russia but bypass poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic pipeline remains a major sticking point tusk suggested that a meeting be arranged between the three countries to discuss the project in its current form .
such a meeting , he said , could bring about " positive corrections on both sides . "
the pipeline , which was negotiated by merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , has angered many poles , who worry about being held hostage on energy policy by russia and feel they have been ignored by their more powerful neighbors .
clearly , much work needs to be done to resolve such conflicts of interest , but tusk 's visit did re-establish a more civil tone between germany and poland .

chancellor angela merkel was all ears .
but will talking about disagreements solve anything ? " there should be no taboo subjects , " tusk said at the press conference after the two-hour meeting with merkel in berlin on tuesday , dec .
11 .
" we are friends , and friends ca n't get themselves into a situation of not talking to one another . "
tusk 's tone stood in marked contrast to that of his conservative predecessor , jaroslav kaczynski , who often seemed to go out of his way to offend german sensibilities .
the more eu-friendly tusk defeated kaczynski in poland 's hotly contested national election in november .
merkel was keen to echo the theme of a new polish-german frankness and friendship .
" we 've pledged not dodge any problems , " merkel said .
" together we can get a lot accomplished . "
a problematic past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as per the schengen agreement , the german-polish border will be opened in 2008 tusk and merkel arranged to meet with czech prime minister mirek topolanek on dec .
21 to discuss the opening of borders between the three countries .
and they also addressed two of the most contentious issues dividing poland and germany .
one of them is how to remember the past and , specifically , a planned memorial in berlin to expellees during world war ii - including germans driven from their homes in poland .
many poles see the project as an attempt to revise history and lessen germany 's wartime culpability .
tusk said he favored treating the subject of expellees of all nationalities in a museum about world war ii to be built in the city of gdansk , which used to be part of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is no doubt happy to have a new counterpart in warsaw merkel asserted that a museum could not replace the berlin memorial , but said that she supported the museum idea .
she also promised to send a delegation to warsaw to keep poland informed about the memorial and said germany had no interest in reviving past conflicts .
" there are no demands whatsoever for reparations from poland -lsb- to german refugees -rsb- , " merkel said .
" no german government is going to take a position that deviates from this . "
tusk said he welcomed the assurance as a " moment with symbolic value . "
a present pipeline merkel also discussed the natural-gas pipeline to be built under the baltic sea , which would connect germany with russia but bypass poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic pipeline remains a major sticking point tusk suggested that a meeting be arranged between the three countries to discuss the project in its current form .
such a meeting , he said , could bring about " positive corrections on both sides . "
the pipeline , which was negotiated by merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , has angered many poles , who worry about being held hostage on energy policy by russia and feel they have been ignored by their more powerful neighbors .
clearly , much work needs to be done to resolve such conflicts of interest , but tusk 's visit did re-establish a more civil tone between germany and poland .
he and merkel will have a chance to continue their open exchanges when they meet in the eastern german city of zittau in 10 days ' time . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

liz mohn leads family-run bertelsmann ag , the world 's fifth largest media conglomerate .
in an interview for dw-world.de 's chinese web site , she explained why love and respect are vital for global business success . dw-world.de : you 've spent a lot of time in china - what are your impressions ?
liz mohn : i am in awe of the chinese for making such an enormous economic leap .
it takes time to change a culture - you ca n't do it from one day to the next .
but they are really accomplishing a lot there .
it shows that the chinese people today are well educated .
without brains and talent , they could n't do it .
i also think the government learned they need to be careful about how to make people follow their ideas .
do germans see china 's economic growth and political importance as a challenge - or a threat ?
neither nor .
we have such a huge market in china .
it offers huge opportunities for both europe and china , not just on one side .
it is a unique experience .
there has n't been anything like it , any time since -lsb- world war ii -rsb- : that a whole world opens up , and we have the good fortune to experience it .
german chancellor angela merkel recently invited the dalai lama to visit germany , which has been hard on the relationship between china and germany .
what is your take on that ?
i think when different cultures come together , mistakes can be made on both sides .
in the christian religion , we say people should forgive .
without mistakes , we ca n't learn .
but i think different cultures do n't learn to understand each other overnight .
does bertelsmann have a long-term strategy in china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing once had bikes , now there are cars bertelsmann has been growing in china since 1995 and it is a market that we want to get into even more .
i think everything we do there is on a long-term basis .
there are so many questions you ca n't answer immediately .
things change so quickly with globalization .
bertelsmann has a long history .
what are you particularly proud of ?
we are the only media concern world-wide that is involved with so many different cultures .
when we went overseas , we respected the other cultures .
that was the strength of our company after the war .
despite the age of digitalization , statistics show germans still read a lot .
that is different in china though .
is your china strategy successful ?
as far as i know , the chinese like to read .
they are a cultured people .
but today people may be more likely to take an audio book , sure .
new times call for new measures .
i 'm amazed when i see the changes on the streets in china today .
how full they are with cars .
when i first started going to china , 12 or 13 years ago , it was bikes , then mopeds .
i found it fascinating to watch the changes - and i am amazed as how much they have achieved .
before china opened up to the west , people had little freedom .
now , young people are colorful .
they 've gotten more room to think , to live .
you claim that bertelsmann 's management culture relies on individuality and creativity .
how can we know that this is n't just lip service ?
after all , centralized leadership and hierarchy can be practical .
because without this management culture , bertelsmann would never have been as successful as it has been .
through our wartime experiences , and before the war , we saw what it meant to have a dictatorship .
no freedom .
later we saw that if you give people freedom to be creative and to think , then they are motivated .
when you are fair to people , and respect them , then people come together and work together , and you get a great success .
you have worked alongside your husband -lrb- bertelsmann owner reinhard mohn -rrb- , and been increasingly active , for years .
what aspect of your own personality is visible in bertelsmann 's culture ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard mohn , now 85 , has handed much power to his wife first i think that it is important to teach basic values - love and respect .
and to know that it is important to give something to society , not just take .
now , china is starting to develop charitable foundations .
i find that great .
and citizens are starting to create businesses that also help society .
these are huge advances .
you 've said creating a management style is bertelsmann 's most important business tool , given globalization .
is that true ?
yes .
for example , from our headquarters , we can not simply order around one of our managers in china .
he has to use his own head , his own ideas .
but at the same time , he needs to keep in mind the greater goals for company are .
he needs to know … what kind of mental and spiritual orientation we have , our values .
what are some other challenges for bertelsmann ?
finding good talent .
people who can lead worldwide .
you have sometimes been called an " iron lady " - is this an accurate description ?
well , i would n't say i am " ironclad . "
i might say : you need to use power to get something done .
otherwise you do n't get anywhere in this world .
you need to have a goal , and bring people along with you .
what other qualities make a good business leader ?
i like dealing with people very much , and that 's why i like my job so much .
i get to dialog with people from all over the world .
and i see that the more i learn , the more i have the feeling that i know nothing at all .
your story - you were a telephone operator who has become the head of a fifth-generation business family - is widely known .
is your life really like a fairy tale ?
no .
the people who know me well , know that you never get to the top without discipline and hard work .
you just ca n't do it any other way .
you also have to make mistakes .
that is a burden .
i think i was fortunate to meet a man who both helped me come into more responsibility in this part of my life , and to experience what i do today .
next year we will have been married for 50 years .
that is a long time .
you still appreciate your husband so much after 50 years of marriage ?
that 's unusual these days .
he is a great businessman , a great person , a great philosopher , he is never arrogant , always humble .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 11.12.2007 opinion : medvedev will uphold putin 's legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president vladimir putin has chosen dmitry medvedev to stand as presidential candidate next march .
dw-world 's ingo mannteufel says the liberal technocrat will uphold putin 's political course - with or without him as pm . the guessing game is over .
for months now , russian politics have been dominated by the question of who will succeed russian president vladimir putin in march 2008 .
russian law prevents presidents from standing for a third term of office .
speculation was rife about putin 's next move .
one scenario put forward was that putin would alter the constitution .
another saw putin naming a stand-in president , then returning to office after having fulfilled the constitution 's technical requirements .
it was difficult to imagine russia being governed by another politician after eight years of putin .
medvedev certain to be elected the russian president has decided to back dmitry medvedev , first deputy prime minister and board chairman of gas giant gazprom , to stand as a presidential candidate in march 2008 .
given what happened in russian parliamentary poll in early december , it is practically certain that medvedev will be elected in the first round of the elections on march 2 .
the kremlin propaganda machine functions magnificently , the administrative apparatus runs smoothly , and the significant size of russian security forces remove any lingering doubt about the outcome of the poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel there is no point in bemoaning the poor prospects for democracy in russia in the light of such political relations .
the vague and possibly premature hopes for a rapid democratization of russia were snuffed out some time ago .
with his decision in favor of medvedev , president putin has made a bold move and answered a number of questions about himself and russia 's future course .
not just a fill-in president putin will step down as president in march 2008 .
the intention is that 42-year-old medvedev should be president for the next four years - in all likelihood much longer .
medvedev is completely unsuited to just act as a stand-in who would keep the presidential post warm for putin .
in this respect , putin has remained true to himself - in spite of what all his opponents and his sycophantic supporters have said .
after all , he always said he would not violate the constitution in order to remain in office .
however , the end of putin 's presidential era does not spell the end of putin as the leading light in russian politics .
he will retain considerable influence over russian politics as head of united russia , or possibly as prime minister .
we will have to wait and see if putin will take up medvedev 's offer to take on the job of pm under him .
at any rate , medvedev is not expected to usher in any decisive course change .
putin 's longstanding ally has always been directly involved from the outset in shaping and representing putin 's policies in his previous posts .
medvedev looks set to continue pursuing putin 's goal of modernizing russia because he shares his convictions .
the loyal technocrat is the ideal candidate to ensure that putin 's course is maintained without the current president having to resort to any trickery with the constitution .
past will burden relations with europe president medvedev will be blemished by the fact that he has emerged from putin 's powerhouse .
his previous role as chair of the board at gazprom will also not help his popularity in europe given the poor image of the russia energy giant here .
on the other hand , medvedev is not the worst candidate from amongst the current russian elite .

berlin would rather stick to its own plans for remembrance . poland 's prime minister , donald tusk , called on monday , dec .
10 , for a grand-scale world war ii museum in the northern polish city of gdansk , the site of the nazi invasion on sept .
1 , 1939 . other countries , including germany , russia and israel could have a part in the museum , which was proposed as an alternative to a plan for an exhibition in berlin to remember german expellees from central and eastern europe during and just after world war ii . in the large gdansk museum , " the fate of expellees would have a place in a conclusive and comprehensive context , " said tusk in an interview with the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . the coastal city of gdansk , located on the baltic sea , is ripe with symbolic meaning . " the war began here , but in a sense it also ended here when the solidarity movement was founded in 1980 , " tusk said . started by polish laborers under lech walesa , solidarity , or solidarnosc , played a key role in the fall of communism in the former east-bloc country . berlin adamant about expulsion center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk became prime minister last month in response , the german government made it clear that tusk 's statement would have no bearing on plans for the expulsion center .
the governing coalition agreed in their founding contract in 2005 to set up a " visible sign of remembrance against expulsion " in berlin , said government spokesman thomas steg . the conflict began some seven years ago when the league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- started a foundation for a proposed expellee center .
the organization , which campaigns for the rights and remembrance of ethnic german expellees , has been seen in poland as overstating german suffering surrounding the holocaust . " the problem is not that anyone wants to prevent the germans from remembering the suffering of their own people , " tusk said .
" it becomes problematic when this remembrance of the german suffering diminishes another memory - namely that of the collective responsibility of the germans . " points of contention on tusk-merkel agenda the question of remembrance is likely to be a major agenda point when tusk meets with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin on tuesday . the two leaders are also slated to broach the ongoing issue of restitution claims for german expellees and re-settlers . the prussian claims society submitted claims for 22 individual claims cases to the european court for human rights in strasbourg in 2006 , requesting the return of land and property in present-day poland to ethnic germans who were forced out of their homes during the war . several more cases have been submitted since then , and still others are being reviewed in polish courts . " the german government has to take responsibility for the possible financial consequences arising from the compensation claims , " tusk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should expelled german be compensated for what they lost ?
berlin has maintained repeatedly that it does n't support such claims , with then german chancellor gerhard schröder making a binding statement to that effect in warsaw in 2004 . according to german estimates , some 15 million ethnic germans were expelled from their homes during or directly following the war .
some two million are thought to have died in the process . poland fears pipeline puts gas supply at risk plans for a joint russian-german gas pipeline along the baltic sea will be another matter of discussion at tuesday 's meeting . currently , russia sends gas to western europe via poland , but the baltic sea pipeline would circumvent the central european country .
poland has expressed concern that , in a political crisis , russia could shut its gas supply without affecting delivery to - and , hence , relations with - western europe . ahead of tuesday 's talks , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed optimism over the future of bilateral relations . " a concrete program to improve cooperation between the governments is being worked on , " he told the polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza on monday .
" the german and polish ministers will now meet together frequently and regularly . " topics of friction , such as expellee claims and the baltic pipeline would be dealt with " openly and constructively , " he added . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the world 's greatest challenge germany : allowances for co2 emissions during nuke phase-out german environment minister calls off biofuel plans cebit features green computing possibilities eu wants to set pace in protecting environment auto industry -pipe- 11.12.2007 experts split on best way to get cleaner cars on europe 's roads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those old cars may be cool , but many of them are also dirty europeans are struggling to find the best way to get high-pollutant cars off the streets .
while some countries bank on cash incentives , some german car experts believe there are better ways to go . the auto industry has plenty to lose sleep over .
not only is public discourse over the new dirty word " co2 " laying on pressure for change , sales are down as well . the german association of the automotive industry announced last week that car sales have dropped 9 percent this year - a record year - naming consumers ' uncertainty over planned vehicle tax reform , climate concerns and the 3-percent sales tax increase last january . it 's not surprising , then , that a plan recently came under discussion that would theoretically solve both environmental and economic concerns : the government would pay drivers a premium for scrapping their old , pollutant vehicles - or at least taking them off the road - in the hope that they put the money into a new car . the carbon dioxide-based vehicle tax , which the german government is currently considering , would provide an incentive for the buyer to select a low-emissions vehicle .
scrapping premiums would come from the vehicle tax pot , thereby being paid for by heavy emitters . potential two-pronged benefit for scrapping premium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim of a premium is to get old cars off the road , not necessarily destroy them " on the one hand , old cars are taken off the market and new cars , which generally have lower emissions , enter the market .
secondly , business would experience a boom , at least in the short term , " said willi diez , director of the german automobile industry institute , of the plan his organization proposed last month . a similar , reportedly successful project in italy serves as a model .
there , consumers are paid 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,170 -rrb- and given a two-year vehicle tax exemption when they scrap their old cars and buy new ones with emissions rates of less than 140 grams per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- . the incentive has gotten 500,000 old cars off italy 's streets since it started in january , according to a report by germany 's motorzeitung.de.
diez predicted that , if a premium of 1,000 euros was introduced in germany , it could lead to an additional 250,000 cars sold , with at least as many taken off the road . car expert slams scrapping plan for ferdinand dudenhöffer , co-founder and director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- at the gelsenkirchen technical college , the premium to scrap cars sounds like a marketing ploy . " the car industry is n't an industry that needs subsidies , " said dudenhöffer .
" there are much better ways to get customers to buy new cars . " a driver could take the premium and buy a big gas-guzzler if he or she wanted to , added dudenhöffer , who did n't see the proposed tax-break of 50 to 100 euros for more ecologically sound cars as enough of an incentive .
as for the old polluter , it 's more likely to end up on the road in eastern europe than to get scrapped , he said . " and russian co2 is just like german co2 , " he said . emissions trading could help europe reach target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to reach an average 130 grams of co2 per kilometer driven by 2012 the auto expert has been an outspoken proponent of emissions trading as the best way to reduce co2 output across europe .
that scenario would have carmakers buy certificates from an independent exchange for every vehicle they produce with a co2 emissions rate of more than 130 grams per kilometer , and sell one back for every car under the emissions limit . ultimately , said dudenhöffer , the emissions trading plan would help europe attain the 130-gram-per vehicle average it is striving for by 2012 . by making high-emission cars more expensive than clean ones , the customer bears the financial burden . " environmental consciousness may be getting a bit stronger , but you have to assume that when i buy something i pay attention to my needs and not to my neighbor 's , " dudenhöffer said .
" that 's why it 's better not to leave the environmental decision to the consumer but to set prices for co2 that allow these emission goals to be reached . " the plan 's weakness , countered diez , is that it 's too difficult to come up with a basis of calculation to determine a price for the so-called emissions certificates .
emissions trading already exists in stationary industries like power plants , but he said he did n't consider it a practical option for the auto sector . co2-based vehicle tax coming soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who want to drive big cars will have to pay more for them diez conceded , however , that the scrapping premium has n't been well received .

while some countries bank on cash incentives , some german car experts believe there are better ways to go . the auto industry has plenty to lose sleep over .
not only is public discourse over the new dirty word " co2 " laying on pressure for change , sales are down as well . the german association of the automotive industry announced last week that car sales have dropped 9 percent this year - a record year - naming consumers ' uncertainty over planned vehicle tax reform , climate concerns and the 3-percent sales tax increase last january . it 's not surprising , then , that a plan recently came under discussion that would theoretically solve both environmental and economic concerns : the government would pay drivers a premium for scrapping their old , pollutant vehicles - or at least taking them off the road - in the hope that they put the money into a new car . the carbon dioxide-based vehicle tax , which the german government is currently considering , would provide an incentive for the buyer to select a low-emissions vehicle .
scrapping premiums would come from the vehicle tax pot , thereby being paid for by heavy emitters . potential two-pronged benefit for scrapping premium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim of a premium is to get old cars off the road , not necessarily destroy them " on the one hand , old cars are taken off the market and new cars , which generally have lower emissions , enter the market .
secondly , business would experience a boom , at least in the short term , " said willi diez , director of the german automobile industry institute , of the plan his organization proposed last month . a similar , reportedly successful project in italy serves as a model .
there , consumers are paid 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,170 -rrb- and given a two-year vehicle tax exemption when they scrap their old cars and buy new ones with emissions rates of less than 140 grams per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- . the incentive has gotten 500,000 old cars off italy 's streets since it started in january , according to a report by germany 's motorzeitung.de.
diez predicted that , if a premium of 1,000 euros was introduced in germany , it could lead to an additional 250,000 cars sold , with at least as many taken off the road . car expert slams scrapping plan for ferdinand dudenhöffer , co-founder and director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- at the gelsenkirchen technical college , the premium to scrap cars sounds like a marketing ploy . " the car industry is n't an industry that needs subsidies , " said dudenhöffer .
" there are much better ways to get customers to buy new cars . " a driver could take the premium and buy a big gas-guzzler if he or she wanted to , added dudenhöffer , who did n't see the proposed tax-break of 50 to 100 euros for more ecologically sound cars as enough of an incentive .
as for the old polluter , it 's more likely to end up on the road in eastern europe than to get scrapped , he said . " and russian co2 is just like german co2 , " he said . emissions trading could help europe reach target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to reach an average 130 grams of co2 per kilometer driven by 2012 the auto expert has been an outspoken proponent of emissions trading as the best way to reduce co2 output across europe .
that scenario would have carmakers buy certificates from an independent exchange for every vehicle they produce with a co2 emissions rate of more than 130 grams per kilometer , and sell one back for every car under the emissions limit . ultimately , said dudenhöffer , the emissions trading plan would help europe attain the 130-gram-per vehicle average it is striving for by 2012 . by making high-emission cars more expensive than clean ones , the customer bears the financial burden . " environmental consciousness may be getting a bit stronger , but you have to assume that when i buy something i pay attention to my needs and not to my neighbor 's , " dudenhöffer said .
" that 's why it 's better not to leave the environmental decision to the consumer but to set prices for co2 that allow these emission goals to be reached . " the plan 's weakness , countered diez , is that it 's too difficult to come up with a basis of calculation to determine a price for the so-called emissions certificates .
emissions trading already exists in stationary industries like power plants , but he said he did n't consider it a practical option for the auto sector . co2-based vehicle tax coming soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who want to drive big cars will have to pay more for them diez conceded , however , that the scrapping premium has n't been well received .

berlin would rather stick to its own plans for remembrance . poland 's prime minister , donald tusk , called on monday , dec .
10 , for a grand-scale world war ii museum in the northern polish city of gdansk , the site of the nazi invasion on sept .
1 , 1939 . other countries , including germany , russia and israel could have a part in the museum , which was proposed as an alternative to a plan for an exhibition in berlin to remember german expellees from central and eastern europe during and just after world war ii . in the large gdansk museum , " the fate of expellees would have a place in a conclusive and comprehensive context , " said tusk in an interview with the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . the coastal city of gdansk , located on the baltic sea , is ripe with symbolic meaning . " the war began here , but in a sense it also ended here when the solidarity movement was founded in 1980 , " tusk said . started by polish laborers under lech walesa , solidarity , or solidarnosc , played a key role in the fall of communism in the former east-bloc country . berlin adamant about expulsion center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk became prime minister last month in response , the german government made it clear that tusk 's statement would have no bearing on plans for the expulsion center .
the governing coalition agreed in their founding contract in 2005 to set up a " visible sign of remembrance against expulsion " in berlin , said government spokesman thomas steg . the conflict began some seven years ago when the league of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- started a foundation for a proposed expellee center .
the organization , which campaigns for the rights and remembrance of ethnic german expellees , has been seen in poland as overstating german suffering surrounding the holocaust . " the problem is not that anyone wants to prevent the germans from remembering the suffering of their own people , " tusk said .
" it becomes problematic when this remembrance of the german suffering diminishes another memory - namely that of the collective responsibility of the germans . " points of contention on tusk-merkel agenda the question of remembrance is likely to be a major agenda point when tusk meets with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin on tuesday . the two leaders are also slated to broach the ongoing issue of restitution claims for german expellees and re-settlers . the prussian claims society submitted claims for 22 individual claims cases to the european court for human rights in strasbourg in 2006 , requesting the return of land and property in present-day poland to ethnic germans who were forced out of their homes during the war . several more cases have been submitted since then , and still others are being reviewed in polish courts . " the german government has to take responsibility for the possible financial consequences arising from the compensation claims , " tusk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should expelled german be compensated for what they lost ?
berlin has maintained repeatedly that it does n't support such claims , with then german chancellor gerhard schröder making a binding statement to that effect in warsaw in 2004 . according to german estimates , some 15 million ethnic germans were expelled from their homes during or directly following the war .
some two million are thought to have died in the process . poland fears pipeline puts gas supply at risk plans for a joint russian-german gas pipeline along the baltic sea will be another matter of discussion at tuesday 's meeting . currently , russia sends gas to western europe via poland , but the baltic sea pipeline would circumvent the central european country .
poland has expressed concern that , in a political crisis , russia could shut its gas supply without affecting delivery to - and , hence , relations with - western europe . ahead of tuesday 's talks , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed optimism over the future of bilateral relations . " a concrete program to improve cooperation between the governments is being worked on , " he told the polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza on monday .
" the german and polish ministers will now meet together frequently and regularly . " topics of friction , such as expellee claims and the baltic pipeline would be dealt with " openly and constructively , " he added . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" points of contention on tusk-merkel agenda the question of remembrance is likely to be a major agenda point when tusk meets with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin on tuesday . the two leaders are also slated to broach the ongoing issue of restitution claims for german expellees and re-settlers . the prussian claims society submitted claims for 22 individual claims cases to the european court for human rights in strasbourg in 2006 , requesting the return of land and property in present-day poland to ethnic germans who were forced out of their homes during the war . several more cases have been submitted since then , and still others are being reviewed in polish courts . " the german government has to take responsibility for the possible financial consequences arising from the compensation claims , " tusk said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should expelled german be compensated for what they lost ?
berlin has maintained repeatedly that it does n't support such claims , with then german chancellor gerhard schröder making a binding statement to that effect in warsaw in 2004 . according to german estimates , some 15 million ethnic germans were expelled from their homes during or directly following the war .
some two million are thought to have died in the process . poland fears pipeline puts gas supply at risk plans for a joint russian-german gas pipeline along the baltic sea will be another matter of discussion at tuesday 's meeting . currently , russia sends gas to western europe via poland , but the baltic sea pipeline would circumvent the central european country .
poland has expressed concern that , in a political crisis , russia could shut its gas supply without affecting delivery to - and , hence , relations with - western europe . ahead of tuesday 's talks , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier expressed optimism over the future of bilateral relations . " a concrete program to improve cooperation between the governments is being worked on , " he told the polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza on monday .
" the german and polish ministers will now meet together frequently and regularly . " topics of friction , such as expellee claims and the baltic pipeline would be dealt with " openly and constructively , " he added . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the expected declaration of independence by kosovo has a number of nations on edge .
those who oppose kosovo 's autonomy harbor separatists of their own .
a free kosovo could be just the rallying call these movements need . with all the signs pointing towards a declaration of independence from kosovo after the un-set deadline for reaching a settlement passes on monday , the european union is bracing itself for a wave of renewed calls for autonomy from separatist movements across europe .
if kosovo declares independence from serbia , it will set a powerful precedent for movements from spain to scotland , all wanting to rewrite the map of europe and form their own independent states , according to experts .
" there is a real risk that the quasi-dogma of the intangibility of borders which has existed since the end of the world war ii will fall , " french political scientist jean-yves camus of the paris-based iris institute told afp .
" this would benefit movements which seek to rewrite the map of europe based on ethnic , linguistic or cultural criteria , " added camus , a specialist on separatist movements in europe .
the emergence of similar lifestyles and english as a common language in europe , combined with the disappearance of borders and the lack of democratic legitimacy of eu bodies , had fueled " the development of micro-distinctive identities , " said camus .
while kosovo 's ethnic majority leaders have vowed not to unilaterally declare independence from serbia without us and european union approval , they are expected to announce their intentions to form a new state in early 2008 .
opposition includes fear of own breakaway states many of the countries which oppose the creation of an independent state of kosovo have at least one separatist movement working towards autonomy within their own borders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has been fighting chechen separatists for years serbia 's ally russia , which leads the opposition , has problems with separatists in chechnya and the caucasus region while spain has had a long-running dispute with the armed eta movement .
other countries against kosovo 's independence such as cyprus and greece have ethnic minorities which demand more power .
" in the west , this -lsb- kosovo -rsb- solution will set off separatists in europe , ” russian president vladimir putin said in an interview published in french newspaper le figaro earlier this year . ” look at scotland , catalonia and the basque country . "
spain is currently experiencing a period of unease as its northern basque country and its wealthy northeastern region of catalonia have stepped up their demands for more autonomy .
last year catalan voters overwhelmingly backed a new charter which recognized the region as a " nation " within spain and grants it enhanced powers in taxation and judicial matters .
separatists claim eu structure makes autonomy possible as in other separatist regions of europe like flanders , the dutch-speaking northern part of belgium , and northern italy , supporters said catalonia deserved extra powers because it makes a bigger contribution to the economy .
the armed basque separatist group eta ended a 15-month ceasefire in june while the scottish national party , which came to power in may , plans to hold a referendum on independence in 2010 .

why must we maintain this intermediate roof we call belgium , " the leader of the flemish nationalist party , bart de wever , told french daily le monde last month .
russia to block independence at un level meanwhile , russia stepped up its opposition tuesday by announcing that it would demand that the un security council annul any unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo .
" russia will of course demand the annulment of such a decision .

the expected declaration of independence by kosovo has a number of nations on edge .
those who oppose kosovo 's autonomy harbor separatists of their own .
a free kosovo could be just the rallying call these movements need . with all the signs pointing towards a declaration of independence from kosovo after the un-set deadline for reaching a settlement passes on monday , the european union is bracing itself for a wave of renewed calls for autonomy from separatist movements across europe .
if kosovo declares independence from serbia , it will set a powerful precedent for movements from spain to scotland , all wanting to rewrite the map of europe and form their own independent states , according to experts .
" there is a real risk that the quasi-dogma of the intangibility of borders which has existed since the end of the world war ii will fall , " french political scientist jean-yves camus of the paris-based iris institute told afp .
" this would benefit movements which seek to rewrite the map of europe based on ethnic , linguistic or cultural criteria , " added camus , a specialist on separatist movements in europe .
the emergence of similar lifestyles and english as a common language in europe , combined with the disappearance of borders and the lack of democratic legitimacy of eu bodies , had fueled " the development of micro-distinctive identities , " said camus .
while kosovo 's ethnic majority leaders have vowed not to unilaterally declare independence from serbia without us and european union approval , they are expected to announce their intentions to form a new state in early 2008 .
opposition includes fear of own breakaway states many of the countries which oppose the creation of an independent state of kosovo have at least one separatist movement working towards autonomy within their own borders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has been fighting chechen separatists for years serbia 's ally russia , which leads the opposition , has problems with separatists in chechnya and the caucasus region while spain has had a long-running dispute with the armed eta movement .
other countries against kosovo 's independence such as cyprus and greece have ethnic minorities which demand more power .
" in the west , this -lsb- kosovo -rsb- solution will set off separatists in europe , ” russian president vladimir putin said in an interview published in french newspaper le figaro earlier this year . ” look at scotland , catalonia and the basque country . "
spain is currently experiencing a period of unease as its northern basque country and its wealthy northeastern region of catalonia have stepped up their demands for more autonomy .
last year catalan voters overwhelmingly backed a new charter which recognized the region as a " nation " within spain and grants it enhanced powers in taxation and judicial matters .
separatists claim eu structure makes autonomy possible as in other separatist regions of europe like flanders , the dutch-speaking northern part of belgium , and northern italy , supporters said catalonia deserved extra powers because it makes a bigger contribution to the economy .
the armed basque separatist group eta ended a 15-month ceasefire in june while the scottish national party , which came to power in may , plans to hold a referendum on independence in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lingusitic divisions have led to a debate on splitting belgium belgium meanwhile has been without a government for six months after a general election on june 10 highlighted deep divisions between the nation 's majority dutch-speakers and francophones .
for many nationalists , membership in the 27-nation european union has only served to make separation seem more viable .
" europe can regulate our functionings and transfer payments .
why must we maintain this intermediate roof we call belgium , " the leader of the flemish nationalist party , bart de wever , told french daily le monde last month .
russia to block independence at un level meanwhile , russia stepped up its opposition tuesday by announcing that it would demand that the un security council annul any unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo .
" russia will of course demand the annulment of such a decision .
we will demand a meeting of the security council because it would be a violation of a council resolution , " russia 's interfax news agency quoted the country 's chief kosovo negotiator alexander botsan-kharchenko as saying . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while some countries bank on cash incentives , some german car experts believe there are better ways to go . the auto industry has plenty to lose sleep over .
not only is public discourse over the new dirty word " co2 " laying on pressure for change , sales are down as well . the german association of the automotive industry announced last week that car sales have dropped 9 percent this year - a record year - naming consumers ' uncertainty over planned vehicle tax reform , climate concerns and the 3-percent sales tax increase last january . it 's not surprising , then , that a plan recently came under discussion that would theoretically solve both environmental and economic concerns : the government would pay drivers a premium for scrapping their old , pollutant vehicles - or at least taking them off the road - in the hope that they put the money into a new car . the carbon dioxide-based vehicle tax , which the german government is currently considering , would provide an incentive for the buyer to select a low-emissions vehicle .
scrapping premiums would come from the vehicle tax pot , thereby being paid for by heavy emitters . potential two-pronged benefit for scrapping premium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aim of a premium is to get old cars off the road , not necessarily destroy them " on the one hand , old cars are taken off the market and new cars , which generally have lower emissions , enter the market .
secondly , business would experience a boom , at least in the short term , " said willi diez , director of the german automobile industry institute , of the plan his organization proposed last month . a similar , reportedly successful project in italy serves as a model .
there , consumers are paid 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,170 -rrb- and given a two-year vehicle tax exemption when they scrap their old cars and buy new ones with emissions rates of less than 140 grams per kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- . the incentive has gotten 500,000 old cars off italy 's streets since it started in january , according to a report by germany 's motorzeitung.de.
diez predicted that , if a premium of 1,000 euros was introduced in germany , it could lead to an additional 250,000 cars sold , with at least as many taken off the road . car expert slams scrapping plan for ferdinand dudenhöffer , co-founder and director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- at the gelsenkirchen technical college , the premium to scrap cars sounds like a marketing ploy . " the car industry is n't an industry that needs subsidies , " said dudenhöffer .
" there are much better ways to get customers to buy new cars . " a driver could take the premium and buy a big gas-guzzler if he or she wanted to , added dudenhöffer , who did n't see the proposed tax-break of 50 to 100 euros for more ecologically sound cars as enough of an incentive .
as for the old polluter , it 's more likely to end up on the road in eastern europe than to get scrapped , he said . " and russian co2 is just like german co2 , " he said . emissions trading could help europe reach target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to reach an average 130 grams of co2 per kilometer driven by 2012 the auto expert has been an outspoken proponent of emissions trading as the best way to reduce co2 output across europe .
that scenario would have carmakers buy certificates from an independent exchange for every vehicle they produce with a co2 emissions rate of more than 130 grams per kilometer , and sell one back for every car under the emissions limit . ultimately , said dudenhöffer , the emissions trading plan would help europe attain the 130-gram-per vehicle average it is striving for by 2012 . by making high-emission cars more expensive than clean ones , the customer bears the financial burden . " environmental consciousness may be getting a bit stronger , but you have to assume that when i buy something i pay attention to my needs and not to my neighbor 's , " dudenhöffer said .
" that 's why it 's better not to leave the environmental decision to the consumer but to set prices for co2 that allow these emission goals to be reached . " the plan 's weakness , countered diez , is that it 's too difficult to come up with a basis of calculation to determine a price for the so-called emissions certificates .
emissions trading already exists in stationary industries like power plants , but he said he did n't consider it a practical option for the auto sector . co2-based vehicle tax coming soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who want to drive big cars will have to pay more for them diez conceded , however , that the scrapping premium has n't been well received .
while politicians worry about where the money will come from , carmakers fear that the temporary boom caused by it will be followed by a painful dip in sales . meanwhile , the german government is in the process of approving a law , to take effect in january 2009 , that would adjust the annual vehicle tax according to a new car 's co2 emission rate . while dudenhöffer called it a " german solution to a european problem , " the sliding tax plays a key role in diez 's scrapping premium .
since old cars would continue to be charged according to their cubic capacity , buyers of new low-emissions cars would benefit the most . german auto club adac said it strongly supports the vehicle tax reform - a plan it had suggested to the government already in 2004 . but there 's even another , perhaps simpler way to cut emissions that does n't involve government-initiated incentives : " driving style should n't be underestimated , " said an adac spokesman .
driving ecologically - not accelerating quickly , shifting early and avoiding traffic - can save 20 to 30 percent on gas , he said .
and less gas means fewer emissions . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ban encompasses not only guns and knives , but baseball bats as well .
some say that 's not going far enough . the law is based on federal legislation , passed earlier this year , allowing local states to prohibit items that can be used to endanger public safety - including fake guns .
hamburg took the lead in pushing for such legislation and is the first state within germany to enact a prohibition on the local level .
the ban covers air rifles , billy clubs , brass knuckles , baseball bats , pepper spray and most forms of mace .
carrying any of those items in the neighborhoods affected by the law can be punished with a fine of up to 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,700 -rrb- .
" this is a further element promoting the safety of people in our city , " hamburg 's interior minister , udo nagel , told the ap news agency .
" by changing the laws we finally have the possibility of reigning in violence in areas that are especially at risk . "
criminal gangs are active on the reeperbahn , and knife fights and attacks with dangerous items occur with relative frequency .
too little or waste of time ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's reeperbahn is a popular attraction - despite crime rates hamburg 's governing conservatives and police hope the bans will reduce violent crime in troubled neighborhoods .
but not everyone likes the prohibition in its current form .
green party parliamentary and interior affairs experts antje möller has called for the ban to be extended to the entire city .
she also says that something should be done about shops that sell the items concerned - of which there are a number on and near the reeperbahn .
" it ca n't be the case that you 're not allowed to carry weapons , but trading in them is publicly accepted , " möller told the german public broadcaster ndr .
others question whether the ban will have any practical affect .
" anyone serious bent on robbing , raping or murdering others is n't interested in legislation - and certainly not in weapons legislation , " wrote one blogger on the german internet news site shortnews .
it will take time to see if the weapons ban succeeds in reducing crime in hamburg .
in the meantime , anyone wanting a pick up game of baseball in the city should probably steer clear of the reeperbahn . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world 's ingo mannteufel says the liberal technocrat will uphold putin 's political course - with or without him as pm . the guessing game is over .
for months now , russian politics have been dominated by the question of who will succeed russian president vladimir putin in march 2008 .
russian law prevents presidents from standing for a third term of office .
speculation was rife about putin 's next move .
one scenario put forward was that putin would alter the constitution .
another saw putin naming a stand-in president , then returning to office after having fulfilled the constitution 's technical requirements .
it was difficult to imagine russia being governed by another politician after eight years of putin .
medvedev certain to be elected the russian president has decided to back dmitry medvedev , first deputy prime minister and board chairman of gas giant gazprom , to stand as a presidential candidate in march 2008 .
given what happened in russian parliamentary poll in early december , it is practically certain that medvedev will be elected in the first round of the elections on march 2 .
the kremlin propaganda machine functions magnificently , the administrative apparatus runs smoothly , and the significant size of russian security forces remove any lingering doubt about the outcome of the poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel there is no point in bemoaning the poor prospects for democracy in russia in the light of such political relations .
the vague and possibly premature hopes for a rapid democratization of russia were snuffed out some time ago .
with his decision in favor of medvedev , president putin has made a bold move and answered a number of questions about himself and russia 's future course .
not just a fill-in president putin will step down as president in march 2008 .
the intention is that 42-year-old medvedev should be president for the next four years - in all likelihood much longer .
medvedev is completely unsuited to just act as a stand-in who would keep the presidential post warm for putin .
in this respect , putin has remained true to himself - in spite of what all his opponents and his sycophantic supporters have said .
after all , he always said he would not violate the constitution in order to remain in office .
however , the end of putin 's presidential era does not spell the end of putin as the leading light in russian politics .
he will retain considerable influence over russian politics as head of united russia , or possibly as prime minister .
we will have to wait and see if putin will take up medvedev 's offer to take on the job of pm under him .
at any rate , medvedev is not expected to usher in any decisive course change .
putin 's longstanding ally has always been directly involved from the outset in shaping and representing putin 's policies in his previous posts .
medvedev looks set to continue pursuing putin 's goal of modernizing russia because he shares his convictions .
the loyal technocrat is the ideal candidate to ensure that putin 's course is maintained without the current president having to resort to any trickery with the constitution .
past will burden relations with europe president medvedev will be blemished by the fact that he has emerged from putin 's powerhouse .
his previous role as chair of the board at gazprom will also not help his popularity in europe given the poor image of the russia energy giant here .
on the other hand , medvedev is not the worst candidate from amongst the current russian elite .
the former law professor from st. petersburg is reputed to be one of the more liberal spirits in the kremlin .
in addition , he has no direct contacts to the soviet or the post-soviet security services .
and given his relative youth , he also stands for a new russia that europe - and the west in general - will have to learn to live with .
the russian president 's decision to select medvedev is not likely to find favor with all of the factions who putin can currently rally behind him .
the effects of a change in president in terms of who has what access to important financial and business resources are not likely to be clear for a while , and the process will not be without its tensions .
the question is whether the first cracks within russia 's kremlin elite will already have become apparent ahead of the elections in march , thus threatening the transfer of power .
then things could get tricky for putin as the one responsible for naming medvedev his political heir .

nhs bosses are splitting up many two-person ambulance crews in an effort to meet new response-time targets .
some staff say " solo-responders " are not always appropriate and that it is a bid to get the service on the cheap .
but ministers insist the move " does not present a risk to patients " and that it will free up resources for other calls .
from next april , the 10 ambulance trusts in england will have to respond to three quarters of the most serious emergencies within eight minutes from the point the call is answered .
what is a solo-responder ?
solo-responders , or rapid response vehicles as they are sometimes known , are basically estate cars or 4x4s equipped with the resources of an ambulance they became popular in the 1990s as ambulance bosses came under pressure to hit response-time targets the vehicles are only manned by one person unlike ambulances which are double-manned .
this poses issues if the person needs to be transported there is no policy banning the transportation of patients in rapid response vehicles , but doctors and paramedics have concerns ambulances : a history to date , the clock has only started ticking once details , including telephone number , address and problem , had been taken .
critics said this process had been taking several minutes in some cases , masking the true response times .
the bbc has learned that all but one of the ambulance trusts submitted plans to the government in the autumn putting forward the case for using solo-responders more .
and officials believe the remaining trust , which has not been named , will take such an approach later .
ambulance bosses are now ordering new fleets of solo-response cars with a view to splitting up many of their double-manned ambulance crews to ensure they have enough resources to meet the target .
the ambulances left in operation are likely to be run by a paramedic working alongside an emergency care assistant , trained in basic life support and first aid .
have your say " less red tape , less targets , less bureaucracy equals more ambulances " nick smith , huddersfield send us your comments department of health staffing projections show that the number of assistants is set to treble to over 3,300 by 2011 .
the south central ambulance trust has confirmed it will be responding to most emergency calls by a solo-responder in the future .
and in london , the capital 's fleet of solo-responders will increase by 50 % to 200 by april .
transporting patients meanwhile , east midlands bosses are reducing its ambulance fleet and increasing its solo responders so that a third of its fleet is cars compared to a quarter currently .
tony dell , chairman of the nhs confederation 's ambulance forum , which represents trusts , said : " it is going to be beneficial to patients .
they are not going to see any diminishing in skills and the responses will be faster . "
but jonathan fox , of the association of professional ambulance personnel and the driver of a solo-responder vehicle , said : " we are trying to do things on the cheap and that is never good for patients . "
you may get solo responders sent when an ambulance crew would be best " sam oestreicher , of unison " we are already hearing of solo-responders transporting patients , but that is not right as you can not manage the patient if you are driving .
" solo-responders have their place , but the emphasis now is on hitting the eight-minute target rather than what is happening once you are there . "
sam oestreicher , of unison , agreed the target distorted priorities and could " potentially put patients at risk " .
" you may get solo-responders sent when an ambulance crew would be best . "
but he also added the deployment of solo-responders was appropriate in some cases as the ambulance service was increasingly dealing with non-life threatening conditions .
concerns have also been expressed by doctors .
martin shalley , of the british emergency medicine association , said : " there is a concern that because of the target solo-responders will be sent out when an ambulance crew should .
" sometimes patients are so seriously hurt you need more than just one person there immediately . "
but health minister ben bradshaw said the reliance on solo-responders " does not present a risk to patients " and freed up resources for other calls .
he added : " fast-response vehicles can often get to the scene faster than traditional ambulances , and can provide assessment and care until a further response arrives . "

scientists believe a patch of ground disturbed by the vehicle shows evidence of a past environment that would have been perfect for microbial life .
the deposits were probably produced when hot spring water or steam came into contact with volcanic rocks .
on earth , these are locations that tend to teem with bacteria , said rover chief scientist steve squyres .

spirit has been driving with a broken wheel that constantly digs a trough as the vehicle trundles across the martian landscape .
in may this year , scientists working on the mission noticed the churned-up soil had a much brighter appearance than usual .
the rovers were originally designed to complete a 90-day mission further investigation revealed it to be extremely rich in silica - the main ingredient of window glass - and spirit was commanded to examine the ground and nearby rocks in detail for extra clues .
the researchers have now concluded that the bright material must have been produced in one of two ways .
one hypothesis is that spirit is seeing hot-spring deposits produced when water dissolves silica at one location and then dumps it in another .
the classic example is a geyser .
the other idea being pursued by the rover team is that they have stumbled across a fumarole , where acidic steam rises through cracks in rocks and strips them of all of their mineral components , apart from silica .

" so this is a representation of what was in the past a local habitable environment . "
the rover is not equipped to look for the evidence of life itself .
it was designed to read the geological conditions in front of it and tell the scientists what the environmental conditions might once have been like .

professor squyres suggested such missions ought to keep an eye out for silica-rich deposits .
and he said any future efforts to return material to earth laboratories might also like to target these kinds of deposits .
he said : " one of the great things about these deposits is that not only does the hot water provide an environment in which the microbes can thrive , but the precipitation of that silica entombs and preserves them .

the building is central to aston 's plan to expand production at the gaydon site under its new owners , a consortium headed by racing guru david richards .
chief executive dr ulrich bez wants to raise output from 7,000 cars per year to cut waiting lists .
" i would like to supply cars to customers in a decent time , " he says .
new markets fresh demand from wealthy customers in china , russia , south africa and new zealand is driving dr bez 's desire to expand .
the most powerful aston martin yet , the v12 vantage rs with 600bhp , was unveiled at the event .
in pictures in china , aston has just opened its first showroom in shanghai and will open one in beijing this month .
a moscow showroom was also opened this year .
" we want to grow , and to have higher visibility , " dr bez tells the bbc .
" we are building the brand , we are speeding up . "
this should be done by making more cars to supply new markets , rather than by transferring cars from dealers in established markets , dr bez explains .
" we do n't want to take cars away from anyone else , " he says .
however , the gaydon development , which is centred around a dedicated aston martin production facility that opened in 2003 , is not merely about raising volumes .
marketing tools that money can buy is not what i 'm looking for ulrich bez chief executive aston martin " we do not only increase our design capacity with this .
we also improve our design quality , " says dr bez .
gaydon and the 1,500 people who work there will remain central to the company 's future .
aston makes its own engines , underframes and chassis at the site .
however , there is every chance that some of its future models - including the £ 200,000 rapide which will arrive in about two years - will be made outside the uk , though most likely within the european union .
marketing efforts tuesday night 's launch party , which is described as " an evening of architecture , art and cool cars " , will be used to showcase aston 's latest concept car .
the event will be attended by a string of aston martin 's customers , including many celebrities .
david richards and his consortium paid £ 479m for aston such exclusive events are central to aston martin 's discreet marketing strategy .
" marketing tools that money can buy is not what i 'm looking for , " dr bez says .
" what you see of us is what we are , not what you see from marketing . "
consequently , aston martin 's " marketing spend is , when compared with other companies , very small " .
in addition to the race days the company arranges for its customers , it also sends out a glossy magazine that relies heavily on the marque 's association with other luxury brands , featuring modern design and architecture , and glamorous locations .
in line with its philosophy of success by association , aston martin will occasionally be a sponsor - and not just of the fictional british agent james bond .
" we are sponsoring -lsb- the operatic tenor -rsb- placido domingo 's world tour , " says dr bez .
" he called me personally . "

the most powerful aston martin yet , the v12 vantage rs with 600bhp , was unveiled at the event .
in pictures in china , aston has just opened its first showroom in shanghai and will open one in beijing this month .
a moscow showroom was also opened this year .
" we want to grow , and to have higher visibility , " dr bez tells the bbc .
" we are building the brand , we are speeding up . "
this should be done by making more cars to supply new markets , rather than by transferring cars from dealers in established markets , dr bez explains .
" we do n't want to take cars away from anyone else , " he says .
however , the gaydon development , which is centred around a dedicated aston martin production facility that opened in 2003 , is not merely about raising volumes .
marketing tools that money can buy is not what i 'm looking for ulrich bez chief executive aston martin " we do not only increase our design capacity with this .
we also improve our design quality , " says dr bez .
gaydon and the 1,500 people who work there will remain central to the company 's future .
aston makes its own engines , underframes and chassis at the site .
however , there is every chance that some of its future models - including the £ 200,000 rapide which will arrive in about two years - will be made outside the uk , though most likely within the european union .
marketing efforts tuesday night 's launch party , which is described as " an evening of architecture , art and cool cars " , will be used to showcase aston 's latest concept car .
the event will be attended by a string of aston martin 's customers , including many celebrities .
david richards and his consortium paid £ 479m for aston such exclusive events are central to aston martin 's discreet marketing strategy .
" marketing tools that money can buy is not what i 'm looking for , " dr bez says .
" what you see of us is what we are , not what you see from marketing . "
consequently , aston martin 's " marketing spend is , when compared with other companies , very small " .
in addition to the race days the company arranges for its customers , it also sends out a glossy magazine that relies heavily on the marque 's association with other luxury brands , featuring modern design and architecture , and glamorous locations .
in line with its philosophy of success by association , aston martin will occasionally be a sponsor - and not just of the fictional british agent james bond .
" we are sponsoring -lsb- the operatic tenor -rsb- placido domingo 's world tour , " says dr bez .
" he called me personally . "
" then of course i invite -lsb- some customers -rsb- to the concerts .
i offer them something they can not buy .

by nick triggle health reporter , bbc news the modern ambulance service has come a long way the modern ambulance service was born in 1946 when local authorities were given responsibilities for transporting patients to hospital .
but the emphasis was very much on the ferrying as they were not expected to provide medical treatment for another 20 years .
but the origins of the service actually date back much further .
indeed , there are reports showing the injured and hurt were carried on horses during norman times to places where they could be helped .
but the birth of any sort of system started in victorian london .
the capital is believed to have had the first full-time service when in 1897 the metropolitan asylums board began transporting patients .
initially this was done by a horse-drawn carriage , but later steam and electric vehicles were introduced , before the petrol-powered motor became popular .
by 1930 , the organisation had a fleet of 150 ambulances and six large ambulance lorries .
patchwork and they were also joined by a london police ambulance service .
elsewhere , particularly in cities and towns , a patchwork of ambulance services began to emerge .
these were loosely run by town hall administrators with the help of the british red cross .
and it was this system that served britain so well during the german bombing campaign during the second world war .
ambulance timeline 1897 - the metropolitan asylums board start transferring patients to hospitals in one of the first schemes of its kind 1946 - 1946 national health services act requires councils to provide ambulances " where necessary " 1964 - the millar report recommends ambulances provide treatment as well as transport 1974 - ambulance services transferred to nhs control hundreds of lives were saved as volunteers dragged the injured from the rubble of bombed-buildings and took them to hospital .
the success persuaded the atlee government to set up a national ambulance service at the same time it was creating the nhs .
the 1946 national health services act required councils to provide ambulances - albeit with the caveat " where necessary " .
this continued until 1964 when a government-commissioned report called for ambulance services to provide treatment .
soon it became common-place for life-saving procedures such as haemorrhage control , neck and back injury care , heart resuscitation and oxygen to be given in the back of ambulances .
by the mid 1970s , the medical aspect had developed at such a pace that it was felt necessary to hand control of the service to the nhs .
and then as technology developed even further so did the form of ambulances .
the first air ambulance was launched in cornwall in 1987 .
and then in the early 1990s ambulance cars , staffed by one paramedic , became popular in london in response to a shortage of staff .
other areas soon followed .
solo-response cars this period also saw a change in the nature of calls ambulance services began to receive .
unison official sam oestreicher said : " increasingly , people began dialling 999 for things that were not life-threatening .
" i think there were a number of reasons for this - people becoming more demanding of the nhs and problems with seeing doctors during out-of-hours . "
this in itself demanded a different response from ambulances with more call to treat patients at the scene .
again , this allowed policy-makers to put the case for the solo-response cars .
increasingly , people began dialling 999 for things that were not life-threatening sam oestreicher , of unison fears over ambulance ' shake-up ' but their use is now becoming even more widespread as bosses grapple with ways to hit ever-more ambitous response times under the call connect target .
from next april , ambulance services will have to answer the most serious calls within eight minutes .
to do this , many are splitting up their two-manned ambulance crews and putting more solo-reponse cars on the road .
the move prompts the question : is this the beginning of the end for ambulances ?
no , not quite , says mr oestreicher .
" there will always be a place for the traditional ambulance .
solo-responder need them as back up and some patients will need to be transported to hospital .
" the ambulance service is just evolving . "

the capital is believed to have had the first full-time service when in 1897 the metropolitan asylums board began transporting patients .
initially this was done by a horse-drawn carriage , but later steam and electric vehicles were introduced , before the petrol-powered motor became popular .
by 1930 , the organisation had a fleet of 150 ambulances and six large ambulance lorries .
patchwork and they were also joined by a london police ambulance service .
elsewhere , particularly in cities and towns , a patchwork of ambulance services began to emerge .
these were loosely run by town hall administrators with the help of the british red cross .
and it was this system that served britain so well during the german bombing campaign during the second world war .
ambulance timeline 1897 - the metropolitan asylums board start transferring patients to hospitals in one of the first schemes of its kind 1946 - 1946 national health services act requires councils to provide ambulances " where necessary " 1964 - the millar report recommends ambulances provide treatment as well as transport 1974 - ambulance services transferred to nhs control hundreds of lives were saved as volunteers dragged the injured from the rubble of bombed-buildings and took them to hospital .
the success persuaded the atlee government to set up a national ambulance service at the same time it was creating the nhs .
the 1946 national health services act required councils to provide ambulances - albeit with the caveat " where necessary " .
this continued until 1964 when a government-commissioned report called for ambulance services to provide treatment .
soon it became common-place for life-saving procedures such as haemorrhage control , neck and back injury care , heart resuscitation and oxygen to be given in the back of ambulances .
by the mid 1970s , the medical aspect had developed at such a pace that it was felt necessary to hand control of the service to the nhs .
and then as technology developed even further so did the form of ambulances .
the first air ambulance was launched in cornwall in 1987 .
and then in the early 1990s ambulance cars , staffed by one paramedic , became popular in london in response to a shortage of staff .
other areas soon followed .
solo-response cars this period also saw a change in the nature of calls ambulance services began to receive .
unison official sam oestreicher said : " increasingly , people began dialling 999 for things that were not life-threatening .
" i think there were a number of reasons for this - people becoming more demanding of the nhs and problems with seeing doctors during out-of-hours . "
this in itself demanded a different response from ambulances with more call to treat patients at the scene .
again , this allowed policy-makers to put the case for the solo-response cars .
increasingly , people began dialling 999 for things that were not life-threatening sam oestreicher , of unison fears over ambulance ' shake-up ' but their use is now becoming even more widespread as bosses grapple with ways to hit ever-more ambitous response times under the call connect target .
from next april , ambulance services will have to answer the most serious calls within eight minutes .
to do this , many are splitting up their two-manned ambulance crews and putting more solo-reponse cars on the road .
the move prompts the question : is this the beginning of the end for ambulances ?
no , not quite , says mr oestreicher .
" there will always be a place for the traditional ambulance .
solo-responder need them as back up and some patients will need to be transported to hospital .
" the ambulance service is just evolving . "

officials said the computer did not " have a button for miracles " .
june clarke , 56 , from plymouth , devon , slipped on a wet canteen floor at work in january 2000 and badly damaged her hip , pelvis and lower spine .
last year she says she received healing at a christian conference and within hours she was able to fold away her wheelchair and stop taking painkillers .
for six years she had experienced progressive , intense pain and was unable to continue working or walk more than a few steps .
mrs clarke 's husband stuart , a pastor at hooe baptist church , said he prayed every day after the accident for god to " bring my wife back " .
then last year she was invited to the christian conference .
it ca n't be often that a government department gets a complaint about unwanted cash june clarke she says medics were amazed by her recovery , which she puts down to the power of prayer and patience .
when mrs clarke realised she was completely healed she contacted the government industrial injury department to put a stop to the benefits she had been receiving , but the payments continued .
mr and mrs clarke sent letters and made phone calls , but officials told them the system was unable to recognise an apparently miraculous recovery .
mrs clarke had been awarded an allowance for life and the computer was not programmed to allow that payment to end while she was still alive .
after six months , she saw an official government doctor who registered her as fully fit .
mrs clarke 's husband stuart is a pastor at hooe baptist church the allowance was stopped and mrs clarke was able to repay the money .
mr clarke said : " we would have loved to have used the money for a good cause , but it was n't ours to spend .

a spokesperson from the department for work and pensions said : " each case is treated individually .

unveiled at the un climate convention meeting in bali , its survey suggests professionals have more confidence in bicycles than in biofuels .
the findings come as ministers assemble for the final part of the un talks .
conservation groups have highlighted the impact of climate change in the tropics and the antarctic .
if nobody shows the willingness to deal with the reduction of carbon emissions to a manageable level , then what are we doing here ?
thelma krug , brazilian delegate european negotiators at the two-week meeting in the beach resort of nusa dua are hoping that the meeting will launch a two-year process leading to a further round of binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions , to come into force when the current kyoto protocol targets expire in 2012 .
but delegates say much ground remains to be covered as ministers from nearly 190 nations arrive for the last three days of discussions under the un climate convention -lrb- unfccc -rrb- and kyoto protocol .
fuelling doubts " technology must be at the heart of the future response to climate change , " unfccc executive secretary yvo de boer declared at the talks .
but which technology ?
in a survey of 1,000 professionals in 105 countries , iucn attempted to gauge which technologies inspired the most confidence .
the survey included people from governments , ngos and industry .
delivering a low-carbon future in detail of 18 technologies suggested by iucn , the current generation of biofuels came bottom of the list , with only 21 % believing in its potential to " lower overall carbon levels in the atmosphere without unacceptable side effects " over the next 25 years .
nearly twice as many were confident in the potential of nuclear energy , while solar power for hot water and solar power for electricity emerged as the most favoured low-carbon technologies .
overall , respondents said increasing energy efficiency and reducing demand could produce more benefits than " clean " energy sources .
although the eu and the us are attempting to boost the expansion of biofuels , recent evidence is equivocal about their potential .
studies show they may produce only marginal carbon savings compared to conventional petrol and diesel .
in indonesia and elsewhere , forests are being cleared for palm oil plantations , partly to produce biofuels .
there is evidence that leaving forests intact results in greater climate benefits while protecting biodiversity .
life at the extremes two presentations on the sidelines of the bali conference have highlighted the impacts of climate change on the natural world .
conservation international -lrb- ci -rrb- researchers took forecasts from the the intergovernmental panel on climate change 's -lrb- ipcc -rrb- 2007 assessment of the earth 's likely climatic future , and calculated what those forecast trends would mean for areas safeguarded for nature , such as national parks and forest reserves .
penguins along the antarctic peninsula are declining , says wwf they found that more than half of these zones were vulnerable to projected climate change .
in 21 countries , mainly in the tropics , more than 90 % of protected areas were vulnerable .
" we previously assumed that if the land is protected , then the plants and animals living there will persist , " said sandy andelman , head of ci 's tropical ecology assessment and monitoring network .
" that may be wishful thinking . "
wwf , meanwhile , looked at conditions at the earth 's other climatic extreme - the cold of the antarctic peninsula .
this tendril of land that projects from the antarctic towards the tip of south america is warming much faster than the global average .
according to wwf researchers , sea ice cover has declined by about 40 % over the last quarter century .
" the research done over the last couple of years is that many penguin populations across antarctica are in decline , with some dropping as much as 65 % , " said wwf 's director-general jim leape .
" you are seeing a massive loss of sea ice in important parts of the continent , and that sea ice is crucial to the food web of antarctica upon which these penguins depend . "
binding ties like other conservation groups , wwf is calling for the inclusion of binding targets for reducing carbon emissions in any agreement coming out of the bali conference .
a draft circulating this week calls for industrialised nations to cut their emissions by 25-40 % by 2020 .
it is supported by the eu .
but the us , australia , canada and japan are arguing against the inclusion of concrete targets at this stage .
gore in nobel climate plea " to start with a predetermined answer , we do n't think is an appropriate thing to do , " us chief negotiator harlan watson has said .
but there is frustration among some developing countries at what they see as a lack of political will among the high emitters .
" if nobody shows the willingness to deal with the reduction of carbon emissions to a manageable level , then what are we doing here ? "
brazilian delegate thelma krug told the afp news agency .
receiving the nobel peace prize in oslo yon monday , former us vice-president al gore urged the us and china to " stop using the others ' behaviour as an excuse for stalemate " and work together to find a mutually acceptable way of tackling climate change .
mr gore and his fellow nobel laureate , ipcc chairman rajendra pachauri , will be in bali for the ministerial talks , as will the new australian prime minister kevin rudd , whose recent ratification of the kyoto protocol injected fresh optimism into the un process .

it has urged the uk 's takeover panel to invoke the so-called " put up or shut up " rule which imposes a time limit on would-be buyers .
rio has already dismissed bhp 's $ 130bn -lrb- £ 63.2bn -rrb- approach as too low .
separately , reports say that xstrata - the world 's sixth largest miner - is open to talks with potential suitors .
the london-listed firm has hired advisers to listen to interested parties , the financial time said .
booming demand from china and india has made commodities firms attractive , with analysts expecting more consolidation in the sector .
rival bid ?
rio said that if the ruling was made , it would mean that bhp must " either announce a firm intention to make an offer ... or announce that it does not intend to make an offer " .
most analysts believed that the move was designed to break the stalemate between the two companies - but that bhp would have to sweeten its offer if it were to have any success .
bhp declined to comment , saying it was a matter for the takeover panel .
in an attempt to defend itself against bhp , anglo-australian firm rio has already said it will look to boost shareholder value by selling off $ 30bn-worth of its business , including two uranium projects in australia and a zinc , lead and silver mine in the us .
analysts say that rio 's refusal to team up with bhp is indicative of its conviction that mineral and metal prices will stay high for years to come , fuelled by strong demand from emerging economies such as china and india .
a report in the daily telegraph earlier this week said that us private equity giant blackstone was planning a rival bid for rio tinto .
the paper said that blackstone was creating a consortium , thought to include a chinese sovereign wealth fund , to make the bid .

anglo-australian mining giant rio tinto has called for rival bhp billiton to be forced to formalise its offer for the firm or withdraw its bid plans .
it has urged the uk 's takeover panel to invoke the so-called " put up or shut up " rule which imposes a time limit on would-be buyers .
rio has already dismissed bhp 's $ 130bn -lrb- £ 63.2bn -rrb- approach as too low .
separately , reports say that xstrata - the world 's sixth largest miner - is open to talks with potential suitors .
the london-listed firm has hired advisers to listen to interested parties , the financial time said .
booming demand from china and india has made commodities firms attractive , with analysts expecting more consolidation in the sector .
rival bid ?
rio said that if the ruling was made , it would mean that bhp must " either announce a firm intention to make an offer ... or announce that it does not intend to make an offer " .
most analysts believed that the move was designed to break the stalemate between the two companies - but that bhp would have to sweeten its offer if it were to have any success .
bhp declined to comment , saying it was a matter for the takeover panel .
in an attempt to defend itself against bhp , anglo-australian firm rio has already said it will look to boost shareholder value by selling off $ 30bn-worth of its business , including two uranium projects in australia and a zinc , lead and silver mine in the us .
analysts say that rio 's refusal to team up with bhp is indicative of its conviction that mineral and metal prices will stay high for years to come , fuelled by strong demand from emerging economies such as china and india .
a report in the daily telegraph earlier this week said that us private equity giant blackstone was planning a rival bid for rio tinto .
the paper said that blackstone was creating a consortium , thought to include a chinese sovereign wealth fund , to make the bid .

bbc news -pipe- science / nature -pipe- hold back the geo-engineering tide home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : tuesday , 11 december 2007 , 09:08 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version hold back the geo-engineering tide viewpoint kristina gjerde projects that add nutrients to the world 's oceans in order to create algal blooms that will absorb more carbon from the atmosphere are scientifically unsound , argues kristina gjerde , high seas policy advisor to the world conservation union .
in this week 's green room , she calls on delegates at the un climate conference to halt schemes that could do more harm than good .
experiments to date have shown that the amount of carbon actually exported to the deep ocean is small and highly uncertain current proposals to combat climate change by stimulating phytoplankton or algal blooms in the ocean may violate fundamental principles of international law , as well as common sense .
adding nutrients , such as iron or nitrogen , or pumping nutrient-rich deep waters up into surface waters in the hope that the resulting bloom will provide long-term storage of carbon dioxide , should not be considered as a potential solution to climate change .
we first need regulations based on credible science to ensure that the method is safe and effective , and that we can verify the results .
two decades of scientific study have shown that ocean fertilisation offers a low probability of lasting benefits and a high probability of harm .
we do n't need quick fixes to this global problem that may , in the long-term , cause far more harm than good the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- considers ocean fertilisation as " speculative and unproven , and with the risk of unknown side effects " .
nevertheless , it continues to be touted as a simple solution to climate change .
uncertain science for such a practice to be effective in mitigating climate change , substantial amounts of additional carbon dioxide must reach the deep ocean and , ideally , be incorporated into the sediments .
experiments to date have shown that the amount of carbon actually exported to the deep ocean is small and highly uncertain .
at present , it is unlikely that significant and verifiable sequestration will occur .
algal blooms can devastate aquatic ecosystems for ocean fertilisation to be safe , and in compliance with international law , it must not harm the marine environment .
however , possible ecological effects include shifts in plankton community structure that could dramatically alter food webs , creation of dead zones deprived of oxygen as the excess plant life decays , and harmful algal blooms .
in addition , the bloom may affect areas far from the original site .
one fertilised patch travelled 1,500 km in 19 days , while modelling studies show that adding nutrients to one area can lead to reductions in productivity in other areas .
though it is difficult to predict with certainty , activities conducted in one nation 's waters may affect the waters of another state , or the high seas .
similarly , activities on the high seas could impact not only the direct area , but also waters under national jurisdiction and control .
furthermore , atmospheric scientists are concerned that artificially-stimulated blooms could exacerbate climate change by increasing the production of nitrous oxide , a greenhouse gas far more potent than carbon dioxide .
this may well offset any benefits from carbon dioxide reduction , while the marine ecosystem side-effects remain .
moreover , additional atmospheric side-effects such as the production of methane , another important greenhouse gas , as well as other gases that are known to influence clouds and ozone , may also result .
need for common sense no evidence has been produced to allay these concerns .
difficulties in actually proving or verifying carbon dioxide sequestration , should it occur , make the current informal and unregulated market for carbon offsets vulnerable to unsubstantiated and unverifiable claims .
all this makes ocean fertilisation a highly unfit candidate for carbon credits .
phytoplankton are the basis for most oceanic food webs recently , a meeting on the international agreements that regulate dumping of wastes and other matter at sea -lrb- the london convention and london protocol -rrb- urged states to use the utmost caution when considering proposals for large-scale fertilisation operations .
it also stressed that " such large-scale operations are currently not justified " .
the decision of governments at the london meeting could not be more timely , as some commercial operations are carrying out pilot projects of ever-increasing scale .
one company is already offering carbon offsets to the public on its website to support its work .
the recently published ipcc fourth assessment synthesis report again confirmed that the effects of climate change are real and that they are already upon us .
but in our efforts to find a quick fix , international law and common sense should not be the first victims .
the oceans are complex , dynamic , unpredictable and already vulnerable to the effects of climate change and acidification .
we need mechanisms that will build their resilience , not undermine it .
independent look the concept of ocean fertilisation needs to be stringently scrutinised through independent peer-reviewed science , not left in the hands of entrepreneurs .
it should not be allowed to proceed until these two preconditions have been met : the benefits , if any , need to outweigh the risks to the marine environment we need to be able to independently verify and regulate any real , measurable , long-term carbon dioxide sequestration benefits , if they are found to occur during the second week of the un climate change conference in bali , governments should apply similarly rigorous standards to all proposed " geo-engineering " solutions .
we do n't need quick fixes to this global problem that may , in the long-term , cause far more harm than good .
kristina m gjerde is a high seas policy adviser to the world conservation union -lrb- iucn -rrb- the author would like to acknowledge the assistance of rosemary rayfuse from school of law , university of new south wales , and mark lawrence of the max planck institute for chemistry , germany .
this article is based on a forthcoming publication in the international journal of marine and coastal law .
the green room is a series of opinion articles on environmental topics running weekly on the bbc news website do you agree with kristina gjerde ?
will schemes like ocean fertilisation do more harm than good ?
should we wait until the science is proven before embarking on large-scale geo-engineering projects ?
or do we need to act now if we are to stand any chance of combatting climate change ? yeah ! act now ! the mess we 're in is due to large-scale geo-engineering ! the last thing we need to do is diversify our tinkering ! we already know what we need to do - stop destroying ecosystems for short-term gains , and stop wasting energy ! industry should be regulated because they are major point-sources for most of the factors of ' climate change ' .
but , world populations should also be educated and encouraged to reduce their own ' carbon foot-print ' by purchasing more responsibly and using energy more selectively and / or efficiently. in this age , people should be aware of the power of a distributed network. many small changes could transform the world. change your life before the world changes it for you .
kevin , united states kristina is right to be cautious ; interfering with the world 's ecology is a dangerous business , but burning fossil fuels at a rate millions of times faster than they are naturally laid down is such a gross disturbance to the natural cycle that desperate measures may be required now .
increased nutrients will probably be added to the world 's oceans anyway , as global warming expands deserts and more violent storms carry extra dust over the oceans .
gaia will stabilise the world 's ecology eventually ; although the new configuration may not include the human species .
martin corney , plymouth , uk we must balance the risks .
which means this should go ahead , with caution .
any counter to global warming will inevitably have effects on a comparable scale , which means , vast .
some side effects are positive : i presume more plankton means more fish .
michael grazebrook , london , uk could global warming actually be an opportunity rather than a threat ? it may force all of humanity to work together for once and may just save us from reverting to type and eventually blowing the planet to pieces.global warming may be a good thing in perspective , maybe not specifically for us humans , but for life on this wonderful and unique planet .
pete webb , portsmouth / uk the amount of fertiliser put in gardens finds its way in to oceans .
in fact we should be worried with this amount in terms of its side effects even before we think of fertilising the oceans .
we have evidence of side effects of fertilisation in rivers and i think it is unwise to try and conquer nature by artificially fertilising oceans .
the wastes we produce in abundance such as dung and sewage are enough sources of nutrients in oceans .
the issue of climate change is now clear .
the problem is human induced gases .
we are destroying our planet only because we want to live a life above what the planet can sustain .
if we are wise then we must live within what the planet can sustain .
greed and scientific wisdom has taken us close to destroying our planet , i find it awkward to suggest that science and technology can save us from this path of death without use of common sense .
it is indeed time now common sense should prevail above science and technology .
science and technology is t ! he major source of greenhouse gases .
we should not forget this .
i know ruminants are a major source but only because we rear them in large numbers based on our science and technology .
i thus agree with the author kristina .
boyson moyo , mzuzu malawi i totally agree with kristina gjerde !
we do not fully understand the consequences of actions like this .
it is madness and stupid - we could be digging a deeper hole !
ecosystems in the oceans are already under threat and we do need to act now but in the right way .
the greatest protection is preserving and restoring healthy marine ecosystems with their natural biodiversity for resilience and the mitigation of climate change effects i.e a network of fully protected marine reserves through out the oceans and seas .
there is enough scientific evidence to show this .
in addition oceanic ecosystems are largely oligotrophic or nutrient poor - as are the waters of the jewels of the ocean - the worlds coral reefs which are among the most productive and valuable ecosystems of the world .
we need to heed the advice of the people that understand the oceans and seas and implement an ecological network of marine protected areas if we are not going to have seas full of jellyfish , toxic algal blooms , dead zones and scientists trying to stop the consequences of our regrettable actions .
now that would be a great whopping dent in the economy never mind to the priceless value of life !
melanie gomes , crossgar co down a big problem is the sudden change .
slow enough and anything survives .
think about how much phytoplankton would be needed to sequester the trillions tons of co2 we produce annually .
now remember that this production can only take place when the sun is up .
at night , they take oxygen out of the system .
so you now swap the oxygen in the water for plankton growth .
fishes need oxygen , and it only comes in quick at the surface .
most of the depth requires slow diffusion .
that aint quick enough to keep the fish alive .
mark , exeter , uk i absolutely agree with k gjerde .
we are only just starting to learn about ocean ecology and have no idea what kind of damage this will cause to the marine life .
our efforts should be aimed at a global curb in the amount of co2 and ch4 being produced .
michelle heelis , tamworth , england i believe ocean fertilisation should be investigated , as it could prove useful .
however , this can only properly be done by governments in collaboration working on a serious pilot scheme .
the idea of private companies offering " carbon offsets " is just plain silly and could lead to disaster .
done this way it would just end up as a scam to generate profit for companies pedalling dubious science .
paul lockwood , cambridge , uk carbon offset projects must move away from attempting to sequester fossil carbon in the biosphere .
good carbon offset project help to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels by generating renewable energy or increasing energy efficiency whilst carbon bio-sequestration projects do little to help move us towards the low carbon economies that we so desperately need .
funding provided by carbon offset projects provide a fantastic opportunity to help transform markets from dirty to clean development , so any project that is attempting to capture carbon in the biosphere is missing out on one of the major parallel benefits of generating emissions reductions .

though it is difficult to predict with certainty , activities conducted in one nation 's waters may affect the waters of another state , or the high seas .
similarly , activities on the high seas could impact not only the direct area , but also waters under national jurisdiction and control .
furthermore , atmospheric scientists are concerned that artificially-stimulated blooms could exacerbate climate change by increasing the production of nitrous oxide , a greenhouse gas far more potent than carbon dioxide .
this may well offset any benefits from carbon dioxide reduction , while the marine ecosystem side-effects remain .
moreover , additional atmospheric side-effects such as the production of methane , another important greenhouse gas , as well as other gases that are known to influence clouds and ozone , may also result .
need for common sense no evidence has been produced to allay these concerns .
difficulties in actually proving or verifying carbon dioxide sequestration , should it occur , make the current informal and unregulated market for carbon offsets vulnerable to unsubstantiated and unverifiable claims .
all this makes ocean fertilisation a highly unfit candidate for carbon credits .
phytoplankton are the basis for most oceanic food webs recently , a meeting on the international agreements that regulate dumping of wastes and other matter at sea -lrb- the london convention and london protocol -rrb- urged states to use the utmost caution when considering proposals for large-scale fertilisation operations .
it also stressed that " such large-scale operations are currently not justified " .
the decision of governments at the london meeting could not be more timely , as some commercial operations are carrying out pilot projects of ever-increasing scale .
one company is already offering carbon offsets to the public on its website to support its work .
the recently published ipcc fourth assessment synthesis report again confirmed that the effects of climate change are real and that they are already upon us .
but in our efforts to find a quick fix , international law and common sense should not be the first victims .
the oceans are complex , dynamic , unpredictable and already vulnerable to the effects of climate change and acidification .
we need mechanisms that will build their resilience , not undermine it .
independent look the concept of ocean fertilisation needs to be stringently scrutinised through independent peer-reviewed science , not left in the hands of entrepreneurs .
it should not be allowed to proceed until these two preconditions have been met : the benefits , if any , need to outweigh the risks to the marine environment we need to be able to independently verify and regulate any real , measurable , long-term carbon dioxide sequestration benefits , if they are found to occur during the second week of the un climate change conference in bali , governments should apply similarly rigorous standards to all proposed " geo-engineering " solutions .
we do n't need quick fixes to this global problem that may , in the long-term , cause far more harm than good .

kevin , united states kristina is right to be cautious ; interfering with the world 's ecology is a dangerous business , but burning fossil fuels at a rate millions of times faster than they are naturally laid down is such a gross disturbance to the natural cycle that desperate measures may be required now .
increased nutrients will probably be added to the world 's oceans anyway , as global warming expands deserts and more violent storms carry extra dust over the oceans .

martin corney , plymouth , uk we must balance the risks .

some side effects are positive : i presume more plankton means more fish .
michael grazebrook , london , uk could global warming actually be an opportunity rather than a threat ? it may force all of humanity to work together for once and may just save us from reverting to type and eventually blowing the planet to pieces.global warming may be a good thing in perspective , maybe not specifically for us humans , but for life on this wonderful and unique planet .
pete webb , portsmouth / uk the amount of fertiliser put in gardens finds its way in to oceans .
in fact we should be worried with this amount in terms of its side effects even before we think of fertilising the oceans .
we have evidence of side effects of fertilisation in rivers and i think it is unwise to try and conquer nature by artificially fertilising oceans .
the wastes we produce in abundance such as dung and sewage are enough sources of nutrients in oceans .
the issue of climate change is now clear .
the problem is human induced gases .
we are destroying our planet only because we want to live a life above what the planet can sustain .
if we are wise then we must live within what the planet can sustain .
greed and scientific wisdom has taken us close to destroying our planet , i find it awkward to suggest that science and technology can save us from this path of death without use of common sense .
it is indeed time now common sense should prevail above science and technology .
science and technology is t ! he major source of greenhouse gases .
we should not forget this .
i know ruminants are a major source but only because we rear them in large numbers based on our science and technology .
i thus agree with the author kristina .
boyson moyo , mzuzu malawi i totally agree with kristina gjerde !
we do not fully understand the consequences of actions like this .
it is madness and stupid - we could be digging a deeper hole !
ecosystems in the oceans are already under threat and we do need to act now but in the right way .
the greatest protection is preserving and restoring healthy marine ecosystems with their natural biodiversity for resilience and the mitigation of climate change effects i.e a network of fully protected marine reserves through out the oceans and seas .
there is enough scientific evidence to show this .
in addition oceanic ecosystems are largely oligotrophic or nutrient poor - as are the waters of the jewels of the ocean - the worlds coral reefs which are among the most productive and valuable ecosystems of the world .
we need to heed the advice of the people that understand the oceans and seas and implement an ecological network of marine protected areas if we are not going to have seas full of jellyfish , toxic algal blooms , dead zones and scientists trying to stop the consequences of our regrettable actions .
now that would be a great whopping dent in the economy never mind to the priceless value of life !
melanie gomes , crossgar co down a big problem is the sudden change .
slow enough and anything survives .
think about how much phytoplankton would be needed to sequester the trillions tons of co2 we produce annually .
now remember that this production can only take place when the sun is up .
at night , they take oxygen out of the system .
so you now swap the oxygen in the water for plankton growth .
fishes need oxygen , and it only comes in quick at the surface .
most of the depth requires slow diffusion .
that aint quick enough to keep the fish alive .
mark , exeter , uk i absolutely agree with k gjerde .
we are only just starting to learn about ocean ecology and have no idea what kind of damage this will cause to the marine life .
our efforts should be aimed at a global curb in the amount of co2 and ch4 being produced .
michelle heelis , tamworth , england i believe ocean fertilisation should be investigated , as it could prove useful .
however , this can only properly be done by governments in collaboration working on a serious pilot scheme .
the idea of private companies offering " carbon offsets " is just plain silly and could lead to disaster .
done this way it would just end up as a scam to generate profit for companies pedalling dubious science .
paul lockwood , cambridge , uk carbon offset projects must move away from attempting to sequester fossil carbon in the biosphere .
good carbon offset project help to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels by generating renewable energy or increasing energy efficiency whilst carbon bio-sequestration projects do little to help move us towards the low carbon economies that we so desperately need .
funding provided by carbon offset projects provide a fantastic opportunity to help transform markets from dirty to clean development , so any project that is attempting to capture carbon in the biosphere is missing out on one of the major parallel benefits of generating emissions reductions .

in this week 's green room , she calls on delegates at the un climate conference to halt schemes that could do more harm than good .
experiments to date have shown that the amount of carbon actually exported to the deep ocean is small and highly uncertain current proposals to combat climate change by stimulating phytoplankton or algal blooms in the ocean may violate fundamental principles of international law , as well as common sense .
adding nutrients , such as iron or nitrogen , or pumping nutrient-rich deep waters up into surface waters in the hope that the resulting bloom will provide long-term storage of carbon dioxide , should not be considered as a potential solution to climate change .
we first need regulations based on credible science to ensure that the method is safe and effective , and that we can verify the results .
two decades of scientific study have shown that ocean fertilisation offers a low probability of lasting benefits and a high probability of harm .
we do n't need quick fixes to this global problem that may , in the long-term , cause far more harm than good the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- considers ocean fertilisation as " speculative and unproven , and with the risk of unknown side effects " .
nevertheless , it continues to be touted as a simple solution to climate change .
uncertain science for such a practice to be effective in mitigating climate change , substantial amounts of additional carbon dioxide must reach the deep ocean and , ideally , be incorporated into the sediments .
experiments to date have shown that the amount of carbon actually exported to the deep ocean is small and highly uncertain .
at present , it is unlikely that significant and verifiable sequestration will occur .
algal blooms can devastate aquatic ecosystems for ocean fertilisation to be safe , and in compliance with international law , it must not harm the marine environment .
however , possible ecological effects include shifts in plankton community structure that could dramatically alter food webs , creation of dead zones deprived of oxygen as the excess plant life decays , and harmful algal blooms .
in addition , the bloom may affect areas far from the original site .
one fertilised patch travelled 1,500 km in 19 days , while modelling studies show that adding nutrients to one area can lead to reductions in productivity in other areas .

in addition oceanic ecosystems are largely oligotrophic or nutrient poor - as are the waters of the jewels of the ocean - the worlds coral reefs which are among the most productive and valuable ecosystems of the world .
we need to heed the advice of the people that understand the oceans and seas and implement an ecological network of marine protected areas if we are not going to have seas full of jellyfish , toxic algal blooms , dead zones and scientists trying to stop the consequences of our regrettable actions .
now that would be a great whopping dent in the economy never mind to the priceless value of life !
melanie gomes , crossgar co down a big problem is the sudden change .
slow enough and anything survives .
think about how much phytoplankton would be needed to sequester the trillions tons of co2 we produce annually .
now remember that this production can only take place when the sun is up .
at night , they take oxygen out of the system .
so you now swap the oxygen in the water for plankton growth .
fishes need oxygen , and it only comes in quick at the surface .
most of the depth requires slow diffusion .
that aint quick enough to keep the fish alive .
mark , exeter , uk i absolutely agree with k gjerde .
we are only just starting to learn about ocean ecology and have no idea what kind of damage this will cause to the marine life .
our efforts should be aimed at a global curb in the amount of co2 and ch4 being produced .
michelle heelis , tamworth , england i believe ocean fertilisation should be investigated , as it could prove useful .
however , this can only properly be done by governments in collaboration working on a serious pilot scheme .
the idea of private companies offering " carbon offsets " is just plain silly and could lead to disaster .
done this way it would just end up as a scam to generate profit for companies pedalling dubious science .
paul lockwood , cambridge , uk carbon offset projects must move away from attempting to sequester fossil carbon in the biosphere .
good carbon offset project help to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels by generating renewable energy or increasing energy efficiency whilst carbon bio-sequestration projects do little to help move us towards the low carbon economies that we so desperately need .
funding provided by carbon offset projects provide a fantastic opportunity to help transform markets from dirty to clean development , so any project that is attempting to capture carbon in the biosphere is missing out on one of the major parallel benefits of generating emissions reductions .

bbc news -pipe- science / nature -pipe- hold back the geo-engineering tide bbc news / science / nature graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- tuesday , 11 december 2007 , 09:08 gmt hold back the geo-engineering tide viewpoint kristina gjerde projects that add nutrients to the world 's oceans in order to create algal blooms that will absorb more carbon from the atmosphere are scientifically unsound , argues kristina gjerde , high seas policy advisor to the world conservation union .
in this week 's green room , she calls on delegates at the un climate conference to halt schemes that could do more harm than good . "
" experiments to date have shown that the amount of carbon actually exported to the deep ocean is small and highly uncertain " current proposals to combat climate change by stimulating phytoplankton or algal blooms in the ocean may violate fundamental principles of international law , as well as common sense .
adding nutrients , such as iron or nitrogen , or pumping nutrient-rich deep waters up into surface waters in the hope that the resulting bloom will provide long-term storage of carbon dioxide , should not be considered as a potential solution to climate change .
we first need regulations based on credible science to ensure that the method is safe and effective , and that we can verify the results .
two decades of scientific study have shown that ocean fertilisation offers a low probability of lasting benefits and a high probability of harm . "
we do n't need quick fixes to this global problem that may , in the long-term , cause far more harm than good " the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- considers ocean fertilisation as " speculative and unproven , and with the risk of unknown side effects " .
nevertheless , it continues to be touted as a simple solution to climate change .
uncertain science for such a practice to be effective in mitigating climate change , substantial amounts of additional carbon dioxide must reach the deep ocean and , ideally , be incorporated into the sediments .
experiments to date have shown that the amount of carbon actually exported to the deep ocean is small and highly uncertain .
at present , it is unlikely that significant and verifiable sequestration will occur .
for ocean fertilisation to be safe , and in compliance with international law , it must not harm the marine environment .
however , possible ecological effects include shifts in plankton community structure that could dramatically alter food webs , creation of dead zones deprived of oxygen as the excess plant life decays , and harmful algal blooms .
in addition , the bloom may affect areas far from the original site .
one fertilised patch travelled 1,500 km in 19 days , while modelling studies show that adding nutrients to one area can lead to reductions in productivity in other areas .
though it is difficult to predict with certainty , activities conducted in one nation 's waters may affect the waters of another state , or the high seas .
similarly , activities on the high seas could impact not only the direct area , but also waters under national jurisdiction and control .
furthermore , atmospheric scientists are concerned that artificially-stimulated blooms could exacerbate climate change by increasing the production of nitrous oxide , a greenhouse gas far more potent than carbon dioxide .
this may well offset any benefits from carbon dioxide reduction , while the marine ecosystem side-effects remain .
moreover , additional atmospheric side-effects such as the production of methane , another important greenhouse gas , as well as other gases that are known to influence clouds and ozone , may also result .
need for common sense no evidence has been produced to allay these concerns .
difficulties in actually proving or verifying carbon dioxide sequestration , should it occur , make the current informal and unregulated market for carbon offsets vulnerable to unsubstantiated and unverifiable claims .
all this makes ocean fertilisation a highly unfit candidate for carbon credits .
recently , a meeting on the international agreements that regulate dumping of wastes and other matter at sea -lrb- the london convention and london protocol -rrb- urged states to use the utmost caution when considering proposals for large-scale fertilisation operations .
it also stressed that " such large-scale operations are currently not justified " .
the decision of governments at the london meeting could not be more timely , as some commercial operations are carrying out pilot projects of ever-increasing scale .
one company is already offering carbon offsets to the public on its website to support its work .
the recently published ipcc fourth assessment synthesis report again confirmed that the effects of climate change are real and that they are already upon us .
but in our efforts to find a quick fix , international law and common sense should not be the first victims .
the oceans are complex , dynamic , unpredictable and already vulnerable to the effects of climate change and acidification .
we need mechanisms that will build their resilience , not undermine it .
independent look the concept of ocean fertilisation needs to be stringently scrutinised through independent peer-reviewed science , not left in the hands of entrepreneurs .
it should not be allowed to proceed until these two preconditions have been met : the benefits , if any , need to outweigh the risks to the marine environment we need to be able to independently verify and regulate any real , measurable , long-term carbon dioxide sequestration benefits , if they are found to occur during the second week of the un climate change conference in bali , governments should apply similarly rigorous standards to all proposed " geo-engineering " solutions .
we do n't need quick fixes to this global problem that may , in the long-term , cause far more harm than good . "
kristina m gjerde is a high seas policy adviser to the world conservation union -lrb- iucn -rrb- the author would like to acknowledge the assistance of rosemary rayfuse from school of law , university of new south wales , and mark lawrence of the max planck institute for chemistry , germany .
this article is based on a forthcoming publication in the international journal of marine and coastal law .
the green room is a series of opinion articles on environmental topics running weekly on the bbc news website do you agree with kristina gjerde ?
will schemes like ocean fertilisation do more harm than good ?
should we wait until the science is proven before embarking on large-scale geo-engineering projects ?
or do we need to act now if we are to stand any chance of combatting climate change ? yeah ! act now ! the mess we 're in is due to large-scale geo-engineering ! the last thing we need to do is diversify our tinkering ! we already know what we need to do - stop destroying ecosystems for short-term gains , and stop wasting energy ! industry should be regulated because they are major point-sources for most of the factors of ' climate change ' .
but , world populations should also be educated and encouraged to reduce their own ' carbon foot-print ' by purchasing more responsibly and using energy more selectively and / or efficiently. in this age , people should be aware of the power of a distributed network. many small changes could transform the world. change your life before the world changes it for you .
kevin , united states kristina is right to be cautious ; interfering with the world 's ecology is a dangerous business , but burning fossil fuels at a rate millions of times faster than they are naturally laid down is such a gross disturbance to the natural cycle that desperate measures may be required now .
increased nutrients will probably be added to the world 's oceans anyway , as global warming expands deserts and more violent storms carry extra dust over the oceans .
gaia will stabilise the world 's ecology eventually ; although the new configuration may not include the human species .
martin corney , plymouth , uk we must balance the risks .
which means this should go ahead , with caution .
any counter to global warming will inevitably have effects on a comparable scale , which means , vast .
some side effects are positive : i presume more plankton means more fish .
michael grazebrook , london , uk could global warming actually be an opportunity rather than a threat ? it may force all of humanity to work together for once and may just save us from reverting to type and eventually blowing the planet to pieces.global warming may be a good thing in perspective , maybe not specifically for us humans , but for life on this wonderful and unique planet .
pete webb , portsmouth / uk the amount of fertiliser put in gardens finds its way in to oceans .
in fact we should be worried with this amount in terms of its side effects even before we think of fertilising the oceans .
we have evidence of side effects of fertilisation in rivers and i think it is unwise to try and conquer nature by artificially fertilising oceans .
the wastes we produce in abundance such as dung and sewage are enough sources of nutrients in oceans .
the issue of climate change is now clear .
the problem is human induced gases .
we are destroying our planet only because we want to live a life above what the planet can sustain .
if we are wise then we must live within what the planet can sustain .
greed and scientific wisdom has taken us close to destroying our planet , i find it awkward to suggest that science and technology can save us from this path of death without use of common sense .
it is indeed time now common sense should prevail above science and technology .
science and technology is t ! he major source of greenhouse gases .
we should not forget this .
i know ruminants are a major source but only because we rear them in large numbers based on our science and technology .
i thus agree with the author kristina .
boyson moyo , mzuzu malawi i totally agree with kristina gjerde !
we do not fully understand the consequences of actions like this .
it is madness and stupid - we could be digging a deeper hole !
ecosystems in the oceans are already under threat and we do need to act now but in the right way .
the greatest protection is preserving and restoring healthy marine ecosystems with their natural biodiversity for resilience and the mitigation of climate change effects i.e a network of fully protected marine reserves through out the oceans and seas .
there is enough scientific evidence to show this .
in addition oceanic ecosystems are largely oligotrophic or nutrient poor - as are the waters of the jewels of the ocean - the worlds coral reefs which are among the most productive and valuable ecosystems of the world .
we need to heed the advice of the people that understand the oceans and seas and implement an ecological network of marine protected areas if we are not going to have seas full of jellyfish , toxic algal blooms , dead zones and scientists trying to stop the consequences of our regrettable actions .
now that would be a great whopping dent in the economy never mind to the priceless value of life !
melanie gomes , crossgar co down a big problem is the sudden change .
slow enough and anything survives .

"
one of the best things about being on the world service radio programme digital planet each week is that i get to hear about interesting technologies from many different countries and explore the impact that computers and the internet are having in people 's daily lives .
we often follow stories as they develop , coming back to them from time to time to see if early promises have been kept or bold predictions have been borne out .
it 's been nearly three years since nicholas negroponte came onto the show to talk about his plan for a low-cost laptop for the developing world .
he wanted to build it for under $ 100 and sell millions to governments who would then give them away to schoolchildren .
later he set up the one laptop per child project to do this , and we 've come back to the $ 100 laptop many times , and in december 2005 we saw the prototype launched at the world summit on the information society in tunisia .
' radical rethinking ' we have watched as the prototype turned into the xo-1 , a radical rethinking of what a laptop should be , with a brand-new user interface , a low-power chip from amd , the linux operating system and a low-energy high contrast screen .
and earlier this year we heard schoolchildren in nigeria tell bbc reporter jonathan fildes how excited they were to have their own computers , what they planned to use them for and how good they were . "
perhaps dvorak 's just afraid that a nigerian schoolchild , empowered by the technology entrusted to them , will take him to task for his patronising attitude , or perhaps even turn out to be a better journalist . "
bill thompson politics ' stifling $ 100 laptop ' audio slideshow : laptops in nigeria not every promise was fulfilled , of course .
the computers cost around $ 180 to make , and instead of millions there are only a few hundred thousand being built in the first year , largely because governments have gone back on the promises they made to buy them in large numbers .
even the nigerian government has yet to decide whether to commit funds to the project , and is watching the trial at abuja 's galadima primary school with interest .
to make things worse intel and microsoft seem to have done everything they could to undermine the project , offering cut-price hardware and discount operating systems in an attempt to keep this remarkable machine , with its linux operating system and amd processor , at bay .
now us journalist john dvorak has weighed into the debate , dismissing the laptop as a ' little green computer ' that changes nothing , and arguing that sending food aid to africa is a better way to solve the continent 's problems .
dvorak is so wrong that it pains me .
he misrepresents both the laptop 's capabilities and the plans for how it will be used .
' demeans people ' he ignores the educational uses and its sophisticated mesh network and acts as if the sole purpose is to get online , asking what benefit the " spam-ridden information super ad-way laced with nigerian scams , hoaxes , porn , blogs , wikis , spam , urban folklore , misinformation " has to offer .
and he demeans the people who will receive the computers , asking his readers if they will feel " better about the world 's problems , knowing that some poor tribesman 's child has a laptop " , apparently contrasting a " tribesman " with a real person like himself , safe in his western affluence .
dvorak is a controversial , opinionated and immensely influential technology writer , based in the us but read around the world thanks to the same internet that he dismisses as unsuitable for those living in poverty .
his comments matter because he may influence those with the power to change people 's lives , especially in governments considering investing in the xo-1 , yet he chooses to use his platform to criticise a self-penned parody of the computer and its planned uses .
there are sensible criticisms to be made of olpc and its work , but dvorak simply misrepresents their position when he dismisses the whole project as arguing : " let 's give these kids these little green computers .
that will do it !
that will solve the poverty problem and everything else , for that matter . "
at wsis in 2005 i talked to olpc 's chief technology officer , mary lou jepsen .
she led innovations in the screen design , energy consumption and user interface that have resulted in a computer to transform the relationship of the world 's poorest children to the networked economy .
' hold back ' she also understands the need for the laptop to fit into the larger development agenda .
the point is not that computers or internet access are as important as clean water , good healthcare , effective education and safe housing .
it is that access to computers and the network can make it simpler and easier to deliver those other things , just as access to electric light can vastly improve the quality of people 's lives .
no one starting a business in the rich world would do so without relying on computers and the internet , so why should we hold back those in the poorer countries ?
dvorak seems to have fallen for the intel and microsoft line that something they are n't involved with could not possibly be all that good .
the xo-1 is powerful , effective and designed to be used by those with little experience of new technology , and even those who are less than fully literate .
yes , there will be problems .
the computers need to be properly integrated into the educational curriculum ; power supplies and stable network connections have to be provided ; some will be stolen , some will break , some will not get to the people who need them .
but that is not a reason to stop .
a century ago campaigners for a working wage were adamant that just having enough to live on was not enough , that there should be space for culture and enjoyment in life , and in 1912 strikers at a textile factory in lawrence , massachusetts are said to have rallied around the slogan " we want bread , but we want roses , too ! " .
well , we need to give the poor of today 's world rice , and housing , and water , and healthcare , but they need the laptops and all that they symbolise too .
those who argue otherwise , like john dvorak , would condemn the poor countries to another century of want and dependency by depriving them of access to the technology that has already transformed life for the rich and privileged .
perhaps he 's just afraid that a nigerian schoolchild , empowered by the technology entrusted to them , will take him to task for his patronising attitude , or perhaps even turn out to be a better journalist .
it would n't be hard . "

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- q & a : offshore wind farms bbc news / uk graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- uk contents : england -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- scotland -pipe- wales -pipe- uk politics -pipe- education -pipe- magazine tuesday , 11 december 2007 , 10:02 gmt q & a : offshore wind farms energy secretary john hutton has announced plans to build 7,000 offshore wind turbines around britain 's coastline .
how much of a contribution will this ambitious project make to the uk 's energy needs ?
and what are the pros and cons of offshore wind farming , compared to conventional energy sources ?
where are they built ?
up until now the turbines were built about three or four miles out to sea - but there are now plans to site them further offshore to reduce their visual impact .
engineers sink a huge pile into the sea bed .
they construct a platform , and the turbine is assembled on top of it .
offshore wind turbines have big advantages over onshore ones .
they can be built a lot bigger and there is a lot more wind out at sea rather than on land .
how do they work ?
the technology is easily understandable : turbines are basically big windmills that use the energy of moving air to generate electricity .
sensors on the turbine detect the wind direction and turn the blades into the wind .
the blades then power a generator to convert the energy into electricity .
undersea cables then carry the electricity to land where it goes into the national grid .
pros and cons of wind farms for : environmentally friendly for : the wind is free - and not owned by foreign governments against : expensive to build and maintain against : not 100 % reliable - the wind can drop .
wind turbines , in graphics to give an idea of how much electricity wind farms generate , the inner dowsing / lynn wind farm in the great wash will have 54 turbines generating 194 megawatts .
that is enough to supply a city the size of coventry .
what is the potential of offshore wind power ?
with its 7,760 miles of coastline , the uk is ideally placed for offshore wind generation .
under the current offshore wind farm programme about eight gigawatts -lrb- gw -rrb- are expected to be generated by 2016 .
john hutton 's new proposals allows for that figure to rise to 33gw .
the government ultimately wants up to a third of britain 's electricity to be generated from offshore wind power .
but this needs to be seen in the context of current performance .
on current trends , it may be that the industry might not produce enough power to help meet the government target of 10 % renewable energy by 2010 .
the british wind energy association -lrb- bwea -rrb- says offshore wind could potentially generate close to 1,000 terawatt hours per year .
that is equivalent to several times the uk 's current total electricity consumption .
the bwea predicts that a substantial proportion of the total european offshore wind resource will one day be located in britain 's waters .
who will build the wind farms ?
most of the major utility companies - like british gas -lrb- centrica -rrb- and npower - have invested in the industry .
are windfarm plans realistic ?
about a dozen firms - such as airtricity , edf and eon are currently running or planning offshore wind farms .
there are already five major off-shore wind farms generating power for the national grid : north hoyle , off the coast of north wales , operated by npower ; scroby sands , off the coast of great yarmouth -lrb- eon -rrb- ; kentish flats off whitstable in kent -lrb- vattenfall -rrb- , barrow off the cumbrian coast -lrb- dong energy / centrica -rrb- and burbo bank , in the mouth of the mersey river -lrb- dong energy -rrb- .
how expensive are they ?
offshore wind farms cost significantly more to build and maintain than their onshore equivalent .
and because they involve new and untested technology they also suffer from " first of a kind " costs .
but the industry is confident that those costs will fall over time .
it is difficult to compare the cost of electricity obtained from a wind farm rather than a conventional energy source like gas .
this is because it involves assumptions about future construction costs , the cost of carbon emissions , and the cost of gas .
however , right now offshore wind farms are significantly more expensive than thermal generation and require a government subsidy to make them economic .
the industry estimates that electricity from offshore wind farms costs more than 10p per kilowatt hour to produce , compared to natural gas at around 4p per kilowatt hour .
are wind farms environmentally friendly ?
one of the reasons companies have moved into offshore wind generation is because supporters say they are much less visually intrusive than windmills on land .
in other words , unlike a wind farm in the unspoilt lake district , there is less risk of the neighbours complaining .
and if there are no disputes about planning permission , then there is more chance that the wind farms will be built quickly - which means less cost to the industry .
what about wildlife ?
offshore wind generation is generally wildlife-friendly , according to a danish report published last year .
danish energy companies and the danish government carried out an eight-year study into the environmental impact of world 's two largest offshore wind farms , horns rev and nysted .
the study concluded that seabirds rarely collide with the turbine propellers and that fish and other sea life flourished in the artificial " reefs " created by the turbine undersea structures .
and although seals and porpoises moved away from the wind farms when they were under construction , they are slowly returning .
most importantly , supporters of offshore wind power say all forms of energy supply have environmental drawbacks .
however , they say that compared to the risks of global warming or nuclear meltdown , wind power is the most environmentally-friendly option we have .

one of the best things about being on the world service radio programme digital planet each week is that i get to hear about interesting technologies from many different countries and explore the impact that computers and the internet are having in people 's daily lives .
we often follow stories as they develop , coming back to them from time to time to see if early promises have been kept or bold predictions have been borne out .
it 's been nearly three years since nicholas negroponte came onto the show to talk about his plan for a low-cost laptop for the developing world .
he wanted to build it for under $ 100 and sell millions to governments who would then give them away to schoolchildren .
later he set up the one laptop per child project to do this , and we 've come back to the $ 100 laptop many times , and in december 2005 we saw the prototype launched at the world summit on the information society in tunisia .
' radical rethinking ' we have watched as the prototype turned into the xo-1 , a radical rethinking of what a laptop should be , with a brand-new user interface , a low-power chip from amd , the linux operating system and a low-energy high contrast screen .
and earlier this year we heard schoolchildren in nigeria tell bbc reporter jonathan fildes how excited they were to have their own computers , what they planned to use them for and how good they were .
perhaps dvorak 's just afraid that a nigerian schoolchild , empowered by the technology entrusted to them , will take him to task for his patronising attitude , or perhaps even turn out to be a better journalist .
bill thompson politics ' stifling $ 100 laptop ' audio slideshow : laptops in nigeria not every promise was fulfilled , of course .
the computers cost around $ 180 to make , and instead of millions there are only a few hundred thousand being built in the first year , largely because governments have gone back on the promises they made to buy them in large numbers .
even the nigerian government has yet to decide whether to commit funds to the project , and is watching the trial at abuja 's galadima primary school with interest .
to make things worse intel and microsoft seem to have done everything they could to undermine the project , offering cut-price hardware and discount operating systems in an attempt to keep this remarkable machine , with its linux operating system and amd processor , at bay .
now us journalist john dvorak has weighed into the debate , dismissing the laptop as a ' little green computer ' that changes nothing , and arguing that sending food aid to africa is a better way to solve the continent 's problems .
dvorak is so wrong that it pains me .
he misrepresents both the laptop 's capabilities and the plans for how it will be used .
' demeans people ' he ignores the educational uses and its sophisticated mesh network and acts as if the sole purpose is to get online , asking what benefit the " spam-ridden information super ad-way laced with nigerian scams , hoaxes , porn , blogs , wikis , spam , urban folklore , misinformation " has to offer .
and he demeans the people who will receive the computers , asking his readers if they will feel " better about the world 's problems , knowing that some poor tribesman 's child has a laptop " , apparently contrasting a " tribesman " with a real person like himself , safe in his western affluence .
dvorak is a controversial , opinionated and immensely influential technology writer , based in the us but read around the world thanks to the same internet that he dismisses as unsuitable for those living in poverty .
his comments matter because he may influence those with the power to change people 's lives , especially in governments considering investing in the xo-1 , yet he chooses to use his platform to criticise a self-penned parody of the computer and its planned uses .
there are sensible criticisms to be made of olpc and its work , but dvorak simply misrepresents their position when he dismisses the whole project as arguing : " let 's give these kids these little green computers .
that will do it !
that will solve the poverty problem and everything else , for that matter . "
at wsis in 2005 i talked to olpc 's chief technology officer , mary lou jepsen .
she led innovations in the screen design , energy consumption and user interface that have resulted in a computer to transform the relationship of the world 's poorest children to the networked economy .
' hold back ' she also understands the need for the laptop to fit into the larger development agenda .
the point is not that computers or internet access are as important as clean water , good healthcare , effective education and safe housing .
it is that access to computers and the network can make it simpler and easier to deliver those other things , just as access to electric light can vastly improve the quality of people 's lives .
no one starting a business in the rich world would do so without relying on computers and the internet , so why should we hold back those in the poorer countries ?
dvorak seems to have fallen for the intel and microsoft line that something they are n't involved with could not possibly be all that good .
the xo-1 is powerful , effective and designed to be used by those with little experience of new technology , and even those who are less than fully literate .
yes , there will be problems .
the computers need to be properly integrated into the educational curriculum ; power supplies and stable network connections have to be provided ; some will be stolen , some will break , some will not get to the people who need them .
but that is not a reason to stop .
a century ago campaigners for a working wage were adamant that just having enough to live on was not enough , that there should be space for culture and enjoyment in life , and in 1912 strikers at a textile factory in lawrence , massachusetts are said to have rallied around the slogan " we want bread , but we want roses , too ! " .
well , we need to give the poor of today 's world rice , and housing , and water , and healthcare , but they need the laptops and all that they symbolise too .
those who argue otherwise , like john dvorak , would condemn the poor countries to another century of want and dependency by depriving them of access to the technology that has already transformed life for the rich and privileged .
perhaps he 's just afraid that a nigerian schoolchild , empowered by the technology entrusted to them , will take him to task for his patronising attitude , or perhaps even turn out to be a better journalist .
it would n't be hard .

one of the best things about being on the world service radio programme digital planet each week is that i get to hear about interesting technologies from many different countries and explore the impact that computers and the internet are having in people 's daily lives .
we often follow stories as they develop , coming back to them from time to time to see if early promises have been kept or bold predictions have been borne out .
it 's been nearly three years since nicholas negroponte came onto the show to talk about his plan for a low-cost laptop for the developing world .
he wanted to build it for under $ 100 and sell millions to governments who would then give them away to schoolchildren .
later he set up the one laptop per child project to do this , and we 've come back to the $ 100 laptop many times , and in december 2005 we saw the prototype launched at the world summit on the information society in tunisia .
' radical rethinking ' we have watched as the prototype turned into the xo-1 , a radical rethinking of what a laptop should be , with a brand-new user interface , a low-power chip from amd , the linux operating system and a low-energy high contrast screen .
and earlier this year we heard schoolchildren in nigeria tell bbc reporter jonathan fildes how excited they were to have their own computers , what they planned to use them for and how good they were .
perhaps dvorak 's just afraid that a nigerian schoolchild , empowered by the technology entrusted to them , will take him to task for his patronising attitude , or perhaps even turn out to be a better journalist .
bill thompson politics ' stifling $ 100 laptop ' audio slideshow : laptops in nigeria not every promise was fulfilled , of course .
the computers cost around $ 180 to make , and instead of millions there are only a few hundred thousand being built in the first year , largely because governments have gone back on the promises they made to buy them in large numbers .
even the nigerian government has yet to decide whether to commit funds to the project , and is watching the trial at abuja 's galadima primary school with interest .
to make things worse intel and microsoft seem to have done everything they could to undermine the project , offering cut-price hardware and discount operating systems in an attempt to keep this remarkable machine , with its linux operating system and amd processor , at bay .
now us journalist john dvorak has weighed into the debate , dismissing the laptop as a ' little green computer ' that changes nothing , and arguing that sending food aid to africa is a better way to solve the continent 's problems .
dvorak is so wrong that it pains me .
he misrepresents both the laptop 's capabilities and the plans for how it will be used .
' demeans people ' he ignores the educational uses and its sophisticated mesh network and acts as if the sole purpose is to get online , asking what benefit the " spam-ridden information super ad-way laced with nigerian scams , hoaxes , porn , blogs , wikis , spam , urban folklore , misinformation " has to offer .
and he demeans the people who will receive the computers , asking his readers if they will feel " better about the world 's problems , knowing that some poor tribesman 's child has a laptop " , apparently contrasting a " tribesman " with a real person like himself , safe in his western affluence .
dvorak is a controversial , opinionated and immensely influential technology writer , based in the us but read around the world thanks to the same internet that he dismisses as unsuitable for those living in poverty .
his comments matter because he may influence those with the power to change people 's lives , especially in governments considering investing in the xo-1 , yet he chooses to use his platform to criticise a self-penned parody of the computer and its planned uses .
there are sensible criticisms to be made of olpc and its work , but dvorak simply misrepresents their position when he dismisses the whole project as arguing : " let 's give these kids these little green computers .
that will do it !
that will solve the poverty problem and everything else , for that matter . "
at wsis in 2005 i talked to olpc 's chief technology officer , mary lou jepsen .
she led innovations in the screen design , energy consumption and user interface that have resulted in a computer to transform the relationship of the world 's poorest children to the networked economy .
' hold back ' she also understands the need for the laptop to fit into the larger development agenda .
the point is not that computers or internet access are as important as clean water , good healthcare , effective education and safe housing .
it is that access to computers and the network can make it simpler and easier to deliver those other things , just as access to electric light can vastly improve the quality of people 's lives .
no one starting a business in the rich world would do so without relying on computers and the internet , so why should we hold back those in the poorer countries ?
dvorak seems to have fallen for the intel and microsoft line that something they are n't involved with could not possibly be all that good .
the xo-1 is powerful , effective and designed to be used by those with little experience of new technology , and even those who are less than fully literate .
yes , there will be problems .
the computers need to be properly integrated into the educational curriculum ; power supplies and stable network connections have to be provided ; some will be stolen , some will break , some will not get to the people who need them .
but that is not a reason to stop .
a century ago campaigners for a working wage were adamant that just having enough to live on was not enough , that there should be space for culture and enjoyment in life , and in 1912 strikers at a textile factory in lawrence , massachusetts are said to have rallied around the slogan " we want bread , but we want roses , too ! " .
well , we need to give the poor of today 's world rice , and housing , and water , and healthcare , but they need the laptops and all that they symbolise too .
those who argue otherwise , like john dvorak , would condemn the poor countries to another century of want and dependency by depriving them of access to the technology that has already transformed life for the rich and privileged .
perhaps he 's just afraid that a nigerian schoolchild , empowered by the technology entrusted to them , will take him to task for his patronising attitude , or perhaps even turn out to be a better journalist .
it would n't be hard .

at wsis in 2005 i talked to olpc 's chief technology officer , mary lou jepsen .

the point is not that computers or internet access are as important as clean water , good healthcare , effective education and safe housing .
it is that access to computers and the network can make it simpler and easier to deliver those other things , just as access to electric light can vastly improve the quality of people 's lives .
no one starting a business in the rich world would do so without relying on computers and the internet , so why should we hold back those in the poorer countries ?
dvorak seems to have fallen for the intel and microsoft line that something they are n't involved with could not possibly be all that good .

well , we need to give the poor of today 's world rice , and housing , and water , and healthcare , but they need the laptops and all that they symbolise too .
those who argue otherwise , like john dvorak , would condemn the poor countries to another century of want and dependency by depriving them of access to the technology that has already transformed life for the rich and privileged .

how much of a contribution will this ambitious project make to the uk 's energy needs ?
and what are the pros and cons of offshore wind farming , compared to conventional energy sources ?
where are they built ?
up until now the turbines were built about three or four miles out to sea - but there are now plans to site them further offshore to reduce their visual impact .
engineers sink a huge pile into the sea bed .
they construct a platform , and the turbine is assembled on top of it .
offshore wind turbines have big advantages over onshore ones .
they can be built a lot bigger and there is a lot more wind out at sea rather than on land .
how do they work ?
the technology is easily understandable : turbines are basically big windmills that use the energy of moving air to generate electricity .
sensors on the turbine detect the wind direction and turn the blades into the wind .
the blades then power a generator to convert the energy into electricity .
undersea cables then carry the electricity to land where it goes into the national grid .
pros and cons of wind farms for : environmentally friendly for : the wind is free - and not owned by foreign governments against : expensive to build and maintain against : not 100 % reliable - the wind can drop .
wind turbines , in graphics to give an idea of how much electricity wind farms generate , the inner dowsing / lynn wind farm in the great wash will have 54 turbines generating 194 megawatts .
that is enough to supply a city the size of coventry .
what is the potential of offshore wind power ?
with its 7,760 miles of coastline , the uk is ideally placed for offshore wind generation .
under the current offshore wind farm programme about eight gigawatts -lrb- gw -rrb- are expected to be generated by 2016 .
john hutton 's new proposals allows for that figure to rise to 33gw .
the government ultimately wants up to a third of britain 's electricity to be generated from offshore wind power .
but this needs to be seen in the context of current performance .
on current trends , it may be that the industry might not produce enough power to help meet the government target of 10 % renewable energy by 2010 .
the british wind energy association -lrb- bwea -rrb- says offshore wind could potentially generate close to 1,000 terawatt hours per year .
that is equivalent to several times the uk 's current total electricity consumption .
the bwea predicts that a substantial proportion of the total european offshore wind resource will one day be located in britain 's waters .
who will build the wind farms ?
most of the major utility companies - like british gas -lrb- centrica -rrb- and npower - have invested in the industry .
are windfarm plans realistic ?
about a dozen firms - such as airtricity , edf and eon are currently running or planning offshore wind farms .
there are already five major off-shore wind farms generating power for the national grid : north hoyle , off the coast of north wales , operated by npower ; scroby sands , off the coast of great yarmouth -lrb- eon -rrb- ; kentish flats off whitstable in kent -lrb- vattenfall -rrb- , barrow off the cumbrian coast -lrb- dong energy / centrica -rrb- and burbo bank , in the mouth of the mersey river -lrb- dong energy -rrb- .
how expensive are they ?
offshore wind farms cost significantly more to build and maintain than their onshore equivalent .
and because they involve new and untested technology they also suffer from " first of a kind " costs .
but the industry is confident that those costs will fall over time .
it is difficult to compare the cost of electricity obtained from a wind farm rather than a conventional energy source like gas .
this is because it involves assumptions about future construction costs , the cost of carbon emissions , and the cost of gas .
however , right now offshore wind farms are significantly more expensive than thermal generation and require a government subsidy to make them economic .
the industry estimates that electricity from offshore wind farms costs more than 10p per kilowatt hour to produce , compared to natural gas at around 4p per kilowatt hour .
are wind farms environmentally friendly ?
one of the reasons companies have moved into offshore wind generation is because supporters say they are much less visually intrusive than windmills on land .
in other words , unlike a wind farm in the unspoilt lake district , there is less risk of the neighbours complaining .
and if there are no disputes about planning permission , then there is more chance that the wind farms will be built quickly - which means less cost to the industry .
what about wildlife ?
offshore wind generation is generally wildlife-friendly , according to a danish report published last year .
offshore wind power is thought to be environmentally friendly .
danish energy companies and the danish government carried out an eight-year study into the environmental impact of world 's two largest offshore wind farms , horns rev and nysted .
the study concluded that seabirds rarely collide with the turbine propellers and that fish and other sea life flourished in the artificial " reefs " created by the turbine undersea structures .
and although seals and porpoises moved away from the wind farms when they were under construction , they are slowly returning .
most importantly , supporters of offshore wind power say all forms of energy supply have environmental drawbacks .
however , they say that compared to the risks of global warming or nuclear meltdown , wind power is the most environmentally-friendly option we have .

how much of a contribution will this ambitious project make to the uk 's energy needs ?
and what are the pros and cons of offshore wind farming , compared to conventional energy sources ?
where are they built ?
up until now the turbines were built about three or four miles out to sea - but there are now plans to site them further offshore to reduce their visual impact .
engineers sink a huge pile into the sea bed .
they construct a platform , and the turbine is assembled on top of it .
offshore wind turbines have big advantages over onshore ones .
they can be built a lot bigger and there is a lot more wind out at sea rather than on land .
how do they work ?
the technology is easily understandable : turbines are basically big windmills that use the energy of moving air to generate electricity .
sensors on the turbine detect the wind direction and turn the blades into the wind .
the blades then power a generator to convert the energy into electricity .
undersea cables then carry the electricity to land where it goes into the national grid .
pros and cons of wind farms for : environmentally friendly for : the wind is free - and not owned by foreign governments against : expensive to build and maintain against : not 100 % reliable - the wind can drop .
wind turbines , in graphics to give an idea of how much electricity wind farms generate , the inner dowsing / lynn wind farm in the great wash will have 54 turbines generating 194 megawatts .
that is enough to supply a city the size of coventry .
what is the potential of offshore wind power ?
with its 7,760 miles of coastline , the uk is ideally placed for offshore wind generation .
under the current offshore wind farm programme about eight gigawatts -lrb- gw -rrb- are expected to be generated by 2016 .
john hutton 's new proposals allows for that figure to rise to 33gw .
the government ultimately wants up to a third of britain 's electricity to be generated from offshore wind power .
but this needs to be seen in the context of current performance .
on current trends , it may be that the industry might not produce enough power to help meet the government target of 10 % renewable energy by 2010 .
the british wind energy association -lrb- bwea -rrb- says offshore wind could potentially generate close to 1,000 terawatt hours per year .
that is equivalent to several times the uk 's current total electricity consumption .
the bwea predicts that a substantial proportion of the total european offshore wind resource will one day be located in britain 's waters .
who will build the wind farms ?
most of the major utility companies - like british gas -lrb- centrica -rrb- and npower - have invested in the industry .
are windfarm plans realistic ?
about a dozen firms - such as airtricity , edf and eon are currently running or planning offshore wind farms .
there are already five major off-shore wind farms generating power for the national grid : north hoyle , off the coast of north wales , operated by npower ; scroby sands , off the coast of great yarmouth -lrb- eon -rrb- ; kentish flats off whitstable in kent -lrb- vattenfall -rrb- , barrow off the cumbrian coast -lrb- dong energy / centrica -rrb- and burbo bank , in the mouth of the mersey river -lrb- dong energy -rrb- .
how expensive are they ?
offshore wind farms cost significantly more to build and maintain than their onshore equivalent .
and because they involve new and untested technology they also suffer from " first of a kind " costs .
but the industry is confident that those costs will fall over time .
it is difficult to compare the cost of electricity obtained from a wind farm rather than a conventional energy source like gas .
this is because it involves assumptions about future construction costs , the cost of carbon emissions , and the cost of gas .
however , right now offshore wind farms are significantly more expensive than thermal generation and require a government subsidy to make them economic .
the industry estimates that electricity from offshore wind farms costs more than 10p per kilowatt hour to produce , compared to natural gas at around 4p per kilowatt hour .
are wind farms environmentally friendly ?
one of the reasons companies have moved into offshore wind generation is because supporters say they are much less visually intrusive than windmills on land .
in other words , unlike a wind farm in the unspoilt lake district , there is less risk of the neighbours complaining .
and if there are no disputes about planning permission , then there is more chance that the wind farms will be built quickly - which means less cost to the industry .
what about wildlife ?
offshore wind generation is generally wildlife-friendly , according to a danish report published last year .
offshore wind power is thought to be environmentally friendly .
danish energy companies and the danish government carried out an eight-year study into the environmental impact of world 's two largest offshore wind farms , horns rev and nysted .
the study concluded that seabirds rarely collide with the turbine propellers and that fish and other sea life flourished in the artificial " reefs " created by the turbine undersea structures .
and although seals and porpoises moved away from the wind farms when they were under construction , they are slowly returning .
most importantly , supporters of offshore wind power say all forms of energy supply have environmental drawbacks .
however , they say that compared to the risks of global warming or nuclear meltdown , wind power is the most environmentally-friendly option we have .
