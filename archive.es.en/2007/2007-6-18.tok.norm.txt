" the eu will resume normal relations with the palestinian authority immediately , " the bloc 's ministers said in a text of conclusions from a meeting in luxembourg . the eu partially froze ties with the palestinian government and suspended direct aid when hamas swept to power last year because the islamist movement figures on its blacklist of outlawed " terrorist " groups . the new emergency cabinet does not contain hamas members . the ministers said the eu would " resume direct financial support to the government , " as well as provide support to the palestinian civilian police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana in luxembourg monday it will also undertake " intensive efforts to build the institutions of the future palestinian state . " " part of the money will be direct , " eu foreign and security policy chief javier solana said at a meeting with eu foreign ministers in luxembourg monday .
but " in order to help the palestinian people in gaza , we will need some mechanism that can not be a direct support . "
eu funds would be distributed in gaza through united nations agencies or the eu 's current emergency aid system which sidelines hama leaders in the territory .
the eu chief diplomat did not give details of when the bloc would resume aid payments to the palestinian government . technical details being discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salam fayyad the eu has expressed its support for the emergency cabinet created by abbas .
last week , abbas dissolved the hamas-led unity government and declared a state of emergency .
the militant group launched an all-out assault on fatah 's security forces in gaza , taking complete control of the strip .
more than 100 people were killed in the clashes .
the emergency cabinet is led by former finance minister salam fayyad .
hamas has denounced the new cabinet as illegal .
the recent violence led to the creation of two separately zones : a hamas-ruled gaza and a fatah-controlled west bank .
the islamic militant group is black-listed as a terrorist organization by the eu and the united states .
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told reporters she was still discussing with fayyad the technical details of when and how aid flows would be re-established .
" we are of course ready to continue to work with fayyad in order to be ready in future to see how we can work directly with the emergency government , " ferrero-waldner said .
she said the eu was working closely with the palestinian authority to establish strict financial channels for the resumption of direct assistance .
financial controls on eu aid had to be clearly defined and very transparent , she insisted , adding : " we have to be very careful ... this is not just political but also technical . " humanitarian aid never stopped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas militants have taken over gaza despite the ban on direct assistance to the palestinian authority , european governments have been sending humanitarian aid to both gaza and the west bank .
officials said an estimated 700 million euros -lrb- $ 939 million -rrb- in such emergency aid was sent to gaza and the west bank last year .
the money was used to pay the salaries of teachers , doctors and health workers and for supplies of fuel , water and electricity to the territories .
once aid flows were re-established , ferrero-waldner said it would be up to fayyad to decide how funds were distributed in gaza .
both solana and ferrero-waldner voiced full confidence in the new palestinian premier , saying they trusted him and had known him for years . israel supports abbas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe suspended its direct aid because of hamas attending eu talks in luxembourg , israeli foreign minister tzipi livni said her government was ready to transfer blocked palestinian tax revenues to the palestinian government . " israel is going to work with abbas and fayyad to transfer the money , " said livni after talks with eu foreign ministers . livni said israel was " not looking for excuses " to delay the delivery of palestinian funds since it wanted to make a clear distinction between palestinian extremists like hamas and the moderate fatah movement of abbas and fayyad . livni did not indicate how much money would be transferred to the palestinians , but eu officials said israel owed up to 850 million dollars in blocked tax money to the palestinians . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier described the israeli move as " significant . " livni said the creation of the emergency palestinian government provided new opportunities for israeli-palestinian peace . isolating hamas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian supporters of hamas celebrate last week the us favors isolating hamas economically , diplomatically and militarily in the gaza strip .
some european diplomats have expressed misgivings about such a strategy .
" the international community does not want two palestinian states , otherwise it will be impossible to find a solution , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
russia wants the emergency cabinet to enter into a " broad dialogue " between all palestinian forces , including hamas . " moscow expects the new emergency cabinet to take all necessary measures to normalize the situation , improve the humanitarian situation ... and above all to halt inter-palestinian conflict , " according to a statement from the russian foreign ministry . " this requires the establishment of broad dialogue between all palestinian political forces including hamas , " the statement said . us also normalizes relations in washington , us secretary of state condoleezza rice meanwhile announced the us government was lifting a 15-month embargo on direct aid to the palestinian territories .
" we intend to lift our financial restrictions on the palestinian government , " she told reporters after meeting abbas in washington .
" this will enable the american people and american financial institutions to resume normal economic and commercial ties with the palestinian government . " we will not leave 1.5 million palestinians at the hands of terrorist organizations , " rice said , referring to the impoverished gaza strip . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 18.06.2007 human rights groups slam eu migration policies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unable to cope with desperate flow from africa , malta is turning its back on refugees europe 's mediterranean countries bear an unfair share of the refugee burden from africa , overwhelming their capacity to cope .
amnesty and others support an eu wide migration policy guided by humanitarian principles . malta , which joined the eu in 2004 , is now at the forefront of a battle against illegal immigration , as scores of desperate african migrants in fishing boats risk their lives to reach european shores . many migrants hope that if they make it from the libyan coast to the tiny mediterranean island , which is south of sicily , they can start a new life anywhere in the european union . malta , which has been the destination of more than 7,000 illegal refugees over the past few years , is refusing to accept any more newcomers now , leaving boatloads of africans either to their fate in the turbulent mediterranean waters or in detention camps behind barbed wire . on monday at a berlin symposium , the human rights organization amnesty international lambasted the european union for its failure to support malta in its struggle to deal with the human tide from the horn of africa . mediterranean countries unfairly burdened it is the southern rim of the eu that is feeling the strain – malta , spain and italy , countries which want the rest of the bloc to do their fair share in taking in the illegal immigrants . the spanish canary islands off the western coast of africa , a favorite holiday destination for german and british tourists , was inundated with more than 30,000 refugees last year .
and lampedusa , an italian island which is closer to tunisia than it is to mainland italy , has also been targeted by a continuous flow of migrants from countries such as senegal , mauritius or eritrea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugee in detention camps or left to fate at sea amnesty said that eu countries still have capacities for immigration and called for a european wide asylum policy guided by humanitarian principles . at last week 's meeting , the eu interior ministers brushed aside malta 's plea for a fair distribution of the immigrants among all eu member states .
fears in european capitals of a tidal wave from africa are unfounded however , speakers at the symposium said . number of asylum seekers dropped drastically the number of asylum-seekers in germany for example has dropped from more than 400,000 in the mid-1990s to merely 20,000 last year . there are huge capacities within the eu to absorb more people in need of help , according to richard williams of the human rights group european council for refugees in exile -lrb- ecre -rrb- , who called for an easing of immigration laws across europe . " we 've created an asylum system that is so harsh , where the chances of being detained are very high , where the chances of being refused asylum on spurious grounds are very high , and the chances of being sent back to a country where you do n't feel safe , are very high , " williams told dw-radio .
" people feel safer not to apply for asylum - to still come , but to remain underground . " the existing patchwork of national laws fosters illegal immigration , said peter altmaier , undersecretary in the german interior ministry in a radio interview .
at present there are 20 different national policies in the 27 member bloc , which apply very different treatment standards to refugees , but the european commission wants harmonized rules to be in place by 2010 . " we have to fight illegal immigration because these people are exploited by criminal organizations , " altmaier said .
" at the same time we have to offer perspectives for legal migration .
and we also need a very strong humanitarian signal that we can not allow people to die in the mediterranean sea .

amnesty and others support an eu wide migration policy guided by humanitarian principles . malta , which joined the eu in 2004 , is now at the forefront of a battle against illegal immigration , as scores of desperate african migrants in fishing boats risk their lives to reach european shores . many migrants hope that if they make it from the libyan coast to the tiny mediterranean island , which is south of sicily , they can start a new life anywhere in the european union . malta , which has been the destination of more than 7,000 illegal refugees over the past few years , is refusing to accept any more newcomers now , leaving boatloads of africans either to their fate in the turbulent mediterranean waters or in detention camps behind barbed wire . on monday at a berlin symposium , the human rights organization amnesty international lambasted the european union for its failure to support malta in its struggle to deal with the human tide from the horn of africa . mediterranean countries unfairly burdened it is the southern rim of the eu that is feeling the strain – malta , spain and italy , countries which want the rest of the bloc to do their fair share in taking in the illegal immigrants . the spanish canary islands off the western coast of africa , a favorite holiday destination for german and british tourists , was inundated with more than 30,000 refugees last year .

fears in european capitals of a tidal wave from africa are unfounded however , speakers at the symposium said . number of asylum seekers dropped drastically the number of asylum-seekers in germany for example has dropped from more than 400,000 in the mid-1990s to merely 20,000 last year . there are huge capacities within the eu to absorb more people in need of help , according to richard williams of the human rights group european council for refugees in exile -lrb- ecre -rrb- , who called for an easing of immigration laws across europe . " we 've created an asylum system that is so harsh , where the chances of being detained are very high , where the chances of being refused asylum on spurious grounds are very high , and the chances of being sent back to a country where you do n't feel safe , are very high , " williams told dw-radio .
" people feel safer not to apply for asylum - to still come , but to remain underground . " the existing patchwork of national laws fosters illegal immigration , said peter altmaier , undersecretary in the german interior ministry in a radio interview .
at present there are 20 different national policies in the 27 member bloc , which apply very different treatment standards to refugees , but the european commission wants harmonized rules to be in place by 2010 . " we have to fight illegal immigration because these people are exploited by criminal organizations , " altmaier said .

survivors said the children were forced to stay in the building to act as " human shields " for militants suspected to be there .
is there any proof the taliban acts in this way ? citha d. maass : naturally , there is no proof , but time and again over the last few months we have received reports that the taliban uses this tactic .
it is certainly a part of the taliban 's tactics , and that creates an enormous dilemma for nato 's isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- troops since they ca n't get the children out and keep the taliban inside . nato has recently announced that fewer civilians would become victims of the conflict in afghanistan .
how can that be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has some 3,000 soldiers stationed as part of nato forces in afghanistan civilian casualties can not be completely avoided when these types of guerilla tactics are used .
it is really always a balance of proportionality .
are you willing pay the price or should you avoid it ?
when there is secure information available that there really are important taliban members , it is more likely that the order for an air strike is given than if you have solid tips that only nominal members are concerned .
the more civilian victims there are the more upset the population becomes about the isaf troops . what exactly happens when an attack kills civilians ? part of the taliban 's tactics is to incite resentment and anger that can then be shown in demonstrations aimed at the isaf troops or in protests against support of civilian reconstruction .
you can try to clarify the situation for the population , but that , of course , is only possible in a relatively minor way .
in the end , the taliban probably have more leverage . does that mean that the tactic of using " human shields " seriously endangers the international soldiers ' mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters rely on guerrilla tactics to match nato 's military might yes .
that 's the intent of this asymmetrical guerrilla tactic .
on one hand are the well-armed isaf military troops and on the other are guerrilla fighters like the taliban who , with the help of " civilian shields " and suicide attacks , conduct pinprick attacks .
they are trying to unsettle the isaf troops and to stir up the population 's mood against the international troops . according to nato diplomats , soldiers in the operation enduring freedom are mainly responsible for the civilian casualties .
is there a possibility that isaf troops are being more careful ? isaf has a different mandate - a different way of operating .
but we have to take a special look at the south - and that is the area that is most affected - and how the two groups work together .
the isaf troops do not have any air support of their own .
that means when they get into an ambush they have to order air support for their own defense .
this comes from the americans , who are operating under the enduring freedom mandate .
that makes it impossible to say who acts how .
instead it 's simply a compound approach in which the air attack comes from enduring freedom planes .
when an isaf patrol ends up in an ambush it naturally tries to get free , that 's the nature of the situation , and in such a case both units of soldiers are connected . you said that civilian casualties can not be completely avoided , that you have to consider them against the benefits in each case .
is n't that cynical when people 's lives are being sacrificed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tornado warplanes are being used to find taliban outposts no , the isaf side has recognized that the taliban is using this tactic to stir up the population against the international troops .
because of that they have become more and more careful .
but the casualties can not be fundamentally avoided because they are part of guerrilla tactics .
i would definitely not call it cynical , because i am sure in every case there is a careful consideration of whether or not to attack .
such an attack can both protect the international troops and at the same time destroy a religious school where taliban troops barricaded themselves . in an interview with deutsche welle , secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said that nato is " in a different moral category " than the taliban .
do people in afghanistan also see it that way ? i doubt that because the people who are in southern afghanistan , which is economically weak after several years of drought , are fighting to survive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 18.06.2007 sarkozy wins french poll but gets reduced majority for reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy got the all-clear to introduce reforms president nicolas sarkozy 's right-wing party won a clear majority to carry through his reform program in france 's legislative election sunday but failed to get a widely predicted landslide . sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- won 314 seats in the 577-member national assembly , 45 fewer than in the outgoing parliament , according to final official results .
another 22 seats went to the ump 's centrist allies . sarkozy 's party had been expected to score a " blue wave " landslide after his stunning presidential election win in may .
but amid a low turnout , the socialist party made a surprise comeback , jumping from 149 to 185 seats . the ump had 359 seats in the old assembly .
prime minister francois fillon said voters had given sarkozy " a majority to act " by handing his right-wing party control of the parliament . turnout for the decisive second round vote was 59.99 percent , far short of the near 85-percent turnout in the april-may presidential vote . " a clear and coherent choice " in an embarrassing blow to sarkozy , former prime minister alain juppe failed to win a seat in his bordeaux stronghold and resigned as environment superminister and government number two . sarkozy , 52 , had brought the 61-year-old juppe back from political exile after his conviction in a party finance scandal and given him one of the most prominent portfolios in his right-wing government . but economy minister jean-louis borloo said the government had scored a " historic success " in becoming the first ruling party since 1978 to retain control of the national assembly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister francois fillon prime minister francois fillon said france had " made a clear and coherent choice " by giving sarkozy " a majority to act . " " you voted for change , well that is going to be a reality .
we will challenge the habits and taboos that hold our country back , " fillon said . " the time for elections is over , now is the time for coming together , now is the time for action . " no blue wave but socialist party leader francois hollande highlighted his party 's gains .
" the blue wave that was announced and was set to sweep did not take place , " he said .

another 22 seats went to the ump 's centrist allies . sarkozy 's party had been expected to score a " blue wave " landslide after his stunning presidential election win in may .
but amid a low turnout , the socialist party made a surprise comeback , jumping from 149 to 185 seats . the ump had 359 seats in the old assembly .
prime minister francois fillon said voters had given sarkozy " a majority to act " by handing his right-wing party control of the parliament . turnout for the decisive second round vote was 59.99 percent , far short of the near 85-percent turnout in the april-may presidential vote . " a clear and coherent choice " in an embarrassing blow to sarkozy , former prime minister alain juppe failed to win a seat in his bordeaux stronghold and resigned as environment superminister and government number two . sarkozy , 52 , had brought the 61-year-old juppe back from political exile after his conviction in a party finance scandal and given him one of the most prominent portfolios in his right-wing government . but economy minister jean-louis borloo said the government had scored a " historic success " in becoming the first ruling party since 1978 to retain control of the national assembly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister francois fillon prime minister francois fillon said france had " made a clear and coherent choice " by giving sarkozy " a majority to act . " " you voted for change , well that is going to be a reality .
we will challenge the habits and taboos that hold our country back , " fillon said . " the time for elections is over , now is the time for coming together , now is the time for action . " no blue wave but socialist party leader francois hollande highlighted his party 's gains .
" the blue wave that was announced and was set to sweep did not take place , " he said .
he said the left 's showing would mean there will be " diversity and pluralism " in the new parliament . the socialists had warned voters of a huge ump majority in parliament would lead to a dangerous concentration of powers and turn the legislature into an annex of sarkozy 's presidency . hollande said the result was the sign of voter unease with " unjust measures " planned by the government , including a possible a hike in value-added tax rates to fund healthcare costs .
but the socialist gains were not expected to bury the party 's problems after three successive defeats in presidential elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal and hollande have separated after nearly 30 years even as they welcomed the better-than-expected showing , socialists were jolted by the news that royal and hollande , her partner of nearly 30 years , had separated . royal accused hollande of having an affair in interviews for a book to be released this week and asked that he no longer be described as her partner , though she did not specify when the break-up happened . a new era of french politics despite the much-reduced majority , the ump still became the first french governing party since 1978 to retain its majority in the lower house . one month after taking over from jacques chirac , sarkozy had asked for a strong majority in support of his campaign pledge to modernise french government , kick-start the economy and toughen up crime and immigration laws . a special session of the new parliament will open on june 26 to examine the first bills to reduce taxation , encourage overtime , grant universities more autonomy , tighten immigration and toughen sentences for repeat offenders . sunday 's vote was marked by low turnout as french voters - heading to the polls for the fourth time in two months - cast the last ballots in an election season that has ushered in a new era of politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rachida dati , france 's new justice minister sarkozy , the 52-year-old son of a hungarian immigrant , has appointed a broad-based government in which prominent leftist bernard kouchner is foreign minister and the first woman of north-african origin , rachida dati , was named justice minister . more politicians from the left and from minorities were expected to be appointed to junior ministries following sunday 's result , as part of sarkozy 's vaunted policy of openness . " yes , but of the french " the conservative le figaro called the results of sunday 's vote the " yes , but of the french " to sarkozy 's reforms in the headline to its story . " what happened yesterday was certainly not a defeat for nicolas sarkozy because nicolas sarkozy has a clear majority , but it certainly is a warning , " wrote the paper . le figaro said the gains made by the socialists from the first round of voting one week ago " ... is ample proof that if the french have adopted the idea of reform they are n't ready to accept those which have n't been amply considered ... " the left-wing liberation was more dramatic about the socialist gains . " the right-wing takes a left hook , " screamed the daily 's headline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois bayrou other left-wing parties picked up 41 seats between them , with 15 going to the communist party and four to the green party . the nationalist movement for france took one seat , but the main far-right national front won no seats . francois bayrou , who formed a new centrist party to build on his strong third-place showing in the presidential elections , took one of three seats won by his democratic movement . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

survivors said the children were forced to stay in the building to act as " human shields " for militants suspected to be there .
is there any proof the taliban acts in this way ? citha d. maass : naturally , there is no proof , but time and again over the last few months we have received reports that the taliban uses this tactic .
it is certainly a part of the taliban 's tactics , and that creates an enormous dilemma for nato 's isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- troops since they ca n't get the children out and keep the taliban inside . nato has recently announced that fewer civilians would become victims of the conflict in afghanistan .
how can that be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has some 3,000 soldiers stationed as part of nato forces in afghanistan civilian casualties can not be completely avoided when these types of guerilla tactics are used .
it is really always a balance of proportionality .
are you willing pay the price or should you avoid it ?
when there is secure information available that there really are important taliban members , it is more likely that the order for an air strike is given than if you have solid tips that only nominal members are concerned .
the more civilian victims there are the more upset the population becomes about the isaf troops . what exactly happens when an attack kills civilians ? part of the taliban 's tactics is to incite resentment and anger that can then be shown in demonstrations aimed at the isaf troops or in protests against support of civilian reconstruction .
you can try to clarify the situation for the population , but that , of course , is only possible in a relatively minor way .
in the end , the taliban probably have more leverage . does that mean that the tactic of using " human shields " seriously endangers the international soldiers ' mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters rely on guerrilla tactics to match nato 's military might yes .
that 's the intent of this asymmetrical guerrilla tactic .
on one hand are the well-armed isaf military troops and on the other are guerrilla fighters like the taliban who , with the help of " civilian shields " and suicide attacks , conduct pinprick attacks .
they are trying to unsettle the isaf troops and to stir up the population 's mood against the international troops . according to nato diplomats , soldiers in the operation enduring freedom are mainly responsible for the civilian casualties .
is there a possibility that isaf troops are being more careful ? isaf has a different mandate - a different way of operating .
but we have to take a special look at the south - and that is the area that is most affected - and how the two groups work together .
the isaf troops do not have any air support of their own .
that means when they get into an ambush they have to order air support for their own defense .
this comes from the americans , who are operating under the enduring freedom mandate .
that makes it impossible to say who acts how .
instead it 's simply a compound approach in which the air attack comes from enduring freedom planes .
when an isaf patrol ends up in an ambush it naturally tries to get free , that 's the nature of the situation , and in such a case both units of soldiers are connected . you said that civilian casualties can not be completely avoided , that you have to consider them against the benefits in each case .
is n't that cynical when people 's lives are being sacrificed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tornado warplanes are being used to find taliban outposts no , the isaf side has recognized that the taliban is using this tactic to stir up the population against the international troops .
because of that they have become more and more careful .
but the casualties can not be fundamentally avoided because they are part of guerrilla tactics .
i would definitely not call it cynical , because i am sure in every case there is a careful consideration of whether or not to attack .
such an attack can both protect the international troops and at the same time destroy a religious school where taliban troops barricaded themselves . in an interview with deutsche welle , secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said that nato is " in a different moral category " than the taliban .
do people in afghanistan also see it that way ? i doubt that because the people who are in southern afghanistan , which is economically weak after several years of drought , are fighting to survive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 18.06.2007 poles threaten to derail major summit on new eu treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the poles ' love affair with the eu coming to an end ?
eu member states have agreed to drop symbolic elements of the new treaty , but a meeting of german and polish leaders over the weekend failed to resolve an impasse over the bloc 's voting structure . when chancellor angela merkel convenes an eu summit on a new slimmed-down treaty towards the end of germany 's six-month rotating presidency on thursday and friday , the 27 member states are expected to be split into three broad camps .
merkel wants to establish a road map for the conference to adopt a new eu treaty . first , there are 22 countries , which are in favor of the defunct constitution that was ratified already by 18 members .

eu member states have agreed to drop symbolic elements of the new treaty , but a meeting of german and polish leaders over the weekend failed to resolve an impasse over the bloc 's voting structure . when chancellor angela merkel convenes an eu summit on a new slimmed-down treaty towards the end of germany 's six-month rotating presidency on thursday and friday , the 27 member states are expected to be split into three broad camps .
merkel wants to establish a road map for the conference to adopt a new eu treaty . first , there are 22 countries , which are in favor of the defunct constitution that was ratified already by 18 members .
the next group are euro-skeptic countries such as britain and the czech republic , which would have likely voted against the old document , but never got around to casting their ballots after it was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 . and then there are the poles , in a camp of their own .
at issue is the eu ’ s reformed voting structure in which each member state carries a certain weight based on their population base .
the poles argue that the current double voting structure gives disproportionate power to large eu countries , such as germany , and that merkel is acting in her country ’ s national interest , instead of speaking for the entire bloc . eu summit could collapse due to polish position merkel , who met with polish president lech kaczynski this past weekend , said she could not rule out the possibility that the brussels summit could collapse because of the polish position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks over weekend between poland 's kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and merkel stalled " i can only say that it was a very open discussion , but in this matter the positions have not changed , " said merkel . merkel rejected poland 's demand that talks on voting procedures be reopened , saying it was better to leave the agreement , which was reached after long and tough negotiations between all member states , in place . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said he backed merkel 's position in the stand-off .
" if this summit fails , then it certainly will not be the fault of germany leading the negotiations , " he said , alluding to the impasse created by the polish position against the rest of the eu . " the double-majority system as defined within the constitutional treaty , we can not accept that , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told reporters after eu foreign ministers discussed negotiations for a new treaty reforming the bloc 's institutions . voting formula based on square root of population diplomats said fotyga 's tough 30-minute speech dashed hopes that warsaw was starting to soften its stance after the meeting between merkel and kaczynski . under the current reform , most eu decisions would require the support of 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the population .
poland , which has less than half of germany 's population , has proposed an alternative based on a mathematical square root of each country 's population . warsaw is cross that even a discussion of their alternative is off the table on merkel 's agenda at the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and dutch " no " votes in 2005 plunged the eu into crisis the poles , who are overwhelmingly catholic , insist that they are willing to compromise .
for instance , they are willing to drop references to a christian god enshrined in the treaty , which was another bone of contention , but that accepting the " double majority " system of voting , which they threaten to veto , would be a going a step too far . poles divided on government position kaczynski explained that warsaw focused so much on the issue of voting rights , because the voting system would assume a new significance in the reformed european union . polish opposition politicians on the other hand appeared divided on the government ’ s position . while the liberal opposition seems to be leaning toward the government line that countries like poland should be given more voting power within the eu , the democratic left alliance pointed out the flaws of what it regards as kaczynski ’ s intransigence . left-wing opposition leader wojciech olejniczak believes that long-term strategic alliances with major european union partners should matter more than the square root voting system the polish government is pushing for . " looking for a compromise solution is a better way of building a country 's position than putting a spanner in the works , " he told dw-radio . according to other critics , kaczynski and his twin brother jaroslaw , who is prime minister , are reluctant to back down on the issue of voting rights because of their suspicion of germany ’ s motives . " the kaczynski brothers focus too much on the difficult history between poland and germany , which seems to cloud their vision of europe , " said european affairs analyst andrzej krajewski of the batory foundation . britain and netherlands have special demands too besides poland , britain and the netherlands have also set out their own demands .
britain insists that a charter of fundamental rights must not be legally binding and wants an opt-out on judicial and criminal matters , a position that is further complicated by the change in leadership from prime minister tony blair to gordon brown after the summit on june 27 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : change of leadership in britain from blair -lrb- left -rrb- to brown complicates matters the dutch are seeking stronger powers for national parliaments to send back eu draft legislation .
france , which voted against the constitution , and spain , which had already approved it in a referendum , made a joint appeal for a quick , simplified treaty . agreement on a revised treaty at the summit could lift the eu out of its torpor and boost merkel ’ s standing in europe .
but another failure could plunge the bloc into a deeper crisis and institutional gridlock .
it could mean a two-speed europe in which some countries would advance ahead anyway , leaving the naysayers behind . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said some of the most objectionable differences , which are largely symbolic , had been overcome , such as calling the new document an amended treaty as opposed to " constitution . "
beethoven 's " ode to joy " and the eu flag with gold stars against a royal blue background for example , would not be formally enscrined in the new treaty . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" maybe these men do this to me because they do not believe in women making decisions . " according to research revealed at the summit , the netherlands and the united kingdom are the two countries that have the highest percentage of women in decision-making positions . visser said it remains hard for women to climb the career ladder since unlike other countries , " the netherlands does not have a legislator that could back women up and to get to the top , you have to be on your own . " " davos for women " the challenges facing women in the business world was one of the core themes of the summit which is also known as the " davos for women .

participants included latvian president , vaira vike-freiberga and vice president of microsoft usa , gerri elliot . irene natividad , president of the summit said the meet allows women across borders , disciplines and cultures to learn from each other in their ongoing work towards economic equity . " sustainability and growth in our global economy would be unthinkable without women " natividad said . she admitted that there were n't enough women in top managerial positions and emphasized the need to change the mind-set of both men and women . " many corporate leaders still view the inclusion of women board directors as a matter of political correctness or as a form of affirmative action to address past inequities . "
she said both views are misguided approaches that merely entrench opposition to diversifying corporate boardrooms . women as stakeholders experts point out that companies can ill-afford to shut out women from decision-making positions given that women are increasingly turning important stakeholders enabling firms to better compete globally . " they -lrb- women -rrb- constitute 50 percent of the world ’ s workers , run over 40 percent of small businesses and make 80 percent of consumer buying decisions , " said natividad . the summit threw up a host of ideas to help ease the way for women aspiring to managerial levels and positions of power in the business world . some pointed out that corporate power circles still remains a boys ' club .

" women who are in government decision making should advocate for laws that could help women to reach to the top managerial positions , " ford said . germany lags behind in europe according to the study published during the summit , german companies tend to have the lowest number of women in managerial positions in western europe . susan unger , senior vice president and chief information officer at daimler chrysler and one of the few german women executives said one of the main barriers faced by german women is juggling family and work .

in the first hours of the paris event , the european group orchestrated the announcement of new orders for its troubled superjumbo a380 from qatar airways and dubai-based emirates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a350 underwent major changes after clients were unhappy with its shape at an airbus press conference , qatar airways said it would buy three additional a380 superjumbos and confirmed a previous order for 80 mid-sized a350s .
the planes would be worth slightly more than $ 18 billion dollars -lrb- 13.4 billion euros -rrb- at catalog prices .
soon afterwards , emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said his company planned to buy eight more a380s worth $ 2.5 billion at catalog prices .
emirates was already the single biggest client for the a380 with an order for 43 of the aircraft .
american carrier us airways also signed a letter of intent on monday to buy 92 airbus aircraft in the a350 , a330 and a320 families , the two companies announced monday .
the order was worth move than $ 8 billion , according to airbus commercial director john leahy .
airbus has fallen far behind boeing for new orders in 2007 after being overtaken by the us manufacturer in 2006 .

a weak dollar has also made buying from airbus expensive as international deals are usually made in dollars , not euros .
" we have to make airbus competitive at an exchange rate of 1.45 dollars per euro , " gallois told reporters before the show .
the current exchange rate is $ 1.34 to the euro .
" if the euro continues to rise , it will force us to make new decisions about where production is located . "
earlier this year airbus announced a restructuring plan that executives said could save 5 billion euros by 2010 and 2.1 billion euros per year thereafter and may lead to as many as 10,000 job cuts .
airbus employs 56,000 people , including 22,000 in france and 21,000 in germany .
deliveries of the a380 , which is to enter service later this year , are running about two years behind schedule and airbus is keen to shore up confidence in the project .
airbus was also forced to re-design its a350 , which re-emerged with an enlarged body , after a poor response from clients to the original shape .

at the end of may , airbus had reported 201 new orders for planes this year , while boeing had 429 at the beginning of june .
the us-based group received a boost from aircraft leasing group gecas on monday , which said it had placed a firm order for six boeing 777 cargo aircraft .

" the eu will resume normal relations with the palestinian authority immediately , " the bloc 's ministers said in a text of conclusions from a meeting in luxembourg . the eu partially froze ties with the palestinian government and suspended direct aid when hamas swept to power last year because the islamist movement figures on its blacklist of outlawed " terrorist " groups . the new emergency cabinet does not contain hamas members . the ministers said the eu would " resume direct financial support to the government , " as well as provide support to the palestinian civilian police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana in luxembourg monday it will also undertake " intensive efforts to build the institutions of the future palestinian state . " " part of the money will be direct , " eu foreign and security policy chief javier solana said at a meeting with eu foreign ministers in luxembourg monday .
but " in order to help the palestinian people in gaza , we will need some mechanism that can not be a direct support . "
eu funds would be distributed in gaza through united nations agencies or the eu 's current emergency aid system which sidelines hama leaders in the territory .
the eu chief diplomat did not give details of when the bloc would resume aid payments to the palestinian government . technical details being discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salam fayyad the eu has expressed its support for the emergency cabinet created by abbas .
last week , abbas dissolved the hamas-led unity government and declared a state of emergency .
the militant group launched an all-out assault on fatah 's security forces in gaza , taking complete control of the strip .
more than 100 people were killed in the clashes .
the emergency cabinet is led by former finance minister salam fayyad .
hamas has denounced the new cabinet as illegal .
the recent violence led to the creation of two separately zones : a hamas-ruled gaza and a fatah-controlled west bank .
the islamic militant group is black-listed as a terrorist organization by the eu and the united states .
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told reporters she was still discussing with fayyad the technical details of when and how aid flows would be re-established .
" we are of course ready to continue to work with fayyad in order to be ready in future to see how we can work directly with the emergency government , " ferrero-waldner said .
she said the eu was working closely with the palestinian authority to establish strict financial channels for the resumption of direct assistance .
financial controls on eu aid had to be clearly defined and very transparent , she insisted , adding : " we have to be very careful ... this is not just political but also technical . " humanitarian aid never stopped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas militants have taken over gaza despite the ban on direct assistance to the palestinian authority , european governments have been sending humanitarian aid to both gaza and the west bank .
officials said an estimated 700 million euros -lrb- $ 939 million -rrb- in such emergency aid was sent to gaza and the west bank last year .
the money was used to pay the salaries of teachers , doctors and health workers and for supplies of fuel , water and electricity to the territories .
once aid flows were re-established , ferrero-waldner said it would be up to fayyad to decide how funds were distributed in gaza .

" maybe these men do this to me because they do not believe in women making decisions . " according to research revealed at the summit , the netherlands and the united kingdom are the two countries that have the highest percentage of women in decision-making positions . visser said it remains hard for women to climb the career ladder since unlike other countries , " the netherlands does not have a legislator that could back women up and to get to the top , you have to be on your own . " " davos for women " the challenges facing women in the business world was one of the core themes of the summit which is also known as the " davos for women . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian president vaira vike-freiberga took part in the summit an annual occurrence , the three-day meeting this time drew over 1,000 female government and business leaders - most of them top corporate executives - from 95 countries .
participants included latvian president , vaira vike-freiberga and vice president of microsoft usa , gerri elliot . irene natividad , president of the summit said the meet allows women across borders , disciplines and cultures to learn from each other in their ongoing work towards economic equity . " sustainability and growth in our global economy would be unthinkable without women " natividad said . she admitted that there were n't enough women in top managerial positions and emphasized the need to change the mind-set of both men and women . " many corporate leaders still view the inclusion of women board directors as a matter of political correctness or as a form of affirmative action to address past inequities . "
she said both views are misguided approaches that merely entrench opposition to diversifying corporate boardrooms . women as stakeholders experts point out that companies can ill-afford to shut out women from decision-making positions given that women are increasingly turning important stakeholders enabling firms to better compete globally . " they -lrb- women -rrb- constitute 50 percent of the world ’ s workers , run over 40 percent of small businesses and make 80 percent of consumer buying decisions , " said natividad . the summit threw up a host of ideas to help ease the way for women aspiring to managerial levels and positions of power in the business world . some pointed out that corporate power circles still remains a boys ' club .

survivors said the children were forced to stay in the building to act as " human shields " for militants suspected to be there .
is there any proof the taliban acts in this way ? citha d. maass : naturally , there is no proof , but time and again over the last few months we have received reports that the taliban uses this tactic .
it is certainly a part of the taliban 's tactics , and that creates an enormous dilemma for nato 's isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- troops since they ca n't get the children out and keep the taliban inside . nato has recently announced that fewer civilians would become victims of the conflict in afghanistan .
how can that be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has some 3,000 soldiers stationed as part of nato forces in afghanistan civilian casualties can not be completely avoided when these types of guerilla tactics are used .
it is really always a balance of proportionality .
are you willing pay the price or should you avoid it ?
when there is secure information available that there really are important taliban members , it is more likely that the order for an air strike is given than if you have solid tips that only nominal members are concerned .
the more civilian victims there are the more upset the population becomes about the isaf troops . what exactly happens when an attack kills civilians ? part of the taliban 's tactics is to incite resentment and anger that can then be shown in demonstrations aimed at the isaf troops or in protests against support of civilian reconstruction .
you can try to clarify the situation for the population , but that , of course , is only possible in a relatively minor way .
in the end , the taliban probably have more leverage . does that mean that the tactic of using " human shields " seriously endangers the international soldiers ' mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters rely on guerrilla tactics to match nato 's military might yes .
that 's the intent of this asymmetrical guerrilla tactic .
on one hand are the well-armed isaf military troops and on the other are guerrilla fighters like the taliban who , with the help of " civilian shields " and suicide attacks , conduct pinprick attacks .
they are trying to unsettle the isaf troops and to stir up the population 's mood against the international troops . according to nato diplomats , soldiers in the operation enduring freedom are mainly responsible for the civilian casualties .
is there a possibility that isaf troops are being more careful ? isaf has a different mandate - a different way of operating .
but we have to take a special look at the south - and that is the area that is most affected - and how the two groups work together .
the isaf troops do not have any air support of their own .
that means when they get into an ambush they have to order air support for their own defense .
this comes from the americans , who are operating under the enduring freedom mandate .
that makes it impossible to say who acts how .
instead it 's simply a compound approach in which the air attack comes from enduring freedom planes .
when an isaf patrol ends up in an ambush it naturally tries to get free , that 's the nature of the situation , and in such a case both units of soldiers are connected . you said that civilian casualties can not be completely avoided , that you have to consider them against the benefits in each case .
is n't that cynical when people 's lives are being sacrificed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tornado warplanes are being used to find taliban outposts no , the isaf side has recognized that the taliban is using this tactic to stir up the population against the international troops .
because of that they have become more and more careful .
but the casualties can not be fundamentally avoided because they are part of guerrilla tactics .
i would definitely not call it cynical , because i am sure in every case there is a careful consideration of whether or not to attack .
such an attack can both protect the international troops and at the same time destroy a religious school where taliban troops barricaded themselves . in an interview with deutsche welle , secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said that nato is " in a different moral category " than the taliban .
do people in afghanistan also see it that way ? i doubt that because the people who are in southern afghanistan , which is economically weak after several years of drought , are fighting to survive .

is there any proof the taliban acts in this way ? citha d. maass : naturally , there is no proof , but time and again over the last few months we have received reports that the taliban uses this tactic .
it is certainly a part of the taliban 's tactics , and that creates an enormous dilemma for nato 's isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- troops since they ca n't get the children out and keep the taliban inside . nato has recently announced that fewer civilians would become victims of the conflict in afghanistan .

it is really always a balance of proportionality .
are you willing pay the price or should you avoid it ?

you can try to clarify the situation for the population , but that , of course , is only possible in a relatively minor way .
in the end , the taliban probably have more leverage . does that mean that the tactic of using " human shields " seriously endangers the international soldiers ' mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters rely on guerrilla tactics to match nato 's military might yes .
that 's the intent of this asymmetrical guerrilla tactic .
on one hand are the well-armed isaf military troops and on the other are guerrilla fighters like the taliban who , with the help of " civilian shields " and suicide attacks , conduct pinprick attacks .
they are trying to unsettle the isaf troops and to stir up the population 's mood against the international troops . according to nato diplomats , soldiers in the operation enduring freedom are mainly responsible for the civilian casualties .
is there a possibility that isaf troops are being more careful ? isaf has a different mandate - a different way of operating .

the track , considered by many to be the most beautiful and difficult course in the world , turned 80 monday . from day one the nürburgring has had the reputation among racing fans for being exhilarating and brutal .
on june 18 , 1927 , german legend rudolf caracciola won the inaugural race , driving 100.1 kmph -lrb- 62.2 mph -rrb- .
after 12 laps , he emerged from his mercedes s triumphantly , hands bloody and feet burned from the hilly , technical track . racer jackie stewart once famously called it " the green hell . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrari won this race in 1953 the ring , as it 's known by fans , is a curvy stretch of asphalt approximately 90 km southwest of the german city of cologne .
the hilly , wooded eifel region were a natural place to build a track , since the back roads had long been a favorite of racing enthusiasts .
the 28.27 km -lrb- 17.6 mile -rrb- " mountain , racing and test circuit " took as many as 3,000 workers two years to build .
it 's been a wild ride ever since .
more than 200,000 fans showed up for races in 1938 .
the track endured bombings during world war ii .
after the war , the track hosted german grand prix races as part of the formula one world championship . testing ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's schumacher the combined loop is notorious in the racing world for its technical challenges .
because of the demands it makes on drivers , the track has become a favorite testing ground for german car makers wanting to take their prototypes for a spin .
the track was also famous for nearly killing austrian formula one champion niki lauda in 1976 .
lauda 's car swerved off the track at nürburgring , rolled , hit another car and burst into flames .
lauda , trapped inside the car , suffered severe burns on his face , later fell into a coma and nearly died .
the next year , the license for formula one racing was n't renewed .
it returned in 1984 only to move to hockenheim a year later .
formula one returned in 1995 . schumacher brings in fans nürburgring found its current popularity thanks , in part , to german racer michael schumacher .
in 1995 michael schumacher was the first german to win a formula one world championship race at nürburgring .
as the sport increases in popularity around the world , there 's fierce competition to host formula one races . bildunterschrift : plenty of curves in the ring schumacher 's success helped the track .
he won seven world titles , five with ferrari .
his talents sparked an unprecedented formula one madness in germany in the early 1990s .
schumacher retired last year .
since 1994 , 100 million euros -lrb- $ 133 million -rrb- have been invested in nürburgring .
by 2009 another 150 million euros will go into improvements , according to media reports .
the hope is to attract an additional 500,000 visitors to the area each year . the area is trying to sell itself as a destination for car enthusiasts with a year-round recreation park offers " cars , actions and attractions .

amnesty and others support an eu wide migration policy guided by humanitarian principles . malta , which joined the eu in 2004 , is now at the forefront of a battle against illegal immigration , as scores of desperate african migrants in fishing boats risk their lives to reach european shores . many migrants hope that if they make it from the libyan coast to the tiny mediterranean island , which is south of sicily , they can start a new life anywhere in the european union . malta , which has been the destination of more than 7,000 illegal refugees over the past few years , is refusing to accept any more newcomers now , leaving boatloads of africans either to their fate in the turbulent mediterranean waters or in detention camps behind barbed wire . on monday at a berlin symposium , the human rights organization amnesty international lambasted the european union for its failure to support malta in its struggle to deal with the human tide from the horn of africa . mediterranean countries unfairly burdened it is the southern rim of the eu that is feeling the strain – malta , spain and italy , countries which want the rest of the bloc to do their fair share in taking in the illegal immigrants . the spanish canary islands off the western coast of africa , a favorite holiday destination for german and british tourists , was inundated with more than 30,000 refugees last year .

fears in european capitals of a tidal wave from africa are unfounded however , speakers at the symposium said . number of asylum seekers dropped drastically the number of asylum-seekers in germany for example has dropped from more than 400,000 in the mid-1990s to merely 20,000 last year . there are huge capacities within the eu to absorb more people in need of help , according to richard williams of the human rights group european council for refugees in exile -lrb- ecre -rrb- , who called for an easing of immigration laws across europe . " we 've created an asylum system that is so harsh , where the chances of being detained are very high , where the chances of being refused asylum on spurious grounds are very high , and the chances of being sent back to a country where you do n't feel safe , are very high , " williams told dw-radio .
" people feel safer not to apply for asylum - to still come , but to remain underground . " the existing patchwork of national laws fosters illegal immigration , said peter altmaier , undersecretary in the german interior ministry in a radio interview .
at present there are 20 different national policies in the 27 member bloc , which apply very different treatment standards to refugees , but the european commission wants harmonized rules to be in place by 2010 . " we have to fight illegal immigration because these people are exploited by criminal organizations , " altmaier said .

eu member states have agreed to drop symbolic elements of the new treaty , but a meeting of german and polish leaders over the weekend failed to resolve an impasse over the bloc 's voting structure . when chancellor angela merkel convenes an eu summit on a new slimmed-down treaty towards the end of germany 's six-month rotating presidency on thursday and friday , the 27 member states are expected to be split into three broad camps .
merkel wants to establish a road map for the conference to adopt a new eu treaty . first , there are 22 countries , which are in favor of the defunct constitution that was ratified already by 18 members .
the next group are euro-skeptic countries such as britain and the czech republic , which would have likely voted against the old document , but never got around to casting their ballots after it was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 . and then there are the poles , in a camp of their own .
at issue is the eu ’ s reformed voting structure in which each member state carries a certain weight based on their population base .
the poles argue that the current double voting structure gives disproportionate power to large eu countries , such as germany , and that merkel is acting in her country ’ s national interest , instead of speaking for the entire bloc . eu summit could collapse due to polish position merkel , who met with polish president lech kaczynski this past weekend , said she could not rule out the possibility that the brussels summit could collapse because of the polish position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks over weekend between poland 's kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and merkel stalled " i can only say that it was a very open discussion , but in this matter the positions have not changed , " said merkel . merkel rejected poland 's demand that talks on voting procedures be reopened , saying it was better to leave the agreement , which was reached after long and tough negotiations between all member states , in place . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said he backed merkel 's position in the stand-off .
" if this summit fails , then it certainly will not be the fault of germany leading the negotiations , " he said , alluding to the impasse created by the polish position against the rest of the eu . " the double-majority system as defined within the constitutional treaty , we can not accept that , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told reporters after eu foreign ministers discussed negotiations for a new treaty reforming the bloc 's institutions . voting formula based on square root of population diplomats said fotyga 's tough 30-minute speech dashed hopes that warsaw was starting to soften its stance after the meeting between merkel and kaczynski . under the current reform , most eu decisions would require the support of 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the population .
poland , which has less than half of germany 's population , has proposed an alternative based on a mathematical square root of each country 's population . warsaw is cross that even a discussion of their alternative is off the table on merkel 's agenda at the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and dutch " no " votes in 2005 plunged the eu into crisis the poles , who are overwhelmingly catholic , insist that they are willing to compromise .
for instance , they are willing to drop references to a christian god enshrined in the treaty , which was another bone of contention , but that accepting the " double majority " system of voting , which they threaten to veto , would be a going a step too far . poles divided on government position kaczynski explained that warsaw focused so much on the issue of voting rights , because the voting system would assume a new significance in the reformed european union . polish opposition politicians on the other hand appeared divided on the government ’ s position . while the liberal opposition seems to be leaning toward the government line that countries like poland should be given more voting power within the eu , the democratic left alliance pointed out the flaws of what it regards as kaczynski ’ s intransigence . left-wing opposition leader wojciech olejniczak believes that long-term strategic alliances with major european union partners should matter more than the square root voting system the polish government is pushing for . " looking for a compromise solution is a better way of building a country 's position than putting a spanner in the works , " he told dw-radio . according to other critics , kaczynski and his twin brother jaroslaw , who is prime minister , are reluctant to back down on the issue of voting rights because of their suspicion of germany ’ s motives . " the kaczynski brothers focus too much on the difficult history between poland and germany , which seems to cloud their vision of europe , " said european affairs analyst andrzej krajewski of the batory foundation . britain and netherlands have special demands too besides poland , britain and the netherlands have also set out their own demands .
britain insists that a charter of fundamental rights must not be legally binding and wants an opt-out on judicial and criminal matters , a position that is further complicated by the change in leadership from prime minister tony blair to gordon brown after the summit on june 27 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : change of leadership in britain from blair -lrb- left -rrb- to brown complicates matters the dutch are seeking stronger powers for national parliaments to send back eu draft legislation .
france , which voted against the constitution , and spain , which had already approved it in a referendum , made a joint appeal for a quick , simplified treaty . agreement on a revised treaty at the summit could lift the eu out of its torpor and boost merkel ’ s standing in europe .
but another failure could plunge the bloc into a deeper crisis and institutional gridlock .
it could mean a two-speed europe in which some countries would advance ahead anyway , leaving the naysayers behind . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said some of the most objectionable differences , which are largely symbolic , had been overcome , such as calling the new document an amended treaty as opposed to " constitution . "
beethoven 's " ode to joy " and the eu flag with gold stars against a royal blue background for example , would not be formally enscrined in the new treaty . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu member states have agreed to drop symbolic elements of the new treaty , but a meeting of german and polish leaders over the weekend failed to resolve an impasse over the bloc 's voting structure . when chancellor angela merkel convenes an eu summit on a new slimmed-down treaty towards the end of germany 's six-month rotating presidency on thursday and friday , the 27 member states are expected to be split into three broad camps .
merkel wants to establish a road map for the conference to adopt a new eu treaty . first , there are 22 countries , which are in favor of the defunct constitution that was ratified already by 18 members .
the next group are euro-skeptic countries such as britain and the czech republic , which would have likely voted against the old document , but never got around to casting their ballots after it was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 . and then there are the poles , in a camp of their own .
at issue is the eu ’ s reformed voting structure in which each member state carries a certain weight based on their population base .
the poles argue that the current double voting structure gives disproportionate power to large eu countries , such as germany , and that merkel is acting in her country ’ s national interest , instead of speaking for the entire bloc . eu summit could collapse due to polish position merkel , who met with polish president lech kaczynski this past weekend , said she could not rule out the possibility that the brussels summit could collapse because of the polish position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks over weekend between poland 's kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and merkel stalled " i can only say that it was a very open discussion , but in this matter the positions have not changed , " said merkel . merkel rejected poland 's demand that talks on voting procedures be reopened , saying it was better to leave the agreement , which was reached after long and tough negotiations between all member states , in place . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said he backed merkel 's position in the stand-off .
" if this summit fails , then it certainly will not be the fault of germany leading the negotiations , " he said , alluding to the impasse created by the polish position against the rest of the eu . " the double-majority system as defined within the constitutional treaty , we can not accept that , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told reporters after eu foreign ministers discussed negotiations for a new treaty reforming the bloc 's institutions . voting formula based on square root of population diplomats said fotyga 's tough 30-minute speech dashed hopes that warsaw was starting to soften its stance after the meeting between merkel and kaczynski . under the current reform , most eu decisions would require the support of 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the population .

eu member states have agreed to drop symbolic elements of the new treaty , but a meeting of german and polish leaders over the weekend failed to resolve an impasse over the bloc 's voting structure . when chancellor angela merkel convenes an eu summit on a new slimmed-down treaty towards the end of germany 's six-month rotating presidency on thursday and friday , the 27 member states are expected to be split into three broad camps .
merkel wants to establish a road map for the conference to adopt a new eu treaty . first , there are 22 countries , which are in favor of the defunct constitution that was ratified already by 18 members .
the next group are euro-skeptic countries such as britain and the czech republic , which would have likely voted against the old document , but never got around to casting their ballots after it was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 . and then there are the poles , in a camp of their own .
at issue is the eu ’ s reformed voting structure in which each member state carries a certain weight based on their population base .
the poles argue that the current double voting structure gives disproportionate power to large eu countries , such as germany , and that merkel is acting in her country ’ s national interest , instead of speaking for the entire bloc . eu summit could collapse due to polish position merkel , who met with polish president lech kaczynski this past weekend , said she could not rule out the possibility that the brussels summit could collapse because of the polish position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks over weekend between poland 's kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and merkel stalled " i can only say that it was a very open discussion , but in this matter the positions have not changed , " said merkel . merkel rejected poland 's demand that talks on voting procedures be reopened , saying it was better to leave the agreement , which was reached after long and tough negotiations between all member states , in place . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said he backed merkel 's position in the stand-off .
" if this summit fails , then it certainly will not be the fault of germany leading the negotiations , " he said , alluding to the impasse created by the polish position against the rest of the eu . " the double-majority system as defined within the constitutional treaty , we can not accept that , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told reporters after eu foreign ministers discussed negotiations for a new treaty reforming the bloc 's institutions . voting formula based on square root of population diplomats said fotyga 's tough 30-minute speech dashed hopes that warsaw was starting to soften its stance after the meeting between merkel and kaczynski . under the current reform , most eu decisions would require the support of 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the population .
poland , which has less than half of germany 's population , has proposed an alternative based on a mathematical square root of each country 's population . warsaw is cross that even a discussion of their alternative is off the table on merkel 's agenda at the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and dutch " no " votes in 2005 plunged the eu into crisis the poles , who are overwhelmingly catholic , insist that they are willing to compromise .
for instance , they are willing to drop references to a christian god enshrined in the treaty , which was another bone of contention , but that accepting the " double majority " system of voting , which they threaten to veto , would be a going a step too far . poles divided on government position kaczynski explained that warsaw focused so much on the issue of voting rights , because the voting system would assume a new significance in the reformed european union . polish opposition politicians on the other hand appeared divided on the government ’ s position . while the liberal opposition seems to be leaning toward the government line that countries like poland should be given more voting power within the eu , the democratic left alliance pointed out the flaws of what it regards as kaczynski ’ s intransigence . left-wing opposition leader wojciech olejniczak believes that long-term strategic alliances with major european union partners should matter more than the square root voting system the polish government is pushing for . " looking for a compromise solution is a better way of building a country 's position than putting a spanner in the works , " he told dw-radio . according to other critics , kaczynski and his twin brother jaroslaw , who is prime minister , are reluctant to back down on the issue of voting rights because of their suspicion of germany ’ s motives . " the kaczynski brothers focus too much on the difficult history between poland and germany , which seems to cloud their vision of europe , " said european affairs analyst andrzej krajewski of the batory foundation . britain and netherlands have special demands too besides poland , britain and the netherlands have also set out their own demands .
britain insists that a charter of fundamental rights must not be legally binding and wants an opt-out on judicial and criminal matters , a position that is further complicated by the change in leadership from prime minister tony blair to gordon brown after the summit on june 27 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : change of leadership in britain from blair -lrb- left -rrb- to brown complicates matters the dutch are seeking stronger powers for national parliaments to send back eu draft legislation .
france , which voted against the constitution , and spain , which had already approved it in a referendum , made a joint appeal for a quick , simplified treaty . agreement on a revised treaty at the summit could lift the eu out of its torpor and boost merkel ’ s standing in europe .
but another failure could plunge the bloc into a deeper crisis and institutional gridlock .
it could mean a two-speed europe in which some countries would advance ahead anyway , leaving the naysayers behind . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said some of the most objectionable differences , which are largely symbolic , had been overcome , such as calling the new document an amended treaty as opposed to " constitution . "
beethoven 's " ode to joy " and the eu flag with gold stars against a royal blue background for example , would not be formally enscrined in the new treaty . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a future without hamas ?
in this situation , it seems unlikely that the international community will completely abandon the palestinians .
the lifting of the embargo put in place a year and a half ago after the election victory of hamas now seems feasible for the west bank .

there 's no disputing that an abbas-controlled west bank would be the better model for a future palestinian state and should be treated and supported accordingly .
but at the same time , it 's important to avoid allowing the gaza strip to drift completely into a humanitarian disaster . the people there should not be punished for failed hamas policies .

that said , the international community should avoid taking sides in palestine 's internal power struggle , says deutsche welle 's rainer sollich . everyone supports mahmoud abbas : the united states , the united nations and the european union .
israel also sets big hopes on the palestinian president after the military victory of hamas in the gaza strip .
as far as the current situation goes , abbas has earned this broad support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer sollich the violent frenzy of the hamas fighters in the gaza strip can not be excused as a justifiable protest against discrimination or corruption - it is a coup against political institutions .
hamas has deepened the split of the palestinian nation .
and hamas has made the population of the gaza strip hostage to a policy that could drive the region to increasingly hopeless isolation and poverty .
a future without hamas ?
in this situation , it seems unlikely that the international community will completely abandon the palestinians .
the lifting of the embargo put in place a year and a half ago after the election victory of hamas now seems feasible for the west bank .
that would clearly strengthen abbas and his moderate course vis-à-vis israel .
and it is also a clear show of faith for the new , hamas-free transitional cabinet under the existing palestinian finance minister salam fayyad .
israel 's prime minster ehud olmert can already imagine a peace treaty " without hamas . "
this position has takers in both the us and europe .
but caution is warranted .
hamas is and remains a considerable power factor with popularity beyond the gaza strip .
after all , the islamists won the last elections with an absolute majority and in this case justifiably demanded a share of power .
preventing humanitarian disaster the international community is presented with a difficult challenge : it should never accept terror or the hamas-declared goal of destroying israel .
but the international community should also not take sides in an internal palestinian power struggle .
apart from strengthening abbas , steps should be taken to make contact with moderate powers within hamas and to assist them if necessary .
there 's no disputing that an abbas-controlled west bank would be the better model for a future palestinian state and should be treated and supported accordingly .
but at the same time , it 's important to avoid allowing the gaza strip to drift completely into a humanitarian disaster . the people there should not be punished for failed hamas policies .
that would only lead to further radicalization and violence .

in the first hours of the paris event , the european group orchestrated the announcement of new orders for its troubled superjumbo a380 from qatar airways and dubai-based emirates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a350 underwent major changes after clients were unhappy with its shape at an airbus press conference , qatar airways said it would buy three additional a380 superjumbos and confirmed a previous order for 80 mid-sized a350s .
the planes would be worth slightly more than $ 18 billion dollars -lrb- 13.4 billion euros -rrb- at catalog prices .
soon afterwards , emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said his company planned to buy eight more a380s worth $ 2.5 billion at catalog prices .
emirates was already the single biggest client for the a380 with an order for 43 of the aircraft .
american carrier us airways also signed a letter of intent on monday to buy 92 airbus aircraft in the a350 , a330 and a320 families , the two companies announced monday .
the order was worth move than $ 8 billion , according to airbus commercial director john leahy .
airbus has fallen far behind boeing for new orders in 2007 after being overtaken by the us manufacturer in 2006 .
but chief executive louis gallois hinted that more new business was to come .
including the order from qatar airways , only 93 orders have been announced by airbus since the launch of the 10 billion euro a350 program at the end of 2006 .
weak dollar hurting airbus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus and boeing are expected to make more new order announcements this week the european manufacturer has had major production and design problems in the last few years and tallied up losses last year after a profit of 2.3 billion euros in 2006 .
a weak dollar has also made buying from airbus expensive as international deals are usually made in dollars , not euros .
" we have to make airbus competitive at an exchange rate of 1.45 dollars per euro , " gallois told reporters before the show .
the current exchange rate is $ 1.34 to the euro .
" if the euro continues to rise , it will force us to make new decisions about where production is located . "
earlier this year airbus announced a restructuring plan that executives said could save 5 billion euros by 2010 and 2.1 billion euros per year thereafter and may lead to as many as 10,000 job cuts .
airbus employs 56,000 people , including 22,000 in france and 21,000 in germany .
deliveries of the a380 , which is to enter service later this year , are running about two years behind schedule and airbus is keen to shore up confidence in the project .
airbus was also forced to re-design its a350 , which re-emerged with an enlarged body , after a poor response from clients to the original shape .
new orders at boeing , too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 400,000 visitors are expected at the air show boeing meanwhile has sprinted ahead in large part because of the popularity of its future mid-sized 787 model , which will enter service in mid-2008 , five years ahead of the a350 .
at the end of may , airbus had reported 201 new orders for planes this year , while boeing had 429 at the beginning of june .
the us-based group received a boost from aircraft leasing group gecas on monday , which said it had placed a firm order for six boeing 777 cargo aircraft .
about 400,000 people are expected to visit the event , which features air displays as well as exhibitions , at the le bourget airfield on the outskirts of paris .

another 22 seats went to the ump 's centrist allies . sarkozy 's party had been expected to score a " blue wave " landslide after his stunning presidential election win in may .
but amid a low turnout , the socialist party made a surprise comeback , jumping from 149 to 185 seats . the ump had 359 seats in the old assembly .
prime minister francois fillon said voters had given sarkozy " a majority to act " by handing his right-wing party control of the parliament . turnout for the decisive second round vote was 59.99 percent , far short of the near 85-percent turnout in the april-may presidential vote . " a clear and coherent choice " in an embarrassing blow to sarkozy , former prime minister alain juppe failed to win a seat in his bordeaux stronghold and resigned as environment superminister and government number two . sarkozy , 52 , had brought the 61-year-old juppe back from political exile after his conviction in a party finance scandal and given him one of the most prominent portfolios in his right-wing government . but economy minister jean-louis borloo said the government had scored a " historic success " in becoming the first ruling party since 1978 to retain control of the national assembly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister francois fillon prime minister francois fillon said france had " made a clear and coherent choice " by giving sarkozy " a majority to act .

" the blue wave that was announced and was set to sweep did not take place , " he said .
he said the left 's showing would mean there will be " diversity and pluralism " in the new parliament . the socialists had warned voters of a huge ump majority in parliament would lead to a dangerous concentration of powers and turn the legislature into an annex of sarkozy 's presidency . hollande said the result was the sign of voter unease with " unjust measures " planned by the government , including a possible a hike in value-added tax rates to fund healthcare costs .
but the socialist gains were not expected to bury the party 's problems after three successive defeats in presidential elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal and hollande have separated after nearly 30 years even as they welcomed the better-than-expected showing , socialists were jolted by the news that royal and hollande , her partner of nearly 30 years , had separated . royal accused hollande of having an affair in interviews for a book to be released this week and asked that he no longer be described as her partner , though she did not specify when the break-up happened . a new era of french politics despite the much-reduced majority , the ump still became the first french governing party since 1978 to retain its majority in the lower house . one month after taking over from jacques chirac , sarkozy had asked for a strong majority in support of his campaign pledge to modernise french government , kick-start the economy and toughen up crime and immigration laws . a special session of the new parliament will open on june 26 to examine the first bills to reduce taxation , encourage overtime , grant universities more autonomy , tighten immigration and toughen sentences for repeat offenders . sunday 's vote was marked by low turnout as french voters - heading to the polls for the fourth time in two months - cast the last ballots in an election season that has ushered in a new era of politics .

another 22 seats went to the ump 's centrist allies . sarkozy 's party had been expected to score a " blue wave " landslide after his stunning presidential election win in may .
but amid a low turnout , the socialist party made a surprise comeback , jumping from 149 to 185 seats . the ump had 359 seats in the old assembly .
prime minister francois fillon said voters had given sarkozy " a majority to act " by handing his right-wing party control of the parliament . turnout for the decisive second round vote was 59.99 percent , far short of the near 85-percent turnout in the april-may presidential vote . " a clear and coherent choice " in an embarrassing blow to sarkozy , former prime minister alain juppe failed to win a seat in his bordeaux stronghold and resigned as environment superminister and government number two . sarkozy , 52 , had brought the 61-year-old juppe back from political exile after his conviction in a party finance scandal and given him one of the most prominent portfolios in his right-wing government . but economy minister jean-louis borloo said the government had scored a " historic success " in becoming the first ruling party since 1978 to retain control of the national assembly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister francois fillon prime minister francois fillon said france had " made a clear and coherent choice " by giving sarkozy " a majority to act . " " you voted for change , well that is going to be a reality .
we will challenge the habits and taboos that hold our country back , " fillon said . " the time for elections is over , now is the time for coming together , now is the time for action . " no blue wave but socialist party leader francois hollande highlighted his party 's gains .
" the blue wave that was announced and was set to sweep did not take place , " he said .
he said the left 's showing would mean there will be " diversity and pluralism " in the new parliament . the socialists had warned voters of a huge ump majority in parliament would lead to a dangerous concentration of powers and turn the legislature into an annex of sarkozy 's presidency . hollande said the result was the sign of voter unease with " unjust measures " planned by the government , including a possible a hike in value-added tax rates to fund healthcare costs .

" anyone who is n't crazy knows that a restaurant like el bulli , which is as complicated as brain surgery , ca n't just up and move to kassel , " he said .
el bulli was the place that invented culinary foam , consisting of natural flavors -lrb- sweet or savory -rrb- mixed with a natural gelling agent and squeezed from a whipped-cream canister with the help of nitrous oxide .

" the eu will resume normal relations with the palestinian authority immediately , " the bloc 's ministers said in a text of conclusions from a meeting in luxembourg . the eu partially froze ties with the palestinian government and suspended direct aid when hamas swept to power last year because the islamist movement figures on its blacklist of outlawed " terrorist " groups . the new emergency cabinet does not contain hamas members . the ministers said the eu would " resume direct financial support to the government , " as well as provide support to the palestinian civilian police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana in luxembourg monday it will also undertake " intensive efforts to build the institutions of the future palestinian state . " " part of the money will be direct , " eu foreign and security policy chief javier solana said at a meeting with eu foreign ministers in luxembourg monday .
but " in order to help the palestinian people in gaza , we will need some mechanism that can not be a direct support . "
eu funds would be distributed in gaza through united nations agencies or the eu 's current emergency aid system which sidelines hama leaders in the territory .
the eu chief diplomat did not give details of when the bloc would resume aid payments to the palestinian government . technical details being discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salam fayyad the eu has expressed its support for the emergency cabinet created by abbas .
last week , abbas dissolved the hamas-led unity government and declared a state of emergency .
the militant group launched an all-out assault on fatah 's security forces in gaza , taking complete control of the strip .
more than 100 people were killed in the clashes .
the emergency cabinet is led by former finance minister salam fayyad .
hamas has denounced the new cabinet as illegal .
the recent violence led to the creation of two separately zones : a hamas-ruled gaza and a fatah-controlled west bank .
the islamic militant group is black-listed as a terrorist organization by the eu and the united states .
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told reporters she was still discussing with fayyad the technical details of when and how aid flows would be re-established .
" we are of course ready to continue to work with fayyad in order to be ready in future to see how we can work directly with the emergency government , " ferrero-waldner said .
she said the eu was working closely with the palestinian authority to establish strict financial channels for the resumption of direct assistance .
financial controls on eu aid had to be clearly defined and very transparent , she insisted , adding : " we have to be very careful ... this is not just political but also technical . " humanitarian aid never stopped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas militants have taken over gaza despite the ban on direct assistance to the palestinian authority , european governments have been sending humanitarian aid to both gaza and the west bank .
officials said an estimated 700 million euros -lrb- $ 939 million -rrb- in such emergency aid was sent to gaza and the west bank last year .
the money was used to pay the salaries of teachers , doctors and health workers and for supplies of fuel , water and electricity to the territories .
once aid flows were re-established , ferrero-waldner said it would be up to fayyad to decide how funds were distributed in gaza .
both solana and ferrero-waldner voiced full confidence in the new palestinian premier , saying they trusted him and had known him for years . israel supports abbas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe suspended its direct aid because of hamas attending eu talks in luxembourg , israeli foreign minister tzipi livni said her government was ready to transfer blocked palestinian tax revenues to the palestinian government . " israel is going to work with abbas and fayyad to transfer the money , " said livni after talks with eu foreign ministers . livni said israel was " not looking for excuses " to delay the delivery of palestinian funds since it wanted to make a clear distinction between palestinian extremists like hamas and the moderate fatah movement of abbas and fayyad . livni did not indicate how much money would be transferred to the palestinians , but eu officials said israel owed up to 850 million dollars in blocked tax money to the palestinians . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier described the israeli move as " significant . " livni said the creation of the emergency palestinian government provided new opportunities for israeli-palestinian peace . isolating hamas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian supporters of hamas celebrate last week the us favors isolating hamas economically , diplomatically and militarily in the gaza strip .
some european diplomats have expressed misgivings about such a strategy .
" the international community does not want two palestinian states , otherwise it will be impossible to find a solution , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
russia wants the emergency cabinet to enter into a " broad dialogue " between all palestinian forces , including hamas . " moscow expects the new emergency cabinet to take all necessary measures to normalize the situation , improve the humanitarian situation ... and above all to halt inter-palestinian conflict , " according to a statement from the russian foreign ministry . " this requires the establishment of broad dialogue between all palestinian political forces including hamas , " the statement said . us also normalizes relations in washington , us secretary of state condoleezza rice meanwhile announced the us government was lifting a 15-month embargo on direct aid to the palestinian territories .
" we intend to lift our financial restrictions on the palestinian government , " she told reporters after meeting abbas in washington .

" the eu will resume normal relations with the palestinian authority immediately , " the bloc 's ministers said in a text of conclusions from a meeting in luxembourg . the eu partially froze ties with the palestinian government and suspended direct aid when hamas swept to power last year because the islamist movement figures on its blacklist of outlawed " terrorist " groups . the new emergency cabinet does not contain hamas members . the ministers said the eu would " resume direct financial support to the government , " as well as provide support to the palestinian civilian police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana in luxembourg monday it will also undertake " intensive efforts to build the institutions of the future palestinian state . " " part of the money will be direct , " eu foreign and security policy chief javier solana said at a meeting with eu foreign ministers in luxembourg monday .
but " in order to help the palestinian people in gaza , we will need some mechanism that can not be a direct support . "
eu funds would be distributed in gaza through united nations agencies or the eu 's current emergency aid system which sidelines hama leaders in the territory .
the eu chief diplomat did not give details of when the bloc would resume aid payments to the palestinian government . technical details being discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salam fayyad the eu has expressed its support for the emergency cabinet created by abbas .
last week , abbas dissolved the hamas-led unity government and declared a state of emergency .
the militant group launched an all-out assault on fatah 's security forces in gaza , taking complete control of the strip .
more than 100 people were killed in the clashes .
the emergency cabinet is led by former finance minister salam fayyad .
hamas has denounced the new cabinet as illegal .
the recent violence led to the creation of two separately zones : a hamas-ruled gaza and a fatah-controlled west bank .
the islamic militant group is black-listed as a terrorist organization by the eu and the united states .
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told reporters she was still discussing with fayyad the technical details of when and how aid flows would be re-established .
" we are of course ready to continue to work with fayyad in order to be ready in future to see how we can work directly with the emergency government , " ferrero-waldner said .
she said the eu was working closely with the palestinian authority to establish strict financial channels for the resumption of direct assistance .
financial controls on eu aid had to be clearly defined and very transparent , she insisted , adding : " we have to be very careful ... this is not just political but also technical . " humanitarian aid never stopped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas militants have taken over gaza despite the ban on direct assistance to the palestinian authority , european governments have been sending humanitarian aid to both gaza and the west bank .
officials said an estimated 700 million euros -lrb- $ 939 million -rrb- in such emergency aid was sent to gaza and the west bank last year .
the money was used to pay the salaries of teachers , doctors and health workers and for supplies of fuel , water and electricity to the territories .
once aid flows were re-established , ferrero-waldner said it would be up to fayyad to decide how funds were distributed in gaza .
both solana and ferrero-waldner voiced full confidence in the new palestinian premier , saying they trusted him and had known him for years . israel supports abbas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe suspended its direct aid because of hamas attending eu talks in luxembourg , israeli foreign minister tzipi livni said her government was ready to transfer blocked palestinian tax revenues to the palestinian government . " israel is going to work with abbas and fayyad to transfer the money , " said livni after talks with eu foreign ministers . livni said israel was " not looking for excuses " to delay the delivery of palestinian funds since it wanted to make a clear distinction between palestinian extremists like hamas and the moderate fatah movement of abbas and fayyad . livni did not indicate how much money would be transferred to the palestinians , but eu officials said israel owed up to 850 million dollars in blocked tax money to the palestinians . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier described the israeli move as " significant . " livni said the creation of the emergency palestinian government provided new opportunities for israeli-palestinian peace . isolating hamas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian supporters of hamas celebrate last week the us favors isolating hamas economically , diplomatically and militarily in the gaza strip .
some european diplomats have expressed misgivings about such a strategy .
" the international community does not want two palestinian states , otherwise it will be impossible to find a solution , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
russia wants the emergency cabinet to enter into a " broad dialogue " between all palestinian forces , including hamas . " moscow expects the new emergency cabinet to take all necessary measures to normalize the situation , improve the humanitarian situation ... and above all to halt inter-palestinian conflict , " according to a statement from the russian foreign ministry . " this requires the establishment of broad dialogue between all palestinian political forces including hamas , " the statement said . us also normalizes relations in washington , us secretary of state condoleezza rice meanwhile announced the us government was lifting a 15-month embargo on direct aid to the palestinian territories .

in the first hours of the paris event , the european group orchestrated the announcement of new orders for its troubled superjumbo a380 from qatar airways and dubai-based emirates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a350 underwent major changes after clients were unhappy with its shape at an airbus press conference , qatar airways said it would buy three additional a380 superjumbos and confirmed a previous order for 80 mid-sized a350s .
the planes would be worth slightly more than $ 18 billion dollars -lrb- 13.4 billion euros -rrb- at catalog prices .
soon afterwards , emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said his company planned to buy eight more a380s worth $ 2.5 billion at catalog prices .
emirates was already the single biggest client for the a380 with an order for 43 of the aircraft .
american carrier us airways also signed a letter of intent on monday to buy 92 airbus aircraft in the a350 , a330 and a320 families , the two companies announced monday .
the order was worth move than $ 8 billion , according to airbus commercial director john leahy .
airbus has fallen far behind boeing for new orders in 2007 after being overtaken by the us manufacturer in 2006 .
but chief executive louis gallois hinted that more new business was to come .
including the order from qatar airways , only 93 orders have been announced by airbus since the launch of the 10 billion euro a350 program at the end of 2006 .
weak dollar hurting airbus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus and boeing are expected to make more new order announcements this week the european manufacturer has had major production and design problems in the last few years and tallied up losses last year after a profit of 2.3 billion euros in 2006 .
a weak dollar has also made buying from airbus expensive as international deals are usually made in dollars , not euros .
" we have to make airbus competitive at an exchange rate of 1.45 dollars per euro , " gallois told reporters before the show .
the current exchange rate is $ 1.34 to the euro .
" if the euro continues to rise , it will force us to make new decisions about where production is located . "
earlier this year airbus announced a restructuring plan that executives said could save 5 billion euros by 2010 and 2.1 billion euros per year thereafter and may lead to as many as 10,000 job cuts .
airbus employs 56,000 people , including 22,000 in france and 21,000 in germany .
deliveries of the a380 , which is to enter service later this year , are running about two years behind schedule and airbus is keen to shore up confidence in the project .
airbus was also forced to re-design its a350 , which re-emerged with an enlarged body , after a poor response from clients to the original shape .
new orders at boeing , too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 400,000 visitors are expected at the air show boeing meanwhile has sprinted ahead in large part because of the popularity of its future mid-sized 787 model , which will enter service in mid-2008 , five years ahead of the a350 .
at the end of may , airbus had reported 201 new orders for planes this year , while boeing had 429 at the beginning of june .
the us-based group received a boost from aircraft leasing group gecas on monday , which said it had placed a firm order for six boeing 777 cargo aircraft .
about 400,000 people are expected to visit the event , which features air displays as well as exhibitions , at the le bourget airfield on the outskirts of paris .

another 22 seats went to the ump 's centrist allies . sarkozy 's party had been expected to score a " blue wave " landslide after his stunning presidential election win in may .
but amid a low turnout , the socialist party made a surprise comeback , jumping from 149 to 185 seats . the ump had 359 seats in the old assembly .
prime minister francois fillon said voters had given sarkozy " a majority to act " by handing his right-wing party control of the parliament . turnout for the decisive second round vote was 59.99 percent , far short of the near 85-percent turnout in the april-may presidential vote .

we will challenge the habits and taboos that hold our country back , " fillon said . " the time for elections is over , now is the time for coming together , now is the time for action . " no blue wave but socialist party leader francois hollande highlighted his party 's gains .
" the blue wave that was announced and was set to sweep did not take place , " he said .
he said the left 's showing would mean there will be " diversity and pluralism " in the new parliament . the socialists had warned voters of a huge ump majority in parliament would lead to a dangerous concentration of powers and turn the legislature into an annex of sarkozy 's presidency . hollande said the result was the sign of voter unease with " unjust measures " planned by the government , including a possible a hike in value-added tax rates to fund healthcare costs .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer sollich the violent frenzy of the hamas fighters in the gaza strip can not be excused as a justifiable protest against discrimination or corruption - it is a coup against political institutions .
hamas has deepened the split of the palestinian nation .
and hamas has made the population of the gaza strip hostage to a policy that could drive the region to increasingly hopeless isolation and poverty .
a future without hamas ?
in this situation , it seems unlikely that the international community will completely abandon the palestinians .
the lifting of the embargo put in place a year and a half ago after the election victory of hamas now seems feasible for the west bank .

preventing humanitarian disaster the international community is presented with a difficult challenge : it should never accept terror or the hamas-declared goal of destroying israel .

apart from strengthening abbas , steps should be taken to make contact with moderate powers within hamas and to assist them if necessary .
there 's no disputing that an abbas-controlled west bank would be the better model for a future palestinian state and should be treated and supported accordingly .
but at the same time , it 's important to avoid allowing the gaza strip to drift completely into a humanitarian disaster . the people there should not be punished for failed hamas policies .

but at the same time , it 's important to avoid allowing the gaza strip to drift completely into a humanitarian disaster . the people there should not be punished for failed hamas policies .
that would only lead to further radicalization and violence .

eu member states have agreed to drop symbolic elements of the new treaty , but a meeting of german and polish leaders over the weekend failed to resolve an impasse over the bloc 's voting structure . when chancellor angela merkel convenes an eu summit on a new slimmed-down treaty towards the end of germany 's six-month rotating presidency on thursday and friday , the 27 member states are expected to be split into three broad camps .
merkel wants to establish a road map for the conference to adopt a new eu treaty . first , there are 22 countries , which are in favor of the defunct constitution that was ratified already by 18 members .
the next group are euro-skeptic countries such as britain and the czech republic , which would have likely voted against the old document , but never got around to casting their ballots after it was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 . and then there are the poles , in a camp of their own .
at issue is the eu ’ s reformed voting structure in which each member state carries a certain weight based on their population base .
the poles argue that the current double voting structure gives disproportionate power to large eu countries , such as germany , and that merkel is acting in her country ’ s national interest , instead of speaking for the entire bloc . eu summit could collapse due to polish position merkel , who met with polish president lech kaczynski this past weekend , said she could not rule out the possibility that the brussels summit could collapse because of the polish position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks over weekend between poland 's kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and merkel stalled " i can only say that it was a very open discussion , but in this matter the positions have not changed , " said merkel . merkel rejected poland 's demand that talks on voting procedures be reopened , saying it was better to leave the agreement , which was reached after long and tough negotiations between all member states , in place . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said he backed merkel 's position in the stand-off .
" if this summit fails , then it certainly will not be the fault of germany leading the negotiations , " he said , alluding to the impasse created by the polish position against the rest of the eu . " the double-majority system as defined within the constitutional treaty , we can not accept that , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told reporters after eu foreign ministers discussed negotiations for a new treaty reforming the bloc 's institutions . voting formula based on square root of population diplomats said fotyga 's tough 30-minute speech dashed hopes that warsaw was starting to soften its stance after the meeting between merkel and kaczynski . under the current reform , most eu decisions would require the support of 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the population .
poland , which has less than half of germany 's population , has proposed an alternative based on a mathematical square root of each country 's population . warsaw is cross that even a discussion of their alternative is off the table on merkel 's agenda at the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and dutch " no " votes in 2005 plunged the eu into crisis the poles , who are overwhelmingly catholic , insist that they are willing to compromise .
for instance , they are willing to drop references to a christian god enshrined in the treaty , which was another bone of contention , but that accepting the " double majority " system of voting , which they threaten to veto , would be a going a step too far . poles divided on government position kaczynski explained that warsaw focused so much on the issue of voting rights , because the voting system would assume a new significance in the reformed european union . polish opposition politicians on the other hand appeared divided on the government ’ s position . while the liberal opposition seems to be leaning toward the government line that countries like poland should be given more voting power within the eu , the democratic left alliance pointed out the flaws of what it regards as kaczynski ’ s intransigence . left-wing opposition leader wojciech olejniczak believes that long-term strategic alliances with major european union partners should matter more than the square root voting system the polish government is pushing for . " looking for a compromise solution is a better way of building a country 's position than putting a spanner in the works , " he told dw-radio . according to other critics , kaczynski and his twin brother jaroslaw , who is prime minister , are reluctant to back down on the issue of voting rights because of their suspicion of germany ’ s motives . " the kaczynski brothers focus too much on the difficult history between poland and germany , which seems to cloud their vision of europe , " said european affairs analyst andrzej krajewski of the batory foundation . britain and netherlands have special demands too besides poland , britain and the netherlands have also set out their own demands .
britain insists that a charter of fundamental rights must not be legally binding and wants an opt-out on judicial and criminal matters , a position that is further complicated by the change in leadership from prime minister tony blair to gordon brown after the summit on june 27 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : change of leadership in britain from blair -lrb- left -rrb- to brown complicates matters the dutch are seeking stronger powers for national parliaments to send back eu draft legislation .

" if this summit fails , then it certainly will not be the fault of germany leading the negotiations , " he said , alluding to the impasse created by the polish position against the rest of the eu . " the double-majority system as defined within the constitutional treaty , we can not accept that , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told reporters after eu foreign ministers discussed negotiations for a new treaty reforming the bloc 's institutions . voting formula based on square root of population diplomats said fotyga 's tough 30-minute speech dashed hopes that warsaw was starting to soften its stance after the meeting between merkel and kaczynski . under the current reform , most eu decisions would require the support of 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the population .
poland , which has less than half of germany 's population , has proposed an alternative based on a mathematical square root of each country 's population . warsaw is cross that even a discussion of their alternative is off the table on merkel 's agenda at the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and dutch " no " votes in 2005 plunged the eu into crisis the poles , who are overwhelmingly catholic , insist that they are willing to compromise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 18.06.2007 human rights groups slam eu migration policies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unable to cope with desperate flow from africa , malta is turning its back on refugees europe 's mediterranean countries bear an unfair share of the refugee burden from africa , overwhelming their capacity to cope .
amnesty and others support an eu wide migration policy guided by humanitarian principles . malta , which joined the eu in 2004 , is now at the forefront of a battle against illegal immigration , as scores of desperate african migrants in fishing boats risk their lives to reach european shores . many migrants hope that if they make it from the libyan coast to the tiny mediterranean island , which is south of sicily , they can start a new life anywhere in the european union . malta , which has been the destination of more than 7,000 illegal refugees over the past few years , is refusing to accept any more newcomers now , leaving boatloads of africans either to their fate in the turbulent mediterranean waters or in detention camps behind barbed wire . on monday at a berlin symposium , the human rights organization amnesty international lambasted the european union for its failure to support malta in its struggle to deal with the human tide from the horn of africa . mediterranean countries unfairly burdened it is the southern rim of the eu that is feeling the strain – malta , spain and italy , countries which want the rest of the bloc to do their fair share in taking in the illegal immigrants . the spanish canary islands off the western coast of africa , a favorite holiday destination for german and british tourists , was inundated with more than 30,000 refugees last year .
and lampedusa , an italian island which is closer to tunisia than it is to mainland italy , has also been targeted by a continuous flow of migrants from countries such as senegal , mauritius or eritrea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugee in detention camps or left to fate at sea amnesty said that eu countries still have capacities for immigration and called for a european wide asylum policy guided by humanitarian principles . at last week 's meeting , the eu interior ministers brushed aside malta 's plea for a fair distribution of the immigrants among all eu member states .
fears in european capitals of a tidal wave from africa are unfounded however , speakers at the symposium said . number of asylum seekers dropped drastically the number of asylum-seekers in germany for example has dropped from more than 400,000 in the mid-1990s to merely 20,000 last year . there are huge capacities within the eu to absorb more people in need of help , according to richard williams of the human rights group european council for refugees in exile -lrb- ecre -rrb- , who called for an easing of immigration laws across europe . " we 've created an asylum system that is so harsh , where the chances of being detained are very high , where the chances of being refused asylum on spurious grounds are very high , and the chances of being sent back to a country where you do n't feel safe , are very high , " williams told dw-radio .
" people feel safer not to apply for asylum - to still come , but to remain underground . " the existing patchwork of national laws fosters illegal immigration , said peter altmaier , undersecretary in the german interior ministry in a radio interview .
at present there are 20 different national policies in the 27 member bloc , which apply very different treatment standards to refugees , but the european commission wants harmonized rules to be in place by 2010 . " we have to fight illegal immigration because these people are exploited by criminal organizations , " altmaier said .
" at the same time we have to offer perspectives for legal migration .
and we also need a very strong humanitarian signal that we can not allow people to die in the mediterranean sea . " eu interested in common asylum policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu needs a common migration policy the eu 's external border agency frontex will soon begin patrolling the waters off malta to rescue illegal immigrants , altmaier said .
however amnesty claimed that boat commanders are usually told to keep the refugees off territorial waters instead of guiding them safely ashore in europe .
although frontex has 100 vessels as well as 50 planes and helicopters at its disposal , the aid provided by its response team has been patchy . it is in the interest of the entire eu , not just the mediterranean rim 's " front line states " to absorb asylum seekers , according to williams .
many who have made it to italy 's shores for example , migrate further north anyway , and lodge applications for asylum status in more than a single eu country , a practice called " asylum shopping . " ecre 's williams argued that the free movement of people across the borders of most eu countries provided by the schengen accords means that common rules and safeguards on migration are vital . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

amnesty and others support an eu wide migration policy guided by humanitarian principles . malta , which joined the eu in 2004 , is now at the forefront of a battle against illegal immigration , as scores of desperate african migrants in fishing boats risk their lives to reach european shores . many migrants hope that if they make it from the libyan coast to the tiny mediterranean island , which is south of sicily , they can start a new life anywhere in the european union . malta , which has been the destination of more than 7,000 illegal refugees over the past few years , is refusing to accept any more newcomers now , leaving boatloads of africans either to their fate in the turbulent mediterranean waters or in detention camps behind barbed wire . on monday at a berlin symposium , the human rights organization amnesty international lambasted the european union for its failure to support malta in its struggle to deal with the human tide from the horn of africa . mediterranean countries unfairly burdened it is the southern rim of the eu that is feeling the strain – malta , spain and italy , countries which want the rest of the bloc to do their fair share in taking in the illegal immigrants . the spanish canary islands off the western coast of africa , a favorite holiday destination for german and british tourists , was inundated with more than 30,000 refugees last year .
and lampedusa , an italian island which is closer to tunisia than it is to mainland italy , has also been targeted by a continuous flow of migrants from countries such as senegal , mauritius or eritrea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugee in detention camps or left to fate at sea amnesty said that eu countries still have capacities for immigration and called for a european wide asylum policy guided by humanitarian principles . at last week 's meeting , the eu interior ministers brushed aside malta 's plea for a fair distribution of the immigrants among all eu member states .
fears in european capitals of a tidal wave from africa are unfounded however , speakers at the symposium said . number of asylum seekers dropped drastically the number of asylum-seekers in germany for example has dropped from more than 400,000 in the mid-1990s to merely 20,000 last year . there are huge capacities within the eu to absorb more people in need of help , according to richard williams of the human rights group european council for refugees in exile -lrb- ecre -rrb- , who called for an easing of immigration laws across europe . " we 've created an asylum system that is so harsh , where the chances of being detained are very high , where the chances of being refused asylum on spurious grounds are very high , and the chances of being sent back to a country where you do n't feel safe , are very high , " williams told dw-radio .
" people feel safer not to apply for asylum - to still come , but to remain underground . " the existing patchwork of national laws fosters illegal immigration , said peter altmaier , undersecretary in the german interior ministry in a radio interview .
at present there are 20 different national policies in the 27 member bloc , which apply very different treatment standards to refugees , but the european commission wants harmonized rules to be in place by 2010 . " we have to fight illegal immigration because these people are exploited by criminal organizations , " altmaier said .
" at the same time we have to offer perspectives for legal migration .
and we also need a very strong humanitarian signal that we can not allow people to die in the mediterranean sea . " eu interested in common asylum policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu needs a common migration policy the eu 's external border agency frontex will soon begin patrolling the waters off malta to rescue illegal immigrants , altmaier said .
however amnesty claimed that boat commanders are usually told to keep the refugees off territorial waters instead of guiding them safely ashore in europe .
although frontex has 100 vessels as well as 50 planes and helicopters at its disposal , the aid provided by its response team has been patchy . it is in the interest of the entire eu , not just the mediterranean rim 's " front line states " to absorb asylum seekers , according to williams .
many who have made it to italy 's shores for example , migrate further north anyway , and lodge applications for asylum status in more than a single eu country , a practice called " asylum shopping . " ecre 's williams argued that the free movement of people across the borders of most eu countries provided by the schengen accords means that common rules and safeguards on migration are vital . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the eu will resume normal relations with the palestinian authority immediately , " the bloc 's ministers said in a text of conclusions from a meeting in luxembourg . the eu partially froze ties with the palestinian government and suspended direct aid when hamas swept to power last year because the islamist movement figures on its blacklist of outlawed " terrorist " groups . the new emergency cabinet does not contain hamas members . the ministers said the eu would " resume direct financial support to the government , " as well as provide support to the palestinian civilian police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana in luxembourg monday it will also undertake " intensive efforts to build the institutions of the future palestinian state . " " part of the money will be direct , " eu foreign and security policy chief javier solana said at a meeting with eu foreign ministers in luxembourg monday .
but " in order to help the palestinian people in gaza , we will need some mechanism that can not be a direct support . "
eu funds would be distributed in gaza through united nations agencies or the eu 's current emergency aid system which sidelines hama leaders in the territory .
the eu chief diplomat did not give details of when the bloc would resume aid payments to the palestinian government . technical details being discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salam fayyad the eu has expressed its support for the emergency cabinet created by abbas .
last week , abbas dissolved the hamas-led unity government and declared a state of emergency .
the militant group launched an all-out assault on fatah 's security forces in gaza , taking complete control of the strip .
more than 100 people were killed in the clashes .
the emergency cabinet is led by former finance minister salam fayyad .
hamas has denounced the new cabinet as illegal .
the recent violence led to the creation of two separately zones : a hamas-ruled gaza and a fatah-controlled west bank .
the islamic militant group is black-listed as a terrorist organization by the eu and the united states .
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told reporters she was still discussing with fayyad the technical details of when and how aid flows would be re-established .
" we are of course ready to continue to work with fayyad in order to be ready in future to see how we can work directly with the emergency government , " ferrero-waldner said .
she said the eu was working closely with the palestinian authority to establish strict financial channels for the resumption of direct assistance .
financial controls on eu aid had to be clearly defined and very transparent , she insisted , adding : " we have to be very careful ... this is not just political but also technical . " humanitarian aid never stopped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas militants have taken over gaza despite the ban on direct assistance to the palestinian authority , european governments have been sending humanitarian aid to both gaza and the west bank .
officials said an estimated 700 million euros -lrb- $ 939 million -rrb- in such emergency aid was sent to gaza and the west bank last year .
the money was used to pay the salaries of teachers , doctors and health workers and for supplies of fuel , water and electricity to the territories .
once aid flows were re-established , ferrero-waldner said it would be up to fayyad to decide how funds were distributed in gaza .
both solana and ferrero-waldner voiced full confidence in the new palestinian premier , saying they trusted him and had known him for years . israel supports abbas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe suspended its direct aid because of hamas attending eu talks in luxembourg , israeli foreign minister tzipi livni said her government was ready to transfer blocked palestinian tax revenues to the palestinian government . " israel is going to work with abbas and fayyad to transfer the money , " said livni after talks with eu foreign ministers . livni said israel was " not looking for excuses " to delay the delivery of palestinian funds since it wanted to make a clear distinction between palestinian extremists like hamas and the moderate fatah movement of abbas and fayyad . livni did not indicate how much money would be transferred to the palestinians , but eu officials said israel owed up to 850 million dollars in blocked tax money to the palestinians . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier described the israeli move as " significant . " livni said the creation of the emergency palestinian government provided new opportunities for israeli-palestinian peace . isolating hamas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian supporters of hamas celebrate last week the us favors isolating hamas economically , diplomatically and militarily in the gaza strip .
some european diplomats have expressed misgivings about such a strategy .
" the international community does not want two palestinian states , otherwise it will be impossible to find a solution , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
russia wants the emergency cabinet to enter into a " broad dialogue " between all palestinian forces , including hamas . " moscow expects the new emergency cabinet to take all necessary measures to normalize the situation , improve the humanitarian situation ... and above all to halt inter-palestinian conflict , " according to a statement from the russian foreign ministry . " this requires the establishment of broad dialogue between all palestinian political forces including hamas , " the statement said . us also normalizes relations in washington , us secretary of state condoleezza rice meanwhile announced the us government was lifting a 15-month embargo on direct aid to the palestinian territories .
" we intend to lift our financial restrictions on the palestinian government , " she told reporters after meeting abbas in washington .

" the eu will resume normal relations with the palestinian authority immediately , " the bloc 's ministers said in a text of conclusions from a meeting in luxembourg . the eu partially froze ties with the palestinian government and suspended direct aid when hamas swept to power last year because the islamist movement figures on its blacklist of outlawed " terrorist " groups . the new emergency cabinet does not contain hamas members . the ministers said the eu would " resume direct financial support to the government , " as well as provide support to the palestinian civilian police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana in luxembourg monday it will also undertake " intensive efforts to build the institutions of the future palestinian state . " " part of the money will be direct , " eu foreign and security policy chief javier solana said at a meeting with eu foreign ministers in luxembourg monday .
but " in order to help the palestinian people in gaza , we will need some mechanism that can not be a direct support . "
eu funds would be distributed in gaza through united nations agencies or the eu 's current emergency aid system which sidelines hama leaders in the territory .
the eu chief diplomat did not give details of when the bloc would resume aid payments to the palestinian government . technical details being discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salam fayyad the eu has expressed its support for the emergency cabinet created by abbas .
last week , abbas dissolved the hamas-led unity government and declared a state of emergency .
the militant group launched an all-out assault on fatah 's security forces in gaza , taking complete control of the strip .
more than 100 people were killed in the clashes .
the emergency cabinet is led by former finance minister salam fayyad .
hamas has denounced the new cabinet as illegal .
the recent violence led to the creation of two separately zones : a hamas-ruled gaza and a fatah-controlled west bank .
the islamic militant group is black-listed as a terrorist organization by the eu and the united states .
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told reporters she was still discussing with fayyad the technical details of when and how aid flows would be re-established .
" we are of course ready to continue to work with fayyad in order to be ready in future to see how we can work directly with the emergency government , " ferrero-waldner said .
she said the eu was working closely with the palestinian authority to establish strict financial channels for the resumption of direct assistance .
financial controls on eu aid had to be clearly defined and very transparent , she insisted , adding : " we have to be very careful ... this is not just political but also technical . " humanitarian aid never stopped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas militants have taken over gaza despite the ban on direct assistance to the palestinian authority , european governments have been sending humanitarian aid to both gaza and the west bank .
officials said an estimated 700 million euros -lrb- $ 939 million -rrb- in such emergency aid was sent to gaza and the west bank last year .
the money was used to pay the salaries of teachers , doctors and health workers and for supplies of fuel , water and electricity to the territories .
once aid flows were re-established , ferrero-waldner said it would be up to fayyad to decide how funds were distributed in gaza .
both solana and ferrero-waldner voiced full confidence in the new palestinian premier , saying they trusted him and had known him for years . israel supports abbas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe suspended its direct aid because of hamas attending eu talks in luxembourg , israeli foreign minister tzipi livni said her government was ready to transfer blocked palestinian tax revenues to the palestinian government . " israel is going to work with abbas and fayyad to transfer the money , " said livni after talks with eu foreign ministers . livni said israel was " not looking for excuses " to delay the delivery of palestinian funds since it wanted to make a clear distinction between palestinian extremists like hamas and the moderate fatah movement of abbas and fayyad . livni did not indicate how much money would be transferred to the palestinians , but eu officials said israel owed up to 850 million dollars in blocked tax money to the palestinians . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier described the israeli move as " significant . " livni said the creation of the emergency palestinian government provided new opportunities for israeli-palestinian peace . isolating hamas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian supporters of hamas celebrate last week the us favors isolating hamas economically , diplomatically and militarily in the gaza strip .

amnesty and others support an eu wide migration policy guided by humanitarian principles . malta , which joined the eu in 2004 , is now at the forefront of a battle against illegal immigration , as scores of desperate african migrants in fishing boats risk their lives to reach european shores . many migrants hope that if they make it from the libyan coast to the tiny mediterranean island , which is south of sicily , they can start a new life anywhere in the european union . malta , which has been the destination of more than 7,000 illegal refugees over the past few years , is refusing to accept any more newcomers now , leaving boatloads of africans either to their fate in the turbulent mediterranean waters or in detention camps behind barbed wire . on monday at a berlin symposium , the human rights organization amnesty international lambasted the european union for its failure to support malta in its struggle to deal with the human tide from the horn of africa . mediterranean countries unfairly burdened it is the southern rim of the eu that is feeling the strain – malta , spain and italy , countries which want the rest of the bloc to do their fair share in taking in the illegal immigrants . the spanish canary islands off the western coast of africa , a favorite holiday destination for german and british tourists , was inundated with more than 30,000 refugees last year .
and lampedusa , an italian island which is closer to tunisia than it is to mainland italy , has also been targeted by a continuous flow of migrants from countries such as senegal , mauritius or eritrea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugee in detention camps or left to fate at sea amnesty said that eu countries still have capacities for immigration and called for a european wide asylum policy guided by humanitarian principles . at last week 's meeting , the eu interior ministers brushed aside malta 's plea for a fair distribution of the immigrants among all eu member states .
fears in european capitals of a tidal wave from africa are unfounded however , speakers at the symposium said . number of asylum seekers dropped drastically the number of asylum-seekers in germany for example has dropped from more than 400,000 in the mid-1990s to merely 20,000 last year . there are huge capacities within the eu to absorb more people in need of help , according to richard williams of the human rights group european council for refugees in exile -lrb- ecre -rrb- , who called for an easing of immigration laws across europe . " we 've created an asylum system that is so harsh , where the chances of being detained are very high , where the chances of being refused asylum on spurious grounds are very high , and the chances of being sent back to a country where you do n't feel safe , are very high , " williams told dw-radio .
" people feel safer not to apply for asylum - to still come , but to remain underground . " the existing patchwork of national laws fosters illegal immigration , said peter altmaier , undersecretary in the german interior ministry in a radio interview .
at present there are 20 different national policies in the 27 member bloc , which apply very different treatment standards to refugees , but the european commission wants harmonized rules to be in place by 2010 . " we have to fight illegal immigration because these people are exploited by criminal organizations , " altmaier said .
" at the same time we have to offer perspectives for legal migration .
and we also need a very strong humanitarian signal that we can not allow people to die in the mediterranean sea . " eu interested in common asylum policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu needs a common migration policy the eu 's external border agency frontex will soon begin patrolling the waters off malta to rescue illegal immigrants , altmaier said .
however amnesty claimed that boat commanders are usually told to keep the refugees off territorial waters instead of guiding them safely ashore in europe .
although frontex has 100 vessels as well as 50 planes and helicopters at its disposal , the aid provided by its response team has been patchy . it is in the interest of the entire eu , not just the mediterranean rim 's " front line states " to absorb asylum seekers , according to williams .
many who have made it to italy 's shores for example , migrate further north anyway , and lodge applications for asylum status in more than a single eu country , a practice called " asylum shopping . " ecre 's williams argued that the free movement of people across the borders of most eu countries provided by the schengen accords means that common rules and safeguards on migration are vital . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we 've created an asylum system that is so harsh , where the chances of being detained are very high , where the chances of being refused asylum on spurious grounds are very high , and the chances of being sent back to a country where you do n't feel safe , are very high , " williams told dw-radio .
" people feel safer not to apply for asylum - to still come , but to remain underground . " the existing patchwork of national laws fosters illegal immigration , said peter altmaier , undersecretary in the german interior ministry in a radio interview .
at present there are 20 different national policies in the 27 member bloc , which apply very different treatment standards to refugees , but the european commission wants harmonized rules to be in place by 2010 . " we have to fight illegal immigration because these people are exploited by criminal organizations , " altmaier said .
" at the same time we have to offer perspectives for legal migration .

although frontex has 100 vessels as well as 50 planes and helicopters at its disposal , the aid provided by its response team has been patchy . it is in the interest of the entire eu , not just the mediterranean rim 's " front line states " to absorb asylum seekers , according to williams .
many who have made it to italy 's shores for example , migrate further north anyway , and lodge applications for asylum status in more than a single eu country , a practice called " asylum shopping .

after 12 laps , he emerged from his mercedes s triumphantly , hands bloody and feet burned from the hilly , technical track . racer jackie stewart once famously called it " the green hell . "

the track was also famous for nearly killing austrian formula one champion niki lauda in 1976 .
lauda 's car swerved off the track at nürburgring , rolled , hit another car and burst into flames .
lauda , trapped inside the car , suffered severe burns on his face , later fell into a coma and nearly died .
the next year , the license for formula one racing was n't renewed .
it returned in 1984 only to move to hockenheim a year later .
formula one returned in 1995 . schumacher brings in fans nürburgring found its current popularity thanks , in part , to german racer michael schumacher .

he won seven world titles , five with ferrari .
his talents sparked an unprecedented formula one madness in germany in the early 1990s .
schumacher retired last year .
since 1994 , 100 million euros -lrb- $ 133 million -rrb- have been invested in nürburgring .
by 2009 another 150 million euros will go into improvements , according to media reports .

survivors said the children were forced to stay in the building to act as " human shields " for militants suspected to be there .
is there any proof the taliban acts in this way ? citha d. maass : naturally , there is no proof , but time and again over the last few months we have received reports that the taliban uses this tactic .
it is certainly a part of the taliban 's tactics , and that creates an enormous dilemma for nato 's isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- troops since they ca n't get the children out and keep the taliban inside . nato has recently announced that fewer civilians would become victims of the conflict in afghanistan .
how can that be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has some 3,000 soldiers stationed as part of nato forces in afghanistan civilian casualties can not be completely avoided when these types of guerilla tactics are used .
it is really always a balance of proportionality .
are you willing pay the price or should you avoid it ?
when there is secure information available that there really are important taliban members , it is more likely that the order for an air strike is given than if you have solid tips that only nominal members are concerned .
the more civilian victims there are the more upset the population becomes about the isaf troops . what exactly happens when an attack kills civilians ? part of the taliban 's tactics is to incite resentment and anger that can then be shown in demonstrations aimed at the isaf troops or in protests against support of civilian reconstruction .
you can try to clarify the situation for the population , but that , of course , is only possible in a relatively minor way .
in the end , the taliban probably have more leverage . does that mean that the tactic of using " human shields " seriously endangers the international soldiers ' mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters rely on guerrilla tactics to match nato 's military might yes .
that 's the intent of this asymmetrical guerrilla tactic .
on one hand are the well-armed isaf military troops and on the other are guerrilla fighters like the taliban who , with the help of " civilian shields " and suicide attacks , conduct pinprick attacks .
they are trying to unsettle the isaf troops and to stir up the population 's mood against the international troops . according to nato diplomats , soldiers in the operation enduring freedom are mainly responsible for the civilian casualties .
is there a possibility that isaf troops are being more careful ? isaf has a different mandate - a different way of operating .
but we have to take a special look at the south - and that is the area that is most affected - and how the two groups work together .
the isaf troops do not have any air support of their own .
that means when they get into an ambush they have to order air support for their own defense .
this comes from the americans , who are operating under the enduring freedom mandate .
that makes it impossible to say who acts how .
instead it 's simply a compound approach in which the air attack comes from enduring freedom planes .
when an isaf patrol ends up in an ambush it naturally tries to get free , that 's the nature of the situation , and in such a case both units of soldiers are connected . you said that civilian casualties can not be completely avoided , that you have to consider them against the benefits in each case .
is n't that cynical when people 's lives are being sacrificed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tornado warplanes are being used to find taliban outposts no , the isaf side has recognized that the taliban is using this tactic to stir up the population against the international troops .
because of that they have become more and more careful .
but the casualties can not be fundamentally avoided because they are part of guerrilla tactics .
i would definitely not call it cynical , because i am sure in every case there is a careful consideration of whether or not to attack .
such an attack can both protect the international troops and at the same time destroy a religious school where taliban troops barricaded themselves . in an interview with deutsche welle , secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said that nato is " in a different moral category " than the taliban .
do people in afghanistan also see it that way ? i doubt that because the people who are in southern afghanistan , which is economically weak after several years of drought , are fighting to survive .

survivors said the children were forced to stay in the building to act as " human shields " for militants suspected to be there .
is there any proof the taliban acts in this way ? citha d. maass : naturally , there is no proof , but time and again over the last few months we have received reports that the taliban uses this tactic .
it is certainly a part of the taliban 's tactics , and that creates an enormous dilemma for nato 's isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- troops since they ca n't get the children out and keep the taliban inside . nato has recently announced that fewer civilians would become victims of the conflict in afghanistan .
how can that be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has some 3,000 soldiers stationed as part of nato forces in afghanistan civilian casualties can not be completely avoided when these types of guerilla tactics are used .
it is really always a balance of proportionality .
are you willing pay the price or should you avoid it ?
when there is secure information available that there really are important taliban members , it is more likely that the order for an air strike is given than if you have solid tips that only nominal members are concerned .
the more civilian victims there are the more upset the population becomes about the isaf troops . what exactly happens when an attack kills civilians ? part of the taliban 's tactics is to incite resentment and anger that can then be shown in demonstrations aimed at the isaf troops or in protests against support of civilian reconstruction .
you can try to clarify the situation for the population , but that , of course , is only possible in a relatively minor way .
in the end , the taliban probably have more leverage . does that mean that the tactic of using " human shields " seriously endangers the international soldiers ' mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters rely on guerrilla tactics to match nato 's military might yes .
that 's the intent of this asymmetrical guerrilla tactic .
on one hand are the well-armed isaf military troops and on the other are guerrilla fighters like the taliban who , with the help of " civilian shields " and suicide attacks , conduct pinprick attacks .
they are trying to unsettle the isaf troops and to stir up the population 's mood against the international troops . according to nato diplomats , soldiers in the operation enduring freedom are mainly responsible for the civilian casualties .
is there a possibility that isaf troops are being more careful ? isaf has a different mandate - a different way of operating .
but we have to take a special look at the south - and that is the area that is most affected - and how the two groups work together .
the isaf troops do not have any air support of their own .
that means when they get into an ambush they have to order air support for their own defense .
this comes from the americans , who are operating under the enduring freedom mandate .
that makes it impossible to say who acts how .
instead it 's simply a compound approach in which the air attack comes from enduring freedom planes .
when an isaf patrol ends up in an ambush it naturally tries to get free , that 's the nature of the situation , and in such a case both units of soldiers are connected . you said that civilian casualties can not be completely avoided , that you have to consider them against the benefits in each case .
is n't that cynical when people 's lives are being sacrificed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tornado warplanes are being used to find taliban outposts no , the isaf side has recognized that the taliban is using this tactic to stir up the population against the international troops .
because of that they have become more and more careful .
but the casualties can not be fundamentally avoided because they are part of guerrilla tactics .
i would definitely not call it cynical , because i am sure in every case there is a careful consideration of whether or not to attack .
such an attack can both protect the international troops and at the same time destroy a religious school where taliban troops barricaded themselves . in an interview with deutsche welle , secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said that nato is " in a different moral category " than the taliban .
do people in afghanistan also see it that way ? i doubt that because the people who are in southern afghanistan , which is economically weak after several years of drought , are fighting to survive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 18.06.2007 women still face uphill battle in business world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women only make up eight percent of managerial posts in europe a recent high-powered summit in berlin to improve women 's economic opportunities amid intense global competition underlined the dearth of female representatives in boardrooms across europe . women in european countries to date still constitute only eight percent of managerial positions , according to the european women ’ s network . speaking at the 17th global summit of women that took place in berlin last week , mirrella visser , a president of the european women ’ s network said she is the first women to be on a company board in the netherlands . however , other male members of the board sometimes intimidate her , she said .
" maybe these men do this to me because they do not believe in women making decisions . " according to research revealed at the summit , the netherlands and the united kingdom are the two countries that have the highest percentage of women in decision-making positions . visser said it remains hard for women to climb the career ladder since unlike other countries , " the netherlands does not have a legislator that could back women up and to get to the top , you have to be on your own . " " davos for women " the challenges facing women in the business world was one of the core themes of the summit which is also known as the " davos for women . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian president vaira vike-freiberga took part in the summit an annual occurrence , the three-day meeting this time drew over 1,000 female government and business leaders - most of them top corporate executives - from 95 countries .
participants included latvian president , vaira vike-freiberga and vice president of microsoft usa , gerri elliot . irene natividad , president of the summit said the meet allows women across borders , disciplines and cultures to learn from each other in their ongoing work towards economic equity . " sustainability and growth in our global economy would be unthinkable without women " natividad said . she admitted that there were n't enough women in top managerial positions and emphasized the need to change the mind-set of both men and women . " many corporate leaders still view the inclusion of women board directors as a matter of political correctness or as a form of affirmative action to address past inequities . "
she said both views are misguided approaches that merely entrench opposition to diversifying corporate boardrooms . women as stakeholders experts point out that companies can ill-afford to shut out women from decision-making positions given that women are increasingly turning important stakeholders enabling firms to better compete globally . " they -lrb- women -rrb- constitute 50 percent of the world ’ s workers , run over 40 percent of small businesses and make 80 percent of consumer buying decisions , " said natividad . the summit threw up a host of ideas to help ease the way for women aspiring to managerial levels and positions of power in the business world . some pointed out that corporate power circles still remains a boys ' club .
mirrella visser said that male networking is always the easier way to get there . she emphasized that " women need to market themselves and create a network with men who are in decision-making -lrb- positions -rrb- because when there is a position up there , they will recommend them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men have it easier making it to the top of the corporate world jacqueline ford , an executive with ibm in the us - which has more women in managerial positions than any other country - said more has to be done to change the mindset of societies in accepting women as equal partners in the corporate world as well as creating legislation to help smooth the path . " women who are in government decision making should advocate for laws that could help women to reach to the top managerial positions , " ford said . germany lags behind in europe according to the study published during the summit , german companies tend to have the lowest number of women in managerial positions in western europe . susan unger , senior vice president and chief information officer at daimler chrysler and one of the few german women executives said one of the main barriers faced by german women is juggling family and work . " women have to work and take care of their families , so it is not easy for them to do both efficiently .
companies have to cater for women and help create infrastructure that could help in the know how technology , " unger said . unger , who has been working for the carmaker for 35 years , pointed out that daimler chrysler has created 350 children ’ s day care centers for employees , especially women . " the initiative is to relieve the heavy burden from women , " she said , adding that women too had a role to play if they were aiming for the top .
women must contribute by empowering themselves with well advanced skills and must network with role models and mentors , unger said .
she also urged big companies to recognize women ’ s capability and strengths when making top appointments . " it ’ s a long and tough road , but as germans we must initiate for change , " she said . mathapeli ramonotsi send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 18.06.2007 poles threaten to derail major summit on new eu treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the poles ' love affair with the eu coming to an end ?
eu member states have agreed to drop symbolic elements of the new treaty , but a meeting of german and polish leaders over the weekend failed to resolve an impasse over the bloc 's voting structure . when chancellor angela merkel convenes an eu summit on a new slimmed-down treaty towards the end of germany 's six-month rotating presidency on thursday and friday , the 27 member states are expected to be split into three broad camps .
merkel wants to establish a road map for the conference to adopt a new eu treaty . first , there are 22 countries , which are in favor of the defunct constitution that was ratified already by 18 members .
the next group are euro-skeptic countries such as britain and the czech republic , which would have likely voted against the old document , but never got around to casting their ballots after it was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 . and then there are the poles , in a camp of their own .
at issue is the eu ’ s reformed voting structure in which each member state carries a certain weight based on their population base .
the poles argue that the current double voting structure gives disproportionate power to large eu countries , such as germany , and that merkel is acting in her country ’ s national interest , instead of speaking for the entire bloc . eu summit could collapse due to polish position merkel , who met with polish president lech kaczynski this past weekend , said she could not rule out the possibility that the brussels summit could collapse because of the polish position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks over weekend between poland 's kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and merkel stalled " i can only say that it was a very open discussion , but in this matter the positions have not changed , " said merkel . merkel rejected poland 's demand that talks on voting procedures be reopened , saying it was better to leave the agreement , which was reached after long and tough negotiations between all member states , in place . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said he backed merkel 's position in the stand-off .
" if this summit fails , then it certainly will not be the fault of germany leading the negotiations , " he said , alluding to the impasse created by the polish position against the rest of the eu . " the double-majority system as defined within the constitutional treaty , we can not accept that , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told reporters after eu foreign ministers discussed negotiations for a new treaty reforming the bloc 's institutions . voting formula based on square root of population diplomats said fotyga 's tough 30-minute speech dashed hopes that warsaw was starting to soften its stance after the meeting between merkel and kaczynski . under the current reform , most eu decisions would require the support of 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the population .
poland , which has less than half of germany 's population , has proposed an alternative based on a mathematical square root of each country 's population . warsaw is cross that even a discussion of their alternative is off the table on merkel 's agenda at the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and dutch " no " votes in 2005 plunged the eu into crisis the poles , who are overwhelmingly catholic , insist that they are willing to compromise .
for instance , they are willing to drop references to a christian god enshrined in the treaty , which was another bone of contention , but that accepting the " double majority " system of voting , which they threaten to veto , would be a going a step too far . poles divided on government position kaczynski explained that warsaw focused so much on the issue of voting rights , because the voting system would assume a new significance in the reformed european union . polish opposition politicians on the other hand appeared divided on the government ’ s position . while the liberal opposition seems to be leaning toward the government line that countries like poland should be given more voting power within the eu , the democratic left alliance pointed out the flaws of what it regards as kaczynski ’ s intransigence . left-wing opposition leader wojciech olejniczak believes that long-term strategic alliances with major european union partners should matter more than the square root voting system the polish government is pushing for . " looking for a compromise solution is a better way of building a country 's position than putting a spanner in the works , " he told dw-radio . according to other critics , kaczynski and his twin brother jaroslaw , who is prime minister , are reluctant to back down on the issue of voting rights because of their suspicion of germany ’ s motives . " the kaczynski brothers focus too much on the difficult history between poland and germany , which seems to cloud their vision of europe , " said european affairs analyst andrzej krajewski of the batory foundation . britain and netherlands have special demands too besides poland , britain and the netherlands have also set out their own demands .
britain insists that a charter of fundamental rights must not be legally binding and wants an opt-out on judicial and criminal matters , a position that is further complicated by the change in leadership from prime minister tony blair to gordon brown after the summit on june 27 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : change of leadership in britain from blair -lrb- left -rrb- to brown complicates matters the dutch are seeking stronger powers for national parliaments to send back eu draft legislation .
france , which voted against the constitution , and spain , which had already approved it in a referendum , made a joint appeal for a quick , simplified treaty . agreement on a revised treaty at the summit could lift the eu out of its torpor and boost merkel ’ s standing in europe .
but another failure could plunge the bloc into a deeper crisis and institutional gridlock .
it could mean a two-speed europe in which some countries would advance ahead anyway , leaving the naysayers behind . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said some of the most objectionable differences , which are largely symbolic , had been overcome , such as calling the new document an amended treaty as opposed to " constitution . "
beethoven 's " ode to joy " and the eu flag with gold stars against a royal blue background for example , would not be formally enscrined in the new treaty . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that said , the international community should avoid taking sides in palestine 's internal power struggle , says deutsche welle 's rainer sollich . everyone supports mahmoud abbas : the united states , the united nations and the european union .
israel also sets big hopes on the palestinian president after the military victory of hamas in the gaza strip .
as far as the current situation goes , abbas has earned this broad support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer sollich the violent frenzy of the hamas fighters in the gaza strip can not be excused as a justifiable protest against discrimination or corruption - it is a coup against political institutions .
hamas has deepened the split of the palestinian nation .
and hamas has made the population of the gaza strip hostage to a policy that could drive the region to increasingly hopeless isolation and poverty .
a future without hamas ?
in this situation , it seems unlikely that the international community will completely abandon the palestinians .
the lifting of the embargo put in place a year and a half ago after the election victory of hamas now seems feasible for the west bank .
that would clearly strengthen abbas and his moderate course vis-à-vis israel .
and it is also a clear show of faith for the new , hamas-free transitional cabinet under the existing palestinian finance minister salam fayyad .
israel 's prime minster ehud olmert can already imagine a peace treaty " without hamas . "
this position has takers in both the us and europe .
but caution is warranted .
hamas is and remains a considerable power factor with popularity beyond the gaza strip .
after all , the islamists won the last elections with an absolute majority and in this case justifiably demanded a share of power .
preventing humanitarian disaster the international community is presented with a difficult challenge : it should never accept terror or the hamas-declared goal of destroying israel .
but the international community should also not take sides in an internal palestinian power struggle .
apart from strengthening abbas , steps should be taken to make contact with moderate powers within hamas and to assist them if necessary .
there 's no disputing that an abbas-controlled west bank would be the better model for a future palestinian state and should be treated and supported accordingly .
but at the same time , it 's important to avoid allowing the gaza strip to drift completely into a humanitarian disaster . the people there should not be punished for failed hamas policies .
that would only lead to further radicalization and violence .

another 22 seats went to the ump 's centrist allies . sarkozy 's party had been expected to score a " blue wave " landslide after his stunning presidential election win in may .
but amid a low turnout , the socialist party made a surprise comeback , jumping from 149 to 185 seats . the ump had 359 seats in the old assembly .
prime minister francois fillon said voters had given sarkozy " a majority to act " by handing his right-wing party control of the parliament . turnout for the decisive second round vote was 59.99 percent , far short of the near 85-percent turnout in the april-may presidential vote . " a clear and coherent choice " in an embarrassing blow to sarkozy , former prime minister alain juppe failed to win a seat in his bordeaux stronghold and resigned as environment superminister and government number two . sarkozy , 52 , had brought the 61-year-old juppe back from political exile after his conviction in a party finance scandal and given him one of the most prominent portfolios in his right-wing government . but economy minister jean-louis borloo said the government had scored a " historic success " in becoming the first ruling party since 1978 to retain control of the national assembly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister francois fillon prime minister francois fillon said france had " made a clear and coherent choice " by giving sarkozy " a majority to act . " " you voted for change , well that is going to be a reality .
we will challenge the habits and taboos that hold our country back , " fillon said . " the time for elections is over , now is the time for coming together , now is the time for action . " no blue wave but socialist party leader francois hollande highlighted his party 's gains .
" the blue wave that was announced and was set to sweep did not take place , " he said .
he said the left 's showing would mean there will be " diversity and pluralism " in the new parliament . the socialists had warned voters of a huge ump majority in parliament would lead to a dangerous concentration of powers and turn the legislature into an annex of sarkozy 's presidency . hollande said the result was the sign of voter unease with " unjust measures " planned by the government , including a possible a hike in value-added tax rates to fund healthcare costs .
but the socialist gains were not expected to bury the party 's problems after three successive defeats in presidential elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal and hollande have separated after nearly 30 years even as they welcomed the better-than-expected showing , socialists were jolted by the news that royal and hollande , her partner of nearly 30 years , had separated . royal accused hollande of having an affair in interviews for a book to be released this week and asked that he no longer be described as her partner , though she did not specify when the break-up happened . a new era of french politics despite the much-reduced majority , the ump still became the first french governing party since 1978 to retain its majority in the lower house . one month after taking over from jacques chirac , sarkozy had asked for a strong majority in support of his campaign pledge to modernise french government , kick-start the economy and toughen up crime and immigration laws . a special session of the new parliament will open on june 26 to examine the first bills to reduce taxation , encourage overtime , grant universities more autonomy , tighten immigration and toughen sentences for repeat offenders . sunday 's vote was marked by low turnout as french voters - heading to the polls for the fourth time in two months - cast the last ballots in an election season that has ushered in a new era of politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rachida dati , france 's new justice minister sarkozy , the 52-year-old son of a hungarian immigrant , has appointed a broad-based government in which prominent leftist bernard kouchner is foreign minister and the first woman of north-african origin , rachida dati , was named justice minister . more politicians from the left and from minorities were expected to be appointed to junior ministries following sunday 's result , as part of sarkozy 's vaunted policy of openness . " yes , but of the french " the conservative le figaro called the results of sunday 's vote the " yes , but of the french " to sarkozy 's reforms in the headline to its story . " what happened yesterday was certainly not a defeat for nicolas sarkozy because nicolas sarkozy has a clear majority , but it certainly is a warning , " wrote the paper . le figaro said the gains made by the socialists from the first round of voting one week ago " ... is ample proof that if the french have adopted the idea of reform they are n't ready to accept those which have n't been amply considered ... " the left-wing liberation was more dramatic about the socialist gains . " the right-wing takes a left hook , " screamed the daily 's headline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois bayrou other left-wing parties picked up 41 seats between them , with 15 going to the communist party and four to the green party . the nationalist movement for france took one seat , but the main far-right national front won no seats . francois bayrou , who formed a new centrist party to build on his strong third-place showing in the presidential elections , took one of three seats won by his democratic movement . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but amid a low turnout , the socialist party made a surprise comeback , jumping from 149 to 185 seats . the ump had 359 seats in the old assembly .
prime minister francois fillon said voters had given sarkozy " a majority to act " by handing his right-wing party control of the parliament . turnout for the decisive second round vote was 59.99 percent , far short of the near 85-percent turnout in the april-may presidential vote . " a clear and coherent choice " in an embarrassing blow to sarkozy , former prime minister alain juppe failed to win a seat in his bordeaux stronghold and resigned as environment superminister and government number two . sarkozy , 52 , had brought the 61-year-old juppe back from political exile after his conviction in a party finance scandal and given him one of the most prominent portfolios in his right-wing government . but economy minister jean-louis borloo said the government had scored a " historic success " in becoming the first ruling party since 1978 to retain control of the national assembly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister francois fillon prime minister francois fillon said france had " made a clear and coherent choice " by giving sarkozy " a majority to act . " " you voted for change , well that is going to be a reality .
we will challenge the habits and taboos that hold our country back , " fillon said . " the time for elections is over , now is the time for coming together , now is the time for action . " no blue wave but socialist party leader francois hollande highlighted his party 's gains .
" the blue wave that was announced and was set to sweep did not take place , " he said .
he said the left 's showing would mean there will be " diversity and pluralism " in the new parliament . the socialists had warned voters of a huge ump majority in parliament would lead to a dangerous concentration of powers and turn the legislature into an annex of sarkozy 's presidency . hollande said the result was the sign of voter unease with " unjust measures " planned by the government , including a possible a hike in value-added tax rates to fund healthcare costs .
but the socialist gains were not expected to bury the party 's problems after three successive defeats in presidential elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal and hollande have separated after nearly 30 years even as they welcomed the better-than-expected showing , socialists were jolted by the news that royal and hollande , her partner of nearly 30 years , had separated . royal accused hollande of having an affair in interviews for a book to be released this week and asked that he no longer be described as her partner , though she did not specify when the break-up happened . a new era of french politics despite the much-reduced majority , the ump still became the first french governing party since 1978 to retain its majority in the lower house . one month after taking over from jacques chirac , sarkozy had asked for a strong majority in support of his campaign pledge to modernise french government , kick-start the economy and toughen up crime and immigration laws . a special session of the new parliament will open on june 26 to examine the first bills to reduce taxation , encourage overtime , grant universities more autonomy , tighten immigration and toughen sentences for repeat offenders . sunday 's vote was marked by low turnout as french voters - heading to the polls for the fourth time in two months - cast the last ballots in an election season that has ushered in a new era of politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rachida dati , france 's new justice minister sarkozy , the 52-year-old son of a hungarian immigrant , has appointed a broad-based government in which prominent leftist bernard kouchner is foreign minister and the first woman of north-african origin , rachida dati , was named justice minister . more politicians from the left and from minorities were expected to be appointed to junior ministries following sunday 's result , as part of sarkozy 's vaunted policy of openness . " yes , but of the french " the conservative le figaro called the results of sunday 's vote the " yes , but of the french " to sarkozy 's reforms in the headline to its story . " what happened yesterday was certainly not a defeat for nicolas sarkozy because nicolas sarkozy has a clear majority , but it certainly is a warning , " wrote the paper . le figaro said the gains made by the socialists from the first round of voting one week ago " ... is ample proof that if the french have adopted the idea of reform they are n't ready to accept those which have n't been amply considered ... " the left-wing liberation was more dramatic about the socialist gains . " the right-wing takes a left hook , " screamed the daily 's headline .

more than 100 people were killed in the clashes .

" the eu will resume normal relations with the palestinian authority immediately , " the bloc 's ministers said in a text of conclusions from a meeting in luxembourg . the eu partially froze ties with the palestinian government and suspended direct aid when hamas swept to power last year because the islamist movement figures on its blacklist of outlawed " terrorist " groups . the new emergency cabinet does not contain hamas members . the ministers said the eu would " resume direct financial support to the government , " as well as provide support to the palestinian civilian police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana in luxembourg monday it will also undertake " intensive efforts to build the institutions of the future palestinian state . " " part of the money will be direct , " eu foreign and security policy chief javier solana said at a meeting with eu foreign ministers in luxembourg monday .
but " in order to help the palestinian people in gaza , we will need some mechanism that can not be a direct support . "
eu funds would be distributed in gaza through united nations agencies or the eu 's current emergency aid system which sidelines hama leaders in the territory .
the eu chief diplomat did not give details of when the bloc would resume aid payments to the palestinian government . technical details being discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salam fayyad the eu has expressed its support for the emergency cabinet created by abbas .
last week , abbas dissolved the hamas-led unity government and declared a state of emergency .
the militant group launched an all-out assault on fatah 's security forces in gaza , taking complete control of the strip .
more than 100 people were killed in the clashes .
the emergency cabinet is led by former finance minister salam fayyad .
hamas has denounced the new cabinet as illegal .
the recent violence led to the creation of two separately zones : a hamas-ruled gaza and a fatah-controlled west bank .
the islamic militant group is black-listed as a terrorist organization by the eu and the united states .
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told reporters she was still discussing with fayyad the technical details of when and how aid flows would be re-established .
" we are of course ready to continue to work with fayyad in order to be ready in future to see how we can work directly with the emergency government , " ferrero-waldner said .
she said the eu was working closely with the palestinian authority to establish strict financial channels for the resumption of direct assistance .
financial controls on eu aid had to be clearly defined and very transparent , she insisted , adding : " we have to be very careful ... this is not just political but also technical . " humanitarian aid never stopped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas militants have taken over gaza despite the ban on direct assistance to the palestinian authority , european governments have been sending humanitarian aid to both gaza and the west bank .
officials said an estimated 700 million euros -lrb- $ 939 million -rrb- in such emergency aid was sent to gaza and the west bank last year .
the money was used to pay the salaries of teachers , doctors and health workers and for supplies of fuel , water and electricity to the territories .
once aid flows were re-established , ferrero-waldner said it would be up to fayyad to decide how funds were distributed in gaza .
both solana and ferrero-waldner voiced full confidence in the new palestinian premier , saying they trusted him and had known him for years . israel supports abbas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe suspended its direct aid because of hamas attending eu talks in luxembourg , israeli foreign minister tzipi livni said her government was ready to transfer blocked palestinian tax revenues to the palestinian government . " israel is going to work with abbas and fayyad to transfer the money , " said livni after talks with eu foreign ministers . livni said israel was " not looking for excuses " to delay the delivery of palestinian funds since it wanted to make a clear distinction between palestinian extremists like hamas and the moderate fatah movement of abbas and fayyad . livni did not indicate how much money would be transferred to the palestinians , but eu officials said israel owed up to 850 million dollars in blocked tax money to the palestinians . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier described the israeli move as " significant . " livni said the creation of the emergency palestinian government provided new opportunities for israeli-palestinian peace . isolating hamas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian supporters of hamas celebrate last week the us favors isolating hamas economically , diplomatically and militarily in the gaza strip .
some european diplomats have expressed misgivings about such a strategy .
" the international community does not want two palestinian states , otherwise it will be impossible to find a solution , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
russia wants the emergency cabinet to enter into a " broad dialogue " between all palestinian forces , including hamas . " moscow expects the new emergency cabinet to take all necessary measures to normalize the situation , improve the humanitarian situation ... and above all to halt inter-palestinian conflict , " according to a statement from the russian foreign ministry .

that said , the international community should avoid taking sides in palestine 's internal power struggle , says deutsche welle 's rainer sollich . everyone supports mahmoud abbas : the united states , the united nations and the european union .
israel also sets big hopes on the palestinian president after the military victory of hamas in the gaza strip .
as far as the current situation goes , abbas has earned this broad support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer sollich the violent frenzy of the hamas fighters in the gaza strip can not be excused as a justifiable protest against discrimination or corruption - it is a coup against political institutions .
hamas has deepened the split of the palestinian nation .
and hamas has made the population of the gaza strip hostage to a policy that could drive the region to increasingly hopeless isolation and poverty .
a future without hamas ?
in this situation , it seems unlikely that the international community will completely abandon the palestinians .
the lifting of the embargo put in place a year and a half ago after the election victory of hamas now seems feasible for the west bank .
that would clearly strengthen abbas and his moderate course vis-à-vis israel .
and it is also a clear show of faith for the new , hamas-free transitional cabinet under the existing palestinian finance minister salam fayyad .
israel 's prime minster ehud olmert can already imagine a peace treaty " without hamas . "
this position has takers in both the us and europe .
but caution is warranted .
hamas is and remains a considerable power factor with popularity beyond the gaza strip .
after all , the islamists won the last elections with an absolute majority and in this case justifiably demanded a share of power .
preventing humanitarian disaster the international community is presented with a difficult challenge : it should never accept terror or the hamas-declared goal of destroying israel .
but the international community should also not take sides in an internal palestinian power struggle .
apart from strengthening abbas , steps should be taken to make contact with moderate powers within hamas and to assist them if necessary .
there 's no disputing that an abbas-controlled west bank would be the better model for a future palestinian state and should be treated and supported accordingly .
but at the same time , it 's important to avoid allowing the gaza strip to drift completely into a humanitarian disaster . the people there should not be punished for failed hamas policies .
that would only lead to further radicalization and violence .

eu member states have agreed to drop symbolic elements of the new treaty , but a meeting of german and polish leaders over the weekend failed to resolve an impasse over the bloc 's voting structure . when chancellor angela merkel convenes an eu summit on a new slimmed-down treaty towards the end of germany 's six-month rotating presidency on thursday and friday , the 27 member states are expected to be split into three broad camps .
merkel wants to establish a road map for the conference to adopt a new eu treaty . first , there are 22 countries , which are in favor of the defunct constitution that was ratified already by 18 members .
the next group are euro-skeptic countries such as britain and the czech republic , which would have likely voted against the old document , but never got around to casting their ballots after it was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 . and then there are the poles , in a camp of their own .
at issue is the eu ’ s reformed voting structure in which each member state carries a certain weight based on their population base .
the poles argue that the current double voting structure gives disproportionate power to large eu countries , such as germany , and that merkel is acting in her country ’ s national interest , instead of speaking for the entire bloc . eu summit could collapse due to polish position merkel , who met with polish president lech kaczynski this past weekend , said she could not rule out the possibility that the brussels summit could collapse because of the polish position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks over weekend between poland 's kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and merkel stalled " i can only say that it was a very open discussion , but in this matter the positions have not changed , " said merkel . merkel rejected poland 's demand that talks on voting procedures be reopened , saying it was better to leave the agreement , which was reached after long and tough negotiations between all member states , in place . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said he backed merkel 's position in the stand-off .
" if this summit fails , then it certainly will not be the fault of germany leading the negotiations , " he said , alluding to the impasse created by the polish position against the rest of the eu . " the double-majority system as defined within the constitutional treaty , we can not accept that , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told reporters after eu foreign ministers discussed negotiations for a new treaty reforming the bloc 's institutions . voting formula based on square root of population diplomats said fotyga 's tough 30-minute speech dashed hopes that warsaw was starting to soften its stance after the meeting between merkel and kaczynski . under the current reform , most eu decisions would require the support of 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the population .
poland , which has less than half of germany 's population , has proposed an alternative based on a mathematical square root of each country 's population . warsaw is cross that even a discussion of their alternative is off the table on merkel 's agenda at the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and dutch " no " votes in 2005 plunged the eu into crisis the poles , who are overwhelmingly catholic , insist that they are willing to compromise .
for instance , they are willing to drop references to a christian god enshrined in the treaty , which was another bone of contention , but that accepting the " double majority " system of voting , which they threaten to veto , would be a going a step too far . poles divided on government position kaczynski explained that warsaw focused so much on the issue of voting rights , because the voting system would assume a new significance in the reformed european union . polish opposition politicians on the other hand appeared divided on the government ’ s position . while the liberal opposition seems to be leaning toward the government line that countries like poland should be given more voting power within the eu , the democratic left alliance pointed out the flaws of what it regards as kaczynski ’ s intransigence . left-wing opposition leader wojciech olejniczak believes that long-term strategic alliances with major european union partners should matter more than the square root voting system the polish government is pushing for . " looking for a compromise solution is a better way of building a country 's position than putting a spanner in the works , " he told dw-radio . according to other critics , kaczynski and his twin brother jaroslaw , who is prime minister , are reluctant to back down on the issue of voting rights because of their suspicion of germany ’ s motives . " the kaczynski brothers focus too much on the difficult history between poland and germany , which seems to cloud their vision of europe , " said european affairs analyst andrzej krajewski of the batory foundation . britain and netherlands have special demands too besides poland , britain and the netherlands have also set out their own demands .
britain insists that a charter of fundamental rights must not be legally binding and wants an opt-out on judicial and criminal matters , a position that is further complicated by the change in leadership from prime minister tony blair to gordon brown after the summit on june 27 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : change of leadership in britain from blair -lrb- left -rrb- to brown complicates matters the dutch are seeking stronger powers for national parliaments to send back eu draft legislation .
france , which voted against the constitution , and spain , which had already approved it in a referendum , made a joint appeal for a quick , simplified treaty . agreement on a revised treaty at the summit could lift the eu out of its torpor and boost merkel ’ s standing in europe .
but another failure could plunge the bloc into a deeper crisis and institutional gridlock .
it could mean a two-speed europe in which some countries would advance ahead anyway , leaving the naysayers behind . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said some of the most objectionable differences , which are largely symbolic , had been overcome , such as calling the new document an amended treaty as opposed to " constitution . "
beethoven 's " ode to joy " and the eu flag with gold stars against a royal blue background for example , would not be formally enscrined in the new treaty . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

britain insists that a charter of fundamental rights must not be legally binding and wants an opt-out on judicial and criminal matters , a position that is further complicated by the change in leadership from prime minister tony blair to gordon brown after the summit on june 27 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : change of leadership in britain from blair -lrb- left -rrb- to brown complicates matters the dutch are seeking stronger powers for national parliaments to send back eu draft legislation .
france , which voted against the constitution , and spain , which had already approved it in a referendum , made a joint appeal for a quick , simplified treaty . agreement on a revised treaty at the summit could lift the eu out of its torpor and boost merkel ’ s standing in europe .
but another failure could plunge the bloc into a deeper crisis and institutional gridlock .
it could mean a two-speed europe in which some countries would advance ahead anyway , leaving the naysayers behind . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said some of the most objectionable differences , which are largely symbolic , had been overcome , such as calling the new document an amended treaty as opposed to " constitution . "
beethoven 's " ode to joy " and the eu flag with gold stars against a royal blue background for example , would not be formally enscrined in the new treaty . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the track , considered by many to be the most beautiful and difficult course in the world , turned 80 monday . from day one the nürburgring has had the reputation among racing fans for being exhilarating and brutal .
on june 18 , 1927 , german legend rudolf caracciola won the inaugural race , driving 100.1 kmph -lrb- 62.2 mph -rrb- .
after 12 laps , he emerged from his mercedes s triumphantly , hands bloody and feet burned from the hilly , technical track . racer jackie stewart once famously called it " the green hell . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrari won this race in 1953 the ring , as it 's known by fans , is a curvy stretch of asphalt approximately 90 km southwest of the german city of cologne .
the hilly , wooded eifel region were a natural place to build a track , since the back roads had long been a favorite of racing enthusiasts .
the 28.27 km -lrb- 17.6 mile -rrb- " mountain , racing and test circuit " took as many as 3,000 workers two years to build .
it 's been a wild ride ever since .
more than 200,000 fans showed up for races in 1938 .
the track endured bombings during world war ii .
after the war , the track hosted german grand prix races as part of the formula one world championship . testing ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's schumacher the combined loop is notorious in the racing world for its technical challenges .
because of the demands it makes on drivers , the track has become a favorite testing ground for german car makers wanting to take their prototypes for a spin .
the track was also famous for nearly killing austrian formula one champion niki lauda in 1976 .
lauda 's car swerved off the track at nürburgring , rolled , hit another car and burst into flames .
lauda , trapped inside the car , suffered severe burns on his face , later fell into a coma and nearly died .
the next year , the license for formula one racing was n't renewed .
it returned in 1984 only to move to hockenheim a year later .
formula one returned in 1995 . schumacher brings in fans nürburgring found its current popularity thanks , in part , to german racer michael schumacher .
in 1995 michael schumacher was the first german to win a formula one world championship race at nürburgring .
as the sport increases in popularity around the world , there 's fierce competition to host formula one races . bildunterschrift : plenty of curves in the ring schumacher 's success helped the track .
he won seven world titles , five with ferrari .
his talents sparked an unprecedented formula one madness in germany in the early 1990s .
schumacher retired last year .
since 1994 , 100 million euros -lrb- $ 133 million -rrb- have been invested in nürburgring .
by 2009 another 150 million euros will go into improvements , according to media reports .
the hope is to attract an additional 500,000 visitors to the area each year . the area is trying to sell itself as a destination for car enthusiasts with a year-round recreation park offers " cars , actions and attractions . " among many non-formula one enthusiasts , the track is best known for hosting the music festival rock am ring .

survivors said the children were forced to stay in the building to act as " human shields " for militants suspected to be there .
is there any proof the taliban acts in this way ? citha d. maass : naturally , there is no proof , but time and again over the last few months we have received reports that the taliban uses this tactic .
it is certainly a part of the taliban 's tactics , and that creates an enormous dilemma for nato 's isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- troops since they ca n't get the children out and keep the taliban inside . nato has recently announced that fewer civilians would become victims of the conflict in afghanistan .
how can that be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has some 3,000 soldiers stationed as part of nato forces in afghanistan civilian casualties can not be completely avoided when these types of guerilla tactics are used .
it is really always a balance of proportionality .
are you willing pay the price or should you avoid it ?
when there is secure information available that there really are important taliban members , it is more likely that the order for an air strike is given than if you have solid tips that only nominal members are concerned .
the more civilian victims there are the more upset the population becomes about the isaf troops . what exactly happens when an attack kills civilians ? part of the taliban 's tactics is to incite resentment and anger that can then be shown in demonstrations aimed at the isaf troops or in protests against support of civilian reconstruction .
you can try to clarify the situation for the population , but that , of course , is only possible in a relatively minor way .
in the end , the taliban probably have more leverage . does that mean that the tactic of using " human shields " seriously endangers the international soldiers ' mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters rely on guerrilla tactics to match nato 's military might yes .
that 's the intent of this asymmetrical guerrilla tactic .
on one hand are the well-armed isaf military troops and on the other are guerrilla fighters like the taliban who , with the help of " civilian shields " and suicide attacks , conduct pinprick attacks .
they are trying to unsettle the isaf troops and to stir up the population 's mood against the international troops . according to nato diplomats , soldiers in the operation enduring freedom are mainly responsible for the civilian casualties .
is there a possibility that isaf troops are being more careful ? isaf has a different mandate - a different way of operating .
but we have to take a special look at the south - and that is the area that is most affected - and how the two groups work together .
the isaf troops do not have any air support of their own .
that means when they get into an ambush they have to order air support for their own defense .
this comes from the americans , who are operating under the enduring freedom mandate .
that makes it impossible to say who acts how .
instead it 's simply a compound approach in which the air attack comes from enduring freedom planes .
when an isaf patrol ends up in an ambush it naturally tries to get free , that 's the nature of the situation , and in such a case both units of soldiers are connected . you said that civilian casualties can not be completely avoided , that you have to consider them against the benefits in each case .
is n't that cynical when people 's lives are being sacrificed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tornado warplanes are being used to find taliban outposts no , the isaf side has recognized that the taliban is using this tactic to stir up the population against the international troops .
because of that they have become more and more careful .
but the casualties can not be fundamentally avoided because they are part of guerrilla tactics .
i would definitely not call it cynical , because i am sure in every case there is a careful consideration of whether or not to attack .
such an attack can both protect the international troops and at the same time destroy a religious school where taliban troops barricaded themselves . in an interview with deutsche welle , secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said that nato is " in a different moral category " than the taliban .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 18.06.2007 " civilian casualties can not be completely avoided " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : war planners weigh the potential benefits of an attack with civilian deaths , maass said dw-world.de spoke to afghanistan expert citha d. maass about taliban tactics and civilian casualties after a us airstrike killed seven children who military planners said were being used as human shields . citha d. maass is an afghanistan expert at the german institute for international and security affairs and is currently focusing her work on perspectives for afghanistan 's consolidation . dw-world.de : seven children were killed during a us-led air strike in eastern afghanistan .
survivors said the children were forced to stay in the building to act as " human shields " for militants suspected to be there .
is there any proof the taliban acts in this way ? citha d. maass : naturally , there is no proof , but time and again over the last few months we have received reports that the taliban uses this tactic .
it is certainly a part of the taliban 's tactics , and that creates an enormous dilemma for nato 's isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- troops since they ca n't get the children out and keep the taliban inside . nato has recently announced that fewer civilians would become victims of the conflict in afghanistan .
how can that be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has some 3,000 soldiers stationed as part of nato forces in afghanistan civilian casualties can not be completely avoided when these types of guerilla tactics are used .
it is really always a balance of proportionality .
are you willing pay the price or should you avoid it ?
when there is secure information available that there really are important taliban members , it is more likely that the order for an air strike is given than if you have solid tips that only nominal members are concerned .
the more civilian victims there are the more upset the population becomes about the isaf troops . what exactly happens when an attack kills civilians ? part of the taliban 's tactics is to incite resentment and anger that can then be shown in demonstrations aimed at the isaf troops or in protests against support of civilian reconstruction .
you can try to clarify the situation for the population , but that , of course , is only possible in a relatively minor way .
in the end , the taliban probably have more leverage . does that mean that the tactic of using " human shields " seriously endangers the international soldiers ' mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters rely on guerrilla tactics to match nato 's military might yes .
that 's the intent of this asymmetrical guerrilla tactic .
on one hand are the well-armed isaf military troops and on the other are guerrilla fighters like the taliban who , with the help of " civilian shields " and suicide attacks , conduct pinprick attacks .
they are trying to unsettle the isaf troops and to stir up the population 's mood against the international troops . according to nato diplomats , soldiers in the operation enduring freedom are mainly responsible for the civilian casualties .
is there a possibility that isaf troops are being more careful ? isaf has a different mandate - a different way of operating .
but we have to take a special look at the south - and that is the area that is most affected - and how the two groups work together .
the isaf troops do not have any air support of their own .
that means when they get into an ambush they have to order air support for their own defense .
this comes from the americans , who are operating under the enduring freedom mandate .
that makes it impossible to say who acts how .
instead it 's simply a compound approach in which the air attack comes from enduring freedom planes .
when an isaf patrol ends up in an ambush it naturally tries to get free , that 's the nature of the situation , and in such a case both units of soldiers are connected . you said that civilian casualties can not be completely avoided , that you have to consider them against the benefits in each case .
is n't that cynical when people 's lives are being sacrificed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tornado warplanes are being used to find taliban outposts no , the isaf side has recognized that the taliban is using this tactic to stir up the population against the international troops .
because of that they have become more and more careful .
but the casualties can not be fundamentally avoided because they are part of guerrilla tactics .
i would definitely not call it cynical , because i am sure in every case there is a careful consideration of whether or not to attack .
such an attack can both protect the international troops and at the same time destroy a religious school where taliban troops barricaded themselves . in an interview with deutsche welle , secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said that nato is " in a different moral category " than the taliban .
do people in afghanistan also see it that way ? i doubt that because the people who are in southern afghanistan , which is economically weak after several years of drought , are fighting to survive .

another 22 seats went to the ump 's centrist allies . sarkozy 's party had been expected to score a " blue wave " landslide after his stunning presidential election win in may .
but amid a low turnout , the socialist party made a surprise comeback , jumping from 149 to 185 seats . the ump had 359 seats in the old assembly .
prime minister francois fillon said voters had given sarkozy " a majority to act " by handing his right-wing party control of the parliament . turnout for the decisive second round vote was 59.99 percent , far short of the near 85-percent turnout in the april-may presidential vote .

another 22 seats went to the ump 's centrist allies . sarkozy 's party had been expected to score a " blue wave " landslide after his stunning presidential election win in may .
but amid a low turnout , the socialist party made a surprise comeback , jumping from 149 to 185 seats . the ump had 359 seats in the old assembly .
prime minister francois fillon said voters had given sarkozy " a majority to act " by handing his right-wing party control of the parliament . turnout for the decisive second round vote was 59.99 percent , far short of the near 85-percent turnout in the april-may presidential vote . " a clear and coherent choice " in an embarrassing blow to sarkozy , former prime minister alain juppe failed to win a seat in his bordeaux stronghold and resigned as environment superminister and government number two . sarkozy , 52 , had brought the 61-year-old juppe back from political exile after his conviction in a party finance scandal and given him one of the most prominent portfolios in his right-wing government . but economy minister jean-louis borloo said the government had scored a " historic success " in becoming the first ruling party since 1978 to retain control of the national assembly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister francois fillon prime minister francois fillon said france had " made a clear and coherent choice " by giving sarkozy " a majority to act . " " you voted for change , well that is going to be a reality .
we will challenge the habits and taboos that hold our country back , " fillon said . " the time for elections is over , now is the time for coming together , now is the time for action . " no blue wave but socialist party leader francois hollande highlighted his party 's gains .
" the blue wave that was announced and was set to sweep did not take place , " he said .
he said the left 's showing would mean there will be " diversity and pluralism " in the new parliament . the socialists had warned voters of a huge ump majority in parliament would lead to a dangerous concentration of powers and turn the legislature into an annex of sarkozy 's presidency . hollande said the result was the sign of voter unease with " unjust measures " planned by the government , including a possible a hike in value-added tax rates to fund healthcare costs .

" the eu will resume normal relations with the palestinian authority immediately , " the bloc 's ministers said in a text of conclusions from a meeting in luxembourg . the eu partially froze ties with the palestinian government and suspended direct aid when hamas swept to power last year because the islamist movement figures on its blacklist of outlawed " terrorist " groups . the new emergency cabinet does not contain hamas members . the ministers said the eu would " resume direct financial support to the government , " as well as provide support to the palestinian civilian police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana in luxembourg monday it will also undertake " intensive efforts to build the institutions of the future palestinian state . " " part of the money will be direct , " eu foreign and security policy chief javier solana said at a meeting with eu foreign ministers in luxembourg monday .
but " in order to help the palestinian people in gaza , we will need some mechanism that can not be a direct support . "
eu funds would be distributed in gaza through united nations agencies or the eu 's current emergency aid system which sidelines hama leaders in the territory .
the eu chief diplomat did not give details of when the bloc would resume aid payments to the palestinian government . technical details being discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salam fayyad the eu has expressed its support for the emergency cabinet created by abbas .
last week , abbas dissolved the hamas-led unity government and declared a state of emergency .
the militant group launched an all-out assault on fatah 's security forces in gaza , taking complete control of the strip .
more than 100 people were killed in the clashes .
the emergency cabinet is led by former finance minister salam fayyad .
hamas has denounced the new cabinet as illegal .
the recent violence led to the creation of two separately zones : a hamas-ruled gaza and a fatah-controlled west bank .
the islamic militant group is black-listed as a terrorist organization by the eu and the united states .
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told reporters she was still discussing with fayyad the technical details of when and how aid flows would be re-established .
" we are of course ready to continue to work with fayyad in order to be ready in future to see how we can work directly with the emergency government , " ferrero-waldner said .
she said the eu was working closely with the palestinian authority to establish strict financial channels for the resumption of direct assistance .
financial controls on eu aid had to be clearly defined and very transparent , she insisted , adding : " we have to be very careful ... this is not just political but also technical . " humanitarian aid never stopped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas militants have taken over gaza despite the ban on direct assistance to the palestinian authority , european governments have been sending humanitarian aid to both gaza and the west bank .
officials said an estimated 700 million euros -lrb- $ 939 million -rrb- in such emergency aid was sent to gaza and the west bank last year .
the money was used to pay the salaries of teachers , doctors and health workers and for supplies of fuel , water and electricity to the territories .
once aid flows were re-established , ferrero-waldner said it would be up to fayyad to decide how funds were distributed in gaza .
both solana and ferrero-waldner voiced full confidence in the new palestinian premier , saying they trusted him and had known him for years . israel supports abbas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe suspended its direct aid because of hamas attending eu talks in luxembourg , israeli foreign minister tzipi livni said her government was ready to transfer blocked palestinian tax revenues to the palestinian government . " israel is going to work with abbas and fayyad to transfer the money , " said livni after talks with eu foreign ministers . livni said israel was " not looking for excuses " to delay the delivery of palestinian funds since it wanted to make a clear distinction between palestinian extremists like hamas and the moderate fatah movement of abbas and fayyad . livni did not indicate how much money would be transferred to the palestinians , but eu officials said israel owed up to 850 million dollars in blocked tax money to the palestinians . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier described the israeli move as " significant . " livni said the creation of the emergency palestinian government provided new opportunities for israeli-palestinian peace . isolating hamas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian supporters of hamas celebrate last week the us favors isolating hamas economically , diplomatically and militarily in the gaza strip .
some european diplomats have expressed misgivings about such a strategy .
" the international community does not want two palestinian states , otherwise it will be impossible to find a solution , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
russia wants the emergency cabinet to enter into a " broad dialogue " between all palestinian forces , including hamas . " moscow expects the new emergency cabinet to take all necessary measures to normalize the situation , improve the humanitarian situation ... and above all to halt inter-palestinian conflict , " according to a statement from the russian foreign ministry . " this requires the establishment of broad dialogue between all palestinian political forces including hamas , " the statement said . us also normalizes relations in washington , us secretary of state condoleezza rice meanwhile announced the us government was lifting a 15-month embargo on direct aid to the palestinian territories .
" we intend to lift our financial restrictions on the palestinian government , " she told reporters after meeting abbas in washington .
" this will enable the american people and american financial institutions to resume normal economic and commercial ties with the palestinian government .

" the eu will resume normal relations with the palestinian authority immediately , " the bloc 's ministers said in a text of conclusions from a meeting in luxembourg . the eu partially froze ties with the palestinian government and suspended direct aid when hamas swept to power last year because the islamist movement figures on its blacklist of outlawed " terrorist " groups . the new emergency cabinet does not contain hamas members . the ministers said the eu would " resume direct financial support to the government , " as well as provide support to the palestinian civilian police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana in luxembourg monday it will also undertake " intensive efforts to build the institutions of the future palestinian state . " " part of the money will be direct , " eu foreign and security policy chief javier solana said at a meeting with eu foreign ministers in luxembourg monday .
but " in order to help the palestinian people in gaza , we will need some mechanism that can not be a direct support . "
eu funds would be distributed in gaza through united nations agencies or the eu 's current emergency aid system which sidelines hama leaders in the territory .
the eu chief diplomat did not give details of when the bloc would resume aid payments to the palestinian government . technical details being discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salam fayyad the eu has expressed its support for the emergency cabinet created by abbas .
last week , abbas dissolved the hamas-led unity government and declared a state of emergency .
the militant group launched an all-out assault on fatah 's security forces in gaza , taking complete control of the strip .
more than 100 people were killed in the clashes .
the emergency cabinet is led by former finance minister salam fayyad .
hamas has denounced the new cabinet as illegal .
the recent violence led to the creation of two separately zones : a hamas-ruled gaza and a fatah-controlled west bank .
the islamic militant group is black-listed as a terrorist organization by the eu and the united states .
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told reporters she was still discussing with fayyad the technical details of when and how aid flows would be re-established .
" we are of course ready to continue to work with fayyad in order to be ready in future to see how we can work directly with the emergency government , " ferrero-waldner said .
she said the eu was working closely with the palestinian authority to establish strict financial channels for the resumption of direct assistance .
financial controls on eu aid had to be clearly defined and very transparent , she insisted , adding : " we have to be very careful ... this is not just political but also technical . " humanitarian aid never stopped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas militants have taken over gaza despite the ban on direct assistance to the palestinian authority , european governments have been sending humanitarian aid to both gaza and the west bank .
officials said an estimated 700 million euros -lrb- $ 939 million -rrb- in such emergency aid was sent to gaza and the west bank last year .
the money was used to pay the salaries of teachers , doctors and health workers and for supplies of fuel , water and electricity to the territories .
once aid flows were re-established , ferrero-waldner said it would be up to fayyad to decide how funds were distributed in gaza .
both solana and ferrero-waldner voiced full confidence in the new palestinian premier , saying they trusted him and had known him for years . israel supports abbas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe suspended its direct aid because of hamas attending eu talks in luxembourg , israeli foreign minister tzipi livni said her government was ready to transfer blocked palestinian tax revenues to the palestinian government . " israel is going to work with abbas and fayyad to transfer the money , " said livni after talks with eu foreign ministers . livni said israel was " not looking for excuses " to delay the delivery of palestinian funds since it wanted to make a clear distinction between palestinian extremists like hamas and the moderate fatah movement of abbas and fayyad . livni did not indicate how much money would be transferred to the palestinians , but eu officials said israel owed up to 850 million dollars in blocked tax money to the palestinians . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier described the israeli move as " significant . " livni said the creation of the emergency palestinian government provided new opportunities for israeli-palestinian peace . isolating hamas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian supporters of hamas celebrate last week the us favors isolating hamas economically , diplomatically and militarily in the gaza strip .
some european diplomats have expressed misgivings about such a strategy .
" the international community does not want two palestinian states , otherwise it will be impossible to find a solution , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
russia wants the emergency cabinet to enter into a " broad dialogue " between all palestinian forces , including hamas . " moscow expects the new emergency cabinet to take all necessary measures to normalize the situation , improve the humanitarian situation ... and above all to halt inter-palestinian conflict , " according to a statement from the russian foreign ministry . " this requires the establishment of broad dialogue between all palestinian political forces including hamas , " the statement said . us also normalizes relations in washington , us secretary of state condoleezza rice meanwhile announced the us government was lifting a 15-month embargo on direct aid to the palestinian territories .
" we intend to lift our financial restrictions on the palestinian government , " she told reporters after meeting abbas in washington .
" this will enable the american people and american financial institutions to resume normal economic and commercial ties with the palestinian government . " we will not leave 1.5 million palestinians at the hands of terrorist organizations , " rice said , referring to the impoverished gaza strip . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

another 22 seats went to the ump 's centrist allies . sarkozy 's party had been expected to score a " blue wave " landslide after his stunning presidential election win in may .
but amid a low turnout , the socialist party made a surprise comeback , jumping from 149 to 185 seats . the ump had 359 seats in the old assembly .
prime minister francois fillon said voters had given sarkozy " a majority to act " by handing his right-wing party control of the parliament . turnout for the decisive second round vote was 59.99 percent , far short of the near 85-percent turnout in the april-may presidential vote . " a clear and coherent choice " in an embarrassing blow to sarkozy , former prime minister alain juppe failed to win a seat in his bordeaux stronghold and resigned as environment superminister and government number two . sarkozy , 52 , had brought the 61-year-old juppe back from political exile after his conviction in a party finance scandal and given him one of the most prominent portfolios in his right-wing government . but economy minister jean-louis borloo said the government had scored a " historic success " in becoming the first ruling party since 1978 to retain control of the national assembly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister francois fillon prime minister francois fillon said france had " made a clear and coherent choice " by giving sarkozy " a majority to act . " " you voted for change , well that is going to be a reality .
we will challenge the habits and taboos that hold our country back , " fillon said . " the time for elections is over , now is the time for coming together , now is the time for action . " no blue wave but socialist party leader francois hollande highlighted his party 's gains .
" the blue wave that was announced and was set to sweep did not take place , " he said .
he said the left 's showing would mean there will be " diversity and pluralism " in the new parliament . the socialists had warned voters of a huge ump majority in parliament would lead to a dangerous concentration of powers and turn the legislature into an annex of sarkozy 's presidency . hollande said the result was the sign of voter unease with " unjust measures " planned by the government , including a possible a hike in value-added tax rates to fund healthcare costs .
but the socialist gains were not expected to bury the party 's problems after three successive defeats in presidential elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal and hollande have separated after nearly 30 years even as they welcomed the better-than-expected showing , socialists were jolted by the news that royal and hollande , her partner of nearly 30 years , had separated . royal accused hollande of having an affair in interviews for a book to be released this week and asked that he no longer be described as her partner , though she did not specify when the break-up happened . a new era of french politics despite the much-reduced majority , the ump still became the first french governing party since 1978 to retain its majority in the lower house . one month after taking over from jacques chirac , sarkozy had asked for a strong majority in support of his campaign pledge to modernise french government , kick-start the economy and toughen up crime and immigration laws . a special session of the new parliament will open on june 26 to examine the first bills to reduce taxation , encourage overtime , grant universities more autonomy , tighten immigration and toughen sentences for repeat offenders . sunday 's vote was marked by low turnout as french voters - heading to the polls for the fourth time in two months - cast the last ballots in an election season that has ushered in a new era of politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rachida dati , france 's new justice minister sarkozy , the 52-year-old son of a hungarian immigrant , has appointed a broad-based government in which prominent leftist bernard kouchner is foreign minister and the first woman of north-african origin , rachida dati , was named justice minister . more politicians from the left and from minorities were expected to be appointed to junior ministries following sunday 's result , as part of sarkozy 's vaunted policy of openness . " yes , but of the french " the conservative le figaro called the results of sunday 's vote the " yes , but of the french " to sarkozy 's reforms in the headline to its story . " what happened yesterday was certainly not a defeat for nicolas sarkozy because nicolas sarkozy has a clear majority , but it certainly is a warning , " wrote the paper . le figaro said the gains made by the socialists from the first round of voting one week ago " ... is ample proof that if the french have adopted the idea of reform they are n't ready to accept those which have n't been amply considered ... " the left-wing liberation was more dramatic about the socialist gains . " the right-wing takes a left hook , " screamed the daily 's headline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francois bayrou other left-wing parties picked up 41 seats between them , with 15 going to the communist party and four to the green party . the nationalist movement for france took one seat , but the main far-right national front won no seats . francois bayrou , who formed a new centrist party to build on his strong third-place showing in the presidential elections , took one of three seats won by his democratic movement . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that said , the international community should avoid taking sides in palestine 's internal power struggle , says deutsche welle 's rainer sollich . everyone supports mahmoud abbas : the united states , the united nations and the european union .
israel also sets big hopes on the palestinian president after the military victory of hamas in the gaza strip .
as far as the current situation goes , abbas has earned this broad support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer sollich the violent frenzy of the hamas fighters in the gaza strip can not be excused as a justifiable protest against discrimination or corruption - it is a coup against political institutions .
hamas has deepened the split of the palestinian nation .
and hamas has made the population of the gaza strip hostage to a policy that could drive the region to increasingly hopeless isolation and poverty .
a future without hamas ?
in this situation , it seems unlikely that the international community will completely abandon the palestinians .
the lifting of the embargo put in place a year and a half ago after the election victory of hamas now seems feasible for the west bank .
that would clearly strengthen abbas and his moderate course vis-à-vis israel .
and it is also a clear show of faith for the new , hamas-free transitional cabinet under the existing palestinian finance minister salam fayyad .
israel 's prime minster ehud olmert can already imagine a peace treaty " without hamas . "
this position has takers in both the us and europe .
but caution is warranted .
hamas is and remains a considerable power factor with popularity beyond the gaza strip .
after all , the islamists won the last elections with an absolute majority and in this case justifiably demanded a share of power .
preventing humanitarian disaster the international community is presented with a difficult challenge : it should never accept terror or the hamas-declared goal of destroying israel .
but the international community should also not take sides in an internal palestinian power struggle .
apart from strengthening abbas , steps should be taken to make contact with moderate powers within hamas and to assist them if necessary .
there 's no disputing that an abbas-controlled west bank would be the better model for a future palestinian state and should be treated and supported accordingly .
but at the same time , it 's important to avoid allowing the gaza strip to drift completely into a humanitarian disaster . the people there should not be punished for failed hamas policies .
that would only lead to further radicalization and violence .

in the first hours of the paris event , the european group orchestrated the announcement of new orders for its troubled superjumbo a380 from qatar airways and dubai-based emirates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a350 underwent major changes after clients were unhappy with its shape at an airbus press conference , qatar airways said it would buy three additional a380 superjumbos and confirmed a previous order for 80 mid-sized a350s .
the planes would be worth slightly more than $ 18 billion dollars -lrb- 13.4 billion euros -rrb- at catalog prices .
soon afterwards , emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said his company planned to buy eight more a380s worth $ 2.5 billion at catalog prices .
emirates was already the single biggest client for the a380 with an order for 43 of the aircraft .
american carrier us airways also signed a letter of intent on monday to buy 92 airbus aircraft in the a350 , a330 and a320 families , the two companies announced monday .
the order was worth move than $ 8 billion , according to airbus commercial director john leahy .
airbus has fallen far behind boeing for new orders in 2007 after being overtaken by the us manufacturer in 2006 .
but chief executive louis gallois hinted that more new business was to come .
including the order from qatar airways , only 93 orders have been announced by airbus since the launch of the 10 billion euro a350 program at the end of 2006 .
weak dollar hurting airbus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus and boeing are expected to make more new order announcements this week the european manufacturer has had major production and design problems in the last few years and tallied up losses last year after a profit of 2.3 billion euros in 2006 .
a weak dollar has also made buying from airbus expensive as international deals are usually made in dollars , not euros .
" we have to make airbus competitive at an exchange rate of 1.45 dollars per euro , " gallois told reporters before the show .
the current exchange rate is $ 1.34 to the euro .
" if the euro continues to rise , it will force us to make new decisions about where production is located . "
earlier this year airbus announced a restructuring plan that executives said could save 5 billion euros by 2010 and 2.1 billion euros per year thereafter and may lead to as many as 10,000 job cuts .
airbus employs 56,000 people , including 22,000 in france and 21,000 in germany .
deliveries of the a380 , which is to enter service later this year , are running about two years behind schedule and airbus is keen to shore up confidence in the project .
airbus was also forced to re-design its a350 , which re-emerged with an enlarged body , after a poor response from clients to the original shape .
new orders at boeing , too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 400,000 visitors are expected at the air show boeing meanwhile has sprinted ahead in large part because of the popularity of its future mid-sized 787 model , which will enter service in mid-2008 , five years ahead of the a350 .
at the end of may , airbus had reported 201 new orders for planes this year , while boeing had 429 at the beginning of june .
the us-based group received a boost from aircraft leasing group gecas on monday , which said it had placed a firm order for six boeing 777 cargo aircraft .
about 400,000 people are expected to visit the event , which features air displays as well as exhibitions , at the le bourget airfield on the outskirts of paris .

that said , the international community should avoid taking sides in palestine 's internal power struggle , says deutsche welle 's rainer sollich . everyone supports mahmoud abbas : the united states , the united nations and the european union .
israel also sets big hopes on the palestinian president after the military victory of hamas in the gaza strip .
as far as the current situation goes , abbas has earned this broad support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer sollich the violent frenzy of the hamas fighters in the gaza strip can not be excused as a justifiable protest against discrimination or corruption - it is a coup against political institutions .
hamas has deepened the split of the palestinian nation .
and hamas has made the population of the gaza strip hostage to a policy that could drive the region to increasingly hopeless isolation and poverty .
a future without hamas ?
in this situation , it seems unlikely that the international community will completely abandon the palestinians .
the lifting of the embargo put in place a year and a half ago after the election victory of hamas now seems feasible for the west bank .
that would clearly strengthen abbas and his moderate course vis-à-vis israel .
and it is also a clear show of faith for the new , hamas-free transitional cabinet under the existing palestinian finance minister salam fayyad .
israel 's prime minster ehud olmert can already imagine a peace treaty " without hamas . "
this position has takers in both the us and europe .
but caution is warranted .
hamas is and remains a considerable power factor with popularity beyond the gaza strip .
after all , the islamists won the last elections with an absolute majority and in this case justifiably demanded a share of power .
preventing humanitarian disaster the international community is presented with a difficult challenge : it should never accept terror or the hamas-declared goal of destroying israel .
but the international community should also not take sides in an internal palestinian power struggle .
apart from strengthening abbas , steps should be taken to make contact with moderate powers within hamas and to assist them if necessary .
there 's no disputing that an abbas-controlled west bank would be the better model for a future palestinian state and should be treated and supported accordingly .
but at the same time , it 's important to avoid allowing the gaza strip to drift completely into a humanitarian disaster . the people there should not be punished for failed hamas policies .
that would only lead to further radicalization and violence .

eu member states have agreed to drop symbolic elements of the new treaty , but a meeting of german and polish leaders over the weekend failed to resolve an impasse over the bloc 's voting structure . when chancellor angela merkel convenes an eu summit on a new slimmed-down treaty towards the end of germany 's six-month rotating presidency on thursday and friday , the 27 member states are expected to be split into three broad camps .
merkel wants to establish a road map for the conference to adopt a new eu treaty . first , there are 22 countries , which are in favor of the defunct constitution that was ratified already by 18 members .
the next group are euro-skeptic countries such as britain and the czech republic , which would have likely voted against the old document , but never got around to casting their ballots after it was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 . and then there are the poles , in a camp of their own .
at issue is the eu ’ s reformed voting structure in which each member state carries a certain weight based on their population base .
the poles argue that the current double voting structure gives disproportionate power to large eu countries , such as germany , and that merkel is acting in her country ’ s national interest , instead of speaking for the entire bloc . eu summit could collapse due to polish position merkel , who met with polish president lech kaczynski this past weekend , said she could not rule out the possibility that the brussels summit could collapse because of the polish position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks over weekend between poland 's kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and merkel stalled " i can only say that it was a very open discussion , but in this matter the positions have not changed , " said merkel . merkel rejected poland 's demand that talks on voting procedures be reopened , saying it was better to leave the agreement , which was reached after long and tough negotiations between all member states , in place . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said he backed merkel 's position in the stand-off .
" if this summit fails , then it certainly will not be the fault of germany leading the negotiations , " he said , alluding to the impasse created by the polish position against the rest of the eu . " the double-majority system as defined within the constitutional treaty , we can not accept that , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told reporters after eu foreign ministers discussed negotiations for a new treaty reforming the bloc 's institutions . voting formula based on square root of population diplomats said fotyga 's tough 30-minute speech dashed hopes that warsaw was starting to soften its stance after the meeting between merkel and kaczynski . under the current reform , most eu decisions would require the support of 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the population .
poland , which has less than half of germany 's population , has proposed an alternative based on a mathematical square root of each country 's population . warsaw is cross that even a discussion of their alternative is off the table on merkel 's agenda at the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and dutch " no " votes in 2005 plunged the eu into crisis the poles , who are overwhelmingly catholic , insist that they are willing to compromise .
for instance , they are willing to drop references to a christian god enshrined in the treaty , which was another bone of contention , but that accepting the " double majority " system of voting , which they threaten to veto , would be a going a step too far . poles divided on government position kaczynski explained that warsaw focused so much on the issue of voting rights , because the voting system would assume a new significance in the reformed european union . polish opposition politicians on the other hand appeared divided on the government ’ s position . while the liberal opposition seems to be leaning toward the government line that countries like poland should be given more voting power within the eu , the democratic left alliance pointed out the flaws of what it regards as kaczynski ’ s intransigence . left-wing opposition leader wojciech olejniczak believes that long-term strategic alliances with major european union partners should matter more than the square root voting system the polish government is pushing for . " looking for a compromise solution is a better way of building a country 's position than putting a spanner in the works , " he told dw-radio . according to other critics , kaczynski and his twin brother jaroslaw , who is prime minister , are reluctant to back down on the issue of voting rights because of their suspicion of germany ’ s motives . " the kaczynski brothers focus too much on the difficult history between poland and germany , which seems to cloud their vision of europe , " said european affairs analyst andrzej krajewski of the batory foundation . britain and netherlands have special demands too besides poland , britain and the netherlands have also set out their own demands .
britain insists that a charter of fundamental rights must not be legally binding and wants an opt-out on judicial and criminal matters , a position that is further complicated by the change in leadership from prime minister tony blair to gordon brown after the summit on june 27 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : change of leadership in britain from blair -lrb- left -rrb- to brown complicates matters the dutch are seeking stronger powers for national parliaments to send back eu draft legislation .
france , which voted against the constitution , and spain , which had already approved it in a referendum , made a joint appeal for a quick , simplified treaty . agreement on a revised treaty at the summit could lift the eu out of its torpor and boost merkel ’ s standing in europe .

it could mean a two-speed europe in which some countries would advance ahead anyway , leaving the naysayers behind . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said some of the most objectionable differences , which are largely symbolic , had been overcome , such as calling the new document an amended treaty as opposed to " constitution .

eu member states have agreed to drop symbolic elements of the new treaty , but a meeting of german and polish leaders over the weekend failed to resolve an impasse over the bloc 's voting structure . when chancellor angela merkel convenes an eu summit on a new slimmed-down treaty towards the end of germany 's six-month rotating presidency on thursday and friday , the 27 member states are expected to be split into three broad camps .
merkel wants to establish a road map for the conference to adopt a new eu treaty . first , there are 22 countries , which are in favor of the defunct constitution that was ratified already by 18 members .
the next group are euro-skeptic countries such as britain and the czech republic , which would have likely voted against the old document , but never got around to casting their ballots after it was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 . and then there are the poles , in a camp of their own .
at issue is the eu ’ s reformed voting structure in which each member state carries a certain weight based on their population base .
the poles argue that the current double voting structure gives disproportionate power to large eu countries , such as germany , and that merkel is acting in her country ’ s national interest , instead of speaking for the entire bloc . eu summit could collapse due to polish position merkel , who met with polish president lech kaczynski this past weekend , said she could not rule out the possibility that the brussels summit could collapse because of the polish position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks over weekend between poland 's kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and merkel stalled " i can only say that it was a very open discussion , but in this matter the positions have not changed , " said merkel . merkel rejected poland 's demand that talks on voting procedures be reopened , saying it was better to leave the agreement , which was reached after long and tough negotiations between all member states , in place . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said he backed merkel 's position in the stand-off .
" if this summit fails , then it certainly will not be the fault of germany leading the negotiations , " he said , alluding to the impasse created by the polish position against the rest of the eu . " the double-majority system as defined within the constitutional treaty , we can not accept that , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told reporters after eu foreign ministers discussed negotiations for a new treaty reforming the bloc 's institutions . voting formula based on square root of population diplomats said fotyga 's tough 30-minute speech dashed hopes that warsaw was starting to soften its stance after the meeting between merkel and kaczynski . under the current reform , most eu decisions would require the support of 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the population .

that said , the international community should avoid taking sides in palestine 's internal power struggle , says deutsche welle 's rainer sollich . everyone supports mahmoud abbas : the united states , the united nations and the european union .
israel also sets big hopes on the palestinian president after the military victory of hamas in the gaza strip .
as far as the current situation goes , abbas has earned this broad support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer sollich the violent frenzy of the hamas fighters in the gaza strip can not be excused as a justifiable protest against discrimination or corruption - it is a coup against political institutions .
hamas has deepened the split of the palestinian nation .
and hamas has made the population of the gaza strip hostage to a policy that could drive the region to increasingly hopeless isolation and poverty .
a future without hamas ?
in this situation , it seems unlikely that the international community will completely abandon the palestinians .
the lifting of the embargo put in place a year and a half ago after the election victory of hamas now seems feasible for the west bank .
that would clearly strengthen abbas and his moderate course vis-à-vis israel .
and it is also a clear show of faith for the new , hamas-free transitional cabinet under the existing palestinian finance minister salam fayyad .
israel 's prime minster ehud olmert can already imagine a peace treaty " without hamas . "
this position has takers in both the us and europe .
but caution is warranted .

that said , the international community should avoid taking sides in palestine 's internal power struggle , says deutsche welle 's rainer sollich . everyone supports mahmoud abbas : the united states , the united nations and the european union .
israel also sets big hopes on the palestinian president after the military victory of hamas in the gaza strip .
as far as the current situation goes , abbas has earned this broad support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer sollich the violent frenzy of the hamas fighters in the gaza strip can not be excused as a justifiable protest against discrimination or corruption - it is a coup against political institutions .
hamas has deepened the split of the palestinian nation .
and hamas has made the population of the gaza strip hostage to a policy that could drive the region to increasingly hopeless isolation and poverty .
a future without hamas ?
in this situation , it seems unlikely that the international community will completely abandon the palestinians .
the lifting of the embargo put in place a year and a half ago after the election victory of hamas now seems feasible for the west bank .
that would clearly strengthen abbas and his moderate course vis-à-vis israel .
and it is also a clear show of faith for the new , hamas-free transitional cabinet under the existing palestinian finance minister salam fayyad .
israel 's prime minster ehud olmert can already imagine a peace treaty " without hamas . "
this position has takers in both the us and europe .
but caution is warranted .
hamas is and remains a considerable power factor with popularity beyond the gaza strip .
after all , the islamists won the last elections with an absolute majority and in this case justifiably demanded a share of power .
preventing humanitarian disaster the international community is presented with a difficult challenge : it should never accept terror or the hamas-declared goal of destroying israel .
but the international community should also not take sides in an internal palestinian power struggle .
apart from strengthening abbas , steps should be taken to make contact with moderate powers within hamas and to assist them if necessary .

amnesty and others support an eu wide migration policy guided by humanitarian principles . malta , which joined the eu in 2004 , is now at the forefront of a battle against illegal immigration , as scores of desperate african migrants in fishing boats risk their lives to reach european shores . many migrants hope that if they make it from the libyan coast to the tiny mediterranean island , which is south of sicily , they can start a new life anywhere in the european union . malta , which has been the destination of more than 7,000 illegal refugees over the past few years , is refusing to accept any more newcomers now , leaving boatloads of africans either to their fate in the turbulent mediterranean waters or in detention camps behind barbed wire . on monday at a berlin symposium , the human rights organization amnesty international lambasted the european union for its failure to support malta in its struggle to deal with the human tide from the horn of africa . mediterranean countries unfairly burdened it is the southern rim of the eu that is feeling the strain – malta , spain and italy , countries which want the rest of the bloc to do their fair share in taking in the illegal immigrants . the spanish canary islands off the western coast of africa , a favorite holiday destination for german and british tourists , was inundated with more than 30,000 refugees last year .
and lampedusa , an italian island which is closer to tunisia than it is to mainland italy , has also been targeted by a continuous flow of migrants from countries such as senegal , mauritius or eritrea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugee in detention camps or left to fate at sea amnesty said that eu countries still have capacities for immigration and called for a european wide asylum policy guided by humanitarian principles . at last week 's meeting , the eu interior ministers brushed aside malta 's plea for a fair distribution of the immigrants among all eu member states .
fears in european capitals of a tidal wave from africa are unfounded however , speakers at the symposium said . number of asylum seekers dropped drastically the number of asylum-seekers in germany for example has dropped from more than 400,000 in the mid-1990s to merely 20,000 last year . there are huge capacities within the eu to absorb more people in need of help , according to richard williams of the human rights group european council for refugees in exile -lrb- ecre -rrb- , who called for an easing of immigration laws across europe . " we 've created an asylum system that is so harsh , where the chances of being detained are very high , where the chances of being refused asylum on spurious grounds are very high , and the chances of being sent back to a country where you do n't feel safe , are very high , " williams told dw-radio .
" people feel safer not to apply for asylum - to still come , but to remain underground . " the existing patchwork of national laws fosters illegal immigration , said peter altmaier , undersecretary in the german interior ministry in a radio interview .
at present there are 20 different national policies in the 27 member bloc , which apply very different treatment standards to refugees , but the european commission wants harmonized rules to be in place by 2010 . " we have to fight illegal immigration because these people are exploited by criminal organizations , " altmaier said .
" at the same time we have to offer perspectives for legal migration .
and we also need a very strong humanitarian signal that we can not allow people to die in the mediterranean sea . " eu interested in common asylum policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu needs a common migration policy the eu 's external border agency frontex will soon begin patrolling the waters off malta to rescue illegal immigrants , altmaier said .
however amnesty claimed that boat commanders are usually told to keep the refugees off territorial waters instead of guiding them safely ashore in europe .
although frontex has 100 vessels as well as 50 planes and helicopters at its disposal , the aid provided by its response team has been patchy . it is in the interest of the entire eu , not just the mediterranean rim 's " front line states " to absorb asylum seekers , according to williams .
many who have made it to italy 's shores for example , migrate further north anyway , and lodge applications for asylum status in more than a single eu country , a practice called " asylum shopping .

amnesty and others support an eu wide migration policy guided by humanitarian principles . malta , which joined the eu in 2004 , is now at the forefront of a battle against illegal immigration , as scores of desperate african migrants in fishing boats risk their lives to reach european shores . many migrants hope that if they make it from the libyan coast to the tiny mediterranean island , which is south of sicily , they can start a new life anywhere in the european union . malta , which has been the destination of more than 7,000 illegal refugees over the past few years , is refusing to accept any more newcomers now , leaving boatloads of africans either to their fate in the turbulent mediterranean waters or in detention camps behind barbed wire . on monday at a berlin symposium , the human rights organization amnesty international lambasted the european union for its failure to support malta in its struggle to deal with the human tide from the horn of africa . mediterranean countries unfairly burdened it is the southern rim of the eu that is feeling the strain – malta , spain and italy , countries which want the rest of the bloc to do their fair share in taking in the illegal immigrants . the spanish canary islands off the western coast of africa , a favorite holiday destination for german and british tourists , was inundated with more than 30,000 refugees last year .
and lampedusa , an italian island which is closer to tunisia than it is to mainland italy , has also been targeted by a continuous flow of migrants from countries such as senegal , mauritius or eritrea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugee in detention camps or left to fate at sea amnesty said that eu countries still have capacities for immigration and called for a european wide asylum policy guided by humanitarian principles . at last week 's meeting , the eu interior ministers brushed aside malta 's plea for a fair distribution of the immigrants among all eu member states .
fears in european capitals of a tidal wave from africa are unfounded however , speakers at the symposium said . number of asylum seekers dropped drastically the number of asylum-seekers in germany for example has dropped from more than 400,000 in the mid-1990s to merely 20,000 last year . there are huge capacities within the eu to absorb more people in need of help , according to richard williams of the human rights group european council for refugees in exile -lrb- ecre -rrb- , who called for an easing of immigration laws across europe . " we 've created an asylum system that is so harsh , where the chances of being detained are very high , where the chances of being refused asylum on spurious grounds are very high , and the chances of being sent back to a country where you do n't feel safe , are very high , " williams told dw-radio .
" people feel safer not to apply for asylum - to still come , but to remain underground . " the existing patchwork of national laws fosters illegal immigration , said peter altmaier , undersecretary in the german interior ministry in a radio interview .
at present there are 20 different national policies in the 27 member bloc , which apply very different treatment standards to refugees , but the european commission wants harmonized rules to be in place by 2010 . " we have to fight illegal immigration because these people are exploited by criminal organizations , " altmaier said .
" at the same time we have to offer perspectives for legal migration .
and we also need a very strong humanitarian signal that we can not allow people to die in the mediterranean sea . " eu interested in common asylum policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu needs a common migration policy the eu 's external border agency frontex will soon begin patrolling the waters off malta to rescue illegal immigrants , altmaier said .
however amnesty claimed that boat commanders are usually told to keep the refugees off territorial waters instead of guiding them safely ashore in europe .
although frontex has 100 vessels as well as 50 planes and helicopters at its disposal , the aid provided by its response team has been patchy . it is in the interest of the entire eu , not just the mediterranean rim 's " front line states " to absorb asylum seekers , according to williams .
many who have made it to italy 's shores for example , migrate further north anyway , and lodge applications for asylum status in more than a single eu country , a practice called " asylum shopping . " ecre 's williams argued that the free movement of people across the borders of most eu countries provided by the schengen accords means that common rules and safeguards on migration are vital . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the track , considered by many to be the most beautiful and difficult course in the world , turned 80 monday . from day one the nürburgring has had the reputation among racing fans for being exhilarating and brutal .
on june 18 , 1927 , german legend rudolf caracciola won the inaugural race , driving 100.1 kmph -lrb- 62.2 mph -rrb- .
after 12 laps , he emerged from his mercedes s triumphantly , hands bloody and feet burned from the hilly , technical track . racer jackie stewart once famously called it " the green hell . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrari won this race in 1953 the ring , as it 's known by fans , is a curvy stretch of asphalt approximately 90 km southwest of the german city of cologne .
the hilly , wooded eifel region were a natural place to build a track , since the back roads had long been a favorite of racing enthusiasts .
the 28.27 km -lrb- 17.6 mile -rrb- " mountain , racing and test circuit " took as many as 3,000 workers two years to build .
it 's been a wild ride ever since .
more than 200,000 fans showed up for races in 1938 .
the track endured bombings during world war ii .
after the war , the track hosted german grand prix races as part of the formula one world championship . testing ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's schumacher the combined loop is notorious in the racing world for its technical challenges .
because of the demands it makes on drivers , the track has become a favorite testing ground for german car makers wanting to take their prototypes for a spin .
the track was also famous for nearly killing austrian formula one champion niki lauda in 1976 .
lauda 's car swerved off the track at nürburgring , rolled , hit another car and burst into flames .
lauda , trapped inside the car , suffered severe burns on his face , later fell into a coma and nearly died .
the next year , the license for formula one racing was n't renewed .
it returned in 1984 only to move to hockenheim a year later .

" maybe these men do this to me because they do not believe in women making decisions . " according to research revealed at the summit , the netherlands and the united kingdom are the two countries that have the highest percentage of women in decision-making positions . visser said it remains hard for women to climb the career ladder since unlike other countries , " the netherlands does not have a legislator that could back women up and to get to the top , you have to be on your own . " " davos for women " the challenges facing women in the business world was one of the core themes of the summit which is also known as the " davos for women . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian president vaira vike-freiberga took part in the summit an annual occurrence , the three-day meeting this time drew over 1,000 female government and business leaders - most of them top corporate executives - from 95 countries .
participants included latvian president , vaira vike-freiberga and vice president of microsoft usa , gerri elliot . irene natividad , president of the summit said the meet allows women across borders , disciplines and cultures to learn from each other in their ongoing work towards economic equity . " sustainability and growth in our global economy would be unthinkable without women " natividad said . she admitted that there were n't enough women in top managerial positions and emphasized the need to change the mind-set of both men and women . " many corporate leaders still view the inclusion of women board directors as a matter of political correctness or as a form of affirmative action to address past inequities . "
she said both views are misguided approaches that merely entrench opposition to diversifying corporate boardrooms . women as stakeholders experts point out that companies can ill-afford to shut out women from decision-making positions given that women are increasingly turning important stakeholders enabling firms to better compete globally . " they -lrb- women -rrb- constitute 50 percent of the world ’ s workers , run over 40 percent of small businesses and make 80 percent of consumer buying decisions , " said natividad . the summit threw up a host of ideas to help ease the way for women aspiring to managerial levels and positions of power in the business world . some pointed out that corporate power circles still remains a boys ' club .
mirrella visser said that male networking is always the easier way to get there . she emphasized that " women need to market themselves and create a network with men who are in decision-making -lrb- positions -rrb- because when there is a position up there , they will recommend them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men have it easier making it to the top of the corporate world jacqueline ford , an executive with ibm in the us - which has more women in managerial positions than any other country - said more has to be done to change the mindset of societies in accepting women as equal partners in the corporate world as well as creating legislation to help smooth the path . " women who are in government decision making should advocate for laws that could help women to reach to the top managerial positions , " ford said . germany lags behind in europe according to the study published during the summit , german companies tend to have the lowest number of women in managerial positions in western europe . susan unger , senior vice president and chief information officer at daimler chrysler and one of the few german women executives said one of the main barriers faced by german women is juggling family and work . " women have to work and take care of their families , so it is not easy for them to do both efficiently .
companies have to cater for women and help create infrastructure that could help in the know how technology , " unger said . unger , who has been working for the carmaker for 35 years , pointed out that daimler chrysler has created 350 children ’ s day care centers for employees , especially women . " the initiative is to relieve the heavy burden from women , " she said , adding that women too had a role to play if they were aiming for the top .
women must contribute by empowering themselves with well advanced skills and must network with role models and mentors , unger said .
she also urged big companies to recognize women ’ s capability and strengths when making top appointments .

survivors said the children were forced to stay in the building to act as " human shields " for militants suspected to be there .
is there any proof the taliban acts in this way ? citha d. maass : naturally , there is no proof , but time and again over the last few months we have received reports that the taliban uses this tactic .
it is certainly a part of the taliban 's tactics , and that creates an enormous dilemma for nato 's isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- troops since they ca n't get the children out and keep the taliban inside . nato has recently announced that fewer civilians would become victims of the conflict in afghanistan .
how can that be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has some 3,000 soldiers stationed as part of nato forces in afghanistan civilian casualties can not be completely avoided when these types of guerilla tactics are used .
it is really always a balance of proportionality .
are you willing pay the price or should you avoid it ?
when there is secure information available that there really are important taliban members , it is more likely that the order for an air strike is given than if you have solid tips that only nominal members are concerned .
the more civilian victims there are the more upset the population becomes about the isaf troops . what exactly happens when an attack kills civilians ? part of the taliban 's tactics is to incite resentment and anger that can then be shown in demonstrations aimed at the isaf troops or in protests against support of civilian reconstruction .
you can try to clarify the situation for the population , but that , of course , is only possible in a relatively minor way .
in the end , the taliban probably have more leverage . does that mean that the tactic of using " human shields " seriously endangers the international soldiers ' mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters rely on guerrilla tactics to match nato 's military might yes .
that 's the intent of this asymmetrical guerrilla tactic .
on one hand are the well-armed isaf military troops and on the other are guerrilla fighters like the taliban who , with the help of " civilian shields " and suicide attacks , conduct pinprick attacks .
they are trying to unsettle the isaf troops and to stir up the population 's mood against the international troops . according to nato diplomats , soldiers in the operation enduring freedom are mainly responsible for the civilian casualties .
is there a possibility that isaf troops are being more careful ? isaf has a different mandate - a different way of operating .
but we have to take a special look at the south - and that is the area that is most affected - and how the two groups work together .
the isaf troops do not have any air support of their own .
that means when they get into an ambush they have to order air support for their own defense .
this comes from the americans , who are operating under the enduring freedom mandate .
that makes it impossible to say who acts how .
instead it 's simply a compound approach in which the air attack comes from enduring freedom planes .
when an isaf patrol ends up in an ambush it naturally tries to get free , that 's the nature of the situation , and in such a case both units of soldiers are connected . you said that civilian casualties can not be completely avoided , that you have to consider them against the benefits in each case .
is n't that cynical when people 's lives are being sacrificed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tornado warplanes are being used to find taliban outposts no , the isaf side has recognized that the taliban is using this tactic to stir up the population against the international troops .
because of that they have become more and more careful .
but the casualties can not be fundamentally avoided because they are part of guerrilla tactics .
i would definitely not call it cynical , because i am sure in every case there is a careful consideration of whether or not to attack .
such an attack can both protect the international troops and at the same time destroy a religious school where taliban troops barricaded themselves . in an interview with deutsche welle , secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said that nato is " in a different moral category " than the taliban .
do people in afghanistan also see it that way ? i doubt that because the people who are in southern afghanistan , which is economically weak after several years of drought , are fighting to survive .
moral categories just do n't apply there . matthias klein interviewed citha d. maass -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the first hours of the paris event , the european group orchestrated the announcement of new orders for its troubled superjumbo a380 from qatar airways and dubai-based emirates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a350 underwent major changes after clients were unhappy with its shape at an airbus press conference , qatar airways said it would buy three additional a380 superjumbos and confirmed a previous order for 80 mid-sized a350s .
the planes would be worth slightly more than $ 18 billion dollars -lrb- 13.4 billion euros -rrb- at catalog prices .
soon afterwards , emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said his company planned to buy eight more a380s worth $ 2.5 billion at catalog prices .
emirates was already the single biggest client for the a380 with an order for 43 of the aircraft .
american carrier us airways also signed a letter of intent on monday to buy 92 airbus aircraft in the a350 , a330 and a320 families , the two companies announced monday .
the order was worth move than $ 8 billion , according to airbus commercial director john leahy .
airbus has fallen far behind boeing for new orders in 2007 after being overtaken by the us manufacturer in 2006 .
but chief executive louis gallois hinted that more new business was to come .
including the order from qatar airways , only 93 orders have been announced by airbus since the launch of the 10 billion euro a350 program at the end of 2006 .
weak dollar hurting airbus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus and boeing are expected to make more new order announcements this week the european manufacturer has had major production and design problems in the last few years and tallied up losses last year after a profit of 2.3 billion euros in 2006 .
a weak dollar has also made buying from airbus expensive as international deals are usually made in dollars , not euros .
" we have to make airbus competitive at an exchange rate of 1.45 dollars per euro , " gallois told reporters before the show .
the current exchange rate is $ 1.34 to the euro .
" if the euro continues to rise , it will force us to make new decisions about where production is located . "
earlier this year airbus announced a restructuring plan that executives said could save 5 billion euros by 2010 and 2.1 billion euros per year thereafter and may lead to as many as 10,000 job cuts .
airbus employs 56,000 people , including 22,000 in france and 21,000 in germany .
deliveries of the a380 , which is to enter service later this year , are running about two years behind schedule and airbus is keen to shore up confidence in the project .
airbus was also forced to re-design its a350 , which re-emerged with an enlarged body , after a poor response from clients to the original shape .
new orders at boeing , too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 400,000 visitors are expected at the air show boeing meanwhile has sprinted ahead in large part because of the popularity of its future mid-sized 787 model , which will enter service in mid-2008 , five years ahead of the a350 .
at the end of may , airbus had reported 201 new orders for planes this year , while boeing had 429 at the beginning of june .
the us-based group received a boost from aircraft leasing group gecas on monday , which said it had placed a firm order for six boeing 777 cargo aircraft .
about 400,000 people are expected to visit the event , which features air displays as well as exhibitions , at the le bourget airfield on the outskirts of paris .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 18.06.2007 women still face uphill battle in business world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women only make up eight percent of managerial posts in europe a recent high-powered summit in berlin to improve women 's economic opportunities amid intense global competition underlined the dearth of female representatives in boardrooms across europe . women in european countries to date still constitute only eight percent of managerial positions , according to the european women ’ s network . speaking at the 17th global summit of women that took place in berlin last week , mirrella visser , a president of the european women ’ s network said she is the first women to be on a company board in the netherlands . however , other male members of the board sometimes intimidate her , she said .
" maybe these men do this to me because they do not believe in women making decisions . " according to research revealed at the summit , the netherlands and the united kingdom are the two countries that have the highest percentage of women in decision-making positions . visser said it remains hard for women to climb the career ladder since unlike other countries , " the netherlands does not have a legislator that could back women up and to get to the top , you have to be on your own . " " davos for women " the challenges facing women in the business world was one of the core themes of the summit which is also known as the " davos for women . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian president vaira vike-freiberga took part in the summit an annual occurrence , the three-day meeting this time drew over 1,000 female government and business leaders - most of them top corporate executives - from 95 countries .
participants included latvian president , vaira vike-freiberga and vice president of microsoft usa , gerri elliot . irene natividad , president of the summit said the meet allows women across borders , disciplines and cultures to learn from each other in their ongoing work towards economic equity . " sustainability and growth in our global economy would be unthinkable without women " natividad said . she admitted that there were n't enough women in top managerial positions and emphasized the need to change the mind-set of both men and women . " many corporate leaders still view the inclusion of women board directors as a matter of political correctness or as a form of affirmative action to address past inequities . "
she said both views are misguided approaches that merely entrench opposition to diversifying corporate boardrooms . women as stakeholders experts point out that companies can ill-afford to shut out women from decision-making positions given that women are increasingly turning important stakeholders enabling firms to better compete globally . " they -lrb- women -rrb- constitute 50 percent of the world ’ s workers , run over 40 percent of small businesses and make 80 percent of consumer buying decisions , " said natividad . the summit threw up a host of ideas to help ease the way for women aspiring to managerial levels and positions of power in the business world . some pointed out that corporate power circles still remains a boys ' club .
mirrella visser said that male networking is always the easier way to get there . she emphasized that " women need to market themselves and create a network with men who are in decision-making -lrb- positions -rrb- because when there is a position up there , they will recommend them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men have it easier making it to the top of the corporate world jacqueline ford , an executive with ibm in the us - which has more women in managerial positions than any other country - said more has to be done to change the mindset of societies in accepting women as equal partners in the corporate world as well as creating legislation to help smooth the path . " women who are in government decision making should advocate for laws that could help women to reach to the top managerial positions , " ford said . germany lags behind in europe according to the study published during the summit , german companies tend to have the lowest number of women in managerial positions in western europe . susan unger , senior vice president and chief information officer at daimler chrysler and one of the few german women executives said one of the main barriers faced by german women is juggling family and work . " women have to work and take care of their families , so it is not easy for them to do both efficiently .
companies have to cater for women and help create infrastructure that could help in the know how technology , " unger said . unger , who has been working for the carmaker for 35 years , pointed out that daimler chrysler has created 350 children ’ s day care centers for employees , especially women . " the initiative is to relieve the heavy burden from women , " she said , adding that women too had a role to play if they were aiming for the top .
women must contribute by empowering themselves with well advanced skills and must network with role models and mentors , unger said .
she also urged big companies to recognize women ’ s capability and strengths when making top appointments .

survivors said the children were forced to stay in the building to act as " human shields " for militants suspected to be there .
is there any proof the taliban acts in this way ? citha d. maass : naturally , there is no proof , but time and again over the last few months we have received reports that the taliban uses this tactic .
it is certainly a part of the taliban 's tactics , and that creates an enormous dilemma for nato 's isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- troops since they ca n't get the children out and keep the taliban inside . nato has recently announced that fewer civilians would become victims of the conflict in afghanistan .
how can that be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has some 3,000 soldiers stationed as part of nato forces in afghanistan civilian casualties can not be completely avoided when these types of guerilla tactics are used .
it is really always a balance of proportionality .
are you willing pay the price or should you avoid it ?
when there is secure information available that there really are important taliban members , it is more likely that the order for an air strike is given than if you have solid tips that only nominal members are concerned .
the more civilian victims there are the more upset the population becomes about the isaf troops . what exactly happens when an attack kills civilians ? part of the taliban 's tactics is to incite resentment and anger that can then be shown in demonstrations aimed at the isaf troops or in protests against support of civilian reconstruction .
you can try to clarify the situation for the population , but that , of course , is only possible in a relatively minor way .
in the end , the taliban probably have more leverage . does that mean that the tactic of using " human shields " seriously endangers the international soldiers ' mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters rely on guerrilla tactics to match nato 's military might yes .
that 's the intent of this asymmetrical guerrilla tactic .
on one hand are the well-armed isaf military troops and on the other are guerrilla fighters like the taliban who , with the help of " civilian shields " and suicide attacks , conduct pinprick attacks .
they are trying to unsettle the isaf troops and to stir up the population 's mood against the international troops . according to nato diplomats , soldiers in the operation enduring freedom are mainly responsible for the civilian casualties .
is there a possibility that isaf troops are being more careful ? isaf has a different mandate - a different way of operating .
but we have to take a special look at the south - and that is the area that is most affected - and how the two groups work together .
the isaf troops do not have any air support of their own .
that means when they get into an ambush they have to order air support for their own defense .
this comes from the americans , who are operating under the enduring freedom mandate .
that makes it impossible to say who acts how .
instead it 's simply a compound approach in which the air attack comes from enduring freedom planes .
when an isaf patrol ends up in an ambush it naturally tries to get free , that 's the nature of the situation , and in such a case both units of soldiers are connected . you said that civilian casualties can not be completely avoided , that you have to consider them against the benefits in each case .
is n't that cynical when people 's lives are being sacrificed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tornado warplanes are being used to find taliban outposts no , the isaf side has recognized that the taliban is using this tactic to stir up the population against the international troops .
because of that they have become more and more careful .
but the casualties can not be fundamentally avoided because they are part of guerrilla tactics .
i would definitely not call it cynical , because i am sure in every case there is a careful consideration of whether or not to attack .
such an attack can both protect the international troops and at the same time destroy a religious school where taliban troops barricaded themselves . in an interview with deutsche welle , secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said that nato is " in a different moral category " than the taliban .
do people in afghanistan also see it that way ? i doubt that because the people who are in southern afghanistan , which is economically weak after several years of drought , are fighting to survive .

survivors said the children were forced to stay in the building to act as " human shields " for militants suspected to be there .
is there any proof the taliban acts in this way ? citha d. maass : naturally , there is no proof , but time and again over the last few months we have received reports that the taliban uses this tactic .
it is certainly a part of the taliban 's tactics , and that creates an enormous dilemma for nato 's isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- troops since they ca n't get the children out and keep the taliban inside . nato has recently announced that fewer civilians would become victims of the conflict in afghanistan .
how can that be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has some 3,000 soldiers stationed as part of nato forces in afghanistan civilian casualties can not be completely avoided when these types of guerilla tactics are used .
it is really always a balance of proportionality .
are you willing pay the price or should you avoid it ?
when there is secure information available that there really are important taliban members , it is more likely that the order for an air strike is given than if you have solid tips that only nominal members are concerned .
the more civilian victims there are the more upset the population becomes about the isaf troops . what exactly happens when an attack kills civilians ? part of the taliban 's tactics is to incite resentment and anger that can then be shown in demonstrations aimed at the isaf troops or in protests against support of civilian reconstruction .
you can try to clarify the situation for the population , but that , of course , is only possible in a relatively minor way .
in the end , the taliban probably have more leverage . does that mean that the tactic of using " human shields " seriously endangers the international soldiers ' mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters rely on guerrilla tactics to match nato 's military might yes .
that 's the intent of this asymmetrical guerrilla tactic .
on one hand are the well-armed isaf military troops and on the other are guerrilla fighters like the taliban who , with the help of " civilian shields " and suicide attacks , conduct pinprick attacks .
they are trying to unsettle the isaf troops and to stir up the population 's mood against the international troops . according to nato diplomats , soldiers in the operation enduring freedom are mainly responsible for the civilian casualties .
is there a possibility that isaf troops are being more careful ? isaf has a different mandate - a different way of operating .
but we have to take a special look at the south - and that is the area that is most affected - and how the two groups work together .
the isaf troops do not have any air support of their own .
that means when they get into an ambush they have to order air support for their own defense .
this comes from the americans , who are operating under the enduring freedom mandate .
that makes it impossible to say who acts how .
instead it 's simply a compound approach in which the air attack comes from enduring freedom planes .
when an isaf patrol ends up in an ambush it naturally tries to get free , that 's the nature of the situation , and in such a case both units of soldiers are connected . you said that civilian casualties can not be completely avoided , that you have to consider them against the benefits in each case .

in the first hours of the paris event , the european group orchestrated the announcement of new orders for its troubled superjumbo a380 from qatar airways and dubai-based emirates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a350 underwent major changes after clients were unhappy with its shape at an airbus press conference , qatar airways said it would buy three additional a380 superjumbos and confirmed a previous order for 80 mid-sized a350s .
the planes would be worth slightly more than $ 18 billion dollars -lrb- 13.4 billion euros -rrb- at catalog prices .
soon afterwards , emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said his company planned to buy eight more a380s worth $ 2.5 billion at catalog prices .
emirates was already the single biggest client for the a380 with an order for 43 of the aircraft .
american carrier us airways also signed a letter of intent on monday to buy 92 airbus aircraft in the a350 , a330 and a320 families , the two companies announced monday .
the order was worth move than $ 8 billion , according to airbus commercial director john leahy .
airbus has fallen far behind boeing for new orders in 2007 after being overtaken by the us manufacturer in 2006 .
but chief executive louis gallois hinted that more new business was to come .
including the order from qatar airways , only 93 orders have been announced by airbus since the launch of the 10 billion euro a350 program at the end of 2006 .
weak dollar hurting airbus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus and boeing are expected to make more new order announcements this week the european manufacturer has had major production and design problems in the last few years and tallied up losses last year after a profit of 2.3 billion euros in 2006 .
a weak dollar has also made buying from airbus expensive as international deals are usually made in dollars , not euros .
" we have to make airbus competitive at an exchange rate of 1.45 dollars per euro , " gallois told reporters before the show .
the current exchange rate is $ 1.34 to the euro .
" if the euro continues to rise , it will force us to make new decisions about where production is located . "
earlier this year airbus announced a restructuring plan that executives said could save 5 billion euros by 2010 and 2.1 billion euros per year thereafter and may lead to as many as 10,000 job cuts .
airbus employs 56,000 people , including 22,000 in france and 21,000 in germany .
deliveries of the a380 , which is to enter service later this year , are running about two years behind schedule and airbus is keen to shore up confidence in the project .
airbus was also forced to re-design its a350 , which re-emerged with an enlarged body , after a poor response from clients to the original shape .
new orders at boeing , too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 400,000 visitors are expected at the air show boeing meanwhile has sprinted ahead in large part because of the popularity of its future mid-sized 787 model , which will enter service in mid-2008 , five years ahead of the a350 .
at the end of may , airbus had reported 201 new orders for planes this year , while boeing had 429 at the beginning of june .
the us-based group received a boost from aircraft leasing group gecas on monday , which said it had placed a firm order for six boeing 777 cargo aircraft .
about 400,000 people are expected to visit the event , which features air displays as well as exhibitions , at the le bourget airfield on the outskirts of paris .

amnesty and others support an eu wide migration policy guided by humanitarian principles . malta , which joined the eu in 2004 , is now at the forefront of a battle against illegal immigration , as scores of desperate african migrants in fishing boats risk their lives to reach european shores . many migrants hope that if they make it from the libyan coast to the tiny mediterranean island , which is south of sicily , they can start a new life anywhere in the european union . malta , which has been the destination of more than 7,000 illegal refugees over the past few years , is refusing to accept any more newcomers now , leaving boatloads of africans either to their fate in the turbulent mediterranean waters or in detention camps behind barbed wire . on monday at a berlin symposium , the human rights organization amnesty international lambasted the european union for its failure to support malta in its struggle to deal with the human tide from the horn of africa . mediterranean countries unfairly burdened it is the southern rim of the eu that is feeling the strain – malta , spain and italy , countries which want the rest of the bloc to do their fair share in taking in the illegal immigrants . the spanish canary islands off the western coast of africa , a favorite holiday destination for german and british tourists , was inundated with more than 30,000 refugees last year .
and lampedusa , an italian island which is closer to tunisia than it is to mainland italy , has also been targeted by a continuous flow of migrants from countries such as senegal , mauritius or eritrea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugee in detention camps or left to fate at sea amnesty said that eu countries still have capacities for immigration and called for a european wide asylum policy guided by humanitarian principles . at last week 's meeting , the eu interior ministers brushed aside malta 's plea for a fair distribution of the immigrants among all eu member states .
fears in european capitals of a tidal wave from africa are unfounded however , speakers at the symposium said . number of asylum seekers dropped drastically the number of asylum-seekers in germany for example has dropped from more than 400,000 in the mid-1990s to merely 20,000 last year . there are huge capacities within the eu to absorb more people in need of help , according to richard williams of the human rights group european council for refugees in exile -lrb- ecre -rrb- , who called for an easing of immigration laws across europe . " we 've created an asylum system that is so harsh , where the chances of being detained are very high , where the chances of being refused asylum on spurious grounds are very high , and the chances of being sent back to a country where you do n't feel safe , are very high , " williams told dw-radio .
" people feel safer not to apply for asylum - to still come , but to remain underground . " the existing patchwork of national laws fosters illegal immigration , said peter altmaier , undersecretary in the german interior ministry in a radio interview .
at present there are 20 different national policies in the 27 member bloc , which apply very different treatment standards to refugees , but the european commission wants harmonized rules to be in place by 2010 . " we have to fight illegal immigration because these people are exploited by criminal organizations , " altmaier said .
" at the same time we have to offer perspectives for legal migration .
and we also need a very strong humanitarian signal that we can not allow people to die in the mediterranean sea . " eu interested in common asylum policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu needs a common migration policy the eu 's external border agency frontex will soon begin patrolling the waters off malta to rescue illegal immigrants , altmaier said .
however amnesty claimed that boat commanders are usually told to keep the refugees off territorial waters instead of guiding them safely ashore in europe .
although frontex has 100 vessels as well as 50 planes and helicopters at its disposal , the aid provided by its response team has been patchy . it is in the interest of the entire eu , not just the mediterranean rim 's " front line states " to absorb asylum seekers , according to williams .
many who have made it to italy 's shores for example , migrate further north anyway , and lodge applications for asylum status in more than a single eu country , a practice called " asylum shopping . " ecre 's williams argued that the free movement of people across the borders of most eu countries provided by the schengen accords means that common rules and safeguards on migration are vital . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" maybe these men do this to me because they do not believe in women making decisions . " according to research revealed at the summit , the netherlands and the united kingdom are the two countries that have the highest percentage of women in decision-making positions . visser said it remains hard for women to climb the career ladder since unlike other countries , " the netherlands does not have a legislator that could back women up and to get to the top , you have to be on your own . " " davos for women " the challenges facing women in the business world was one of the core themes of the summit which is also known as the " davos for women . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian president vaira vike-freiberga took part in the summit an annual occurrence , the three-day meeting this time drew over 1,000 female government and business leaders - most of them top corporate executives - from 95 countries .
participants included latvian president , vaira vike-freiberga and vice president of microsoft usa , gerri elliot . irene natividad , president of the summit said the meet allows women across borders , disciplines and cultures to learn from each other in their ongoing work towards economic equity . " sustainability and growth in our global economy would be unthinkable without women " natividad said . she admitted that there were n't enough women in top managerial positions and emphasized the need to change the mind-set of both men and women . " many corporate leaders still view the inclusion of women board directors as a matter of political correctness or as a form of affirmative action to address past inequities . "
she said both views are misguided approaches that merely entrench opposition to diversifying corporate boardrooms . women as stakeholders experts point out that companies can ill-afford to shut out women from decision-making positions given that women are increasingly turning important stakeholders enabling firms to better compete globally . " they -lrb- women -rrb- constitute 50 percent of the world ’ s workers , run over 40 percent of small businesses and make 80 percent of consumer buying decisions , " said natividad . the summit threw up a host of ideas to help ease the way for women aspiring to managerial levels and positions of power in the business world . some pointed out that corporate power circles still remains a boys ' club .
mirrella visser said that male networking is always the easier way to get there . she emphasized that " women need to market themselves and create a network with men who are in decision-making -lrb- positions -rrb- because when there is a position up there , they will recommend them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men have it easier making it to the top of the corporate world jacqueline ford , an executive with ibm in the us - which has more women in managerial positions than any other country - said more has to be done to change the mindset of societies in accepting women as equal partners in the corporate world as well as creating legislation to help smooth the path . " women who are in government decision making should advocate for laws that could help women to reach to the top managerial positions , " ford said . germany lags behind in europe according to the study published during the summit , german companies tend to have the lowest number of women in managerial positions in western europe . susan unger , senior vice president and chief information officer at daimler chrysler and one of the few german women executives said one of the main barriers faced by german women is juggling family and work . " women have to work and take care of their families , so it is not easy for them to do both efficiently .
companies have to cater for women and help create infrastructure that could help in the know how technology , " unger said . unger , who has been working for the carmaker for 35 years , pointed out that daimler chrysler has created 350 children ’ s day care centers for employees , especially women . " the initiative is to relieve the heavy burden from women , " she said , adding that women too had a role to play if they were aiming for the top .
women must contribute by empowering themselves with well advanced skills and must network with role models and mentors , unger said .
she also urged big companies to recognize women ’ s capability and strengths when making top appointments .

after 12 laps , he emerged from his mercedes s triumphantly , hands bloody and feet burned from the hilly , technical track . racer jackie stewart once famously called it " the green hell . "

lauda 's car swerved off the track at nürburgring , rolled , hit another car and burst into flames .
lauda , trapped inside the car , suffered severe burns on his face , later fell into a coma and nearly died .
the next year , the license for formula one racing was n't renewed .

" maybe these men do this to me because they do not believe in women making decisions . " according to research revealed at the summit , the netherlands and the united kingdom are the two countries that have the highest percentage of women in decision-making positions . visser said it remains hard for women to climb the career ladder since unlike other countries , " the netherlands does not have a legislator that could back women up and to get to the top , you have to be on your own . " " davos for women " the challenges facing women in the business world was one of the core themes of the summit which is also known as the " davos for women . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian president vaira vike-freiberga took part in the summit an annual occurrence , the three-day meeting this time drew over 1,000 female government and business leaders - most of them top corporate executives - from 95 countries .
participants included latvian president , vaira vike-freiberga and vice president of microsoft usa , gerri elliot . irene natividad , president of the summit said the meet allows women across borders , disciplines and cultures to learn from each other in their ongoing work towards economic equity . " sustainability and growth in our global economy would be unthinkable without women " natividad said . she admitted that there were n't enough women in top managerial positions and emphasized the need to change the mind-set of both men and women . " many corporate leaders still view the inclusion of women board directors as a matter of political correctness or as a form of affirmative action to address past inequities . "
she said both views are misguided approaches that merely entrench opposition to diversifying corporate boardrooms . women as stakeholders experts point out that companies can ill-afford to shut out women from decision-making positions given that women are increasingly turning important stakeholders enabling firms to better compete globally . " they -lrb- women -rrb- constitute 50 percent of the world ’ s workers , run over 40 percent of small businesses and make 80 percent of consumer buying decisions , " said natividad . the summit threw up a host of ideas to help ease the way for women aspiring to managerial levels and positions of power in the business world . some pointed out that corporate power circles still remains a boys ' club .
mirrella visser said that male networking is always the easier way to get there . she emphasized that " women need to market themselves and create a network with men who are in decision-making -lrb- positions -rrb- because when there is a position up there , they will recommend them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men have it easier making it to the top of the corporate world jacqueline ford , an executive with ibm in the us - which has more women in managerial positions than any other country - said more has to be done to change the mindset of societies in accepting women as equal partners in the corporate world as well as creating legislation to help smooth the path . " women who are in government decision making should advocate for laws that could help women to reach to the top managerial positions , " ford said . germany lags behind in europe according to the study published during the summit , german companies tend to have the lowest number of women in managerial positions in western europe . susan unger , senior vice president and chief information officer at daimler chrysler and one of the few german women executives said one of the main barriers faced by german women is juggling family and work . " women have to work and take care of their families , so it is not easy for them to do both efficiently .
companies have to cater for women and help create infrastructure that could help in the know how technology , " unger said . unger , who has been working for the carmaker for 35 years , pointed out that daimler chrysler has created 350 children ’ s day care centers for employees , especially women . " the initiative is to relieve the heavy burden from women , " she said , adding that women too had a role to play if they were aiming for the top .
women must contribute by empowering themselves with well advanced skills and must network with role models and mentors , unger said .
she also urged big companies to recognize women ’ s capability and strengths when making top appointments . " it ’ s a long and tough road , but as germans we must initiate for change , " she said . mathapeli ramonotsi send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the first hours of the paris event , the european group orchestrated the announcement of new orders for its troubled superjumbo a380 from qatar airways and dubai-based emirates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a350 underwent major changes after clients were unhappy with its shape at an airbus press conference , qatar airways said it would buy three additional a380 superjumbos and confirmed a previous order for 80 mid-sized a350s .
the planes would be worth slightly more than $ 18 billion dollars -lrb- 13.4 billion euros -rrb- at catalog prices .
soon afterwards , emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said his company planned to buy eight more a380s worth $ 2.5 billion at catalog prices .
emirates was already the single biggest client for the a380 with an order for 43 of the aircraft .
american carrier us airways also signed a letter of intent on monday to buy 92 airbus aircraft in the a350 , a330 and a320 families , the two companies announced monday .
the order was worth move than $ 8 billion , according to airbus commercial director john leahy .
airbus has fallen far behind boeing for new orders in 2007 after being overtaken by the us manufacturer in 2006 .
but chief executive louis gallois hinted that more new business was to come .

a weak dollar has also made buying from airbus expensive as international deals are usually made in dollars , not euros .
" we have to make airbus competitive at an exchange rate of 1.45 dollars per euro , " gallois told reporters before the show .
the current exchange rate is $ 1.34 to the euro .
" if the euro continues to rise , it will force us to make new decisions about where production is located . "
earlier this year airbus announced a restructuring plan that executives said could save 5 billion euros by 2010 and 2.1 billion euros per year thereafter and may lead to as many as 10,000 job cuts .
airbus employs 56,000 people , including 22,000 in france and 21,000 in germany .
deliveries of the a380 , which is to enter service later this year , are running about two years behind schedule and airbus is keen to shore up confidence in the project .
airbus was also forced to re-design its a350 , which re-emerged with an enlarged body , after a poor response from clients to the original shape .
new orders at boeing , too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 400,000 visitors are expected at the air show boeing meanwhile has sprinted ahead in large part because of the popularity of its future mid-sized 787 model , which will enter service in mid-2008 , five years ahead of the a350 .
at the end of may , airbus had reported 201 new orders for planes this year , while boeing had 429 at the beginning of june .
the us-based group received a boost from aircraft leasing group gecas on monday , which said it had placed a firm order for six boeing 777 cargo aircraft .
about 400,000 people are expected to visit the event , which features air displays as well as exhibitions , at the le bourget airfield on the outskirts of paris .
organizers decided to pay tribute to the helicopter this year , which is celebrating its 100th anniversary . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" maybe these men do this to me because they do not believe in women making decisions . " according to research revealed at the summit , the netherlands and the united kingdom are the two countries that have the highest percentage of women in decision-making positions . visser said it remains hard for women to climb the career ladder since unlike other countries , " the netherlands does not have a legislator that could back women up and to get to the top , you have to be on your own . " " davos for women " the challenges facing women in the business world was one of the core themes of the summit which is also known as the " davos for women . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian president vaira vike-freiberga took part in the summit an annual occurrence , the three-day meeting this time drew over 1,000 female government and business leaders - most of them top corporate executives - from 95 countries .
participants included latvian president , vaira vike-freiberga and vice president of microsoft usa , gerri elliot . irene natividad , president of the summit said the meet allows women across borders , disciplines and cultures to learn from each other in their ongoing work towards economic equity . " sustainability and growth in our global economy would be unthinkable without women " natividad said . she admitted that there were n't enough women in top managerial positions and emphasized the need to change the mind-set of both men and women . " many corporate leaders still view the inclusion of women board directors as a matter of political correctness or as a form of affirmative action to address past inequities . "
she said both views are misguided approaches that merely entrench opposition to diversifying corporate boardrooms . women as stakeholders experts point out that companies can ill-afford to shut out women from decision-making positions given that women are increasingly turning important stakeholders enabling firms to better compete globally . " they -lrb- women -rrb- constitute 50 percent of the world ’ s workers , run over 40 percent of small businesses and make 80 percent of consumer buying decisions , " said natividad . the summit threw up a host of ideas to help ease the way for women aspiring to managerial levels and positions of power in the business world . some pointed out that corporate power circles still remains a boys ' club .
mirrella visser said that male networking is always the easier way to get there . she emphasized that " women need to market themselves and create a network with men who are in decision-making -lrb- positions -rrb- because when there is a position up there , they will recommend them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men have it easier making it to the top of the corporate world jacqueline ford , an executive with ibm in the us - which has more women in managerial positions than any other country - said more has to be done to change the mindset of societies in accepting women as equal partners in the corporate world as well as creating legislation to help smooth the path . " women who are in government decision making should advocate for laws that could help women to reach to the top managerial positions , " ford said . germany lags behind in europe according to the study published during the summit , german companies tend to have the lowest number of women in managerial positions in western europe . susan unger , senior vice president and chief information officer at daimler chrysler and one of the few german women executives said one of the main barriers faced by german women is juggling family and work . " women have to work and take care of their families , so it is not easy for them to do both efficiently .
companies have to cater for women and help create infrastructure that could help in the know how technology , " unger said . unger , who has been working for the carmaker for 35 years , pointed out that daimler chrysler has created 350 children ’ s day care centers for employees , especially women . " the initiative is to relieve the heavy burden from women , " she said , adding that women too had a role to play if they were aiming for the top .
women must contribute by empowering themselves with well advanced skills and must network with role models and mentors , unger said .
she also urged big companies to recognize women ’ s capability and strengths when making top appointments .

" maybe these men do this to me because they do not believe in women making decisions . " according to research revealed at the summit , the netherlands and the united kingdom are the two countries that have the highest percentage of women in decision-making positions . visser said it remains hard for women to climb the career ladder since unlike other countries , " the netherlands does not have a legislator that could back women up and to get to the top , you have to be on your own .

that said , the international community should avoid taking sides in palestine 's internal power struggle , says deutsche welle 's rainer sollich . everyone supports mahmoud abbas : the united states , the united nations and the european union .
israel also sets big hopes on the palestinian president after the military victory of hamas in the gaza strip .
as far as the current situation goes , abbas has earned this broad support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer sollich the violent frenzy of the hamas fighters in the gaza strip can not be excused as a justifiable protest against discrimination or corruption - it is a coup against political institutions .
hamas has deepened the split of the palestinian nation .
and hamas has made the population of the gaza strip hostage to a policy that could drive the region to increasingly hopeless isolation and poverty .
a future without hamas ?
in this situation , it seems unlikely that the international community will completely abandon the palestinians .
the lifting of the embargo put in place a year and a half ago after the election victory of hamas now seems feasible for the west bank .
that would clearly strengthen abbas and his moderate course vis-à-vis israel .
and it is also a clear show of faith for the new , hamas-free transitional cabinet under the existing palestinian finance minister salam fayyad .
israel 's prime minster ehud olmert can already imagine a peace treaty " without hamas . "
this position has takers in both the us and europe .
but caution is warranted .
hamas is and remains a considerable power factor with popularity beyond the gaza strip .
after all , the islamists won the last elections with an absolute majority and in this case justifiably demanded a share of power .
preventing humanitarian disaster the international community is presented with a difficult challenge : it should never accept terror or the hamas-declared goal of destroying israel .
but the international community should also not take sides in an internal palestinian power struggle .
apart from strengthening abbas , steps should be taken to make contact with moderate powers within hamas and to assist them if necessary .
there 's no disputing that an abbas-controlled west bank would be the better model for a future palestinian state and should be treated and supported accordingly .
but at the same time , it 's important to avoid allowing the gaza strip to drift completely into a humanitarian disaster . the people there should not be punished for failed hamas policies .
that would only lead to further radicalization and violence .

amnesty and others support an eu wide migration policy guided by humanitarian principles . malta , which joined the eu in 2004 , is now at the forefront of a battle against illegal immigration , as scores of desperate african migrants in fishing boats risk their lives to reach european shores . many migrants hope that if they make it from the libyan coast to the tiny mediterranean island , which is south of sicily , they can start a new life anywhere in the european union . malta , which has been the destination of more than 7,000 illegal refugees over the past few years , is refusing to accept any more newcomers now , leaving boatloads of africans either to their fate in the turbulent mediterranean waters or in detention camps behind barbed wire . on monday at a berlin symposium , the human rights organization amnesty international lambasted the european union for its failure to support malta in its struggle to deal with the human tide from the horn of africa . mediterranean countries unfairly burdened it is the southern rim of the eu that is feeling the strain – malta , spain and italy , countries which want the rest of the bloc to do their fair share in taking in the illegal immigrants . the spanish canary islands off the western coast of africa , a favorite holiday destination for german and british tourists , was inundated with more than 30,000 refugees last year .
and lampedusa , an italian island which is closer to tunisia than it is to mainland italy , has also been targeted by a continuous flow of migrants from countries such as senegal , mauritius or eritrea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugee in detention camps or left to fate at sea amnesty said that eu countries still have capacities for immigration and called for a european wide asylum policy guided by humanitarian principles . at last week 's meeting , the eu interior ministers brushed aside malta 's plea for a fair distribution of the immigrants among all eu member states .
fears in european capitals of a tidal wave from africa are unfounded however , speakers at the symposium said . number of asylum seekers dropped drastically the number of asylum-seekers in germany for example has dropped from more than 400,000 in the mid-1990s to merely 20,000 last year . there are huge capacities within the eu to absorb more people in need of help , according to richard williams of the human rights group european council for refugees in exile -lrb- ecre -rrb- , who called for an easing of immigration laws across europe . " we 've created an asylum system that is so harsh , where the chances of being detained are very high , where the chances of being refused asylum on spurious grounds are very high , and the chances of being sent back to a country where you do n't feel safe , are very high , " williams told dw-radio .
" people feel safer not to apply for asylum - to still come , but to remain underground . " the existing patchwork of national laws fosters illegal immigration , said peter altmaier , undersecretary in the german interior ministry in a radio interview .
at present there are 20 different national policies in the 27 member bloc , which apply very different treatment standards to refugees , but the european commission wants harmonized rules to be in place by 2010 . " we have to fight illegal immigration because these people are exploited by criminal organizations , " altmaier said .
" at the same time we have to offer perspectives for legal migration .
and we also need a very strong humanitarian signal that we can not allow people to die in the mediterranean sea . " eu interested in common asylum policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu needs a common migration policy the eu 's external border agency frontex will soon begin patrolling the waters off malta to rescue illegal immigrants , altmaier said .
however amnesty claimed that boat commanders are usually told to keep the refugees off territorial waters instead of guiding them safely ashore in europe .
although frontex has 100 vessels as well as 50 planes and helicopters at its disposal , the aid provided by its response team has been patchy . it is in the interest of the entire eu , not just the mediterranean rim 's " front line states " to absorb asylum seekers , according to williams .
many who have made it to italy 's shores for example , migrate further north anyway , and lodge applications for asylum status in more than a single eu country , a practice called " asylum shopping . " ecre 's williams argued that the free movement of people across the borders of most eu countries provided by the schengen accords means that common rules and safeguards on migration are vital . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the first hours of the paris event , the european group orchestrated the announcement of new orders for its troubled superjumbo a380 from qatar airways and dubai-based emirates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a350 underwent major changes after clients were unhappy with its shape at an airbus press conference , qatar airways said it would buy three additional a380 superjumbos and confirmed a previous order for 80 mid-sized a350s .
the planes would be worth slightly more than $ 18 billion dollars -lrb- 13.4 billion euros -rrb- at catalog prices .
soon afterwards , emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said his company planned to buy eight more a380s worth $ 2.5 billion at catalog prices .
emirates was already the single biggest client for the a380 with an order for 43 of the aircraft .
american carrier us airways also signed a letter of intent on monday to buy 92 airbus aircraft in the a350 , a330 and a320 families , the two companies announced monday .
the order was worth move than $ 8 billion , according to airbus commercial director john leahy .
airbus has fallen far behind boeing for new orders in 2007 after being overtaken by the us manufacturer in 2006 .
but chief executive louis gallois hinted that more new business was to come .
including the order from qatar airways , only 93 orders have been announced by airbus since the launch of the 10 billion euro a350 program at the end of 2006 .
weak dollar hurting airbus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus and boeing are expected to make more new order announcements this week the european manufacturer has had major production and design problems in the last few years and tallied up losses last year after a profit of 2.3 billion euros in 2006 .
a weak dollar has also made buying from airbus expensive as international deals are usually made in dollars , not euros .
" we have to make airbus competitive at an exchange rate of 1.45 dollars per euro , " gallois told reporters before the show .
the current exchange rate is $ 1.34 to the euro .
" if the euro continues to rise , it will force us to make new decisions about where production is located . "
earlier this year airbus announced a restructuring plan that executives said could save 5 billion euros by 2010 and 2.1 billion euros per year thereafter and may lead to as many as 10,000 job cuts .
airbus employs 56,000 people , including 22,000 in france and 21,000 in germany .
deliveries of the a380 , which is to enter service later this year , are running about two years behind schedule and airbus is keen to shore up confidence in the project .
airbus was also forced to re-design its a350 , which re-emerged with an enlarged body , after a poor response from clients to the original shape .
new orders at boeing , too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 400,000 visitors are expected at the air show boeing meanwhile has sprinted ahead in large part because of the popularity of its future mid-sized 787 model , which will enter service in mid-2008 , five years ahead of the a350 .
at the end of may , airbus had reported 201 new orders for planes this year , while boeing had 429 at the beginning of june .
the us-based group received a boost from aircraft leasing group gecas on monday , which said it had placed a firm order for six boeing 777 cargo aircraft .
about 400,000 people are expected to visit the event , which features air displays as well as exhibitions , at the le bourget airfield on the outskirts of paris .
organizers decided to pay tribute to the helicopter this year , which is celebrating its 100th anniversary . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu member states have agreed to drop symbolic elements of the new treaty , but a meeting of german and polish leaders over the weekend failed to resolve an impasse over the bloc 's voting structure . when chancellor angela merkel convenes an eu summit on a new slimmed-down treaty towards the end of germany 's six-month rotating presidency on thursday and friday , the 27 member states are expected to be split into three broad camps .
merkel wants to establish a road map for the conference to adopt a new eu treaty . first , there are 22 countries , which are in favor of the defunct constitution that was ratified already by 18 members .
the next group are euro-skeptic countries such as britain and the czech republic , which would have likely voted against the old document , but never got around to casting their ballots after it was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 . and then there are the poles , in a camp of their own .
at issue is the eu ’ s reformed voting structure in which each member state carries a certain weight based on their population base .
the poles argue that the current double voting structure gives disproportionate power to large eu countries , such as germany , and that merkel is acting in her country ’ s national interest , instead of speaking for the entire bloc . eu summit could collapse due to polish position merkel , who met with polish president lech kaczynski this past weekend , said she could not rule out the possibility that the brussels summit could collapse because of the polish position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks over weekend between poland 's kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and merkel stalled " i can only say that it was a very open discussion , but in this matter the positions have not changed , " said merkel . merkel rejected poland 's demand that talks on voting procedures be reopened , saying it was better to leave the agreement , which was reached after long and tough negotiations between all member states , in place . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said he backed merkel 's position in the stand-off .
" if this summit fails , then it certainly will not be the fault of germany leading the negotiations , " he said , alluding to the impasse created by the polish position against the rest of the eu . " the double-majority system as defined within the constitutional treaty , we can not accept that , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told reporters after eu foreign ministers discussed negotiations for a new treaty reforming the bloc 's institutions . voting formula based on square root of population diplomats said fotyga 's tough 30-minute speech dashed hopes that warsaw was starting to soften its stance after the meeting between merkel and kaczynski . under the current reform , most eu decisions would require the support of 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the population .
poland , which has less than half of germany 's population , has proposed an alternative based on a mathematical square root of each country 's population . warsaw is cross that even a discussion of their alternative is off the table on merkel 's agenda at the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and dutch " no " votes in 2005 plunged the eu into crisis the poles , who are overwhelmingly catholic , insist that they are willing to compromise .

" looking for a compromise solution is a better way of building a country 's position than putting a spanner in the works , " he told dw-radio . according to other critics , kaczynski and his twin brother jaroslaw , who is prime minister , are reluctant to back down on the issue of voting rights because of their suspicion of germany ’ s motives . " the kaczynski brothers focus too much on the difficult history between poland and germany , which seems to cloud their vision of europe , " said european affairs analyst andrzej krajewski of the batory foundation . britain and netherlands have special demands too besides poland , britain and the netherlands have also set out their own demands .

in the first hours of the paris event , the european group orchestrated the announcement of new orders for its troubled superjumbo a380 from qatar airways and dubai-based emirates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a350 underwent major changes after clients were unhappy with its shape at an airbus press conference , qatar airways said it would buy three additional a380 superjumbos and confirmed a previous order for 80 mid-sized a350s .
the planes would be worth slightly more than $ 18 billion dollars -lrb- 13.4 billion euros -rrb- at catalog prices .
soon afterwards , emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said his company planned to buy eight more a380s worth $ 2.5 billion at catalog prices .
emirates was already the single biggest client for the a380 with an order for 43 of the aircraft .
american carrier us airways also signed a letter of intent on monday to buy 92 airbus aircraft in the a350 , a330 and a320 families , the two companies announced monday .
the order was worth move than $ 8 billion , according to airbus commercial director john leahy .
airbus has fallen far behind boeing for new orders in 2007 after being overtaken by the us manufacturer in 2006 .
but chief executive louis gallois hinted that more new business was to come .
including the order from qatar airways , only 93 orders have been announced by airbus since the launch of the 10 billion euro a350 program at the end of 2006 .
weak dollar hurting airbus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus and boeing are expected to make more new order announcements this week the european manufacturer has had major production and design problems in the last few years and tallied up losses last year after a profit of 2.3 billion euros in 2006 .
a weak dollar has also made buying from airbus expensive as international deals are usually made in dollars , not euros .
" we have to make airbus competitive at an exchange rate of 1.45 dollars per euro , " gallois told reporters before the show .

" the eu will resume normal relations with the palestinian authority immediately , " the bloc 's ministers said in a text of conclusions from a meeting in luxembourg . the eu partially froze ties with the palestinian government and suspended direct aid when hamas swept to power last year because the islamist movement figures on its blacklist of outlawed " terrorist " groups . the new emergency cabinet does not contain hamas members . the ministers said the eu would " resume direct financial support to the government , " as well as provide support to the palestinian civilian police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana in luxembourg monday it will also undertake " intensive efforts to build the institutions of the future palestinian state . " " part of the money will be direct , " eu foreign and security policy chief javier solana said at a meeting with eu foreign ministers in luxembourg monday .
but " in order to help the palestinian people in gaza , we will need some mechanism that can not be a direct support . "
eu funds would be distributed in gaza through united nations agencies or the eu 's current emergency aid system which sidelines hama leaders in the territory .
the eu chief diplomat did not give details of when the bloc would resume aid payments to the palestinian government . technical details being discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salam fayyad the eu has expressed its support for the emergency cabinet created by abbas .
last week , abbas dissolved the hamas-led unity government and declared a state of emergency .
the militant group launched an all-out assault on fatah 's security forces in gaza , taking complete control of the strip .
more than 100 people were killed in the clashes .
the emergency cabinet is led by former finance minister salam fayyad .
hamas has denounced the new cabinet as illegal .
the recent violence led to the creation of two separately zones : a hamas-ruled gaza and a fatah-controlled west bank .
the islamic militant group is black-listed as a terrorist organization by the eu and the united states .
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told reporters she was still discussing with fayyad the technical details of when and how aid flows would be re-established .
" we are of course ready to continue to work with fayyad in order to be ready in future to see how we can work directly with the emergency government , " ferrero-waldner said .
she said the eu was working closely with the palestinian authority to establish strict financial channels for the resumption of direct assistance .
financial controls on eu aid had to be clearly defined and very transparent , she insisted , adding : " we have to be very careful ... this is not just political but also technical . " humanitarian aid never stopped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas militants have taken over gaza despite the ban on direct assistance to the palestinian authority , european governments have been sending humanitarian aid to both gaza and the west bank .
officials said an estimated 700 million euros -lrb- $ 939 million -rrb- in such emergency aid was sent to gaza and the west bank last year .
the money was used to pay the salaries of teachers , doctors and health workers and for supplies of fuel , water and electricity to the territories .

" the eu will resume normal relations with the palestinian authority immediately , " the bloc 's ministers said in a text of conclusions from a meeting in luxembourg . the eu partially froze ties with the palestinian government and suspended direct aid when hamas swept to power last year because the islamist movement figures on its blacklist of outlawed " terrorist " groups . the new emergency cabinet does not contain hamas members . the ministers said the eu would " resume direct financial support to the government , " as well as provide support to the palestinian civilian police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana in luxembourg monday it will also undertake " intensive efforts to build the institutions of the future palestinian state .

more than 100 people were killed in the clashes .
the emergency cabinet is led by former finance minister salam fayyad .
hamas has denounced the new cabinet as illegal .
the recent violence led to the creation of two separately zones : a hamas-ruled gaza and a fatah-controlled west bank .
the islamic militant group is black-listed as a terrorist organization by the eu and the united states .
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told reporters she was still discussing with fayyad the technical details of when and how aid flows would be re-established .
" we are of course ready to continue to work with fayyad in order to be ready in future to see how we can work directly with the emergency government , " ferrero-waldner said .
she said the eu was working closely with the palestinian authority to establish strict financial channels for the resumption of direct assistance .
financial controls on eu aid had to be clearly defined and very transparent , she insisted , adding : " we have to be very careful ... this is not just political but also technical . " humanitarian aid never stopped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas militants have taken over gaza despite the ban on direct assistance to the palestinian authority , european governments have been sending humanitarian aid to both gaza and the west bank .

the money was used to pay the salaries of teachers , doctors and health workers and for supplies of fuel , water and electricity to the territories .

eu member states have agreed to drop symbolic elements of the new treaty , but a meeting of german and polish leaders over the weekend failed to resolve an impasse over the bloc 's voting structure . when chancellor angela merkel convenes an eu summit on a new slimmed-down treaty towards the end of germany 's six-month rotating presidency on thursday and friday , the 27 member states are expected to be split into three broad camps .
merkel wants to establish a road map for the conference to adopt a new eu treaty . first , there are 22 countries , which are in favor of the defunct constitution that was ratified already by 18 members .
the next group are euro-skeptic countries such as britain and the czech republic , which would have likely voted against the old document , but never got around to casting their ballots after it was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 . and then there are the poles , in a camp of their own .
at issue is the eu ’ s reformed voting structure in which each member state carries a certain weight based on their population base .
the poles argue that the current double voting structure gives disproportionate power to large eu countries , such as germany , and that merkel is acting in her country ’ s national interest , instead of speaking for the entire bloc . eu summit could collapse due to polish position merkel , who met with polish president lech kaczynski this past weekend , said she could not rule out the possibility that the brussels summit could collapse because of the polish position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks over weekend between poland 's kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and merkel stalled " i can only say that it was a very open discussion , but in this matter the positions have not changed , " said merkel . merkel rejected poland 's demand that talks on voting procedures be reopened , saying it was better to leave the agreement , which was reached after long and tough negotiations between all member states , in place . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said he backed merkel 's position in the stand-off .
" if this summit fails , then it certainly will not be the fault of germany leading the negotiations , " he said , alluding to the impasse created by the polish position against the rest of the eu . " the double-majority system as defined within the constitutional treaty , we can not accept that , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told reporters after eu foreign ministers discussed negotiations for a new treaty reforming the bloc 's institutions . voting formula based on square root of population diplomats said fotyga 's tough 30-minute speech dashed hopes that warsaw was starting to soften its stance after the meeting between merkel and kaczynski . under the current reform , most eu decisions would require the support of 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the population .
poland , which has less than half of germany 's population , has proposed an alternative based on a mathematical square root of each country 's population . warsaw is cross that even a discussion of their alternative is off the table on merkel 's agenda at the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and dutch " no " votes in 2005 plunged the eu into crisis the poles , who are overwhelmingly catholic , insist that they are willing to compromise .
for instance , they are willing to drop references to a christian god enshrined in the treaty , which was another bone of contention , but that accepting the " double majority " system of voting , which they threaten to veto , would be a going a step too far . poles divided on government position kaczynski explained that warsaw focused so much on the issue of voting rights , because the voting system would assume a new significance in the reformed european union . polish opposition politicians on the other hand appeared divided on the government ’ s position . while the liberal opposition seems to be leaning toward the government line that countries like poland should be given more voting power within the eu , the democratic left alliance pointed out the flaws of what it regards as kaczynski ’ s intransigence . left-wing opposition leader wojciech olejniczak believes that long-term strategic alliances with major european union partners should matter more than the square root voting system the polish government is pushing for . " looking for a compromise solution is a better way of building a country 's position than putting a spanner in the works , " he told dw-radio . according to other critics , kaczynski and his twin brother jaroslaw , who is prime minister , are reluctant to back down on the issue of voting rights because of their suspicion of germany ’ s motives . " the kaczynski brothers focus too much on the difficult history between poland and germany , which seems to cloud their vision of europe , " said european affairs analyst andrzej krajewski of the batory foundation . britain and netherlands have special demands too besides poland , britain and the netherlands have also set out their own demands .
britain insists that a charter of fundamental rights must not be legally binding and wants an opt-out on judicial and criminal matters , a position that is further complicated by the change in leadership from prime minister tony blair to gordon brown after the summit on june 27 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : change of leadership in britain from blair -lrb- left -rrb- to brown complicates matters the dutch are seeking stronger powers for national parliaments to send back eu draft legislation .
france , which voted against the constitution , and spain , which had already approved it in a referendum , made a joint appeal for a quick , simplified treaty . agreement on a revised treaty at the summit could lift the eu out of its torpor and boost merkel ’ s standing in europe .
but another failure could plunge the bloc into a deeper crisis and institutional gridlock .
it could mean a two-speed europe in which some countries would advance ahead anyway , leaving the naysayers behind . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said some of the most objectionable differences , which are largely symbolic , had been overcome , such as calling the new document an amended treaty as opposed to " constitution . "
beethoven 's " ode to joy " and the eu flag with gold stars against a royal blue background for example , would not be formally enscrined in the new treaty . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

survivors said the children were forced to stay in the building to act as " human shields " for militants suspected to be there .
is there any proof the taliban acts in this way ? citha d. maass : naturally , there is no proof , but time and again over the last few months we have received reports that the taliban uses this tactic .
it is certainly a part of the taliban 's tactics , and that creates an enormous dilemma for nato 's isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- troops since they ca n't get the children out and keep the taliban inside . nato has recently announced that fewer civilians would become victims of the conflict in afghanistan .
how can that be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has some 3,000 soldiers stationed as part of nato forces in afghanistan civilian casualties can not be completely avoided when these types of guerilla tactics are used .
it is really always a balance of proportionality .
are you willing pay the price or should you avoid it ?
when there is secure information available that there really are important taliban members , it is more likely that the order for an air strike is given than if you have solid tips that only nominal members are concerned .
the more civilian victims there are the more upset the population becomes about the isaf troops . what exactly happens when an attack kills civilians ? part of the taliban 's tactics is to incite resentment and anger that can then be shown in demonstrations aimed at the isaf troops or in protests against support of civilian reconstruction .
you can try to clarify the situation for the population , but that , of course , is only possible in a relatively minor way .
in the end , the taliban probably have more leverage . does that mean that the tactic of using " human shields " seriously endangers the international soldiers ' mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters rely on guerrilla tactics to match nato 's military might yes .
that 's the intent of this asymmetrical guerrilla tactic .
on one hand are the well-armed isaf military troops and on the other are guerrilla fighters like the taliban who , with the help of " civilian shields " and suicide attacks , conduct pinprick attacks .
they are trying to unsettle the isaf troops and to stir up the population 's mood against the international troops . according to nato diplomats , soldiers in the operation enduring freedom are mainly responsible for the civilian casualties .
is there a possibility that isaf troops are being more careful ? isaf has a different mandate - a different way of operating .
but we have to take a special look at the south - and that is the area that is most affected - and how the two groups work together .
the isaf troops do not have any air support of their own .
that means when they get into an ambush they have to order air support for their own defense .
this comes from the americans , who are operating under the enduring freedom mandate .
that makes it impossible to say who acts how .
instead it 's simply a compound approach in which the air attack comes from enduring freedom planes .
when an isaf patrol ends up in an ambush it naturally tries to get free , that 's the nature of the situation , and in such a case both units of soldiers are connected . you said that civilian casualties can not be completely avoided , that you have to consider them against the benefits in each case .
is n't that cynical when people 's lives are being sacrificed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tornado warplanes are being used to find taliban outposts no , the isaf side has recognized that the taliban is using this tactic to stir up the population against the international troops .
because of that they have become more and more careful .
but the casualties can not be fundamentally avoided because they are part of guerrilla tactics .
i would definitely not call it cynical , because i am sure in every case there is a careful consideration of whether or not to attack .
such an attack can both protect the international troops and at the same time destroy a religious school where taliban troops barricaded themselves . in an interview with deutsche welle , secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said that nato is " in a different moral category " than the taliban .

amnesty and others support an eu wide migration policy guided by humanitarian principles . malta , which joined the eu in 2004 , is now at the forefront of a battle against illegal immigration , as scores of desperate african migrants in fishing boats risk their lives to reach european shores . many migrants hope that if they make it from the libyan coast to the tiny mediterranean island , which is south of sicily , they can start a new life anywhere in the european union . malta , which has been the destination of more than 7,000 illegal refugees over the past few years , is refusing to accept any more newcomers now , leaving boatloads of africans either to their fate in the turbulent mediterranean waters or in detention camps behind barbed wire . on monday at a berlin symposium , the human rights organization amnesty international lambasted the european union for its failure to support malta in its struggle to deal with the human tide from the horn of africa . mediterranean countries unfairly burdened it is the southern rim of the eu that is feeling the strain – malta , spain and italy , countries which want the rest of the bloc to do their fair share in taking in the illegal immigrants . the spanish canary islands off the western coast of africa , a favorite holiday destination for german and british tourists , was inundated with more than 30,000 refugees last year .
and lampedusa , an italian island which is closer to tunisia than it is to mainland italy , has also been targeted by a continuous flow of migrants from countries such as senegal , mauritius or eritrea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugee in detention camps or left to fate at sea amnesty said that eu countries still have capacities for immigration and called for a european wide asylum policy guided by humanitarian principles . at last week 's meeting , the eu interior ministers brushed aside malta 's plea for a fair distribution of the immigrants among all eu member states .
fears in european capitals of a tidal wave from africa are unfounded however , speakers at the symposium said . number of asylum seekers dropped drastically the number of asylum-seekers in germany for example has dropped from more than 400,000 in the mid-1990s to merely 20,000 last year . there are huge capacities within the eu to absorb more people in need of help , according to richard williams of the human rights group european council for refugees in exile -lrb- ecre -rrb- , who called for an easing of immigration laws across europe . " we 've created an asylum system that is so harsh , where the chances of being detained are very high , where the chances of being refused asylum on spurious grounds are very high , and the chances of being sent back to a country where you do n't feel safe , are very high , " williams told dw-radio .
" people feel safer not to apply for asylum - to still come , but to remain underground . " the existing patchwork of national laws fosters illegal immigration , said peter altmaier , undersecretary in the german interior ministry in a radio interview .
at present there are 20 different national policies in the 27 member bloc , which apply very different treatment standards to refugees , but the european commission wants harmonized rules to be in place by 2010 . " we have to fight illegal immigration because these people are exploited by criminal organizations , " altmaier said .
" at the same time we have to offer perspectives for legal migration .
and we also need a very strong humanitarian signal that we can not allow people to die in the mediterranean sea . " eu interested in common asylum policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu needs a common migration policy the eu 's external border agency frontex will soon begin patrolling the waters off malta to rescue illegal immigrants , altmaier said .
however amnesty claimed that boat commanders are usually told to keep the refugees off territorial waters instead of guiding them safely ashore in europe .
although frontex has 100 vessels as well as 50 planes and helicopters at its disposal , the aid provided by its response team has been patchy . it is in the interest of the entire eu , not just the mediterranean rim 's " front line states " to absorb asylum seekers , according to williams .
many who have made it to italy 's shores for example , migrate further north anyway , and lodge applications for asylum status in more than a single eu country , a practice called " asylum shopping . " ecre 's williams argued that the free movement of people across the borders of most eu countries provided by the schengen accords means that common rules and safeguards on migration are vital . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the eu will resume normal relations with the palestinian authority immediately , " the bloc 's ministers said in a text of conclusions from a meeting in luxembourg . the eu partially froze ties with the palestinian government and suspended direct aid when hamas swept to power last year because the islamist movement figures on its blacklist of outlawed " terrorist " groups . the new emergency cabinet does not contain hamas members . the ministers said the eu would " resume direct financial support to the government , " as well as provide support to the palestinian civilian police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana in luxembourg monday it will also undertake " intensive efforts to build the institutions of the future palestinian state . " " part of the money will be direct , " eu foreign and security policy chief javier solana said at a meeting with eu foreign ministers in luxembourg monday .
but " in order to help the palestinian people in gaza , we will need some mechanism that can not be a direct support . "
eu funds would be distributed in gaza through united nations agencies or the eu 's current emergency aid system which sidelines hama leaders in the territory .
the eu chief diplomat did not give details of when the bloc would resume aid payments to the palestinian government . technical details being discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salam fayyad the eu has expressed its support for the emergency cabinet created by abbas .
last week , abbas dissolved the hamas-led unity government and declared a state of emergency .
the militant group launched an all-out assault on fatah 's security forces in gaza , taking complete control of the strip .
more than 100 people were killed in the clashes .
the emergency cabinet is led by former finance minister salam fayyad .
hamas has denounced the new cabinet as illegal .
the recent violence led to the creation of two separately zones : a hamas-ruled gaza and a fatah-controlled west bank .
the islamic militant group is black-listed as a terrorist organization by the eu and the united states .
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told reporters she was still discussing with fayyad the technical details of when and how aid flows would be re-established .
" we are of course ready to continue to work with fayyad in order to be ready in future to see how we can work directly with the emergency government , " ferrero-waldner said .
she said the eu was working closely with the palestinian authority to establish strict financial channels for the resumption of direct assistance .
financial controls on eu aid had to be clearly defined and very transparent , she insisted , adding : " we have to be very careful ... this is not just political but also technical . " humanitarian aid never stopped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas militants have taken over gaza despite the ban on direct assistance to the palestinian authority , european governments have been sending humanitarian aid to both gaza and the west bank .
officials said an estimated 700 million euros -lrb- $ 939 million -rrb- in such emergency aid was sent to gaza and the west bank last year .
the money was used to pay the salaries of teachers , doctors and health workers and for supplies of fuel , water and electricity to the territories .
once aid flows were re-established , ferrero-waldner said it would be up to fayyad to decide how funds were distributed in gaza .
both solana and ferrero-waldner voiced full confidence in the new palestinian premier , saying they trusted him and had known him for years . israel supports abbas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe suspended its direct aid because of hamas attending eu talks in luxembourg , israeli foreign minister tzipi livni said her government was ready to transfer blocked palestinian tax revenues to the palestinian government . " israel is going to work with abbas and fayyad to transfer the money , " said livni after talks with eu foreign ministers . livni said israel was " not looking for excuses " to delay the delivery of palestinian funds since it wanted to make a clear distinction between palestinian extremists like hamas and the moderate fatah movement of abbas and fayyad . livni did not indicate how much money would be transferred to the palestinians , but eu officials said israel owed up to 850 million dollars in blocked tax money to the palestinians . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier described the israeli move as " significant . " livni said the creation of the emergency palestinian government provided new opportunities for israeli-palestinian peace . isolating hamas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian supporters of hamas celebrate last week the us favors isolating hamas economically , diplomatically and militarily in the gaza strip .
some european diplomats have expressed misgivings about such a strategy .
" the international community does not want two palestinian states , otherwise it will be impossible to find a solution , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
russia wants the emergency cabinet to enter into a " broad dialogue " between all palestinian forces , including hamas . " moscow expects the new emergency cabinet to take all necessary measures to normalize the situation , improve the humanitarian situation ... and above all to halt inter-palestinian conflict , " according to a statement from the russian foreign ministry . " this requires the establishment of broad dialogue between all palestinian political forces including hamas , " the statement said . us also normalizes relations in washington , us secretary of state condoleezza rice meanwhile announced the us government was lifting a 15-month embargo on direct aid to the palestinian territories .
" we intend to lift our financial restrictions on the palestinian government , " she told reporters after meeting abbas in washington .
" this will enable the american people and american financial institutions to resume normal economic and commercial ties with the palestinian government . " we will not leave 1.5 million palestinians at the hands of terrorist organizations , " rice said , referring to the impoverished gaza strip . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

amnesty and others support an eu wide migration policy guided by humanitarian principles . malta , which joined the eu in 2004 , is now at the forefront of a battle against illegal immigration , as scores of desperate african migrants in fishing boats risk their lives to reach european shores . many migrants hope that if they make it from the libyan coast to the tiny mediterranean island , which is south of sicily , they can start a new life anywhere in the european union . malta , which has been the destination of more than 7,000 illegal refugees over the past few years , is refusing to accept any more newcomers now , leaving boatloads of africans either to their fate in the turbulent mediterranean waters or in detention camps behind barbed wire . on monday at a berlin symposium , the human rights organization amnesty international lambasted the european union for its failure to support malta in its struggle to deal with the human tide from the horn of africa . mediterranean countries unfairly burdened it is the southern rim of the eu that is feeling the strain – malta , spain and italy , countries which want the rest of the bloc to do their fair share in taking in the illegal immigrants . the spanish canary islands off the western coast of africa , a favorite holiday destination for german and british tourists , was inundated with more than 30,000 refugees last year .
and lampedusa , an italian island which is closer to tunisia than it is to mainland italy , has also been targeted by a continuous flow of migrants from countries such as senegal , mauritius or eritrea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugee in detention camps or left to fate at sea amnesty said that eu countries still have capacities for immigration and called for a european wide asylum policy guided by humanitarian principles . at last week 's meeting , the eu interior ministers brushed aside malta 's plea for a fair distribution of the immigrants among all eu member states .
fears in european capitals of a tidal wave from africa are unfounded however , speakers at the symposium said . number of asylum seekers dropped drastically the number of asylum-seekers in germany for example has dropped from more than 400,000 in the mid-1990s to merely 20,000 last year . there are huge capacities within the eu to absorb more people in need of help , according to richard williams of the human rights group european council for refugees in exile -lrb- ecre -rrb- , who called for an easing of immigration laws across europe . " we 've created an asylum system that is so harsh , where the chances of being detained are very high , where the chances of being refused asylum on spurious grounds are very high , and the chances of being sent back to a country where you do n't feel safe , are very high , " williams told dw-radio .
" people feel safer not to apply for asylum - to still come , but to remain underground . " the existing patchwork of national laws fosters illegal immigration , said peter altmaier , undersecretary in the german interior ministry in a radio interview .
at present there are 20 different national policies in the 27 member bloc , which apply very different treatment standards to refugees , but the european commission wants harmonized rules to be in place by 2010 . " we have to fight illegal immigration because these people are exploited by criminal organizations , " altmaier said .
" at the same time we have to offer perspectives for legal migration .
and we also need a very strong humanitarian signal that we can not allow people to die in the mediterranean sea . " eu interested in common asylum policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu needs a common migration policy the eu 's external border agency frontex will soon begin patrolling the waters off malta to rescue illegal immigrants , altmaier said .
however amnesty claimed that boat commanders are usually told to keep the refugees off territorial waters instead of guiding them safely ashore in europe .
although frontex has 100 vessels as well as 50 planes and helicopters at its disposal , the aid provided by its response team has been patchy . it is in the interest of the entire eu , not just the mediterranean rim 's " front line states " to absorb asylum seekers , according to williams .
many who have made it to italy 's shores for example , migrate further north anyway , and lodge applications for asylum status in more than a single eu country , a practice called " asylum shopping . " ecre 's williams argued that the free movement of people across the borders of most eu countries provided by the schengen accords means that common rules and safeguards on migration are vital . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 18.06.2007 " civilian casualties can not be completely avoided " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : war planners weigh the potential benefits of an attack with civilian deaths , maass said dw-world.de spoke to afghanistan expert citha d. maass about taliban tactics and civilian casualties after a us airstrike killed seven children who military planners said were being used as human shields . citha d. maass is an afghanistan expert at the german institute for international and security affairs and is currently focusing her work on perspectives for afghanistan 's consolidation . dw-world.de : seven children were killed during a us-led air strike in eastern afghanistan .
survivors said the children were forced to stay in the building to act as " human shields " for militants suspected to be there .
is there any proof the taliban acts in this way ? citha d. maass : naturally , there is no proof , but time and again over the last few months we have received reports that the taliban uses this tactic .
it is certainly a part of the taliban 's tactics , and that creates an enormous dilemma for nato 's isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- troops since they ca n't get the children out and keep the taliban inside . nato has recently announced that fewer civilians would become victims of the conflict in afghanistan .
how can that be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has some 3,000 soldiers stationed as part of nato forces in afghanistan civilian casualties can not be completely avoided when these types of guerilla tactics are used .
it is really always a balance of proportionality .
are you willing pay the price or should you avoid it ?
when there is secure information available that there really are important taliban members , it is more likely that the order for an air strike is given than if you have solid tips that only nominal members are concerned .
the more civilian victims there are the more upset the population becomes about the isaf troops . what exactly happens when an attack kills civilians ? part of the taliban 's tactics is to incite resentment and anger that can then be shown in demonstrations aimed at the isaf troops or in protests against support of civilian reconstruction .
you can try to clarify the situation for the population , but that , of course , is only possible in a relatively minor way .
in the end , the taliban probably have more leverage . does that mean that the tactic of using " human shields " seriously endangers the international soldiers ' mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters rely on guerrilla tactics to match nato 's military might yes .
that 's the intent of this asymmetrical guerrilla tactic .
on one hand are the well-armed isaf military troops and on the other are guerrilla fighters like the taliban who , with the help of " civilian shields " and suicide attacks , conduct pinprick attacks .
they are trying to unsettle the isaf troops and to stir up the population 's mood against the international troops . according to nato diplomats , soldiers in the operation enduring freedom are mainly responsible for the civilian casualties .
is there a possibility that isaf troops are being more careful ? isaf has a different mandate - a different way of operating .
but we have to take a special look at the south - and that is the area that is most affected - and how the two groups work together .
the isaf troops do not have any air support of their own .
that means when they get into an ambush they have to order air support for their own defense .
this comes from the americans , who are operating under the enduring freedom mandate .
that makes it impossible to say who acts how .
instead it 's simply a compound approach in which the air attack comes from enduring freedom planes .
when an isaf patrol ends up in an ambush it naturally tries to get free , that 's the nature of the situation , and in such a case both units of soldiers are connected . you said that civilian casualties can not be completely avoided , that you have to consider them against the benefits in each case .
is n't that cynical when people 's lives are being sacrificed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tornado warplanes are being used to find taliban outposts no , the isaf side has recognized that the taliban is using this tactic to stir up the population against the international troops .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 18.06.2007 " civilian casualties can not be completely avoided " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : war planners weigh the potential benefits of an attack with civilian deaths , maass said dw-world.de spoke to afghanistan expert citha d. maass about taliban tactics and civilian casualties after a us airstrike killed seven children who military planners said were being used as human shields . citha d. maass is an afghanistan expert at the german institute for international and security affairs and is currently focusing her work on perspectives for afghanistan 's consolidation . dw-world.de : seven children were killed during a us-led air strike in eastern afghanistan .
survivors said the children were forced to stay in the building to act as " human shields " for militants suspected to be there .
is there any proof the taliban acts in this way ? citha d. maass : naturally , there is no proof , but time and again over the last few months we have received reports that the taliban uses this tactic .
it is certainly a part of the taliban 's tactics , and that creates an enormous dilemma for nato 's isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- troops since they ca n't get the children out and keep the taliban inside . nato has recently announced that fewer civilians would become victims of the conflict in afghanistan .
how can that be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has some 3,000 soldiers stationed as part of nato forces in afghanistan civilian casualties can not be completely avoided when these types of guerilla tactics are used .
it is really always a balance of proportionality .
are you willing pay the price or should you avoid it ?
when there is secure information available that there really are important taliban members , it is more likely that the order for an air strike is given than if you have solid tips that only nominal members are concerned .
the more civilian victims there are the more upset the population becomes about the isaf troops . what exactly happens when an attack kills civilians ? part of the taliban 's tactics is to incite resentment and anger that can then be shown in demonstrations aimed at the isaf troops or in protests against support of civilian reconstruction .
you can try to clarify the situation for the population , but that , of course , is only possible in a relatively minor way .
in the end , the taliban probably have more leverage . does that mean that the tactic of using " human shields " seriously endangers the international soldiers ' mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters rely on guerrilla tactics to match nato 's military might yes .
that 's the intent of this asymmetrical guerrilla tactic .
on one hand are the well-armed isaf military troops and on the other are guerrilla fighters like the taliban who , with the help of " civilian shields " and suicide attacks , conduct pinprick attacks .
they are trying to unsettle the isaf troops and to stir up the population 's mood against the international troops . according to nato diplomats , soldiers in the operation enduring freedom are mainly responsible for the civilian casualties .
is there a possibility that isaf troops are being more careful ? isaf has a different mandate - a different way of operating .
but we have to take a special look at the south - and that is the area that is most affected - and how the two groups work together .
the isaf troops do not have any air support of their own .
that means when they get into an ambush they have to order air support for their own defense .
this comes from the americans , who are operating under the enduring freedom mandate .
that makes it impossible to say who acts how .
instead it 's simply a compound approach in which the air attack comes from enduring freedom planes .
when an isaf patrol ends up in an ambush it naturally tries to get free , that 's the nature of the situation , and in such a case both units of soldiers are connected . you said that civilian casualties can not be completely avoided , that you have to consider them against the benefits in each case .
is n't that cynical when people 's lives are being sacrificed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tornado warplanes are being used to find taliban outposts no , the isaf side has recognized that the taliban is using this tactic to stir up the population against the international troops .
because of that they have become more and more careful .
but the casualties can not be fundamentally avoided because they are part of guerrilla tactics .
i would definitely not call it cynical , because i am sure in every case there is a careful consideration of whether or not to attack .
such an attack can both protect the international troops and at the same time destroy a religious school where taliban troops barricaded themselves . in an interview with deutsche welle , secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said that nato is " in a different moral category " than the taliban .
do people in afghanistan also see it that way ? i doubt that because the people who are in southern afghanistan , which is economically weak after several years of drought , are fighting to survive .

survivors said the children were forced to stay in the building to act as " human shields " for militants suspected to be there .
is there any proof the taliban acts in this way ? citha d. maass : naturally , there is no proof , but time and again over the last few months we have received reports that the taliban uses this tactic .
it is certainly a part of the taliban 's tactics , and that creates an enormous dilemma for nato 's isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- troops since they ca n't get the children out and keep the taliban inside . nato has recently announced that fewer civilians would become victims of the conflict in afghanistan .
how can that be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has some 3,000 soldiers stationed as part of nato forces in afghanistan civilian casualties can not be completely avoided when these types of guerilla tactics are used .
it is really always a balance of proportionality .
are you willing pay the price or should you avoid it ?
when there is secure information available that there really are important taliban members , it is more likely that the order for an air strike is given than if you have solid tips that only nominal members are concerned .
the more civilian victims there are the more upset the population becomes about the isaf troops . what exactly happens when an attack kills civilians ? part of the taliban 's tactics is to incite resentment and anger that can then be shown in demonstrations aimed at the isaf troops or in protests against support of civilian reconstruction .
you can try to clarify the situation for the population , but that , of course , is only possible in a relatively minor way .
in the end , the taliban probably have more leverage . does that mean that the tactic of using " human shields " seriously endangers the international soldiers ' mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters rely on guerrilla tactics to match nato 's military might yes .
that 's the intent of this asymmetrical guerrilla tactic .
on one hand are the well-armed isaf military troops and on the other are guerrilla fighters like the taliban who , with the help of " civilian shields " and suicide attacks , conduct pinprick attacks .
they are trying to unsettle the isaf troops and to stir up the population 's mood against the international troops . according to nato diplomats , soldiers in the operation enduring freedom are mainly responsible for the civilian casualties .
is there a possibility that isaf troops are being more careful ? isaf has a different mandate - a different way of operating .
but we have to take a special look at the south - and that is the area that is most affected - and how the two groups work together .
the isaf troops do not have any air support of their own .
that means when they get into an ambush they have to order air support for their own defense .
this comes from the americans , who are operating under the enduring freedom mandate .
that makes it impossible to say who acts how .
instead it 's simply a compound approach in which the air attack comes from enduring freedom planes .
when an isaf patrol ends up in an ambush it naturally tries to get free , that 's the nature of the situation , and in such a case both units of soldiers are connected . you said that civilian casualties can not be completely avoided , that you have to consider them against the benefits in each case .
is n't that cynical when people 's lives are being sacrificed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tornado warplanes are being used to find taliban outposts no , the isaf side has recognized that the taliban is using this tactic to stir up the population against the international troops .
because of that they have become more and more careful .
but the casualties can not be fundamentally avoided because they are part of guerrilla tactics .
i would definitely not call it cynical , because i am sure in every case there is a careful consideration of whether or not to attack .
such an attack can both protect the international troops and at the same time destroy a religious school where taliban troops barricaded themselves . in an interview with deutsche welle , secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said that nato is " in a different moral category " than the taliban .
do people in afghanistan also see it that way ? i doubt that because the people who are in southern afghanistan , which is economically weak after several years of drought , are fighting to survive .

that said , the international community should avoid taking sides in palestine 's internal power struggle , says deutsche welle 's rainer sollich . everyone supports mahmoud abbas : the united states , the united nations and the european union .
israel also sets big hopes on the palestinian president after the military victory of hamas in the gaza strip .
as far as the current situation goes , abbas has earned this broad support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer sollich the violent frenzy of the hamas fighters in the gaza strip can not be excused as a justifiable protest against discrimination or corruption - it is a coup against political institutions .
hamas has deepened the split of the palestinian nation .
and hamas has made the population of the gaza strip hostage to a policy that could drive the region to increasingly hopeless isolation and poverty .
a future without hamas ?
in this situation , it seems unlikely that the international community will completely abandon the palestinians .
the lifting of the embargo put in place a year and a half ago after the election victory of hamas now seems feasible for the west bank .
that would clearly strengthen abbas and his moderate course vis-à-vis israel .
and it is also a clear show of faith for the new , hamas-free transitional cabinet under the existing palestinian finance minister salam fayyad .
israel 's prime minster ehud olmert can already imagine a peace treaty " without hamas . "
this position has takers in both the us and europe .
but caution is warranted .
hamas is and remains a considerable power factor with popularity beyond the gaza strip .
after all , the islamists won the last elections with an absolute majority and in this case justifiably demanded a share of power .
preventing humanitarian disaster the international community is presented with a difficult challenge : it should never accept terror or the hamas-declared goal of destroying israel .
but the international community should also not take sides in an internal palestinian power struggle .
apart from strengthening abbas , steps should be taken to make contact with moderate powers within hamas and to assist them if necessary .
there 's no disputing that an abbas-controlled west bank would be the better model for a future palestinian state and should be treated and supported accordingly .
but at the same time , it 's important to avoid allowing the gaza strip to drift completely into a humanitarian disaster . the people there should not be punished for failed hamas policies .
that would only lead to further radicalization and violence .

that said , the international community should avoid taking sides in palestine 's internal power struggle , says deutsche welle 's rainer sollich . everyone supports mahmoud abbas : the united states , the united nations and the european union .
israel also sets big hopes on the palestinian president after the military victory of hamas in the gaza strip .
as far as the current situation goes , abbas has earned this broad support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer sollich the violent frenzy of the hamas fighters in the gaza strip can not be excused as a justifiable protest against discrimination or corruption - it is a coup against political institutions .
hamas has deepened the split of the palestinian nation .
and hamas has made the population of the gaza strip hostage to a policy that could drive the region to increasingly hopeless isolation and poverty .
a future without hamas ?
in this situation , it seems unlikely that the international community will completely abandon the palestinians .
the lifting of the embargo put in place a year and a half ago after the election victory of hamas now seems feasible for the west bank .
that would clearly strengthen abbas and his moderate course vis-à-vis israel .
and it is also a clear show of faith for the new , hamas-free transitional cabinet under the existing palestinian finance minister salam fayyad .
israel 's prime minster ehud olmert can already imagine a peace treaty " without hamas . "
this position has takers in both the us and europe .
but caution is warranted .
hamas is and remains a considerable power factor with popularity beyond the gaza strip .
after all , the islamists won the last elections with an absolute majority and in this case justifiably demanded a share of power .
preventing humanitarian disaster the international community is presented with a difficult challenge : it should never accept terror or the hamas-declared goal of destroying israel .
but the international community should also not take sides in an internal palestinian power struggle .
apart from strengthening abbas , steps should be taken to make contact with moderate powers within hamas and to assist them if necessary .
there 's no disputing that an abbas-controlled west bank would be the better model for a future palestinian state and should be treated and supported accordingly .
but at the same time , it 's important to avoid allowing the gaza strip to drift completely into a humanitarian disaster . the people there should not be punished for failed hamas policies .
that would only lead to further radicalization and violence .

that said , the international community should avoid taking sides in palestine 's internal power struggle , says deutsche welle 's rainer sollich . everyone supports mahmoud abbas : the united states , the united nations and the european union .
israel also sets big hopes on the palestinian president after the military victory of hamas in the gaza strip .
as far as the current situation goes , abbas has earned this broad support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer sollich the violent frenzy of the hamas fighters in the gaza strip can not be excused as a justifiable protest against discrimination or corruption - it is a coup against political institutions .
hamas has deepened the split of the palestinian nation .
and hamas has made the population of the gaza strip hostage to a policy that could drive the region to increasingly hopeless isolation and poverty .
a future without hamas ?
in this situation , it seems unlikely that the international community will completely abandon the palestinians .
the lifting of the embargo put in place a year and a half ago after the election victory of hamas now seems feasible for the west bank .
that would clearly strengthen abbas and his moderate course vis-à-vis israel .
and it is also a clear show of faith for the new , hamas-free transitional cabinet under the existing palestinian finance minister salam fayyad .
israel 's prime minster ehud olmert can already imagine a peace treaty " without hamas . "
this position has takers in both the us and europe .
but caution is warranted .
hamas is and remains a considerable power factor with popularity beyond the gaza strip .
after all , the islamists won the last elections with an absolute majority and in this case justifiably demanded a share of power .
preventing humanitarian disaster the international community is presented with a difficult challenge : it should never accept terror or the hamas-declared goal of destroying israel .
but the international community should also not take sides in an internal palestinian power struggle .
apart from strengthening abbas , steps should be taken to make contact with moderate powers within hamas and to assist them if necessary .
there 's no disputing that an abbas-controlled west bank would be the better model for a future palestinian state and should be treated and supported accordingly .
but at the same time , it 's important to avoid allowing the gaza strip to drift completely into a humanitarian disaster . the people there should not be punished for failed hamas policies .
that would only lead to further radicalization and violence .

but amid a low turnout , the socialist party made a surprise comeback , jumping from 149 to 185 seats . the ump had 359 seats in the old assembly .
prime minister francois fillon said voters had given sarkozy " a majority to act " by handing his right-wing party control of the parliament . turnout for the decisive second round vote was 59.99 percent , far short of the near 85-percent turnout in the april-may presidential vote .

eu member states have agreed to drop symbolic elements of the new treaty , but a meeting of german and polish leaders over the weekend failed to resolve an impasse over the bloc 's voting structure . when chancellor angela merkel convenes an eu summit on a new slimmed-down treaty towards the end of germany 's six-month rotating presidency on thursday and friday , the 27 member states are expected to be split into three broad camps .
merkel wants to establish a road map for the conference to adopt a new eu treaty . first , there are 22 countries , which are in favor of the defunct constitution that was ratified already by 18 members .
the next group are euro-skeptic countries such as britain and the czech republic , which would have likely voted against the old document , but never got around to casting their ballots after it was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 . and then there are the poles , in a camp of their own .
at issue is the eu ’ s reformed voting structure in which each member state carries a certain weight based on their population base .
the poles argue that the current double voting structure gives disproportionate power to large eu countries , such as germany , and that merkel is acting in her country ’ s national interest , instead of speaking for the entire bloc . eu summit could collapse due to polish position merkel , who met with polish president lech kaczynski this past weekend , said she could not rule out the possibility that the brussels summit could collapse because of the polish position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks over weekend between poland 's kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and merkel stalled " i can only say that it was a very open discussion , but in this matter the positions have not changed , " said merkel . merkel rejected poland 's demand that talks on voting procedures be reopened , saying it was better to leave the agreement , which was reached after long and tough negotiations between all member states , in place . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said he backed merkel 's position in the stand-off .
" if this summit fails , then it certainly will not be the fault of germany leading the negotiations , " he said , alluding to the impasse created by the polish position against the rest of the eu . " the double-majority system as defined within the constitutional treaty , we can not accept that , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told reporters after eu foreign ministers discussed negotiations for a new treaty reforming the bloc 's institutions . voting formula based on square root of population diplomats said fotyga 's tough 30-minute speech dashed hopes that warsaw was starting to soften its stance after the meeting between merkel and kaczynski . under the current reform , most eu decisions would require the support of 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the population .
poland , which has less than half of germany 's population , has proposed an alternative based on a mathematical square root of each country 's population . warsaw is cross that even a discussion of their alternative is off the table on merkel 's agenda at the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and dutch " no " votes in 2005 plunged the eu into crisis the poles , who are overwhelmingly catholic , insist that they are willing to compromise .
for instance , they are willing to drop references to a christian god enshrined in the treaty , which was another bone of contention , but that accepting the " double majority " system of voting , which they threaten to veto , would be a going a step too far . poles divided on government position kaczynski explained that warsaw focused so much on the issue of voting rights , because the voting system would assume a new significance in the reformed european union . polish opposition politicians on the other hand appeared divided on the government ’ s position . while the liberal opposition seems to be leaning toward the government line that countries like poland should be given more voting power within the eu , the democratic left alliance pointed out the flaws of what it regards as kaczynski ’ s intransigence . left-wing opposition leader wojciech olejniczak believes that long-term strategic alliances with major european union partners should matter more than the square root voting system the polish government is pushing for . " looking for a compromise solution is a better way of building a country 's position than putting a spanner in the works , " he told dw-radio . according to other critics , kaczynski and his twin brother jaroslaw , who is prime minister , are reluctant to back down on the issue of voting rights because of their suspicion of germany ’ s motives . " the kaczynski brothers focus too much on the difficult history between poland and germany , which seems to cloud their vision of europe , " said european affairs analyst andrzej krajewski of the batory foundation . britain and netherlands have special demands too besides poland , britain and the netherlands have also set out their own demands .
britain insists that a charter of fundamental rights must not be legally binding and wants an opt-out on judicial and criminal matters , a position that is further complicated by the change in leadership from prime minister tony blair to gordon brown after the summit on june 27 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : change of leadership in britain from blair -lrb- left -rrb- to brown complicates matters the dutch are seeking stronger powers for national parliaments to send back eu draft legislation .
france , which voted against the constitution , and spain , which had already approved it in a referendum , made a joint appeal for a quick , simplified treaty . agreement on a revised treaty at the summit could lift the eu out of its torpor and boost merkel ’ s standing in europe .
but another failure could plunge the bloc into a deeper crisis and institutional gridlock .
it could mean a two-speed europe in which some countries would advance ahead anyway , leaving the naysayers behind . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said some of the most objectionable differences , which are largely symbolic , had been overcome , such as calling the new document an amended treaty as opposed to " constitution . "
beethoven 's " ode to joy " and the eu flag with gold stars against a royal blue background for example , would not be formally enscrined in the new treaty . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel wants to establish a road map for the conference to adopt a new eu treaty . first , there are 22 countries , which are in favor of the defunct constitution that was ratified already by 18 members .
the next group are euro-skeptic countries such as britain and the czech republic , which would have likely voted against the old document , but never got around to casting their ballots after it was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 . and then there are the poles , in a camp of their own .
at issue is the eu ’ s reformed voting structure in which each member state carries a certain weight based on their population base .
the poles argue that the current double voting structure gives disproportionate power to large eu countries , such as germany , and that merkel is acting in her country ’ s national interest , instead of speaking for the entire bloc . eu summit could collapse due to polish position merkel , who met with polish president lech kaczynski this past weekend , said she could not rule out the possibility that the brussels summit could collapse because of the polish position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks over weekend between poland 's kaczynski -lrb- left -rrb- and merkel stalled " i can only say that it was a very open discussion , but in this matter the positions have not changed , " said merkel . merkel rejected poland 's demand that talks on voting procedures be reopened , saying it was better to leave the agreement , which was reached after long and tough negotiations between all member states , in place . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said he backed merkel 's position in the stand-off .
" if this summit fails , then it certainly will not be the fault of germany leading the negotiations , " he said , alluding to the impasse created by the polish position against the rest of the eu . " the double-majority system as defined within the constitutional treaty , we can not accept that , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told reporters after eu foreign ministers discussed negotiations for a new treaty reforming the bloc 's institutions . voting formula based on square root of population diplomats said fotyga 's tough 30-minute speech dashed hopes that warsaw was starting to soften its stance after the meeting between merkel and kaczynski . under the current reform , most eu decisions would require the support of 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the population .
poland , which has less than half of germany 's population , has proposed an alternative based on a mathematical square root of each country 's population . warsaw is cross that even a discussion of their alternative is off the table on merkel 's agenda at the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and dutch " no " votes in 2005 plunged the eu into crisis the poles , who are overwhelmingly catholic , insist that they are willing to compromise .
for instance , they are willing to drop references to a christian god enshrined in the treaty , which was another bone of contention , but that accepting the " double majority " system of voting , which they threaten to veto , would be a going a step too far . poles divided on government position kaczynski explained that warsaw focused so much on the issue of voting rights , because the voting system would assume a new significance in the reformed european union . polish opposition politicians on the other hand appeared divided on the government ’ s position . while the liberal opposition seems to be leaning toward the government line that countries like poland should be given more voting power within the eu , the democratic left alliance pointed out the flaws of what it regards as kaczynski ’ s intransigence . left-wing opposition leader wojciech olejniczak believes that long-term strategic alliances with major european union partners should matter more than the square root voting system the polish government is pushing for . " looking for a compromise solution is a better way of building a country 's position than putting a spanner in the works , " he told dw-radio . according to other critics , kaczynski and his twin brother jaroslaw , who is prime minister , are reluctant to back down on the issue of voting rights because of their suspicion of germany ’ s motives . " the kaczynski brothers focus too much on the difficult history between poland and germany , which seems to cloud their vision of europe , " said european affairs analyst andrzej krajewski of the batory foundation . britain and netherlands have special demands too besides poland , britain and the netherlands have also set out their own demands .
britain insists that a charter of fundamental rights must not be legally binding and wants an opt-out on judicial and criminal matters , a position that is further complicated by the change in leadership from prime minister tony blair to gordon brown after the summit on june 27 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : change of leadership in britain from blair -lrb- left -rrb- to brown complicates matters the dutch are seeking stronger powers for national parliaments to send back eu draft legislation .
france , which voted against the constitution , and spain , which had already approved it in a referendum , made a joint appeal for a quick , simplified treaty . agreement on a revised treaty at the summit could lift the eu out of its torpor and boost merkel ’ s standing in europe .
but another failure could plunge the bloc into a deeper crisis and institutional gridlock .
it could mean a two-speed europe in which some countries would advance ahead anyway , leaving the naysayers behind . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said some of the most objectionable differences , which are largely symbolic , had been overcome , such as calling the new document an amended treaty as opposed to " constitution . "
beethoven 's " ode to joy " and the eu flag with gold stars against a royal blue background for example , would not be formally enscrined in the new treaty . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 18.06.2007 " civilian casualties can not be completely avoided " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : war planners weigh the potential benefits of an attack with civilian deaths , maass said dw-world.de spoke to afghanistan expert citha d. maass about taliban tactics and civilian casualties after a us airstrike killed seven children who military planners said were being used as human shields . citha d. maass is an afghanistan expert at the german institute for international and security affairs and is currently focusing her work on perspectives for afghanistan 's consolidation . dw-world.de : seven children were killed during a us-led air strike in eastern afghanistan .
survivors said the children were forced to stay in the building to act as " human shields " for militants suspected to be there .
is there any proof the taliban acts in this way ? citha d. maass : naturally , there is no proof , but time and again over the last few months we have received reports that the taliban uses this tactic .
it is certainly a part of the taliban 's tactics , and that creates an enormous dilemma for nato 's isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- troops since they ca n't get the children out and keep the taliban inside . nato has recently announced that fewer civilians would become victims of the conflict in afghanistan .
how can that be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has some 3,000 soldiers stationed as part of nato forces in afghanistan civilian casualties can not be completely avoided when these types of guerilla tactics are used .
it is really always a balance of proportionality .
are you willing pay the price or should you avoid it ?
when there is secure information available that there really are important taliban members , it is more likely that the order for an air strike is given than if you have solid tips that only nominal members are concerned .
the more civilian victims there are the more upset the population becomes about the isaf troops . what exactly happens when an attack kills civilians ? part of the taliban 's tactics is to incite resentment and anger that can then be shown in demonstrations aimed at the isaf troops or in protests against support of civilian reconstruction .
you can try to clarify the situation for the population , but that , of course , is only possible in a relatively minor way .
in the end , the taliban probably have more leverage . does that mean that the tactic of using " human shields " seriously endangers the international soldiers ' mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters rely on guerrilla tactics to match nato 's military might yes .
that 's the intent of this asymmetrical guerrilla tactic .
on one hand are the well-armed isaf military troops and on the other are guerrilla fighters like the taliban who , with the help of " civilian shields " and suicide attacks , conduct pinprick attacks .
they are trying to unsettle the isaf troops and to stir up the population 's mood against the international troops . according to nato diplomats , soldiers in the operation enduring freedom are mainly responsible for the civilian casualties .
is there a possibility that isaf troops are being more careful ? isaf has a different mandate - a different way of operating .
but we have to take a special look at the south - and that is the area that is most affected - and how the two groups work together .
the isaf troops do not have any air support of their own .
that means when they get into an ambush they have to order air support for their own defense .
this comes from the americans , who are operating under the enduring freedom mandate .
that makes it impossible to say who acts how .
instead it 's simply a compound approach in which the air attack comes from enduring freedom planes .
when an isaf patrol ends up in an ambush it naturally tries to get free , that 's the nature of the situation , and in such a case both units of soldiers are connected . you said that civilian casualties can not be completely avoided , that you have to consider them against the benefits in each case .
is n't that cynical when people 's lives are being sacrificed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tornado warplanes are being used to find taliban outposts no , the isaf side has recognized that the taliban is using this tactic to stir up the population against the international troops .
because of that they have become more and more careful .
but the casualties can not be fundamentally avoided because they are part of guerrilla tactics .
i would definitely not call it cynical , because i am sure in every case there is a careful consideration of whether or not to attack .
such an attack can both protect the international troops and at the same time destroy a religious school where taliban troops barricaded themselves . in an interview with deutsche welle , secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said that nato is " in a different moral category " than the taliban .
do people in afghanistan also see it that way ? i doubt that because the people who are in southern afghanistan , which is economically weak after several years of drought , are fighting to survive .
moral categories just do n't apply there . matthias klein interviewed citha d. maass -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the first hours of the paris event , the european group orchestrated the announcement of new orders for its troubled superjumbo a380 from qatar airways and dubai-based emirates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a350 underwent major changes after clients were unhappy with its shape at an airbus press conference , qatar airways said it would buy three additional a380 superjumbos and confirmed a previous order for 80 mid-sized a350s .
the planes would be worth slightly more than $ 18 billion dollars -lrb- 13.4 billion euros -rrb- at catalog prices .
soon afterwards , emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said his company planned to buy eight more a380s worth $ 2.5 billion at catalog prices .
emirates was already the single biggest client for the a380 with an order for 43 of the aircraft .
american carrier us airways also signed a letter of intent on monday to buy 92 airbus aircraft in the a350 , a330 and a320 families , the two companies announced monday .
the order was worth move than $ 8 billion , according to airbus commercial director john leahy .
airbus has fallen far behind boeing for new orders in 2007 after being overtaken by the us manufacturer in 2006 .
but chief executive louis gallois hinted that more new business was to come .
including the order from qatar airways , only 93 orders have been announced by airbus since the launch of the 10 billion euro a350 program at the end of 2006 .
weak dollar hurting airbus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus and boeing are expected to make more new order announcements this week the european manufacturer has had major production and design problems in the last few years and tallied up losses last year after a profit of 2.3 billion euros in 2006 .
a weak dollar has also made buying from airbus expensive as international deals are usually made in dollars , not euros .
" we have to make airbus competitive at an exchange rate of 1.45 dollars per euro , " gallois told reporters before the show .
the current exchange rate is $ 1.34 to the euro .
" if the euro continues to rise , it will force us to make new decisions about where production is located . "
earlier this year airbus announced a restructuring plan that executives said could save 5 billion euros by 2010 and 2.1 billion euros per year thereafter and may lead to as many as 10,000 job cuts .
airbus employs 56,000 people , including 22,000 in france and 21,000 in germany .
deliveries of the a380 , which is to enter service later this year , are running about two years behind schedule and airbus is keen to shore up confidence in the project .
airbus was also forced to re-design its a350 , which re-emerged with an enlarged body , after a poor response from clients to the original shape .
new orders at boeing , too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 400,000 visitors are expected at the air show boeing meanwhile has sprinted ahead in large part because of the popularity of its future mid-sized 787 model , which will enter service in mid-2008 , five years ahead of the a350 .
at the end of may , airbus had reported 201 new orders for planes this year , while boeing had 429 at the beginning of june .
the us-based group received a boost from aircraft leasing group gecas on monday , which said it had placed a firm order for six boeing 777 cargo aircraft .
about 400,000 people are expected to visit the event , which features air displays as well as exhibitions , at the le bourget airfield on the outskirts of paris .

amnesty and others support an eu wide migration policy guided by humanitarian principles . malta , which joined the eu in 2004 , is now at the forefront of a battle against illegal immigration , as scores of desperate african migrants in fishing boats risk their lives to reach european shores . many migrants hope that if they make it from the libyan coast to the tiny mediterranean island , which is south of sicily , they can start a new life anywhere in the european union . malta , which has been the destination of more than 7,000 illegal refugees over the past few years , is refusing to accept any more newcomers now , leaving boatloads of africans either to their fate in the turbulent mediterranean waters or in detention camps behind barbed wire . on monday at a berlin symposium , the human rights organization amnesty international lambasted the european union for its failure to support malta in its struggle to deal with the human tide from the horn of africa . mediterranean countries unfairly burdened it is the southern rim of the eu that is feeling the strain – malta , spain and italy , countries which want the rest of the bloc to do their fair share in taking in the illegal immigrants . the spanish canary islands off the western coast of africa , a favorite holiday destination for german and british tourists , was inundated with more than 30,000 refugees last year .
and lampedusa , an italian island which is closer to tunisia than it is to mainland italy , has also been targeted by a continuous flow of migrants from countries such as senegal , mauritius or eritrea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugee in detention camps or left to fate at sea amnesty said that eu countries still have capacities for immigration and called for a european wide asylum policy guided by humanitarian principles . at last week 's meeting , the eu interior ministers brushed aside malta 's plea for a fair distribution of the immigrants among all eu member states .
fears in european capitals of a tidal wave from africa are unfounded however , speakers at the symposium said . number of asylum seekers dropped drastically the number of asylum-seekers in germany for example has dropped from more than 400,000 in the mid-1990s to merely 20,000 last year . there are huge capacities within the eu to absorb more people in need of help , according to richard williams of the human rights group european council for refugees in exile -lrb- ecre -rrb- , who called for an easing of immigration laws across europe . " we 've created an asylum system that is so harsh , where the chances of being detained are very high , where the chances of being refused asylum on spurious grounds are very high , and the chances of being sent back to a country where you do n't feel safe , are very high , " williams told dw-radio .
" people feel safer not to apply for asylum - to still come , but to remain underground . " the existing patchwork of national laws fosters illegal immigration , said peter altmaier , undersecretary in the german interior ministry in a radio interview .
at present there are 20 different national policies in the 27 member bloc , which apply very different treatment standards to refugees , but the european commission wants harmonized rules to be in place by 2010 . " we have to fight illegal immigration because these people are exploited by criminal organizations , " altmaier said .
" at the same time we have to offer perspectives for legal migration .
and we also need a very strong humanitarian signal that we can not allow people to die in the mediterranean sea . " eu interested in common asylum policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu needs a common migration policy the eu 's external border agency frontex will soon begin patrolling the waters off malta to rescue illegal immigrants , altmaier said .
however amnesty claimed that boat commanders are usually told to keep the refugees off territorial waters instead of guiding them safely ashore in europe .
although frontex has 100 vessels as well as 50 planes and helicopters at its disposal , the aid provided by its response team has been patchy . it is in the interest of the entire eu , not just the mediterranean rim 's " front line states " to absorb asylum seekers , according to williams .
many who have made it to italy 's shores for example , migrate further north anyway , and lodge applications for asylum status in more than a single eu country , a practice called " asylum shopping . " ecre 's williams argued that the free movement of people across the borders of most eu countries provided by the schengen accords means that common rules and safeguards on migration are vital . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and lampedusa , an italian island which is closer to tunisia than it is to mainland italy , has also been targeted by a continuous flow of migrants from countries such as senegal , mauritius or eritrea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugee in detention camps or left to fate at sea amnesty said that eu countries still have capacities for immigration and called for a european wide asylum policy guided by humanitarian principles . at last week 's meeting , the eu interior ministers brushed aside malta 's plea for a fair distribution of the immigrants among all eu member states .
fears in european capitals of a tidal wave from africa are unfounded however , speakers at the symposium said . number of asylum seekers dropped drastically the number of asylum-seekers in germany for example has dropped from more than 400,000 in the mid-1990s to merely 20,000 last year . there are huge capacities within the eu to absorb more people in need of help , according to richard williams of the human rights group european council for refugees in exile -lrb- ecre -rrb- , who called for an easing of immigration laws across europe . " we 've created an asylum system that is so harsh , where the chances of being detained are very high , where the chances of being refused asylum on spurious grounds are very high , and the chances of being sent back to a country where you do n't feel safe , are very high , " williams told dw-radio .
" people feel safer not to apply for asylum - to still come , but to remain underground . " the existing patchwork of national laws fosters illegal immigration , said peter altmaier , undersecretary in the german interior ministry in a radio interview .
at present there are 20 different national policies in the 27 member bloc , which apply very different treatment standards to refugees , but the european commission wants harmonized rules to be in place by 2010 . " we have to fight illegal immigration because these people are exploited by criminal organizations , " altmaier said .
" at the same time we have to offer perspectives for legal migration .
and we also need a very strong humanitarian signal that we can not allow people to die in the mediterranean sea . " eu interested in common asylum policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu needs a common migration policy the eu 's external border agency frontex will soon begin patrolling the waters off malta to rescue illegal immigrants , altmaier said .
however amnesty claimed that boat commanders are usually told to keep the refugees off territorial waters instead of guiding them safely ashore in europe .
although frontex has 100 vessels as well as 50 planes and helicopters at its disposal , the aid provided by its response team has been patchy . it is in the interest of the entire eu , not just the mediterranean rim 's " front line states " to absorb asylum seekers , according to williams .
many who have made it to italy 's shores for example , migrate further north anyway , and lodge applications for asylum status in more than a single eu country , a practice called " asylum shopping . " ecre 's williams argued that the free movement of people across the borders of most eu countries provided by the schengen accords means that common rules and safeguards on migration are vital . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" maybe these men do this to me because they do not believe in women making decisions . " according to research revealed at the summit , the netherlands and the united kingdom are the two countries that have the highest percentage of women in decision-making positions . visser said it remains hard for women to climb the career ladder since unlike other countries , " the netherlands does not have a legislator that could back women up and to get to the top , you have to be on your own . " " davos for women " the challenges facing women in the business world was one of the core themes of the summit which is also known as the " davos for women . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian president vaira vike-freiberga took part in the summit an annual occurrence , the three-day meeting this time drew over 1,000 female government and business leaders - most of them top corporate executives - from 95 countries .
participants included latvian president , vaira vike-freiberga and vice president of microsoft usa , gerri elliot . irene natividad , president of the summit said the meet allows women across borders , disciplines and cultures to learn from each other in their ongoing work towards economic equity . " sustainability and growth in our global economy would be unthinkable without women " natividad said . she admitted that there were n't enough women in top managerial positions and emphasized the need to change the mind-set of both men and women . " many corporate leaders still view the inclusion of women board directors as a matter of political correctness or as a form of affirmative action to address past inequities . "
she said both views are misguided approaches that merely entrench opposition to diversifying corporate boardrooms . women as stakeholders experts point out that companies can ill-afford to shut out women from decision-making positions given that women are increasingly turning important stakeholders enabling firms to better compete globally . " they -lrb- women -rrb- constitute 50 percent of the world ’ s workers , run over 40 percent of small businesses and make 80 percent of consumer buying decisions , " said natividad . the summit threw up a host of ideas to help ease the way for women aspiring to managerial levels and positions of power in the business world . some pointed out that corporate power circles still remains a boys ' club .
mirrella visser said that male networking is always the easier way to get there . she emphasized that " women need to market themselves and create a network with men who are in decision-making -lrb- positions -rrb- because when there is a position up there , they will recommend them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men have it easier making it to the top of the corporate world jacqueline ford , an executive with ibm in the us - which has more women in managerial positions than any other country - said more has to be done to change the mindset of societies in accepting women as equal partners in the corporate world as well as creating legislation to help smooth the path . " women who are in government decision making should advocate for laws that could help women to reach to the top managerial positions , " ford said . germany lags behind in europe according to the study published during the summit , german companies tend to have the lowest number of women in managerial positions in western europe . susan unger , senior vice president and chief information officer at daimler chrysler and one of the few german women executives said one of the main barriers faced by german women is juggling family and work . " women have to work and take care of their families , so it is not easy for them to do both efficiently .
companies have to cater for women and help create infrastructure that could help in the know how technology , " unger said . unger , who has been working for the carmaker for 35 years , pointed out that daimler chrysler has created 350 children ’ s day care centers for employees , especially women . " the initiative is to relieve the heavy burden from women , " she said , adding that women too had a role to play if they were aiming for the top .
women must contribute by empowering themselves with well advanced skills and must network with role models and mentors , unger said .
she also urged big companies to recognize women ’ s capability and strengths when making top appointments . " it ’ s a long and tough road , but as germans we must initiate for change , " she said . mathapeli ramonotsi send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the first hours of the paris event , the european group orchestrated the announcement of new orders for its troubled superjumbo a380 from qatar airways and dubai-based emirates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a350 underwent major changes after clients were unhappy with its shape at an airbus press conference , qatar airways said it would buy three additional a380 superjumbos and confirmed a previous order for 80 mid-sized a350s .
the planes would be worth slightly more than $ 18 billion dollars -lrb- 13.4 billion euros -rrb- at catalog prices .
soon afterwards , emirates chairman and chief executive sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum said his company planned to buy eight more a380s worth $ 2.5 billion at catalog prices .
emirates was already the single biggest client for the a380 with an order for 43 of the aircraft .
american carrier us airways also signed a letter of intent on monday to buy 92 airbus aircraft in the a350 , a330 and a320 families , the two companies announced monday .
the order was worth move than $ 8 billion , according to airbus commercial director john leahy .
airbus has fallen far behind boeing for new orders in 2007 after being overtaken by the us manufacturer in 2006 .
but chief executive louis gallois hinted that more new business was to come .
including the order from qatar airways , only 93 orders have been announced by airbus since the launch of the 10 billion euro a350 program at the end of 2006 .
weak dollar hurting airbus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus and boeing are expected to make more new order announcements this week the european manufacturer has had major production and design problems in the last few years and tallied up losses last year after a profit of 2.3 billion euros in 2006 .
a weak dollar has also made buying from airbus expensive as international deals are usually made in dollars , not euros .
" we have to make airbus competitive at an exchange rate of 1.45 dollars per euro , " gallois told reporters before the show .
the current exchange rate is $ 1.34 to the euro .
" if the euro continues to rise , it will force us to make new decisions about where production is located . "
earlier this year airbus announced a restructuring plan that executives said could save 5 billion euros by 2010 and 2.1 billion euros per year thereafter and may lead to as many as 10,000 job cuts .
airbus employs 56,000 people , including 22,000 in france and 21,000 in germany .
deliveries of the a380 , which is to enter service later this year , are running about two years behind schedule and airbus is keen to shore up confidence in the project .
airbus was also forced to re-design its a350 , which re-emerged with an enlarged body , after a poor response from clients to the original shape .
new orders at boeing , too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 400,000 visitors are expected at the air show boeing meanwhile has sprinted ahead in large part because of the popularity of its future mid-sized 787 model , which will enter service in mid-2008 , five years ahead of the a350 .
at the end of may , airbus had reported 201 new orders for planes this year , while boeing had 429 at the beginning of june .
the us-based group received a boost from aircraft leasing group gecas on monday , which said it had placed a firm order for six boeing 777 cargo aircraft .
about 400,000 people are expected to visit the event , which features air displays as well as exhibitions , at the le bourget airfield on the outskirts of paris .

there is a mood of almost cocky confidence as the world 's largest air show kicks off at le bourget airport on the outskirts of paris .
the signing of deals worth more than $ 30bn -lrb- £ 15bn -rrb- - equivalent to some 300 aircraft sold - are expected at the show , which is set to receive almost a quarter of a million industry visitors .
" plane orders are increasing on the back of global economic growth , " observes aerospace analyst pierre boucheny from kepler equities in paris .
" the show falls at a good point in the cycle of the airline industry . "
and the only way is up , according to us aerospace giant boeing , which recently raised its sales forecast for the industry from $ 2.6 trillion to $ 2.8 trillion over the next two decades - equivalent to 28,600 planes .
boeing in the lead boeing is in rude health , having landed almost 600 orders for its 787 dreamliner aircraft , a plane built using modern composite materials that is due to fly for the first time later this year .
airbus will make it , but it 's going to take a while john newhouse , author of boeing versus airbus " since the last show , boeing has got well back into the game , " observes aerospace analyst christophe quarante of natexis bleichroeder in paris .
boeing 's european rival , airbus , meanwhile is struggling .
customers have yet to take delivery of its a380 superjumbo , which made its first public appearance at an airshow at le bourget two years ago .
the two-year delay , which was caused by a mixture of wiring difficulties within the aircraft itself and crossed wires at management level .
and its efforts to offer a rival to the 787 dreamliner have been slow and unsuccessful , with orders for its a350 few and far between .
so far , only 13 firm orders have been signed , though this number could see a significant lift this week .
airbus recovery ?
indeed , airbus too is due a recovery after a disastrous couple of years , predicts james mcnerney , chief executive of boeing , in an interview with the french newspaper le monde over the weekend .
is airbus going to turn the corner from its struggles ?
boeing has re-discovered its " self-confidence " , says mr mcnerney , while predicting that airbus is set to re-emerge stronger than ever from its ongoing crisis .
" airbus will make it , " agrees john newhouse , author of boeing versus airbus .
" but it 's going to take a while . "
more pollution and yet , as the show gets underway , the noise and the fumes from some 40 air displays will serve as regular reminders that the aerospace industry is still facing enormous challenges .
buoyant industry expected deals in paris worth $ 30bn -lrb- £ 15bm -rrb- almost a quarter of a million trade visitors industry expected to sell 28,600 planes in next 20 years true , tomorrow 's planes will be lighter and more efficient than current models , and thus they will be quieter and emit less co2 than current models .
but the sheer number of new planes entering the market in the years ahead will mean the industry as a whole is about to pump out a great deal more co2 in the future than it does today .
currently , planes and other aircraft account for just 2 % of total co2 emissions .
this is set to rise to 5 % by 2050 , according to predictions cited in the stern report .
some solutions beyond better aircraft are already being implemented , though .
currently , 80 % of the seats are occupied on an average flight , up from 70 % a decade ago , boeing points out .
future fuels ?
other solutions could involve cleaner fuels , industry officials insist .
hence , the aircraft makers will no doubt spend a lot of time at the show talking about how airlines could soon fill up with supposedly greener biofuels that would enable them to reduce co2 emissions .
do not expect such talk to be backed by investment commitments , however .
aircraft makers consistently insist that it is too expensive to modify existing aircraft , many with a couple of decades of flying ahead of them .
the challenge , thus , goes out to fuel suppliers , which are urged to produce the stuff .
and to airlines , which are urged to buy it .
hence , to the extent there are quick fixes to the green challenge , they are not forthcoming from the aircraft makers .

boeing has re-discovered its " self-confidence " , says mr mcnerney , while predicting that airbus is set to re-emerge stronger than ever from its ongoing crisis .
" airbus will make it , " agrees john newhouse , author of boeing versus airbus .
" but it 's going to take a while . "
more pollution and yet , as the show gets underway , the noise and the fumes from some 40 air displays will serve as regular reminders that the aerospace industry is still facing enormous challenges .
buoyant industry expected deals in paris worth $ 30bn -lrb- £ 15bm -rrb- almost a quarter of a million trade visitors industry expected to sell 28,600 planes in next 20 years true , tomorrow 's planes will be lighter and more efficient than current models , and thus they will be quieter and emit less co2 than current models .
but the sheer number of new planes entering the market in the years ahead will mean the industry as a whole is about to pump out a great deal more co2 in the future than it does today .
currently , planes and other aircraft account for just 2 % of total co2 emissions .
this is set to rise to 5 % by 2050 , according to predictions cited in the stern report .
some solutions beyond better aircraft are already being implemented , though .
currently , 80 % of the seats are occupied on an average flight , up from 70 % a decade ago , boeing points out .
future fuels ?
other solutions could involve cleaner fuels , industry officials insist .
hence , the aircraft makers will no doubt spend a lot of time at the show talking about how airlines could soon fill up with supposedly greener biofuels that would enable them to reduce co2 emissions .
do not expect such talk to be backed by investment commitments , however .
aircraft makers consistently insist that it is too expensive to modify existing aircraft , many with a couple of decades of flying ahead of them .
the challenge , thus , goes out to fuel suppliers , which are urged to produce the stuff .
and to airlines , which are urged to buy it .
hence , to the extent there are quick fixes to the green challenge , they are not forthcoming from the aircraft makers .

there is a mood of almost cocky confidence as the world 's largest air show kicks off at le bourget airport on the outskirts of paris .
the signing of deals worth more than $ 30bn -lrb- £ 15bn -rrb- - equivalent to some 300 aircraft sold - are expected at the show , which is set to receive almost a quarter of a million industry visitors .
" plane orders are increasing on the back of global economic growth , " observes aerospace analyst pierre boucheny from kepler equities in paris .
" the show falls at a good point in the cycle of the airline industry . "
and the only way is up , according to us aerospace giant boeing , which recently raised its sales forecast for the industry from $ 2.6 trillion to $ 2.8 trillion over the next two decades - equivalent to 28,600 planes .
boeing in the lead boeing is in rude health , having landed almost 600 orders for its 787 dreamliner aircraft , a plane built using modern composite materials that is due to fly for the first time later this year .
airbus will make it , but it 's going to take a while john newhouse , author of boeing versus airbus " since the last show , boeing has got well back into the game , " observes aerospace analyst christophe quarante of natexis bleichroeder in paris .
boeing 's european rival , airbus , meanwhile is struggling .
customers have yet to take delivery of its a380 superjumbo , which made its first public appearance at an airshow at le bourget two years ago .
the two-year delay , which was caused by a mixture of wiring difficulties within the aircraft itself and crossed wires at management level .
and its efforts to offer a rival to the 787 dreamliner have been slow and unsuccessful , with orders for its a350 few and far between .
so far , only 13 firm orders have been signed , though this number could see a significant lift this week .

many who served in the war with argentina have found it near-impossible to forget the horror of the campaign to reclaim the islands , which left some 1,000 dead on both sides .
but sunday was a day of remembrance in which they were willing and proud to take part .
as final preparations got under way on sunday morning , uniformed veterans and their families mingled with tourists and sunbathers in london 's st james 's park .
signs all along birdcage walk indicated where each regiment was to muster for the march to the parade ground that had been many months in the planning .
argentine bombing old friends and colleagues tom eadie , 56 , and john shannahan-creasey , 49 , had travelled to the event from dorset to take part in the march along with nearly 2,000 of their 1982 comrades .
the retired royal marines , who were serving in the commando logistic regiment during the war , said they had a " rough " journey to the south atlantic in landing ships and were transferred to the rfa ship sir galahad at ascension island . "
i do n't like loud bangs any more , or hunger .
we had 24-hour rations that had to last four or five days " tom eadie retired royal marine " food rationing had started on day one .
but up until we left ascension we thought we would probably be going back home again , " said john , who added there had been hope the political situation would be resolved before a shot was fired .
after their arrival in the falklands , tom was still aboard the sir galahad when it took its first hit from argentine fighter-bombers in ajax bay .
" fortunately those bombs did n't go off .
we abandoned ship and i got on the last boat off , which then broke down during an air attack .
our war started then . "
he later had another close shave on land when ajax bay was bombed .
" i do n't like loud bangs any more , or hunger .
we had 24-hour rations that had to last four or five days , " he added .
meanwhile back in the uk , tom 's young wife margaret was waiting with their two children - aged just 10 months and three years old .
" tom had been away in norway for three months and had only just been back two days when he was sent to the falklands . "
' it was awful ' she knew he was on the sir galahad - which was bombed again after tom had left , killing 48 on board - and endured an agonising wait to hear if he was safe .
" it was awful .
it was five days before i was told that he was okay . "
on a park bench nearby , john mcrobb and his wife julie relaxed in the sunshine ahead of a day they knew would be emotionally draining . "
it 's not remembering it clearly that 's the problem , it 's trying not to remember it clearly " john mcrobb former scots guard john had a more luxurious passage to the south atlantic than most , having sailed there in the qe2 , before ending up in bluff cove and right in the path of argentine jets targeting british ships in the bay .
" that was when the fireworks started , " said john , who served in the 2nd battalion scots guards and is now a truck driver .
later in the conflict he was involved in some 14 hours of " hand-to-hand fighting " on mount tumbledown .
but it did not seem like 25 years ago since it all happened , he said .
" it 's not remembering it clearly that 's the problem , it 's trying not to remember it clearly .
it 's the nearest thing to having a tattoo on your brain . "
julie , who was at home in london then with their two-year-old son , said : " the best thing was when i got the telegram saying it was all finished .
it said , ' on the advance party home .
how 's my bike ? " '
john , a keen motorcyclist , added : " i knew if i put that she 'd know i really was okay . "
their story would sound familiar to hundreds of families who had gathered at horse guard 's parade for the climax of the year 's commemorations .
others did not have such a happy ending .
as the applause sparked by the arrival of baroness thatcher died away we are sailing began to play on the pa system .
on huge tv screens the dated graphics of the bbc 's 9 o 'clock news circa 1982 flashed up , with snapshots of the build-up to the war reminding the crowd of the events of 25 years ago .
in a live link-up screened from the falklands , islanders - who were joined by prince edward and 1982 government minister lord parkinson - shivered in the buffeting winter wind at san carlos cemetery .
it was a stark reminder of the bitter conditions the troops had endured 25 years ago .
in london , the tears started to flow with the rousing arrival of the bands of the raf , army and royal marines .
and then the veterans came in their hundreds .
some marched with walking sticks , others in wheelchairs .
' fitting occasion ' when live footage of four buglers playing the last post in san carlos belted out into the parade ground , some in the audience finally broke down .
it was a " fitting " occasion , said tracy bolton , from somerset , who watched from the stands as her partner of 22 years wo2 neil hodgson took part in the march .
she said she did not know if he had lost friends during the conflict , adding that she had learned more from the footage shown during the ceremony than she had ever gleaned from him .
" he does n't talk about it , " she said .
afterwards , as the crowd followed the marchers down the mall to watch a fly-past of aircraft , it seemed as if they could n't help but step in time to the band .
a final loud cheer went up as the red arrows roared overhead , streaking red , white and blue behind them , before the crowd dispersed again into st james 's park .

mr fillon said the result gave the ump a strong mandate for reform dismay and disappointment were clear on the faces of ump supporters as they watched the results come through .
french president nicolas sarkozy 's centre-right party may have won an outright majority with 314 seats , but it was far from the " blue tidal wave " or " blue tsunami " predicted by the opinion polls .
instead , it was a modest victory which gives mr sarkozy 's party a clear majority in the national assembly , but a smaller one than it had under former president jacques chirac .
but the ump prime minister , francois fillon , insisted it was still a clear endorsement of the president 's planned policies .
this victory is a reward for the tremendous momentum created by nicolas sarkozy ump leader francois fillon " this victory is a reward for the tremendous momentum created by nicolas sarkozy , " mr fillon told the party faithful .
" we are going to carry out reforms , we are going to engage in renewal , we are going to experiment with new ideas , we are going to enhance the status of work , we are going to encourage talent and innovation , and we are going to free ourselves from the defeatism which is suffocating the republic . "
' tough election ' however , mr fillon 's number two , alain juppe , was forced to resign from the cabinet after losing his parliamentary seat , which will lead to a cabinet reshuffle this week .
high-profile losers former prime minister alain juppe , appointed to be energy and environment minister in new government marine le pen , daughter of far-right national front leader jean marie le pen jean-louis bruguiere , france 's best known anti-terrorist judge , standing for ump send us your reaction some at the ump blamed the socialist party 's focus on the government 's controversial proposal to raise value added tax for scaring the voters away from handing too much power to the right .
ump candidate pierre lellouche said it had been a long and tough campaign , lasting more than nine months since the start of work on the campaign for last month 's presidential election .
" it was a tough election , but the main thing is that the voters have given us a majority to govern and implement reform , " he told the bbc .
" that is the key thing . "
" i am disappointed , " admitted one ump campaigner .
" i thought we would have more mps , but we are still in power . "
socialist relief over at the socialists ' headquarters , there was delight and relief .
ms royal says she will challenge mr hollande to lead the socialists they may still be in opposition , but winning 185 seats was the best news the beleaguered party has had for some time .
the party 's leader , francois hollande , promised that the french left would be an active opposition in the new parliament .
" the blue wave that had been predicted did not take place , " he said .
" in the new parliamentary assembly , there will be diversity and pluralism .
that 's good for the country .
our citizens have brought in a force to face the new power , allowing a balance and a counter-power that is indispensable for a democracy . "
royal split but it was a separate announcement by his long-term partner , the defeated socialist presidential candidate , segolene royal , that is likely to dominate the debate over the coming days .
ms royal announced in an interview on french radio that she and francois hollande were no longer a couple .
all couples have their difficulties , and we have had ours ...
and now we are moving on to a new phase segolene royal they have four children together , and have long been the " golden couple " of the socialist party .
the two have been together since they were both at the elite ecole nationale d 'administration , which turns out france 's top civil servants and politicians .
they never married .
" all couples have their difficulties , and we have had ours .
and now we are moving on to a new phase , " ms royal told the france inter radio station .
the revelations are expanded on in a book to be published by ms royal this week , in which she says mr hollande had been having an affair and that she had asked him to leave their home .
leadership challenge the announcement will end the speculation and rumours that have been sweeping paris over the past months about the exact state of their partnership , which had clearly been put under strain by disagreements during the presidential election .
despite the french media 's much-vaunted respect for the private lives of politicians , the papers are full of the split-up bbc europe editor mark mardell read mark 's thoughts in full ms royal complained of a lack of support from the party , while mr hollande was occasionally quoted making less-than-supportive remarks or contradicting ms royal 's policies .
most embarrassing of all was the moment when ms royal 's official spokesman was asked during the campaign what her biggest problem was .
" francois hollande , " he replied and was promptly suspended for a month .
now , though , the way is clear for ms royal to challenge her former partner for his job as leader of the socialists , a position he has held for the past 10 years .
however , that may not be easy as other leading figures in the party , the so-called " elephants , " blame ms royal for the socialists ' defeat in the presidential vote , even if she remains the most popular socialist figure with the voters .

french president nicolas sarkozy 's centre-right party may have won an outright majority with 314 seats , but it was far from the " blue tidal wave " or " blue tsunami " predicted by the opinion polls .
instead , it was a modest victory which gives mr sarkozy 's party a clear majority in the national assembly , but a smaller one than it had under former president jacques chirac .
but the ump prime minister , francois fillon , insisted it was still a clear endorsement of the president 's planned policies .
this victory is a reward for the tremendous momentum created by nicolas sarkozy ump leader francois fillon " this victory is a reward for the tremendous momentum created by nicolas sarkozy , " mr fillon told the party faithful .

ump candidate pierre lellouche said it had been a long and tough campaign , lasting more than nine months since the start of work on the campaign for last month 's presidential election .
" it was a tough election , but the main thing is that the voters have given us a majority to govern and implement reform , " he told the bbc .

most embarrassing of all was the moment when ms royal 's official spokesman was asked during the campaign what her biggest problem was .
" francois hollande , " he replied and was promptly suspended for a month .
now , though , the way is clear for ms royal to challenge her former partner for his job as leader of the socialists , a position he has held for the past 10 years .
however , that may not be easy as other leading figures in the party , the so-called " elephants , " blame ms royal for the socialists ' defeat in the presidential vote , even if she remains the most popular socialist figure with the voters .

farmers say the spread of cattle tb by badgers is destroying the industry and that culling would control it .
but independent government advisers said culling would have to be so extensive it would be uneconomical .
conservationists suggest tighter restrictions on cattle movements could help control the disease 's spread .
the government is currently considering whether to introduce a cull .
if they do embark on a badger culling policy , it is quite clear that will have no impact professor john bourne it set up the independent scientific group on cattle tb -lrb- isg -rrb- to examine the links between tb in cattle and the spread of badgers in the countryside .
isg chairman professor john bourne told bbc radio 4 's farming today : " one has to recognise that what we are dealing with is primarily a disease of cattle , although badgers in hot spot areas do make a significant contribution . "
the dilemma for farmers and ministers is that there was no sustainable way of treating the badger issue , he said .
" if they do embark on a badger culling policy , it is quite clear that will have no impact - direct impact or meaningful impact - on controlling the disease in cattle , and it could make it worse . "
instead , he proposed a method of cattle control which would reduce the incidents and prevent its geographical spread .
but national farmers ' union president peter kendall said he would seek urgent meetings with ministers and officials to devise a culling strategy that would make a worthwhile difference to the disease situation .
the krebs trial 30 areas of the country , each 100 square km 10 culled proactively , 10 reactively , 10 not culled badgers culled through being caught in cage and then shot incidence of bovine tb measured on farms inside and outside study areas reactive culling suspended in 2003 after significant rise in infection trial cost £ 7m per year " i simply do not accept that the industry can not devise a culling strategy that will reduce the reservoir of tb in badgers , " he said .
he added that better testing and tighter controls on cattle movements would be worthless unless something was done to stop the " relentless cycle " of re-infection of cattle in the tb hot spot areas by disease spreading from badgers .
trevor lawson , from the conservation group , the badger trust , said that the problem lies with the way cattle are tested .
" it 's been missing large numbers of infected cattle , and because we 've had large herds and we move cattle around so much in this country , that 's spread it countrywide . "
a consultation mounted recently by the department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- suggested public opinion is firmly against a cull .
past research has shown that culling is associated with increased tb in the badgers ; areas which had received four culls saw a doubling of the rate .
it appears that badgers move more freely and more widely in culled areas thereby increasing contact with each other .
the data comes from the randomised badger culling trial , sometimes known as the krebs trial after sir john krebs , the government scientist who instigated it .

farmers say the spread of cattle tb by badgers is destroying the industry and that culling would control it .
but independent government advisers said culling would have to be so extensive it would be uneconomical .
conservationists suggest tighter restrictions on cattle movements could help control the disease 's spread .
the government is currently considering whether to introduce a cull .
if they do embark on a badger culling policy , it is quite clear that will have no impact professor john bourne it set up the independent scientific group on cattle tb -lrb- isg -rrb- to examine the links between tb in cattle and the spread of badgers in the countryside .
isg chairman professor john bourne told bbc radio 4 's farming today : " one has to recognise that what we are dealing with is primarily a disease of cattle , although badgers in hot spot areas do make a significant contribution . "
the dilemma for farmers and ministers is that there was no sustainable way of treating the badger issue , he said .
" if they do embark on a badger culling policy , it is quite clear that will have no impact - direct impact or meaningful impact - on controlling the disease in cattle , and it could make it worse . "
instead , he proposed a method of cattle control which would reduce the incidents and prevent its geographical spread .
but national farmers ' union president peter kendall said he would seek urgent meetings with ministers and officials to devise a culling strategy that would make a worthwhile difference to the disease situation .

he added that better testing and tighter controls on cattle movements would be worthless unless something was done to stop the " relentless cycle " of re-infection of cattle in the tb hot spot areas by disease spreading from badgers .
trevor lawson , from the conservation group , the badger trust , said that the problem lies with the way cattle are tested .
" it 's been missing large numbers of infected cattle , and because we 've had large herds and we move cattle around so much in this country , that 's spread it countrywide . "
a consultation mounted recently by the department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- suggested public opinion is firmly against a cull .
past research has shown that culling is associated with increased tb in the badgers ; areas which had received four culls saw a doubling of the rate .

the house of lords had initially ordered the men 's retrial after a juror at their second trial complained of being " badgered and intimidated " by other jurors into delivering a guilty verdict .
so what are the rules of the jury room ?
henry fonda 's character -lrb- centre -rrb- persuaded the other 11 jurors anyone who has ever seen the film twelve angry men will know the scene .
henry fonda played a strong and persuasive character who cajoled his fellow jurors into acquitting a man they were all convinced was guilty .
the secrets of the jury room are supposed to be sacrosanct in britain - less so in the united states , where jurors frequently give press conferences to explain their verdicts in high profile cases such as the michael jackson trial .
but what happens in real life if jurors are badgered into changing their minds by their peers ?
right to a fair trial the jury in patrick smith and joseph merceica 's first trial was discharged after a juror was found with a mobile phone .
following the complaints from a juror in their second trial , they were granted a retrial , which ended with a hung jury .
a fourth trial finally ended on friday with the pair being acquitted of all charges .
even if they 're not guilty , do you really want these people to go free ?
juror in first smith and merceica trial the case illustrates how important it is not only for justice to be done but for it to be " seen " to be done .
the story began on 27 january 2000 when hertfordshire businessman mark levy disappeared after going to london for a meeting to discuss the purchase of 12 rolex watches .
mr levy has not been seen since and his body has never been found but in may 2002 smith and merceica were jailed for life for his murder .
jurors at the old bailey trial were told the murder was carried out under the noses of the national crime squad , which had smith under surveillance at the time .
the cursed case 2001 : jury at mr smith and mr merceica 's first trial discharged after a juror was found with a mobile phone .
2002 : mr smith and mr merceica convicted but a juror later complains and convictions quashed 2006 : jury at third trial fail to agree verdicts .
2007 : jury acquits mr smith and mr merceica they heard he was suspected of being behind the importation of 500 kilos of cannabis which arrived in britain on the same day as the murder .
when the jury went out to deliberate they were given a lengthy direction on the law by the trial judge .
after several days of deliberation one of the jurors sent a detailed letter to the judge .
he gave them another direction on the law and some time later they returned with a guilty verdict .
mr smith and mr merceica lost an appeal against their convictions but took the case to the house of lords , claiming the judge should have dismissed the jury and declared a mistrial after receiving the letter from a woman juror .
prosecutor richard latham qc , the subject of a juror 's affections the law lords heard that , in the letter , she alleged some jurors were " badgering and intimidating " others to reach a particular verdict .
she quoted one of her fellow jurors as having said : " even if they 're not guilty , do you really want these people to go free ? "
the law lords ordered a new trial .
that ended in a hung jury and the fourth trial finally ended on friday .
mr levy 's widow , tina , was forced to give evidence a total of five times .
it is not the first time there have been allegations concerning jurors : a murder conviction in 1994 was overturned after it emerged that four jurors had consulted a ouija board during a drinking session on the eve of the verdict .
in 2004 the court of appeal dismissed an appeal by two conmen who were convicted despite it emerging that a female juror had sent a bottle of champagne to prosecutor richard latham with a note saying : " what does a lady need to do to attract your attention ? "
in 2001 shabbir ali mirza was jailed after being found guilty on a majority verdict of indecent assault .
after the trial a juror wrote to his barrister claiming other jurors were racially biased against mr mirza .
she said when she objected she was " shouted down " by " bigots " .
in another case a judge was informed by the jury bailiff that two jurors had climbed through a window and were sitting on the ledge smoking cigarettes and refusing to participate in deliberations .
what are the rules ?
so what are the rules governing jury service and juror misbehaviour ?
people who have been given custodial sentences are automatically excused from jury service but that does not mean those who do serve are going to be beyond reproach .
in 2004 the department of constitutional affairs announced a consultation paper and among the suggestions was that the public might be able to scrutinise the decisions of juries .
but last year after consulting lawyers , judges and other interested parties the dca decided to keep to the status quo .
the secrets of the jury room will remain secret .
it is however still open to a judge to find a juror in contempt of court .
it 's up to the jury to argue it out among themselves .
there must be circumstances where some jurors are more assertive than others and are bound to make more of an impact joshua rozenberg legal expert that is exactly what happened to keith scotcher in 2002 .
he was fined £ 2,500 after he wrote an anonymous letter to the mother of a defendant saying he had been on the jury and thought her son had been wrongly convicted .
but the daily telegraph 's legal editor , joshua rozenberg , said there was no suggestion the " badgering " jurors in the smith and merceica case had broken the law .
he said : " it 's up to the jury to argue it out among themselves .
there must be circumstances where some jurors are more assertive than others and are bound to make more of an impact .
that is what reaching agreement means . "
mr rozenberg said jurors had been fined or ticked off by judges - for example if their mobile phones went off during a trial - and he said : " a judge has powers to control his own court but they do not like prying into what is going on in the jury room . "

the house of lords had initially ordered the men 's retrial after a juror at their second trial complained of being " badgered and intimidated " by other jurors into delivering a guilty verdict .
so what are the rules of the jury room ?
henry fonda 's character -lrb- centre -rrb- persuaded the other 11 jurors anyone who has ever seen the film twelve angry men will know the scene .
henry fonda played a strong and persuasive character who cajoled his fellow jurors into acquitting a man they were all convinced was guilty .
the secrets of the jury room are supposed to be sacrosanct in britain - less so in the united states , where jurors frequently give press conferences to explain their verdicts in high profile cases such as the michael jackson trial .
but what happens in real life if jurors are badgered into changing their minds by their peers ?
right to a fair trial the jury in patrick smith and joseph merceica 's first trial was discharged after a juror was found with a mobile phone .
following the complaints from a juror in their second trial , they were granted a retrial , which ended with a hung jury .
a fourth trial finally ended on friday with the pair being acquitted of all charges .
even if they 're not guilty , do you really want these people to go free ?
juror in first smith and merceica trial the case illustrates how important it is not only for justice to be done but for it to be " seen " to be done .
the story began on 27 january 2000 when hertfordshire businessman mark levy disappeared after going to london for a meeting to discuss the purchase of 12 rolex watches .
mr levy has not been seen since and his body has never been found but in may 2002 smith and merceica were jailed for life for his murder .
jurors at the old bailey trial were told the murder was carried out under the noses of the national crime squad , which had smith under surveillance at the time .
the cursed case 2001 : jury at mr smith and mr merceica 's first trial discharged after a juror was found with a mobile phone .
2002 : mr smith and mr merceica convicted but a juror later complains and convictions quashed 2006 : jury at third trial fail to agree verdicts .
2007 : jury acquits mr smith and mr merceica they heard he was suspected of being behind the importation of 500 kilos of cannabis which arrived in britain on the same day as the murder .
when the jury went out to deliberate they were given a lengthy direction on the law by the trial judge .
after several days of deliberation one of the jurors sent a detailed letter to the judge .
he gave them another direction on the law and some time later they returned with a guilty verdict .
mr smith and mr merceica lost an appeal against their convictions but took the case to the house of lords , claiming the judge should have dismissed the jury and declared a mistrial after receiving the letter from a woman juror .
prosecutor richard latham qc , the subject of a juror 's affections the law lords heard that , in the letter , she alleged some jurors were " badgering and intimidating " others to reach a particular verdict .
she quoted one of her fellow jurors as having said : " even if they 're not guilty , do you really want these people to go free ? "
the law lords ordered a new trial .
that ended in a hung jury and the fourth trial finally ended on friday .
mr levy 's widow , tina , was forced to give evidence a total of five times .
it is not the first time there have been allegations concerning jurors : a murder conviction in 1994 was overturned after it emerged that four jurors had consulted a ouija board during a drinking session on the eve of the verdict .
in 2004 the court of appeal dismissed an appeal by two conmen who were convicted despite it emerging that a female juror had sent a bottle of champagne to prosecutor richard latham with a note saying : " what does a lady need to do to attract your attention ? "
in 2001 shabbir ali mirza was jailed after being found guilty on a majority verdict of indecent assault .
after the trial a juror wrote to his barrister claiming other jurors were racially biased against mr mirza .
she said when she objected she was " shouted down " by " bigots " .
in another case a judge was informed by the jury bailiff that two jurors had climbed through a window and were sitting on the ledge smoking cigarettes and refusing to participate in deliberations .
what are the rules ?
so what are the rules governing jury service and juror misbehaviour ?
people who have been given custodial sentences are automatically excused from jury service but that does not mean those who do serve are going to be beyond reproach .
in 2004 the department of constitutional affairs announced a consultation paper and among the suggestions was that the public might be able to scrutinise the decisions of juries .
but last year after consulting lawyers , judges and other interested parties the dca decided to keep to the status quo .
the secrets of the jury room will remain secret .
it is however still open to a judge to find a juror in contempt of court .
it 's up to the jury to argue it out among themselves .
there must be circumstances where some jurors are more assertive than others and are bound to make more of an impact joshua rozenberg legal expert that is exactly what happened to keith scotcher in 2002 .
he was fined £ 2,500 after he wrote an anonymous letter to the mother of a defendant saying he had been on the jury and thought her son had been wrongly convicted .
but the daily telegraph 's legal editor , joshua rozenberg , said there was no suggestion the " badgering " jurors in the smith and merceica case had broken the law .
he said : " it 's up to the jury to argue it out among themselves .
there must be circumstances where some jurors are more assertive than others and are bound to make more of an impact .
that is what reaching agreement means . "
mr rozenberg said jurors had been fined or ticked off by judges - for example if their mobile phones went off during a trial - and he said : " a judge has powers to control his own court but they do not like prying into what is going on in the jury room . "
