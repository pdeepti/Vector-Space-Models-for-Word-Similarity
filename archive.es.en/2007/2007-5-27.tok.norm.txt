" the benes decrees are incompatible with the law , the spirit and the culture of europe , " he told a rally of the sudeten german association in the bavarian city of augsburg .
stoiber said human rights , freedom , justice and the right to a homeland were basic rights in the european union .
the future of europe could be built on this , he said , not on a set of laws leading to expulsions .
laws proclaimed by the late president edvard benes led to the confiscation of german property and the deportation of sudeten germans , who were collectively accused of having been nazi collaborators .
many died in the brutal expulsions and hundreds of thousands later settled in germany and austria , where they and their descendants still live , preserving their dialect and folk customs .
stoiber defended the sudeten german association from criticism by czech president vaclav klaus , who said the real goal of the organization was to wreck czech-german relations .
" the opposite is true , " said the bavarian premier , who also called for the creation of a national center against expulsions in berlin .
opposition to national expellee center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exhibitions have told the story but no permament site exists the czech government and poland are opposed to such a center , fearing it could attempt to rewrite history by portraying germans as victims of the war .
on saturday , sudeten german leader bernd posselt urged the government in prague to end its " hysterical fear " of the group and hold round table discussions to help rebuild trust .
czech prime minister mirek topolanek declined an invitation to attend the two-day rally in augsburg on the grounds that his presence would not contribute to improving german-czech relations . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de explaining the expellee experience after world war ii , germans were expelled from eastern europe and sent to a divided germany .

the discussions are scheduled for may 31 . iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani and eu foreign policy chief javier solana had been due to meet on thursday , possibly in spain , for their second encounter in just over a month .
however iran 's foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini unexpectedly told reporters at his morning press briefing the meeting had been postponed to allow both sides more time .
" for the larijani-solana meeting , no date or venue has been set .
with the agreement of both sides it has been postponed , " he said .
however amid confusion and concern over why the key meeting had been so suddenly shelved , the foreign ministry later issued a statement from hosseini 's office saying that the talks would , as planned , be held on thursday .
it also indicated that the two men had been in touch recently to confirm the date but did not say if this was after the announcement of the postponement early sunday morning .
early cancellation later retracted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani. right , and javier solana will meet again " in the light of the latest agreement between mr larijani and mr solana , the date for the negotiations is thursday , may 31 , " said the statement .
" the venue will be decided through their contacts , " it added .
there was no explanation for the morning 's announcement .
the meetings between larijani and solana are central to diplomatic efforts to resolve the standoff , which has already seen iran slapped with two sets of un sanctions for its refusal to suspend uranium enrichment .
after missing the latest un security council deadline to suspend the process , western powers are now pressing for iran to face further penalties for its defiance .
freezing of enrichment a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans will be looking for movement from iran even when the pair meet , it remains unclear whether the two sides will be able to achieve any breakthrough , with the eu wanting iran to freeze uranium enrichment and tehran refusing to even consider such a move .
iran 's right to enrichment is the main obstacle toward resolving the standoff as the sensitive process can be used both to make nuclear fuel and , in highly extended form , to produce the fissile core of a bomb .
the united states accuses iran of seeking nuclear weapons , a charge vehemently denied by tehran , which says it just wants to produce energy for a growing population whose fossil fuels will eventually run out .
washington has never ruled out the use of force to resolve the standoff and has sent a clear warning to iran by sailing two nuclear-powered aircraft carriers through the straits of hormuz .
hosseini however brushed off the move .
" the us military build-up in the persian gulf is aimed mostly at lifting their spirits , " he commented .
us-iran dialogue to reopen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq may be the main topic but both sides have other issues the larijani-solana talks are due just three days after eagerly awaited talks in baghdad on monday between iran and its arch enemy the united states .
the talks between us ambassador to iraq ryan crocker and iranian ambassador hassan kazemi will be the highest-level public talks involving only envoys of the two sides since the 1979 islamic revolution .
however both sides have insisted that the talks be strictly limited to iraq , with no chance of the discussions straying into the nuclear crisis .
in a sign of the tension that still exists between the two foes , iran 's intelligence minister said on saturday that the islamic republic had smashed several spy networks run by the us-led coalition in iraq .
" several espionage networks linked to the occupation forces in iraq have been identified and dismantled in the west , southwest and central regions of iran , " said gholam hossein mohseni ejeie , without elaborating . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , eu urges belligerent iran to rethink nuclear program the german presidency of the eu on thursday urged iran to rethink its nuclear program after the un atomic watchdog warned that tehran could acquire nuclear weapons within three to eight years .

the discussions are scheduled for may 31 . iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani and eu foreign policy chief javier solana had been due to meet on thursday , possibly in spain , for their second encounter in just over a month .
however iran 's foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini unexpectedly told reporters at his morning press briefing the meeting had been postponed to allow both sides more time .
" for the larijani-solana meeting , no date or venue has been set .
with the agreement of both sides it has been postponed , " he said .
however amid confusion and concern over why the key meeting had been so suddenly shelved , the foreign ministry later issued a statement from hosseini 's office saying that the talks would , as planned , be held on thursday .
it also indicated that the two men had been in touch recently to confirm the date but did not say if this was after the announcement of the postponement early sunday morning .
early cancellation later retracted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani. right , and javier solana will meet again " in the light of the latest agreement between mr larijani and mr solana , the date for the negotiations is thursday , may 31 , " said the statement .
" the venue will be decided through their contacts , " it added .
there was no explanation for the morning 's announcement .
the meetings between larijani and solana are central to diplomatic efforts to resolve the standoff , which has already seen iran slapped with two sets of un sanctions for its refusal to suspend uranium enrichment .
after missing the latest un security council deadline to suspend the process , western powers are now pressing for iran to face further penalties for its defiance .
freezing of enrichment a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans will be looking for movement from iran even when the pair meet , it remains unclear whether the two sides will be able to achieve any breakthrough , with the eu wanting iran to freeze uranium enrichment and tehran refusing to even consider such a move .
iran 's right to enrichment is the main obstacle toward resolving the standoff as the sensitive process can be used both to make nuclear fuel and , in highly extended form , to produce the fissile core of a bomb .
the united states accuses iran of seeking nuclear weapons , a charge vehemently denied by tehran , which says it just wants to produce energy for a growing population whose fossil fuels will eventually run out .
washington has never ruled out the use of force to resolve the standoff and has sent a clear warning to iran by sailing two nuclear-powered aircraft carriers through the straits of hormuz .
hosseini however brushed off the move .
" the us military build-up in the persian gulf is aimed mostly at lifting their spirits , " he commented .
us-iran dialogue to reopen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq may be the main topic but both sides have other issues the larijani-solana talks are due just three days after eagerly awaited talks in baghdad on monday between iran and its arch enemy the united states .
the talks between us ambassador to iraq ryan crocker and iranian ambassador hassan kazemi will be the highest-level public talks involving only envoys of the two sides since the 1979 islamic revolution .
however both sides have insisted that the talks be strictly limited to iraq , with no chance of the discussions straying into the nuclear crisis .
in a sign of the tension that still exists between the two foes , iran 's intelligence minister said on saturday that the islamic republic had smashed several spy networks run by the us-led coalition in iraq .
" several espionage networks linked to the occupation forces in iraq have been identified and dismantled in the west , southwest and central regions of iran , " said gholam hossein mohseni ejeie , without elaborating . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , eu urges belligerent iran to rethink nuclear program the german presidency of the eu on thursday urged iran to rethink its nuclear program after the un atomic watchdog warned that tehran could acquire nuclear weapons within three to eight years .

the environmental protection group greenpeace saturday published a leaked document showing that the united states had raised serious new objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by the german hosts .
it looked to observers as though us objections in the form of amendments had drained the substance from the german statement .
" the united states still has serious , fundamental concerns about this draft statement , " the document stated .
washington rejects the idea of setting mandatory emissions targets , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel 's proposed climate statement calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
" the treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses multiple ' red lines ' in terms of what we simply can not agree to , " the us document said .

clapp added that " at this point we do n't see signs that the -lrb- bush -rrb- administration will change its position ... and as a matter of fact the signs go in exactly the opposite direction . "
in washington , white house spokeswoman dana perino played down the document leaked by greenpeace while acknowledging differences .

washington does not recognise the un convention on climate change as an appropriate forum for multilateral negotiations on global warming , but only as one of several possible forums .

the environmental protection group greenpeace saturday published a leaked document showing that the united states had raised serious new objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by the german hosts .
it looked to observers as though us objections in the form of amendments had drained the substance from the german statement .
" the united states still has serious , fundamental concerns about this draft statement , " the document stated .
washington rejects the idea of setting mandatory emissions targets , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel 's proposed climate statement calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
" the treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses multiple ' red lines ' in terms of what we simply can not agree to , " the us document said .
sources close to negotiations told afp the us amendments seek to remove any idea of an urgent problem of climate change requiring a firm international response .

" i injected him once with epo in the arm , " said d 'hont .
" it lasted around 10 seconds .
it was as if i was injecting some insulin into someone who was ill . "
it is the first time that d 'hont has revealed who in the telekom team he administered drugs to .
ullrich has been under suspicion of doping since being implicated , along with dozens of other riders , in the spanish doping investigation dubbed ' operation puerto ' which has engulfed the sport since may 2006 .
the 33-year-old german has always denied being involved in the affair , which was uncovered by police in spain and led to the arrest of spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes after doping products and bags of blood were found on his premises .
after months of denials italy 's ivan basso , the tour of italy champion , has recently admitted he worked with fuentes .
the 31-year-old stopped short of saying he actually doped , but is facing a 21-month ban from the italian olympic committee -lrb- coni -rrb- .
germany 's fallen cycling idol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich ended his controversial career after the allegations since being suspended from last year 's tour de france ullrich has retired from the sport , although existing suspicion has heightened in the wake of some stunning confessions from ullrich 's former team-mates this week .
denmark 's bjarne riis , the 1996 tour de france winner , admitted on friday he had used epo while at telekom , who also won the race in 1997 thanks to ullrich .
several of riis 's former telekom teammates , including top sprinter erik zabel of germany , rolf aldag , bert dietz , christian henn and udo boelts , have also admitting using the drug .
the drama provided by the series of stunning confessions took another twist saturday when a doctor employed by several sports federations in germany admitted supplying drugs to amateur cyclists between 1980 and 1990 .
georg huber , a top physician at the university of freiberg clinic , was immediately suspended from his post by the german cycling federation -lrb- bdr -rrb- after admitting to the offences .
huber said he had given the banned male sex hormone testosterone to amateur riders during 1980-1990 , according to a statement by the university clinic of freiberg - considered germany 's top sports medicine facility .
cycling 's wake-up call or death knell ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zabel begged forgiveness for his use of doping the bombshells dropped this week by zabel and riis - two of the german outfits former high profile stars - are being seen as a positive development as cycling fights to rebuild its image .
international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- president pat mcquaid said saturday : " the confessions from germany and denmark show that people are now ready to speak out .
this is extremely positive .
" the law of silence no longer applies - each person must now assume the full consequences of their actions . "
more than eight years on , riis and the other repentants can not now be sanctioned , although the 43-year-old dane is ready to hand back his yellow jersey from his 1996 victory .
the uci and tour de france officials feel it would be a symbolic gesture that would help put the sport on a more sound footing .
it now remains to be seen if the latest claims against ullrich , one of the tour de france 's main protagonists over the past decade , lead to a similar scenario .
d 'hont claimed that ullrich was only following other riders in taking epo , and he urged the german to follow his former team-mates in confessing .
" he did the same as all the others .
it would be good for him to speak out and get things out into the open , it would liberate him , " added d 'hont , who nonetheless could not hide his admiration for the 2000 olympic champion who finished a runner-up five time on the tour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 27.05.2007 ukraine crisis abates with plans for new elections in september großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president yushchenko and prime minister yanukovych put aside their differences for now ukraine 's sparring political parties agreed to a date for fresh parliamentary elections early sunday in a breakthrough hailed by both sides as an end to their feud , and the threat of military confrontation in kiev . pro-european president viktor yushchenko and pro-russian prime minister viktor yanukovich agreed to hold the elections on september 30 , the interfax news agency reported .
the two leaders had been locked in a long-running battle over the legality of early parliamentary elections that had been called by yushchenko , and moves by yanukovich 's coalition to dominate parliament .
the dispute degenerated further this week after yushchenko fired a prosecutor general supported by yanukovich , who in turn had loyal police break in and escort the prosecutor general back to his office building , brawling with pro-yushchenko security guards in the process .
it was the first outbreak violence between organized units of competing branches of the country 's government , since ukraine 's 1991 independence .
troop build-up disperses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops loyal to the president massed outside kiev yushchenko ordered all state buildings in the capital secured and some 2,000 troops were en route to kiev saturday , but the forces were held up outside the city by police loyal to yanukovich .
observers feared a possible assault on the prosecutor general 's office , and uniformed police were unloading steel barriers at the building late saturday evening .
troop columns were returning to bases on sunday , as were pro-yanukovich police at the prosecutor general 's office building .
kiev 's streets barely registered the conflict , with vehicle and pedestrian traffic moving normally under clear skies .
the grounds around the prosecutor general office often resembled a vacation park more than a protest epicentre , with demonstrators and riot police alike seen relaxing , drinking water , sitting on benches , and unbuttoning exterior clothing in the face of unseasonably hot temperatures exceeding 33 degrees in the shade .
the two sides announced a deal was reached after marathon talks ending at around 3 am in kiev .
process for new elections to begin soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko made concessions to ease the crisis parliament will meet for a special session on may 29 and 30 to go through the procedure of setting new elections .
a " special mechanism " in the form of a joint council will oversee legal changes , yushchenko said .
the two sides also agreed that the country 's security forces would not be misused in the dispute .
parliamentary speaker alexander moroz , and opposition leader julia timoshenko joined in the talks , but timoshenko was not named as a participant in the compromise agreement .
the compromise deal conceded yushchenko 's right to call elections , but also pushed the date of the vote beyond the end of summer , a condition yushchenko earlier had described as unacceptable .
" we need to avoid repeating past mistakes , " yanukovich said .
other terms listed in a joint statement included changes in the membership of the central election committee , law making illegal judicial participation in political disputes and an overhaul in national voter rolls .
hope that this truce will hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two viktor 's have never seen eye-to-eye for long it was not the first time this week that yushchenko and yanukovich announced they had resolved the crisis , but the first time a concrete date for elections was set .
the pair in a joint announcement declared their agreement on constitutional amendments would be necessary , to prevent a repeat crisis .
moroz called the deal " not an ideal solution , but the best possible under the circumstances . "
yushchenko identified the inability of the constitutional court , prosecutors and the central election committee to do their jobs in the face of a conflict between the executive and legislative branches as the root of the problem .
" these institutions must be free of political influence , " he said .
" most likely , we will have to find answers in a new constitution . "
ukraine 's last constitution was signed into law in 2006 .

the two leaders had been locked in a long-running battle over the legality of early parliamentary elections that had been called by yushchenko , and moves by yanukovich 's coalition to dominate parliament .
the dispute degenerated further this week after yushchenko fired a prosecutor general supported by yanukovich , who in turn had loyal police break in and escort the prosecutor general back to his office building , brawling with pro-yushchenko security guards in the process .
it was the first outbreak violence between organized units of competing branches of the country 's government , since ukraine 's 1991 independence .
troop build-up disperses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops loyal to the president massed outside kiev yushchenko ordered all state buildings in the capital secured and some 2,000 troops were en route to kiev saturday , but the forces were held up outside the city by police loyal to yanukovich .
observers feared a possible assault on the prosecutor general 's office , and uniformed police were unloading steel barriers at the building late saturday evening .
troop columns were returning to bases on sunday , as were pro-yanukovich police at the prosecutor general 's office building .
kiev 's streets barely registered the conflict , with vehicle and pedestrian traffic moving normally under clear skies .
the grounds around the prosecutor general office often resembled a vacation park more than a protest epicentre , with demonstrators and riot police alike seen relaxing , drinking water , sitting on benches , and unbuttoning exterior clothing in the face of unseasonably hot temperatures exceeding 33 degrees in the shade .
the two sides announced a deal was reached after marathon talks ending at around 3 am in kiev .
process for new elections to begin soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko made concessions to ease the crisis parliament will meet for a special session on may 29 and 30 to go through the procedure of setting new elections .
a " special mechanism " in the form of a joint council will oversee legal changes , yushchenko said .
the two sides also agreed that the country 's security forces would not be misused in the dispute .
parliamentary speaker alexander moroz , and opposition leader julia timoshenko joined in the talks , but timoshenko was not named as a participant in the compromise agreement .
the compromise deal conceded yushchenko 's right to call elections , but also pushed the date of the vote beyond the end of summer , a condition yushchenko earlier had described as unacceptable .
" we need to avoid repeating past mistakes , " yanukovich said .
other terms listed in a joint statement included changes in the membership of the central election committee , law making illegal judicial participation in political disputes and an overhaul in national voter rolls .
hope that this truce will hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two viktor 's have never seen eye-to-eye for long it was not the first time this week that yushchenko and yanukovich announced they had resolved the crisis , but the first time a concrete date for elections was set .
the pair in a joint announcement declared their agreement on constitutional amendments would be necessary , to prevent a repeat crisis .
moroz called the deal " not an ideal solution , but the best possible under the circumstances . "
yushchenko identified the inability of the constitutional court , prosecutors and the central election committee to do their jobs in the face of a conflict between the executive and legislative branches as the root of the problem .
" these institutions must be free of political influence , " he said .
" most likely , we will have to find answers in a new constitution . "

the two leaders had been locked in a long-running battle over the legality of early parliamentary elections that had been called by yushchenko , and moves by yanukovich 's coalition to dominate parliament .
the dispute degenerated further this week after yushchenko fired a prosecutor general supported by yanukovich , who in turn had loyal police break in and escort the prosecutor general back to his office building , brawling with pro-yushchenko security guards in the process .
it was the first outbreak violence between organized units of competing branches of the country 's government , since ukraine 's 1991 independence .
troop build-up disperses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops loyal to the president massed outside kiev yushchenko ordered all state buildings in the capital secured and some 2,000 troops were en route to kiev saturday , but the forces were held up outside the city by police loyal to yanukovich .
observers feared a possible assault on the prosecutor general 's office , and uniformed police were unloading steel barriers at the building late saturday evening .
troop columns were returning to bases on sunday , as were pro-yanukovich police at the prosecutor general 's office building .
kiev 's streets barely registered the conflict , with vehicle and pedestrian traffic moving normally under clear skies .
the grounds around the prosecutor general office often resembled a vacation park more than a protest epicentre , with demonstrators and riot police alike seen relaxing , drinking water , sitting on benches , and unbuttoning exterior clothing in the face of unseasonably hot temperatures exceeding 33 degrees in the shade .
the two sides announced a deal was reached after marathon talks ending at around 3 am in kiev .
process for new elections to begin soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko made concessions to ease the crisis parliament will meet for a special session on may 29 and 30 to go through the procedure of setting new elections .
a " special mechanism " in the form of a joint council will oversee legal changes , yushchenko said .
the two sides also agreed that the country 's security forces would not be misused in the dispute .
parliamentary speaker alexander moroz , and opposition leader julia timoshenko joined in the talks , but timoshenko was not named as a participant in the compromise agreement .
the compromise deal conceded yushchenko 's right to call elections , but also pushed the date of the vote beyond the end of summer , a condition yushchenko earlier had described as unacceptable .
" we need to avoid repeating past mistakes , " yanukovich said .
other terms listed in a joint statement included changes in the membership of the central election committee , law making illegal judicial participation in political disputes and an overhaul in national voter rolls .
hope that this truce will hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two viktor 's have never seen eye-to-eye for long it was not the first time this week that yushchenko and yanukovich announced they had resolved the crisis , but the first time a concrete date for elections was set .
the pair in a joint announcement declared their agreement on constitutional amendments would be necessary , to prevent a repeat crisis .
moroz called the deal " not an ideal solution , but the best possible under the circumstances . "
yushchenko identified the inability of the constitutional court , prosecutors and the central election committee to do their jobs in the face of a conflict between the executive and legislative branches as the root of the problem .
" these institutions must be free of political influence , " he said .
" most likely , we will have to find answers in a new constitution . "
ukraine 's last constitution was signed into law in 2006 .
in a possible sign of real willingness to compromise , both yushchenko and yanukovich said they would appear in public together to attend the national cup match of the ukrainian professional soccer league , pitting dynamo kiev against shakhtar donetsk .
enthusiasm for the sport of football is in ukraine one of the few areas the country 's feuding political clans find common ground .
however , yushchenko is a lifetime dynamo supporter , while yanukovich is a shakhtar fan . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de troops loyal to yushchenko attempt to enter kiev as talks stall troops loyal to ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko tried to enter the capital kiev saturday , the interior ministry said , as crisis talks between the feuding president and prime minister were delayed .

the environmental protection group greenpeace saturday published a leaked document showing that the united states had raised serious new objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by the german hosts .
it looked to observers as though us objections in the form of amendments had drained the substance from the german statement .
" the united states still has serious , fundamental concerns about this draft statement , " the document stated .
washington rejects the idea of setting mandatory emissions targets , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel 's proposed climate statement calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
" the treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses multiple ' red lines ' in terms of what we simply can not agree to , " the us document said .
sources close to negotiations told afp the us amendments seek to remove any idea of an urgent problem of climate change requiring a firm international response .
us rejects climate change as an ' urgent problem ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us denies the scientific evidence is conclusive " the preliminary sessions clearly indicate the american desire to minimalise -lrb- the draft -rrb- , " said one european diplomatic source .
the us was refusing to take account of findings by an intergovernmental group of experts on climate change , whose latest conclusions have been used by the germans in their draft climate statement , the source said .
" i ca n't remember any major international climate meeting with that kind of complete divergence of views , " said phil clapp , head of the national environment trust in washington .
" there is a fundamental disagreement between the eu and the bush administration positions .
it 's hard to see how governments could sign the sort of statement that washington wants . "
clapp added that " at this point we do n't see signs that the -lrb- bush -rrb- administration will change its position ... and as a matter of fact the signs go in exactly the opposite direction . "
in washington , white house spokeswoman dana perino played down the document leaked by greenpeace while acknowledging differences .
" we believe that there are many different approaches to climate change , " she said .
" by no means is there a final document . "
washington does not recognise the un convention on climate change as an appropriate forum for multilateral negotiations on global warming , but only as one of several possible forums .
kyoto successor also in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a follow-up climate protocol to kyoto could also be in danger this also does not augur well for a conference scheduled in bali in december at which states signatory to the convention will have to negotiate a follow-up to the kyoto protocol on climate change which runs out in 2012 .
the us has not signed the protocol .
" these latest proposals display a complete absence of reconciliation between the american technological approach and that of the eu ... " said the diplomatic source .
" and all this despite appeals by major american companies and republican party personalities like arnold schwarzenegger . "
on may 18 , senior us lawmakers wrote to bush expressing deep concern over reports that his administration was seeking to weaken a g8 declaration on climate change .
" us leadership is critical to tackling this global threat .
but we need an executive branch that engages the rest of the world to solve this problem rather than stubbornly ignoring it , " the 15 heads of congressional committees wrote in a letter . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : us rejects germany 's g8 climate declaration the united states has raised new serious objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by germany for next month 's group of eight summit , the washington post reported saturday .
-lrb- 26.05.2007 -rrb- merkel sets g8 agenda , doubts concrete results climate change , development aid and hedge-fund transparency would top the agenda at the g8 summit on june 6-8 , said chancellor angela merkel thursday , but she was n't confident that much progress would be made .
-lrb- 24.05.2007 -rrb- " we are taxing the lives of future generations " jakob von uexküll founded the world future council to provide a voice for future generations on topics like climate change , poverty and fair trade .
people are waiting for integrated answers to global crises , he told dw .
-lrb- 10.05.2007 -rrb- eu leads clamor for carbon cuts after un climate report europe led demands for a deal to slash global greenhouse gas emissions after the un 's top scientific panel said early , deep cuts could avert the worst of long-term climate damage - and at a modest cost .

now , there may be progress in making islam a regular course in german schools . more than 700,000 muslim students attend school in germany , but nowhere does the religious curriculum deal with islam in the same way as christianity .
the problem is that most schools rely on their local mosque for guidance , which means there can be large discrepancies in the content and quality of instruction .
that is why german state governments and muslim organizations alike are looking to create a more standardized approach to teaching islam .
it is not an easy task , however .
about two-and-a-half million of germany 's muslims belong to the sunni denomination of islam .
but the rest are mainly shiites , alevis or followers of the south asian ahmaddiyya movement .
broad spectrum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no standardized method for teaching islam with such a broad spectrum of beliefs among them , islam expert michael kiefer said creating a single combined course would be difficult .
" we 've seen in austria , for example , that the concept of one course for all muslims is controversial , because the smaller denominations are left out , " he said .
that is why authorities in the german state of baden-württemberg have decided to offer with two courses : one for sunni and shia students , and another for alevis .
so far , it looks like a number of other states will base their systems on this model as well , he said .
the states of north rhine-westphalia , bavaria and lower saxony , however , are still looking for ways to create one standard curriculum with the help of various muslim groups . fundamental principles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are divergent views about how to teach islam in lower saxony , for example , a number of muslim organizations have come together to form a " shura , " or council , to help authorities define the fundamental principles to be included in courses on islam .
state education minister heidemarie ballasch says the body 's recommendations have been put to the test in a pilot project at 21 schools since 2003 .
" one of the political goals of the trial is to promote integration instead of parallel social structures , " ballasch said .
" another is to help school students learn about their islam and other religions , so that when the time comes , they 're in a position to declare their faith , " she added .
while most german state education systems limit islamic instruction to primary school , north rhine-westphalia has gone down a different path , offering courses from year 1-10 .
last year , more than 130 schools with some 10,000 muslim students took part in the project .
thousands have participated in the capital berlin , some 4,500 school students have taken part in islamic studies courses since 2003 , while another ten schools recently added material relevant to alevism to their curricula as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over half a million muslims attend german schools " our co-operation with the islamic federation has , by and large , led to a positive expansion of religious education in our schools , ” said hans-jürgen pokall of berlin 's education , science and research administration .
" the initial problems we experienced , which had more to do with the way some teachers interacted with the students than the actual content of the courses , have subsided , " he said .
berlin ’ s islamic federation expects that the demand for school teachers with qualifications in islamic religious instruction will grow as more and more parents request courses for their children .
it is also calling for long-term planning to meet the demand .
the university of münster , for example , was quick to react to the trend and has been training specialist teachers since 2005 .
other institutes , such as the university of osnabrück , are already following suit . sabine ripperger -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de many see progress at berlin islam talks , but differences remain the german government attempted to reach out to the country 's more than three million muslims on wednesday but faced criticism from a muslim leader for organizing " aimless " talks .
-lrb- 02.05.2007 -rrb- female imams in german mosques get a mixed reception turkey 's religious council has already sent 13 women to germany to serve in mosques .
there have been requests for more , even if some reject teaching from a woman .

" another is to help school students learn about their islam and other religions , so that when the time comes , they 're in a position to declare their faith , " she added .
while most german state education systems limit islamic instruction to primary school , north rhine-westphalia has gone down a different path , offering courses from year 1-10 .
last year , more than 130 schools with some 10,000 muslim students took part in the project .
thousands have participated in the capital berlin , some 4,500 school students have taken part in islamic studies courses since 2003 , while another ten schools recently added material relevant to alevism to their curricula as well .

" the initial problems we experienced , which had more to do with the way some teachers interacted with the students than the actual content of the courses , have subsided , " he said .
berlin ’ s islamic federation expects that the demand for school teachers with qualifications in islamic religious instruction will grow as more and more parents request courses for their children .
it is also calling for long-term planning to meet the demand .

now , there may be progress in making islam a regular course in german schools . more than 700,000 muslim students attend school in germany , but nowhere does the religious curriculum deal with islam in the same way as christianity .
the problem is that most schools rely on their local mosque for guidance , which means there can be large discrepancies in the content and quality of instruction .
that is why german state governments and muslim organizations alike are looking to create a more standardized approach to teaching islam .
it is not an easy task , however .
about two-and-a-half million of germany 's muslims belong to the sunni denomination of islam .
but the rest are mainly shiites , alevis or followers of the south asian ahmaddiyya movement .

that is why authorities in the german state of baden-württemberg have decided to offer with two courses : one for sunni and shia students , and another for alevis .
so far , it looks like a number of other states will base their systems on this model as well , he said .

the environmental protection group greenpeace saturday published a leaked document showing that the united states had raised serious new objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by the german hosts .
it looked to observers as though us objections in the form of amendments had drained the substance from the german statement .
" the united states still has serious , fundamental concerns about this draft statement , " the document stated .
washington rejects the idea of setting mandatory emissions targets , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel 's proposed climate statement calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
" the treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses multiple ' red lines ' in terms of what we simply can not agree to , " the us document said .
sources close to negotiations told afp the us amendments seek to remove any idea of an urgent problem of climate change requiring a firm international response .
us rejects climate change as an ' urgent problem ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us denies the scientific evidence is conclusive " the preliminary sessions clearly indicate the american desire to minimalise -lrb- the draft -rrb- , " said one european diplomatic source .
the us was refusing to take account of findings by an intergovernmental group of experts on climate change , whose latest conclusions have been used by the germans in their draft climate statement , the source said .
" i ca n't remember any major international climate meeting with that kind of complete divergence of views , " said phil clapp , head of the national environment trust in washington .
" there is a fundamental disagreement between the eu and the bush administration positions .
it 's hard to see how governments could sign the sort of statement that washington wants . "
clapp added that " at this point we do n't see signs that the -lrb- bush -rrb- administration will change its position ... and as a matter of fact the signs go in exactly the opposite direction . "
in washington , white house spokeswoman dana perino played down the document leaked by greenpeace while acknowledging differences .
" we believe that there are many different approaches to climate change , " she said .
" by no means is there a final document . "
washington does not recognise the un convention on climate change as an appropriate forum for multilateral negotiations on global warming , but only as one of several possible forums .
kyoto successor also in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a follow-up climate protocol to kyoto could also be in danger this also does not augur well for a conference scheduled in bali in december at which states signatory to the convention will have to negotiate a follow-up to the kyoto protocol on climate change which runs out in 2012 .
the us has not signed the protocol .
" these latest proposals display a complete absence of reconciliation between the american technological approach and that of the eu ... " said the diplomatic source .
" and all this despite appeals by major american companies and republican party personalities like arnold schwarzenegger . "
on may 18 , senior us lawmakers wrote to bush expressing deep concern over reports that his administration was seeking to weaken a g8 declaration on climate change .
" us leadership is critical to tackling this global threat .
but we need an executive branch that engages the rest of the world to solve this problem rather than stubbornly ignoring it , " the 15 heads of congressional committees wrote in a letter . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : us rejects germany 's g8 climate declaration the united states has raised new serious objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by germany for next month 's group of eight summit , the washington post reported saturday .
-lrb- 26.05.2007 -rrb- merkel sets g8 agenda , doubts concrete results climate change , development aid and hedge-fund transparency would top the agenda at the g8 summit on june 6-8 , said chancellor angela merkel thursday , but she was n't confident that much progress would be made .
-lrb- 24.05.2007 -rrb- " we are taxing the lives of future generations " jakob von uexküll founded the world future council to provide a voice for future generations on topics like climate change , poverty and fair trade .

the environmental protection group greenpeace saturday published a leaked document showing that the united states had raised serious new objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by the german hosts .
it looked to observers as though us objections in the form of amendments had drained the substance from the german statement .
" the united states still has serious , fundamental concerns about this draft statement , " the document stated .
washington rejects the idea of setting mandatory emissions targets , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel 's proposed climate statement calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
" the treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses multiple ' red lines ' in terms of what we simply can not agree to , " the us document said .
sources close to negotiations told afp the us amendments seek to remove any idea of an urgent problem of climate change requiring a firm international response .
us rejects climate change as an ' urgent problem ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us denies the scientific evidence is conclusive " the preliminary sessions clearly indicate the american desire to minimalise -lrb- the draft -rrb- , " said one european diplomatic source .
the us was refusing to take account of findings by an intergovernmental group of experts on climate change , whose latest conclusions have been used by the germans in their draft climate statement , the source said .
" i ca n't remember any major international climate meeting with that kind of complete divergence of views , " said phil clapp , head of the national environment trust in washington .
" there is a fundamental disagreement between the eu and the bush administration positions .
it 's hard to see how governments could sign the sort of statement that washington wants . "
clapp added that " at this point we do n't see signs that the -lrb- bush -rrb- administration will change its position ... and as a matter of fact the signs go in exactly the opposite direction . "
in washington , white house spokeswoman dana perino played down the document leaked by greenpeace while acknowledging differences .
" we believe that there are many different approaches to climate change , " she said .
" by no means is there a final document . "
washington does not recognise the un convention on climate change as an appropriate forum for multilateral negotiations on global warming , but only as one of several possible forums .
kyoto successor also in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a follow-up climate protocol to kyoto could also be in danger this also does not augur well for a conference scheduled in bali in december at which states signatory to the convention will have to negotiate a follow-up to the kyoto protocol on climate change which runs out in 2012 .
the us has not signed the protocol .
" these latest proposals display a complete absence of reconciliation between the american technological approach and that of the eu ... " said the diplomatic source .
" and all this despite appeals by major american companies and republican party personalities like arnold schwarzenegger . "
on may 18 , senior us lawmakers wrote to bush expressing deep concern over reports that his administration was seeking to weaken a g8 declaration on climate change .
" us leadership is critical to tackling this global threat .
but we need an executive branch that engages the rest of the world to solve this problem rather than stubbornly ignoring it , " the 15 heads of congressional committees wrote in a letter . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : us rejects germany 's g8 climate declaration the united states has raised new serious objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by germany for next month 's group of eight summit , the washington post reported saturday .

the discussions are scheduled for may 31 . iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani and eu foreign policy chief javier solana had been due to meet on thursday , possibly in spain , for their second encounter in just over a month .
however iran 's foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini unexpectedly told reporters at his morning press briefing the meeting had been postponed to allow both sides more time .
" for the larijani-solana meeting , no date or venue has been set .
with the agreement of both sides it has been postponed , " he said .
however amid confusion and concern over why the key meeting had been so suddenly shelved , the foreign ministry later issued a statement from hosseini 's office saying that the talks would , as planned , be held on thursday .
it also indicated that the two men had been in touch recently to confirm the date but did not say if this was after the announcement of the postponement early sunday morning .
early cancellation later retracted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani. right , and javier solana will meet again " in the light of the latest agreement between mr larijani and mr solana , the date for the negotiations is thursday , may 31 , " said the statement .
" the venue will be decided through their contacts , " it added .
there was no explanation for the morning 's announcement .
the meetings between larijani and solana are central to diplomatic efforts to resolve the standoff , which has already seen iran slapped with two sets of un sanctions for its refusal to suspend uranium enrichment .
after missing the latest un security council deadline to suspend the process , western powers are now pressing for iran to face further penalties for its defiance .
freezing of enrichment a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans will be looking for movement from iran even when the pair meet , it remains unclear whether the two sides will be able to achieve any breakthrough , with the eu wanting iran to freeze uranium enrichment and tehran refusing to even consider such a move .
iran 's right to enrichment is the main obstacle toward resolving the standoff as the sensitive process can be used both to make nuclear fuel and , in highly extended form , to produce the fissile core of a bomb .
the united states accuses iran of seeking nuclear weapons , a charge vehemently denied by tehran , which says it just wants to produce energy for a growing population whose fossil fuels will eventually run out .
washington has never ruled out the use of force to resolve the standoff and has sent a clear warning to iran by sailing two nuclear-powered aircraft carriers through the straits of hormuz .
hosseini however brushed off the move .
" the us military build-up in the persian gulf is aimed mostly at lifting their spirits , " he commented .
us-iran dialogue to reopen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq may be the main topic but both sides have other issues the larijani-solana talks are due just three days after eagerly awaited talks in baghdad on monday between iran and its arch enemy the united states .
the talks between us ambassador to iraq ryan crocker and iranian ambassador hassan kazemi will be the highest-level public talks involving only envoys of the two sides since the 1979 islamic revolution .
however both sides have insisted that the talks be strictly limited to iraq , with no chance of the discussions straying into the nuclear crisis .
in a sign of the tension that still exists between the two foes , iran 's intelligence minister said on saturday that the islamic republic had smashed several spy networks run by the us-led coalition in iraq .
" several espionage networks linked to the occupation forces in iraq have been identified and dismantled in the west , southwest and central regions of iran , " said gholam hossein mohseni ejeie , without elaborating . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , eu urges belligerent iran to rethink nuclear program the german presidency of the eu on thursday urged iran to rethink its nuclear program after the un atomic watchdog warned that tehran could acquire nuclear weapons within three to eight years .
-lrb- 24.05.2007 -rrb- iran expects " new ideas " from eu to end nuclear standoff iran 's nuclear negotiator ali larijani said wednesday that he expected new ideas from eu foreign policy chief javier solana on breaking the standoff over tehran 's disputed nuclear program .

" i injected him once with epo in the arm , " said d 'hont .
" it lasted around 10 seconds .
it was as if i was injecting some insulin into someone who was ill . "
it is the first time that d 'hont has revealed who in the telekom team he administered drugs to .
ullrich has been under suspicion of doping since being implicated , along with dozens of other riders , in the spanish doping investigation dubbed ' operation puerto ' which has engulfed the sport since may 2006 .
the 33-year-old german has always denied being involved in the affair , which was uncovered by police in spain and led to the arrest of spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes after doping products and bags of blood were found on his premises .
after months of denials italy 's ivan basso , the tour of italy champion , has recently admitted he worked with fuentes .

several of riis 's former telekom teammates , including top sprinter erik zabel of germany , rolf aldag , bert dietz , christian henn and udo boelts , have also admitting using the drug .
the drama provided by the series of stunning confessions took another twist saturday when a doctor employed by several sports federations in germany admitted supplying drugs to amateur cyclists between 1980 and 1990 .
georg huber , a top physician at the university of freiberg clinic , was immediately suspended from his post by the german cycling federation -lrb- bdr -rrb- after admitting to the offences .

it also indicated that the two men had been in touch recently to confirm the date but did not say if this was after the announcement of the postponement early sunday morning .

" the venue will be decided through their contacts , " it added .
there was no explanation for the morning 's announcement .
the meetings between larijani and solana are central to diplomatic efforts to resolve the standoff , which has already seen iran slapped with two sets of un sanctions for its refusal to suspend uranium enrichment .
after missing the latest un security council deadline to suspend the process , western powers are now pressing for iran to face further penalties for its defiance .

iran 's right to enrichment is the main obstacle toward resolving the standoff as the sensitive process can be used both to make nuclear fuel and , in highly extended form , to produce the fissile core of a bomb .
the united states accuses iran of seeking nuclear weapons , a charge vehemently denied by tehran , which says it just wants to produce energy for a growing population whose fossil fuels will eventually run out .
washington has never ruled out the use of force to resolve the standoff and has sent a clear warning to iran by sailing two nuclear-powered aircraft carriers through the straits of hormuz .
hosseini however brushed off the move .

in a sign of the tension that still exists between the two foes , iran 's intelligence minister said on saturday that the islamic republic had smashed several spy networks run by the us-led coalition in iraq .

the environmental protection group greenpeace saturday published a leaked document showing that the united states had raised serious new objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by the german hosts .
it looked to observers as though us objections in the form of amendments had drained the substance from the german statement .
" the united states still has serious , fundamental concerns about this draft statement , " the document stated .
washington rejects the idea of setting mandatory emissions targets , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel 's proposed climate statement calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
" the treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses multiple ' red lines ' in terms of what we simply can not agree to , " the us document said .

clapp added that " at this point we do n't see signs that the -lrb- bush -rrb- administration will change its position ... and as a matter of fact the signs go in exactly the opposite direction . "
in washington , white house spokeswoman dana perino played down the document leaked by greenpeace while acknowledging differences .

the two leaders had been locked in a long-running battle over the legality of early parliamentary elections that had been called by yushchenko , and moves by yanukovich 's coalition to dominate parliament .
the dispute degenerated further this week after yushchenko fired a prosecutor general supported by yanukovich , who in turn had loyal police break in and escort the prosecutor general back to his office building , brawling with pro-yushchenko security guards in the process .
it was the first outbreak violence between organized units of competing branches of the country 's government , since ukraine 's 1991 independence .
troop build-up disperses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops loyal to the president massed outside kiev yushchenko ordered all state buildings in the capital secured and some 2,000 troops were en route to kiev saturday , but the forces were held up outside the city by police loyal to yanukovich .
observers feared a possible assault on the prosecutor general 's office , and uniformed police were unloading steel barriers at the building late saturday evening .
troop columns were returning to bases on sunday , as were pro-yanukovich police at the prosecutor general 's office building .
kiev 's streets barely registered the conflict , with vehicle and pedestrian traffic moving normally under clear skies .
the grounds around the prosecutor general office often resembled a vacation park more than a protest epicentre , with demonstrators and riot police alike seen relaxing , drinking water , sitting on benches , and unbuttoning exterior clothing in the face of unseasonably hot temperatures exceeding 33 degrees in the shade .
the two sides announced a deal was reached after marathon talks ending at around 3 am in kiev .
process for new elections to begin soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko made concessions to ease the crisis parliament will meet for a special session on may 29 and 30 to go through the procedure of setting new elections .
a " special mechanism " in the form of a joint council will oversee legal changes , yushchenko said .
the two sides also agreed that the country 's security forces would not be misused in the dispute .
parliamentary speaker alexander moroz , and opposition leader julia timoshenko joined in the talks , but timoshenko was not named as a participant in the compromise agreement .
the compromise deal conceded yushchenko 's right to call elections , but also pushed the date of the vote beyond the end of summer , a condition yushchenko earlier had described as unacceptable .
" we need to avoid repeating past mistakes , " yanukovich said .
other terms listed in a joint statement included changes in the membership of the central election committee , law making illegal judicial participation in political disputes and an overhaul in national voter rolls .
hope that this truce will hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two viktor 's have never seen eye-to-eye for long it was not the first time this week that yushchenko and yanukovich announced they had resolved the crisis , but the first time a concrete date for elections was set .
the pair in a joint announcement declared their agreement on constitutional amendments would be necessary , to prevent a repeat crisis .
moroz called the deal " not an ideal solution , but the best possible under the circumstances . "
yushchenko identified the inability of the constitutional court , prosecutors and the central election committee to do their jobs in the face of a conflict between the executive and legislative branches as the root of the problem .
" these institutions must be free of political influence , " he said .
" most likely , we will have to find answers in a new constitution . "
ukraine 's last constitution was signed into law in 2006 .

the two leaders had been locked in a long-running battle over the legality of early parliamentary elections that had been called by yushchenko , and moves by yanukovich 's coalition to dominate parliament .

" i injected him once with epo in the arm , " said d 'hont .
" it lasted around 10 seconds .
it was as if i was injecting some insulin into someone who was ill . "
it is the first time that d 'hont has revealed who in the telekom team he administered drugs to .
ullrich has been under suspicion of doping since being implicated , along with dozens of other riders , in the spanish doping investigation dubbed ' operation puerto ' which has engulfed the sport since may 2006 .
the 33-year-old german has always denied being involved in the affair , which was uncovered by police in spain and led to the arrest of spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes after doping products and bags of blood were found on his premises .
after months of denials italy 's ivan basso , the tour of italy champion , has recently admitted he worked with fuentes .
the 31-year-old stopped short of saying he actually doped , but is facing a 21-month ban from the italian olympic committee -lrb- coni -rrb- .
germany 's fallen cycling idol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich ended his controversial career after the allegations since being suspended from last year 's tour de france ullrich has retired from the sport , although existing suspicion has heightened in the wake of some stunning confessions from ullrich 's former team-mates this week .
denmark 's bjarne riis , the 1996 tour de france winner , admitted on friday he had used epo while at telekom , who also won the race in 1997 thanks to ullrich .
several of riis 's former telekom teammates , including top sprinter erik zabel of germany , rolf aldag , bert dietz , christian henn and udo boelts , have also admitting using the drug .
the drama provided by the series of stunning confessions took another twist saturday when a doctor employed by several sports federations in germany admitted supplying drugs to amateur cyclists between 1980 and 1990 .
georg huber , a top physician at the university of freiberg clinic , was immediately suspended from his post by the german cycling federation -lrb- bdr -rrb- after admitting to the offences .
huber said he had given the banned male sex hormone testosterone to amateur riders during 1980-1990 , according to a statement by the university clinic of freiberg - considered germany 's top sports medicine facility .
cycling 's wake-up call or death knell ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zabel begged forgiveness for his use of doping the bombshells dropped this week by zabel and riis - two of the german outfits former high profile stars - are being seen as a positive development as cycling fights to rebuild its image .
international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- president pat mcquaid said saturday : " the confessions from germany and denmark show that people are now ready to speak out .
this is extremely positive .
" the law of silence no longer applies - each person must now assume the full consequences of their actions . "
more than eight years on , riis and the other repentants can not now be sanctioned , although the 43-year-old dane is ready to hand back his yellow jersey from his 1996 victory .
the uci and tour de france officials feel it would be a symbolic gesture that would help put the sport on a more sound footing .
it now remains to be seen if the latest claims against ullrich , one of the tour de france 's main protagonists over the past decade , lead to a similar scenario .
d 'hont claimed that ullrich was only following other riders in taking epo , and he urged the german to follow his former team-mates in confessing .
" he did the same as all the others .
it would be good for him to speak out and get things out into the open , it would liberate him , " added d 'hont , who nonetheless could not hide his admiration for the 2000 olympic champion who finished a runner-up five time on the tour .

the two leaders had been locked in a long-running battle over the legality of early parliamentary elections that had been called by yushchenko , and moves by yanukovich 's coalition to dominate parliament .
the dispute degenerated further this week after yushchenko fired a prosecutor general supported by yanukovich , who in turn had loyal police break in and escort the prosecutor general back to his office building , brawling with pro-yushchenko security guards in the process .
it was the first outbreak violence between organized units of competing branches of the country 's government , since ukraine 's 1991 independence .
troop build-up disperses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops loyal to the president massed outside kiev yushchenko ordered all state buildings in the capital secured and some 2,000 troops were en route to kiev saturday , but the forces were held up outside the city by police loyal to yanukovich .
observers feared a possible assault on the prosecutor general 's office , and uniformed police were unloading steel barriers at the building late saturday evening .
troop columns were returning to bases on sunday , as were pro-yanukovich police at the prosecutor general 's office building .
kiev 's streets barely registered the conflict , with vehicle and pedestrian traffic moving normally under clear skies .
the grounds around the prosecutor general office often resembled a vacation park more than a protest epicentre , with demonstrators and riot police alike seen relaxing , drinking water , sitting on benches , and unbuttoning exterior clothing in the face of unseasonably hot temperatures exceeding 33 degrees in the shade .
the two sides announced a deal was reached after marathon talks ending at around 3 am in kiev .
process for new elections to begin soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko made concessions to ease the crisis parliament will meet for a special session on may 29 and 30 to go through the procedure of setting new elections .
a " special mechanism " in the form of a joint council will oversee legal changes , yushchenko said .
the two sides also agreed that the country 's security forces would not be misused in the dispute .
parliamentary speaker alexander moroz , and opposition leader julia timoshenko joined in the talks , but timoshenko was not named as a participant in the compromise agreement .
the compromise deal conceded yushchenko 's right to call elections , but also pushed the date of the vote beyond the end of summer , a condition yushchenko earlier had described as unacceptable .
" we need to avoid repeating past mistakes , " yanukovich said .
other terms listed in a joint statement included changes in the membership of the central election committee , law making illegal judicial participation in political disputes and an overhaul in national voter rolls .
hope that this truce will hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two viktor 's have never seen eye-to-eye for long it was not the first time this week that yushchenko and yanukovich announced they had resolved the crisis , but the first time a concrete date for elections was set .
the pair in a joint announcement declared their agreement on constitutional amendments would be necessary , to prevent a repeat crisis .
moroz called the deal " not an ideal solution , but the best possible under the circumstances . "
yushchenko identified the inability of the constitutional court , prosecutors and the central election committee to do their jobs in the face of a conflict between the executive and legislative branches as the root of the problem .
" these institutions must be free of political influence , " he said .
" most likely , we will have to find answers in a new constitution . "
ukraine 's last constitution was signed into law in 2006 .
in a possible sign of real willingness to compromise , both yushchenko and yanukovich said they would appear in public together to attend the national cup match of the ukrainian professional soccer league , pitting dynamo kiev against shakhtar donetsk .
enthusiasm for the sport of football is in ukraine one of the few areas the country 's feuding political clans find common ground .
however , yushchenko is a lifetime dynamo supporter , while yanukovich is a shakhtar fan . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de troops loyal to yushchenko attempt to enter kiev as talks stall troops loyal to ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko tried to enter the capital kiev saturday , the interior ministry said , as crisis talks between the feuding president and prime minister were delayed .

the discussions are scheduled for may 31 . iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani and eu foreign policy chief javier solana had been due to meet on thursday , possibly in spain , for their second encounter in just over a month .
however iran 's foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini unexpectedly told reporters at his morning press briefing the meeting had been postponed to allow both sides more time .
" for the larijani-solana meeting , no date or venue has been set .
with the agreement of both sides it has been postponed , " he said .
however amid confusion and concern over why the key meeting had been so suddenly shelved , the foreign ministry later issued a statement from hosseini 's office saying that the talks would , as planned , be held on thursday .
it also indicated that the two men had been in touch recently to confirm the date but did not say if this was after the announcement of the postponement early sunday morning .
early cancellation later retracted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani. right , and javier solana will meet again " in the light of the latest agreement between mr larijani and mr solana , the date for the negotiations is thursday , may 31 , " said the statement .
" the venue will be decided through their contacts , " it added .
there was no explanation for the morning 's announcement .
the meetings between larijani and solana are central to diplomatic efforts to resolve the standoff , which has already seen iran slapped with two sets of un sanctions for its refusal to suspend uranium enrichment .
after missing the latest un security council deadline to suspend the process , western powers are now pressing for iran to face further penalties for its defiance .
freezing of enrichment a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans will be looking for movement from iran even when the pair meet , it remains unclear whether the two sides will be able to achieve any breakthrough , with the eu wanting iran to freeze uranium enrichment and tehran refusing to even consider such a move .
iran 's right to enrichment is the main obstacle toward resolving the standoff as the sensitive process can be used both to make nuclear fuel and , in highly extended form , to produce the fissile core of a bomb .
the united states accuses iran of seeking nuclear weapons , a charge vehemently denied by tehran , which says it just wants to produce energy for a growing population whose fossil fuels will eventually run out .
washington has never ruled out the use of force to resolve the standoff and has sent a clear warning to iran by sailing two nuclear-powered aircraft carriers through the straits of hormuz .
hosseini however brushed off the move .
" the us military build-up in the persian gulf is aimed mostly at lifting their spirits , " he commented .
us-iran dialogue to reopen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq may be the main topic but both sides have other issues the larijani-solana talks are due just three days after eagerly awaited talks in baghdad on monday between iran and its arch enemy the united states .
the talks between us ambassador to iraq ryan crocker and iranian ambassador hassan kazemi will be the highest-level public talks involving only envoys of the two sides since the 1979 islamic revolution .
however both sides have insisted that the talks be strictly limited to iraq , with no chance of the discussions straying into the nuclear crisis .
in a sign of the tension that still exists between the two foes , iran 's intelligence minister said on saturday that the islamic republic had smashed several spy networks run by the us-led coalition in iraq .
" several espionage networks linked to the occupation forces in iraq have been identified and dismantled in the west , southwest and central regions of iran , " said gholam hossein mohseni ejeie , without elaborating . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , eu urges belligerent iran to rethink nuclear program the german presidency of the eu on thursday urged iran to rethink its nuclear program after the un atomic watchdog warned that tehran could acquire nuclear weapons within three to eight years .

" i injected him once with epo in the arm , " said d 'hont .
" it lasted around 10 seconds .
it was as if i was injecting some insulin into someone who was ill . "
it is the first time that d 'hont has revealed who in the telekom team he administered drugs to .
ullrich has been under suspicion of doping since being implicated , along with dozens of other riders , in the spanish doping investigation dubbed ' operation puerto ' which has engulfed the sport since may 2006 .
the 33-year-old german has always denied being involved in the affair , which was uncovered by police in spain and led to the arrest of spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes after doping products and bags of blood were found on his premises .
after months of denials italy 's ivan basso , the tour of italy champion , has recently admitted he worked with fuentes .
the 31-year-old stopped short of saying he actually doped , but is facing a 21-month ban from the italian olympic committee -lrb- coni -rrb- .
germany 's fallen cycling idol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich ended his controversial career after the allegations since being suspended from last year 's tour de france ullrich has retired from the sport , although existing suspicion has heightened in the wake of some stunning confessions from ullrich 's former team-mates this week .
denmark 's bjarne riis , the 1996 tour de france winner , admitted on friday he had used epo while at telekom , who also won the race in 1997 thanks to ullrich .
several of riis 's former telekom teammates , including top sprinter erik zabel of germany , rolf aldag , bert dietz , christian henn and udo boelts , have also admitting using the drug .
the drama provided by the series of stunning confessions took another twist saturday when a doctor employed by several sports federations in germany admitted supplying drugs to amateur cyclists between 1980 and 1990 .
georg huber , a top physician at the university of freiberg clinic , was immediately suspended from his post by the german cycling federation -lrb- bdr -rrb- after admitting to the offences .
huber said he had given the banned male sex hormone testosterone to amateur riders during 1980-1990 , according to a statement by the university clinic of freiberg - considered germany 's top sports medicine facility .
cycling 's wake-up call or death knell ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zabel begged forgiveness for his use of doping the bombshells dropped this week by zabel and riis - two of the german outfits former high profile stars - are being seen as a positive development as cycling fights to rebuild its image .
international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- president pat mcquaid said saturday : " the confessions from germany and denmark show that people are now ready to speak out .
this is extremely positive .
" the law of silence no longer applies - each person must now assume the full consequences of their actions . "
more than eight years on , riis and the other repentants can not now be sanctioned , although the 43-year-old dane is ready to hand back his yellow jersey from his 1996 victory .
the uci and tour de france officials feel it would be a symbolic gesture that would help put the sport on a more sound footing .
it now remains to be seen if the latest claims against ullrich , one of the tour de france 's main protagonists over the past decade , lead to a similar scenario .
d 'hont claimed that ullrich was only following other riders in taking epo , and he urged the german to follow his former team-mates in confessing .
" he did the same as all the others .
it would be good for him to speak out and get things out into the open , it would liberate him , " added d 'hont , who nonetheless could not hide his admiration for the 2000 olympic champion who finished a runner-up five time on the tour .

the two leaders had been locked in a long-running battle over the legality of early parliamentary elections that had been called by yushchenko , and moves by yanukovich 's coalition to dominate parliament .
the dispute degenerated further this week after yushchenko fired a prosecutor general supported by yanukovich , who in turn had loyal police break in and escort the prosecutor general back to his office building , brawling with pro-yushchenko security guards in the process .
it was the first outbreak violence between organized units of competing branches of the country 's government , since ukraine 's 1991 independence .
troop build-up disperses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops loyal to the president massed outside kiev yushchenko ordered all state buildings in the capital secured and some 2,000 troops were en route to kiev saturday , but the forces were held up outside the city by police loyal to yanukovich .
observers feared a possible assault on the prosecutor general 's office , and uniformed police were unloading steel barriers at the building late saturday evening .
troop columns were returning to bases on sunday , as were pro-yanukovich police at the prosecutor general 's office building .
kiev 's streets barely registered the conflict , with vehicle and pedestrian traffic moving normally under clear skies .
the grounds around the prosecutor general office often resembled a vacation park more than a protest epicentre , with demonstrators and riot police alike seen relaxing , drinking water , sitting on benches , and unbuttoning exterior clothing in the face of unseasonably hot temperatures exceeding 33 degrees in the shade .
the two sides announced a deal was reached after marathon talks ending at around 3 am in kiev .
process for new elections to begin soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko made concessions to ease the crisis parliament will meet for a special session on may 29 and 30 to go through the procedure of setting new elections .
a " special mechanism " in the form of a joint council will oversee legal changes , yushchenko said .
the two sides also agreed that the country 's security forces would not be misused in the dispute .
parliamentary speaker alexander moroz , and opposition leader julia timoshenko joined in the talks , but timoshenko was not named as a participant in the compromise agreement .
the compromise deal conceded yushchenko 's right to call elections , but also pushed the date of the vote beyond the end of summer , a condition yushchenko earlier had described as unacceptable .
" we need to avoid repeating past mistakes , " yanukovich said .
other terms listed in a joint statement included changes in the membership of the central election committee , law making illegal judicial participation in political disputes and an overhaul in national voter rolls .
hope that this truce will hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two viktor 's have never seen eye-to-eye for long it was not the first time this week that yushchenko and yanukovich announced they had resolved the crisis , but the first time a concrete date for elections was set .
the pair in a joint announcement declared their agreement on constitutional amendments would be necessary , to prevent a repeat crisis .
moroz called the deal " not an ideal solution , but the best possible under the circumstances . "
yushchenko identified the inability of the constitutional court , prosecutors and the central election committee to do their jobs in the face of a conflict between the executive and legislative branches as the root of the problem .
" these institutions must be free of political influence , " he said .
" most likely , we will have to find answers in a new constitution . "
ukraine 's last constitution was signed into law in 2006 .
in a possible sign of real willingness to compromise , both yushchenko and yanukovich said they would appear in public together to attend the national cup match of the ukrainian professional soccer league , pitting dynamo kiev against shakhtar donetsk .
enthusiasm for the sport of football is in ukraine one of the few areas the country 's feuding political clans find common ground .
however , yushchenko is a lifetime dynamo supporter , while yanukovich is a shakhtar fan . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de troops loyal to yushchenko attempt to enter kiev as talks stall troops loyal to ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko tried to enter the capital kiev saturday , the interior ministry said , as crisis talks between the feuding president and prime minister were delayed .

the discussions are scheduled for may 31 . iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani and eu foreign policy chief javier solana had been due to meet on thursday , possibly in spain , for their second encounter in just over a month .
however iran 's foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini unexpectedly told reporters at his morning press briefing the meeting had been postponed to allow both sides more time .
" for the larijani-solana meeting , no date or venue has been set .
with the agreement of both sides it has been postponed , " he said .
however amid confusion and concern over why the key meeting had been so suddenly shelved , the foreign ministry later issued a statement from hosseini 's office saying that the talks would , as planned , be held on thursday .
it also indicated that the two men had been in touch recently to confirm the date but did not say if this was after the announcement of the postponement early sunday morning .
early cancellation later retracted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani. right , and javier solana will meet again " in the light of the latest agreement between mr larijani and mr solana , the date for the negotiations is thursday , may 31 , " said the statement .
" the venue will be decided through their contacts , " it added .
there was no explanation for the morning 's announcement .
the meetings between larijani and solana are central to diplomatic efforts to resolve the standoff , which has already seen iran slapped with two sets of un sanctions for its refusal to suspend uranium enrichment .
after missing the latest un security council deadline to suspend the process , western powers are now pressing for iran to face further penalties for its defiance .
freezing of enrichment a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans will be looking for movement from iran even when the pair meet , it remains unclear whether the two sides will be able to achieve any breakthrough , with the eu wanting iran to freeze uranium enrichment and tehran refusing to even consider such a move .
iran 's right to enrichment is the main obstacle toward resolving the standoff as the sensitive process can be used both to make nuclear fuel and , in highly extended form , to produce the fissile core of a bomb .
the united states accuses iran of seeking nuclear weapons , a charge vehemently denied by tehran , which says it just wants to produce energy for a growing population whose fossil fuels will eventually run out .
washington has never ruled out the use of force to resolve the standoff and has sent a clear warning to iran by sailing two nuclear-powered aircraft carriers through the straits of hormuz .
hosseini however brushed off the move .
" the us military build-up in the persian gulf is aimed mostly at lifting their spirits , " he commented .
us-iran dialogue to reopen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq may be the main topic but both sides have other issues the larijani-solana talks are due just three days after eagerly awaited talks in baghdad on monday between iran and its arch enemy the united states .
the talks between us ambassador to iraq ryan crocker and iranian ambassador hassan kazemi will be the highest-level public talks involving only envoys of the two sides since the 1979 islamic revolution .
however both sides have insisted that the talks be strictly limited to iraq , with no chance of the discussions straying into the nuclear crisis .
in a sign of the tension that still exists between the two foes , iran 's intelligence minister said on saturday that the islamic republic had smashed several spy networks run by the us-led coalition in iraq .
" several espionage networks linked to the occupation forces in iraq have been identified and dismantled in the west , southwest and central regions of iran , " said gholam hossein mohseni ejeie , without elaborating . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , eu urges belligerent iran to rethink nuclear program the german presidency of the eu on thursday urged iran to rethink its nuclear program after the un atomic watchdog warned that tehran could acquire nuclear weapons within three to eight years .

parliamentary speaker alexander moroz , and opposition leader julia timoshenko joined in the talks , but timoshenko was not named as a participant in the compromise agreement .
the compromise deal conceded yushchenko 's right to call elections , but also pushed the date of the vote beyond the end of summer , a condition yushchenko earlier had described as unacceptable .

moroz called the deal " not an ideal solution , but the best possible under the circumstances . "
yushchenko identified the inability of the constitutional court , prosecutors and the central election committee to do their jobs in the face of a conflict between the executive and legislative branches as the root of the problem .

the environmental protection group greenpeace saturday published a leaked document showing that the united states had raised serious new objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by the german hosts .
it looked to observers as though us objections in the form of amendments had drained the substance from the german statement .
" the united states still has serious , fundamental concerns about this draft statement , " the document stated .
washington rejects the idea of setting mandatory emissions targets , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel 's proposed climate statement calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
" the treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses multiple ' red lines ' in terms of what we simply can not agree to , " the us document said .
sources close to negotiations told afp the us amendments seek to remove any idea of an urgent problem of climate change requiring a firm international response .
us rejects climate change as an ' urgent problem ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us denies the scientific evidence is conclusive " the preliminary sessions clearly indicate the american desire to minimalise -lrb- the draft -rrb- , " said one european diplomatic source .
the us was refusing to take account of findings by an intergovernmental group of experts on climate change , whose latest conclusions have been used by the germans in their draft climate statement , the source said .
" i ca n't remember any major international climate meeting with that kind of complete divergence of views , " said phil clapp , head of the national environment trust in washington .
" there is a fundamental disagreement between the eu and the bush administration positions .
it 's hard to see how governments could sign the sort of statement that washington wants . "
clapp added that " at this point we do n't see signs that the -lrb- bush -rrb- administration will change its position ... and as a matter of fact the signs go in exactly the opposite direction . "
in washington , white house spokeswoman dana perino played down the document leaked by greenpeace while acknowledging differences .
" we believe that there are many different approaches to climate change , " she said .
" by no means is there a final document . "
washington does not recognise the un convention on climate change as an appropriate forum for multilateral negotiations on global warming , but only as one of several possible forums .
kyoto successor also in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a follow-up climate protocol to kyoto could also be in danger this also does not augur well for a conference scheduled in bali in december at which states signatory to the convention will have to negotiate a follow-up to the kyoto protocol on climate change which runs out in 2012 .
the us has not signed the protocol .
" these latest proposals display a complete absence of reconciliation between the american technological approach and that of the eu ... " said the diplomatic source .
" and all this despite appeals by major american companies and republican party personalities like arnold schwarzenegger . "
on may 18 , senior us lawmakers wrote to bush expressing deep concern over reports that his administration was seeking to weaken a g8 declaration on climate change .
" us leadership is critical to tackling this global threat .
but we need an executive branch that engages the rest of the world to solve this problem rather than stubbornly ignoring it , " the 15 heads of congressional committees wrote in a letter . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : us rejects germany 's g8 climate declaration the united states has raised new serious objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by germany for next month 's group of eight summit , the washington post reported saturday .

the discussions are scheduled for may 31 . iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani and eu foreign policy chief javier solana had been due to meet on thursday , possibly in spain , for their second encounter in just over a month .
however iran 's foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini unexpectedly told reporters at his morning press briefing the meeting had been postponed to allow both sides more time .
" for the larijani-solana meeting , no date or venue has been set .
with the agreement of both sides it has been postponed , " he said .
however amid confusion and concern over why the key meeting had been so suddenly shelved , the foreign ministry later issued a statement from hosseini 's office saying that the talks would , as planned , be held on thursday .
it also indicated that the two men had been in touch recently to confirm the date but did not say if this was after the announcement of the postponement early sunday morning .
early cancellation later retracted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani. right , and javier solana will meet again " in the light of the latest agreement between mr larijani and mr solana , the date for the negotiations is thursday , may 31 , " said the statement .
" the venue will be decided through their contacts , " it added .
there was no explanation for the morning 's announcement .
the meetings between larijani and solana are central to diplomatic efforts to resolve the standoff , which has already seen iran slapped with two sets of un sanctions for its refusal to suspend uranium enrichment .
after missing the latest un security council deadline to suspend the process , western powers are now pressing for iran to face further penalties for its defiance .
freezing of enrichment a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans will be looking for movement from iran even when the pair meet , it remains unclear whether the two sides will be able to achieve any breakthrough , with the eu wanting iran to freeze uranium enrichment and tehran refusing to even consider such a move .
iran 's right to enrichment is the main obstacle toward resolving the standoff as the sensitive process can be used both to make nuclear fuel and , in highly extended form , to produce the fissile core of a bomb .
the united states accuses iran of seeking nuclear weapons , a charge vehemently denied by tehran , which says it just wants to produce energy for a growing population whose fossil fuels will eventually run out .
washington has never ruled out the use of force to resolve the standoff and has sent a clear warning to iran by sailing two nuclear-powered aircraft carriers through the straits of hormuz .

the discussions are scheduled for may 31 . iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani and eu foreign policy chief javier solana had been due to meet on thursday , possibly in spain , for their second encounter in just over a month .
however iran 's foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini unexpectedly told reporters at his morning press briefing the meeting had been postponed to allow both sides more time .
" for the larijani-solana meeting , no date or venue has been set .
with the agreement of both sides it has been postponed , " he said .
however amid confusion and concern over why the key meeting had been so suddenly shelved , the foreign ministry later issued a statement from hosseini 's office saying that the talks would , as planned , be held on thursday .
it also indicated that the two men had been in touch recently to confirm the date but did not say if this was after the announcement of the postponement early sunday morning .
early cancellation later retracted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani. right , and javier solana will meet again " in the light of the latest agreement between mr larijani and mr solana , the date for the negotiations is thursday , may 31 , " said the statement .
" the venue will be decided through their contacts , " it added .
there was no explanation for the morning 's announcement .
the meetings between larijani and solana are central to diplomatic efforts to resolve the standoff , which has already seen iran slapped with two sets of un sanctions for its refusal to suspend uranium enrichment .
after missing the latest un security council deadline to suspend the process , western powers are now pressing for iran to face further penalties for its defiance .
freezing of enrichment a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans will be looking for movement from iran even when the pair meet , it remains unclear whether the two sides will be able to achieve any breakthrough , with the eu wanting iran to freeze uranium enrichment and tehran refusing to even consider such a move .
iran 's right to enrichment is the main obstacle toward resolving the standoff as the sensitive process can be used both to make nuclear fuel and , in highly extended form , to produce the fissile core of a bomb .
the united states accuses iran of seeking nuclear weapons , a charge vehemently denied by tehran , which says it just wants to produce energy for a growing population whose fossil fuels will eventually run out .
washington has never ruled out the use of force to resolve the standoff and has sent a clear warning to iran by sailing two nuclear-powered aircraft carriers through the straits of hormuz .
hosseini however brushed off the move .

now , there may be progress in making islam a regular course in german schools . more than 700,000 muslim students attend school in germany , but nowhere does the religious curriculum deal with islam in the same way as christianity .
the problem is that most schools rely on their local mosque for guidance , which means there can be large discrepancies in the content and quality of instruction .
that is why german state governments and muslim organizations alike are looking to create a more standardized approach to teaching islam .
it is not an easy task , however .
about two-and-a-half million of germany 's muslims belong to the sunni denomination of islam .
but the rest are mainly shiites , alevis or followers of the south asian ahmaddiyya movement .
broad spectrum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no standardized method for teaching islam with such a broad spectrum of beliefs among them , islam expert michael kiefer said creating a single combined course would be difficult .
" we 've seen in austria , for example , that the concept of one course for all muslims is controversial , because the smaller denominations are left out , " he said .
that is why authorities in the german state of baden-württemberg have decided to offer with two courses : one for sunni and shia students , and another for alevis .
so far , it looks like a number of other states will base their systems on this model as well , he said .
the states of north rhine-westphalia , bavaria and lower saxony , however , are still looking for ways to create one standard curriculum with the help of various muslim groups . fundamental principles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are divergent views about how to teach islam in lower saxony , for example , a number of muslim organizations have come together to form a " shura , " or council , to help authorities define the fundamental principles to be included in courses on islam .
state education minister heidemarie ballasch says the body 's recommendations have been put to the test in a pilot project at 21 schools since 2003 .
" one of the political goals of the trial is to promote integration instead of parallel social structures , " ballasch said .
" another is to help school students learn about their islam and other religions , so that when the time comes , they 're in a position to declare their faith , " she added .
while most german state education systems limit islamic instruction to primary school , north rhine-westphalia has gone down a different path , offering courses from year 1-10 .
last year , more than 130 schools with some 10,000 muslim students took part in the project .
thousands have participated in the capital berlin , some 4,500 school students have taken part in islamic studies courses since 2003 , while another ten schools recently added material relevant to alevism to their curricula as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over half a million muslims attend german schools " our co-operation with the islamic federation has , by and large , led to a positive expansion of religious education in our schools , ” said hans-jürgen pokall of berlin 's education , science and research administration .
" the initial problems we experienced , which had more to do with the way some teachers interacted with the students than the actual content of the courses , have subsided , " he said .
berlin ’ s islamic federation expects that the demand for school teachers with qualifications in islamic religious instruction will grow as more and more parents request courses for their children .
it is also calling for long-term planning to meet the demand .
the university of münster , for example , was quick to react to the trend and has been training specialist teachers since 2005 .

the environmental protection group greenpeace saturday published a leaked document showing that the united states had raised serious new objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by the german hosts .
it looked to observers as though us objections in the form of amendments had drained the substance from the german statement .
" the united states still has serious , fundamental concerns about this draft statement , " the document stated .
washington rejects the idea of setting mandatory emissions targets , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel 's proposed climate statement calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
" the treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses multiple ' red lines ' in terms of what we simply can not agree to , " the us document said .
sources close to negotiations told afp the us amendments seek to remove any idea of an urgent problem of climate change requiring a firm international response .
us rejects climate change as an ' urgent problem ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us denies the scientific evidence is conclusive " the preliminary sessions clearly indicate the american desire to minimalise -lrb- the draft -rrb- , " said one european diplomatic source .
the us was refusing to take account of findings by an intergovernmental group of experts on climate change , whose latest conclusions have been used by the germans in their draft climate statement , the source said .
" i ca n't remember any major international climate meeting with that kind of complete divergence of views , " said phil clapp , head of the national environment trust in washington .
" there is a fundamental disagreement between the eu and the bush administration positions .
it 's hard to see how governments could sign the sort of statement that washington wants . "
clapp added that " at this point we do n't see signs that the -lrb- bush -rrb- administration will change its position ... and as a matter of fact the signs go in exactly the opposite direction . "
in washington , white house spokeswoman dana perino played down the document leaked by greenpeace while acknowledging differences .
" we believe that there are many different approaches to climate change , " she said .
" by no means is there a final document . "
washington does not recognise the un convention on climate change as an appropriate forum for multilateral negotiations on global warming , but only as one of several possible forums .
kyoto successor also in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a follow-up climate protocol to kyoto could also be in danger this also does not augur well for a conference scheduled in bali in december at which states signatory to the convention will have to negotiate a follow-up to the kyoto protocol on climate change which runs out in 2012 .
the us has not signed the protocol .
" these latest proposals display a complete absence of reconciliation between the american technological approach and that of the eu ... " said the diplomatic source .
" and all this despite appeals by major american companies and republican party personalities like arnold schwarzenegger . "

the environmental protection group greenpeace saturday published a leaked document showing that the united states had raised serious new objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by the german hosts .
it looked to observers as though us objections in the form of amendments had drained the substance from the german statement .
" the united states still has serious , fundamental concerns about this draft statement , " the document stated .
washington rejects the idea of setting mandatory emissions targets , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel 's proposed climate statement calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
" the treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses multiple ' red lines ' in terms of what we simply can not agree to , " the us document said .
sources close to negotiations told afp the us amendments seek to remove any idea of an urgent problem of climate change requiring a firm international response .
us rejects climate change as an ' urgent problem ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us denies the scientific evidence is conclusive " the preliminary sessions clearly indicate the american desire to minimalise -lrb- the draft -rrb- , " said one european diplomatic source .
the us was refusing to take account of findings by an intergovernmental group of experts on climate change , whose latest conclusions have been used by the germans in their draft climate statement , the source said .
" i ca n't remember any major international climate meeting with that kind of complete divergence of views , " said phil clapp , head of the national environment trust in washington .
" there is a fundamental disagreement between the eu and the bush administration positions .
it 's hard to see how governments could sign the sort of statement that washington wants . "
clapp added that " at this point we do n't see signs that the -lrb- bush -rrb- administration will change its position ... and as a matter of fact the signs go in exactly the opposite direction . "
in washington , white house spokeswoman dana perino played down the document leaked by greenpeace while acknowledging differences .
" we believe that there are many different approaches to climate change , " she said .
" by no means is there a final document . "
washington does not recognise the un convention on climate change as an appropriate forum for multilateral negotiations on global warming , but only as one of several possible forums .
kyoto successor also in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a follow-up climate protocol to kyoto could also be in danger this also does not augur well for a conference scheduled in bali in december at which states signatory to the convention will have to negotiate a follow-up to the kyoto protocol on climate change which runs out in 2012 .
the us has not signed the protocol .
" these latest proposals display a complete absence of reconciliation between the american technological approach and that of the eu ... " said the diplomatic source .

" i injected him once with epo in the arm , " said d 'hont .
" it lasted around 10 seconds .
it was as if i was injecting some insulin into someone who was ill . "
it is the first time that d 'hont has revealed who in the telekom team he administered drugs to .
ullrich has been under suspicion of doping since being implicated , along with dozens of other riders , in the spanish doping investigation dubbed ' operation puerto ' which has engulfed the sport since may 2006 .
the 33-year-old german has always denied being involved in the affair , which was uncovered by police in spain and led to the arrest of spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes after doping products and bags of blood were found on his premises .
after months of denials italy 's ivan basso , the tour of italy champion , has recently admitted he worked with fuentes .
the 31-year-old stopped short of saying he actually doped , but is facing a 21-month ban from the italian olympic committee -lrb- coni -rrb- .
germany 's fallen cycling idol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich ended his controversial career after the allegations since being suspended from last year 's tour de france ullrich has retired from the sport , although existing suspicion has heightened in the wake of some stunning confessions from ullrich 's former team-mates this week .
denmark 's bjarne riis , the 1996 tour de france winner , admitted on friday he had used epo while at telekom , who also won the race in 1997 thanks to ullrich .
several of riis 's former telekom teammates , including top sprinter erik zabel of germany , rolf aldag , bert dietz , christian henn and udo boelts , have also admitting using the drug .
the drama provided by the series of stunning confessions took another twist saturday when a doctor employed by several sports federations in germany admitted supplying drugs to amateur cyclists between 1980 and 1990 .
georg huber , a top physician at the university of freiberg clinic , was immediately suspended from his post by the german cycling federation -lrb- bdr -rrb- after admitting to the offences .
huber said he had given the banned male sex hormone testosterone to amateur riders during 1980-1990 , according to a statement by the university clinic of freiberg - considered germany 's top sports medicine facility .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zabel begged forgiveness for his use of doping the bombshells dropped this week by zabel and riis - two of the german outfits former high profile stars - are being seen as a positive development as cycling fights to rebuild its image .

this is extremely positive .
" the law of silence no longer applies - each person must now assume the full consequences of their actions . "
more than eight years on , riis and the other repentants can not now be sanctioned , although the 43-year-old dane is ready to hand back his yellow jersey from his 1996 victory .
the uci and tour de france officials feel it would be a symbolic gesture that would help put the sport on a more sound footing .
it now remains to be seen if the latest claims against ullrich , one of the tour de france 's main protagonists over the past decade , lead to a similar scenario .
d 'hont claimed that ullrich was only following other riders in taking epo , and he urged the german to follow his former team-mates in confessing .
" he did the same as all the others .
it would be good for him to speak out and get things out into the open , it would liberate him , " added d 'hont , who nonetheless could not hide his admiration for the 2000 olympic champion who finished a runner-up five time on the tour .

" i injected him once with epo in the arm , " said d 'hont .
" it lasted around 10 seconds .
it was as if i was injecting some insulin into someone who was ill . "
it is the first time that d 'hont has revealed who in the telekom team he administered drugs to .
ullrich has been under suspicion of doping since being implicated , along with dozens of other riders , in the spanish doping investigation dubbed ' operation puerto ' which has engulfed the sport since may 2006 .
the 33-year-old german has always denied being involved in the affair , which was uncovered by police in spain and led to the arrest of spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes after doping products and bags of blood were found on his premises .
after months of denials italy 's ivan basso , the tour of italy champion , has recently admitted he worked with fuentes .
the 31-year-old stopped short of saying he actually doped , but is facing a 21-month ban from the italian olympic committee -lrb- coni -rrb- .
germany 's fallen cycling idol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich ended his controversial career after the allegations since being suspended from last year 's tour de france ullrich has retired from the sport , although existing suspicion has heightened in the wake of some stunning confessions from ullrich 's former team-mates this week .
denmark 's bjarne riis , the 1996 tour de france winner , admitted on friday he had used epo while at telekom , who also won the race in 1997 thanks to ullrich .
several of riis 's former telekom teammates , including top sprinter erik zabel of germany , rolf aldag , bert dietz , christian henn and udo boelts , have also admitting using the drug .
the drama provided by the series of stunning confessions took another twist saturday when a doctor employed by several sports federations in germany admitted supplying drugs to amateur cyclists between 1980 and 1990 .
georg huber , a top physician at the university of freiberg clinic , was immediately suspended from his post by the german cycling federation -lrb- bdr -rrb- after admitting to the offences .
huber said he had given the banned male sex hormone testosterone to amateur riders during 1980-1990 , according to a statement by the university clinic of freiberg - considered germany 's top sports medicine facility .
cycling 's wake-up call or death knell ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zabel begged forgiveness for his use of doping the bombshells dropped this week by zabel and riis - two of the german outfits former high profile stars - are being seen as a positive development as cycling fights to rebuild its image .
international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- president pat mcquaid said saturday : " the confessions from germany and denmark show that people are now ready to speak out .
this is extremely positive .
" the law of silence no longer applies - each person must now assume the full consequences of their actions . "
more than eight years on , riis and the other repentants can not now be sanctioned , although the 43-year-old dane is ready to hand back his yellow jersey from his 1996 victory .
the uci and tour de france officials feel it would be a symbolic gesture that would help put the sport on a more sound footing .
it now remains to be seen if the latest claims against ullrich , one of the tour de france 's main protagonists over the past decade , lead to a similar scenario .
d 'hont claimed that ullrich was only following other riders in taking epo , and he urged the german to follow his former team-mates in confessing .
" he did the same as all the others .
it would be good for him to speak out and get things out into the open , it would liberate him , " added d 'hont , who nonetheless could not hide his admiration for the 2000 olympic champion who finished a runner-up five time on the tour .
" if everyone was clean , ullrich would have won the tour de france at least 10 times .

the two leaders had been locked in a long-running battle over the legality of early parliamentary elections that had been called by yushchenko , and moves by yanukovich 's coalition to dominate parliament .
the dispute degenerated further this week after yushchenko fired a prosecutor general supported by yanukovich , who in turn had loyal police break in and escort the prosecutor general back to his office building , brawling with pro-yushchenko security guards in the process .
it was the first outbreak violence between organized units of competing branches of the country 's government , since ukraine 's 1991 independence .
troop build-up disperses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops loyal to the president massed outside kiev yushchenko ordered all state buildings in the capital secured and some 2,000 troops were en route to kiev saturday , but the forces were held up outside the city by police loyal to yanukovich .
observers feared a possible assault on the prosecutor general 's office , and uniformed police were unloading steel barriers at the building late saturday evening .
troop columns were returning to bases on sunday , as were pro-yanukovich police at the prosecutor general 's office building .
kiev 's streets barely registered the conflict , with vehicle and pedestrian traffic moving normally under clear skies .
the grounds around the prosecutor general office often resembled a vacation park more than a protest epicentre , with demonstrators and riot police alike seen relaxing , drinking water , sitting on benches , and unbuttoning exterior clothing in the face of unseasonably hot temperatures exceeding 33 degrees in the shade .
the two sides announced a deal was reached after marathon talks ending at around 3 am in kiev .
process for new elections to begin soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko made concessions to ease the crisis parliament will meet for a special session on may 29 and 30 to go through the procedure of setting new elections .
a " special mechanism " in the form of a joint council will oversee legal changes , yushchenko said .
the two sides also agreed that the country 's security forces would not be misused in the dispute .
parliamentary speaker alexander moroz , and opposition leader julia timoshenko joined in the talks , but timoshenko was not named as a participant in the compromise agreement .
the compromise deal conceded yushchenko 's right to call elections , but also pushed the date of the vote beyond the end of summer , a condition yushchenko earlier had described as unacceptable .
" we need to avoid repeating past mistakes , " yanukovich said .
other terms listed in a joint statement included changes in the membership of the central election committee , law making illegal judicial participation in political disputes and an overhaul in national voter rolls .
hope that this truce will hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two viktor 's have never seen eye-to-eye for long it was not the first time this week that yushchenko and yanukovich announced they had resolved the crisis , but the first time a concrete date for elections was set .
the pair in a joint announcement declared their agreement on constitutional amendments would be necessary , to prevent a repeat crisis .
moroz called the deal " not an ideal solution , but the best possible under the circumstances . "
yushchenko identified the inability of the constitutional court , prosecutors and the central election committee to do their jobs in the face of a conflict between the executive and legislative branches as the root of the problem .
" these institutions must be free of political influence , " he said .
" most likely , we will have to find answers in a new constitution . "
ukraine 's last constitution was signed into law in 2006 .
in a possible sign of real willingness to compromise , both yushchenko and yanukovich said they would appear in public together to attend the national cup match of the ukrainian professional soccer league , pitting dynamo kiev against shakhtar donetsk .
enthusiasm for the sport of football is in ukraine one of the few areas the country 's feuding political clans find common ground .
however , yushchenko is a lifetime dynamo supporter , while yanukovich is a shakhtar fan . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de troops loyal to yushchenko attempt to enter kiev as talks stall troops loyal to ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko tried to enter the capital kiev saturday , the interior ministry said , as crisis talks between the feuding president and prime minister were delayed .

now , there may be progress in making islam a regular course in german schools . more than 700,000 muslim students attend school in germany , but nowhere does the religious curriculum deal with islam in the same way as christianity .
the problem is that most schools rely on their local mosque for guidance , which means there can be large discrepancies in the content and quality of instruction .
that is why german state governments and muslim organizations alike are looking to create a more standardized approach to teaching islam .
it is not an easy task , however .
about two-and-a-half million of germany 's muslims belong to the sunni denomination of islam .
but the rest are mainly shiites , alevis or followers of the south asian ahmaddiyya movement .
broad spectrum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no standardized method for teaching islam with such a broad spectrum of beliefs among them , islam expert michael kiefer said creating a single combined course would be difficult .
" we 've seen in austria , for example , that the concept of one course for all muslims is controversial , because the smaller denominations are left out , " he said .
that is why authorities in the german state of baden-württemberg have decided to offer with two courses : one for sunni and shia students , and another for alevis .
so far , it looks like a number of other states will base their systems on this model as well , he said .
the states of north rhine-westphalia , bavaria and lower saxony , however , are still looking for ways to create one standard curriculum with the help of various muslim groups . fundamental principles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are divergent views about how to teach islam in lower saxony , for example , a number of muslim organizations have come together to form a " shura , " or council , to help authorities define the fundamental principles to be included in courses on islam .
state education minister heidemarie ballasch says the body 's recommendations have been put to the test in a pilot project at 21 schools since 2003 .
" one of the political goals of the trial is to promote integration instead of parallel social structures , " ballasch said .
" another is to help school students learn about their islam and other religions , so that when the time comes , they 're in a position to declare their faith , " she added .
while most german state education systems limit islamic instruction to primary school , north rhine-westphalia has gone down a different path , offering courses from year 1-10 .
last year , more than 130 schools with some 10,000 muslim students took part in the project .
thousands have participated in the capital berlin , some 4,500 school students have taken part in islamic studies courses since 2003 , while another ten schools recently added material relevant to alevism to their curricula as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over half a million muslims attend german schools " our co-operation with the islamic federation has , by and large , led to a positive expansion of religious education in our schools , ” said hans-jürgen pokall of berlin 's education , science and research administration .
" the initial problems we experienced , which had more to do with the way some teachers interacted with the students than the actual content of the courses , have subsided , " he said .
berlin ’ s islamic federation expects that the demand for school teachers with qualifications in islamic religious instruction will grow as more and more parents request courses for their children .
it is also calling for long-term planning to meet the demand .

now , there may be progress in making islam a regular course in german schools . more than 700,000 muslim students attend school in germany , but nowhere does the religious curriculum deal with islam in the same way as christianity .
the problem is that most schools rely on their local mosque for guidance , which means there can be large discrepancies in the content and quality of instruction .
that is why german state governments and muslim organizations alike are looking to create a more standardized approach to teaching islam .
it is not an easy task , however .
about two-and-a-half million of germany 's muslims belong to the sunni denomination of islam .
but the rest are mainly shiites , alevis or followers of the south asian ahmaddiyya movement .
broad spectrum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no standardized method for teaching islam with such a broad spectrum of beliefs among them , islam expert michael kiefer said creating a single combined course would be difficult .
" we 've seen in austria , for example , that the concept of one course for all muslims is controversial , because the smaller denominations are left out , " he said .
that is why authorities in the german state of baden-württemberg have decided to offer with two courses : one for sunni and shia students , and another for alevis .
so far , it looks like a number of other states will base their systems on this model as well , he said .
the states of north rhine-westphalia , bavaria and lower saxony , however , are still looking for ways to create one standard curriculum with the help of various muslim groups . fundamental principles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are divergent views about how to teach islam in lower saxony , for example , a number of muslim organizations have come together to form a " shura , " or council , to help authorities define the fundamental principles to be included in courses on islam .
state education minister heidemarie ballasch says the body 's recommendations have been put to the test in a pilot project at 21 schools since 2003 .
" one of the political goals of the trial is to promote integration instead of parallel social structures , " ballasch said .
" another is to help school students learn about their islam and other religions , so that when the time comes , they 're in a position to declare their faith , " she added .
while most german state education systems limit islamic instruction to primary school , north rhine-westphalia has gone down a different path , offering courses from year 1-10 .
last year , more than 130 schools with some 10,000 muslim students took part in the project .
thousands have participated in the capital berlin , some 4,500 school students have taken part in islamic studies courses since 2003 , while another ten schools recently added material relevant to alevism to their curricula as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over half a million muslims attend german schools " our co-operation with the islamic federation has , by and large , led to a positive expansion of religious education in our schools , ” said hans-jürgen pokall of berlin 's education , science and research administration .
" the initial problems we experienced , which had more to do with the way some teachers interacted with the students than the actual content of the courses , have subsided , " he said .
berlin ’ s islamic federation expects that the demand for school teachers with qualifications in islamic religious instruction will grow as more and more parents request courses for their children .
it is also calling for long-term planning to meet the demand .
the university of münster , for example , was quick to react to the trend and has been training specialist teachers since 2005 .
other institutes , such as the university of osnabrück , are already following suit . sabine ripperger -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de many see progress at berlin islam talks , but differences remain the german government attempted to reach out to the country 's more than three million muslims on wednesday but faced criticism from a muslim leader for organizing " aimless " talks .
-lrb- 02.05.2007 -rrb- female imams in german mosques get a mixed reception turkey 's religious council has already sent 13 women to germany to serve in mosques .
there have been requests for more , even if some reject teaching from a woman .

now , there may be progress in making islam a regular course in german schools . more than 700,000 muslim students attend school in germany , but nowhere does the religious curriculum deal with islam in the same way as christianity .
the problem is that most schools rely on their local mosque for guidance , which means there can be large discrepancies in the content and quality of instruction .
that is why german state governments and muslim organizations alike are looking to create a more standardized approach to teaching islam .
it is not an easy task , however .
about two-and-a-half million of germany 's muslims belong to the sunni denomination of islam .
but the rest are mainly shiites , alevis or followers of the south asian ahmaddiyya movement .
broad spectrum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no standardized method for teaching islam with such a broad spectrum of beliefs among them , islam expert michael kiefer said creating a single combined course would be difficult .
" we 've seen in austria , for example , that the concept of one course for all muslims is controversial , because the smaller denominations are left out , " he said .
that is why authorities in the german state of baden-württemberg have decided to offer with two courses : one for sunni and shia students , and another for alevis .
so far , it looks like a number of other states will base their systems on this model as well , he said .
the states of north rhine-westphalia , bavaria and lower saxony , however , are still looking for ways to create one standard curriculum with the help of various muslim groups . fundamental principles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are divergent views about how to teach islam in lower saxony , for example , a number of muslim organizations have come together to form a " shura , " or council , to help authorities define the fundamental principles to be included in courses on islam .
state education minister heidemarie ballasch says the body 's recommendations have been put to the test in a pilot project at 21 schools since 2003 .
" one of the political goals of the trial is to promote integration instead of parallel social structures , " ballasch said .
" another is to help school students learn about their islam and other religions , so that when the time comes , they 're in a position to declare their faith , " she added .
while most german state education systems limit islamic instruction to primary school , north rhine-westphalia has gone down a different path , offering courses from year 1-10 .

but the rest are mainly shiites , alevis or followers of the south asian ahmaddiyya movement .
broad spectrum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no standardized method for teaching islam with such a broad spectrum of beliefs among them , islam expert michael kiefer said creating a single combined course would be difficult .
" we 've seen in austria , for example , that the concept of one course for all muslims is controversial , because the smaller denominations are left out , " he said .
that is why authorities in the german state of baden-württemberg have decided to offer with two courses : one for sunni and shia students , and another for alevis .
so far , it looks like a number of other states will base their systems on this model as well , he said .
the states of north rhine-westphalia , bavaria and lower saxony , however , are still looking for ways to create one standard curriculum with the help of various muslim groups . fundamental principles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are divergent views about how to teach islam in lower saxony , for example , a number of muslim organizations have come together to form a " shura , " or council , to help authorities define the fundamental principles to be included in courses on islam .
state education minister heidemarie ballasch says the body 's recommendations have been put to the test in a pilot project at 21 schools since 2003 .
" one of the political goals of the trial is to promote integration instead of parallel social structures , " ballasch said .
" another is to help school students learn about their islam and other religions , so that when the time comes , they 're in a position to declare their faith , " she added .
while most german state education systems limit islamic instruction to primary school , north rhine-westphalia has gone down a different path , offering courses from year 1-10 .
last year , more than 130 schools with some 10,000 muslim students took part in the project .
thousands have participated in the capital berlin , some 4,500 school students have taken part in islamic studies courses since 2003 , while another ten schools recently added material relevant to alevism to their curricula as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over half a million muslims attend german schools " our co-operation with the islamic federation has , by and large , led to a positive expansion of religious education in our schools , ” said hans-jürgen pokall of berlin 's education , science and research administration .
" the initial problems we experienced , which had more to do with the way some teachers interacted with the students than the actual content of the courses , have subsided , " he said .
berlin ’ s islamic federation expects that the demand for school teachers with qualifications in islamic religious instruction will grow as more and more parents request courses for their children .
it is also calling for long-term planning to meet the demand .
the university of münster , for example , was quick to react to the trend and has been training specialist teachers since 2005 .
other institutes , such as the university of osnabrück , are already following suit . sabine ripperger -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de many see progress at berlin islam talks , but differences remain the german government attempted to reach out to the country 's more than three million muslims on wednesday but faced criticism from a muslim leader for organizing " aimless " talks .

the two leaders had been locked in a long-running battle over the legality of early parliamentary elections that had been called by yushchenko , and moves by yanukovich 's coalition to dominate parliament .
the dispute degenerated further this week after yushchenko fired a prosecutor general supported by yanukovich , who in turn had loyal police break in and escort the prosecutor general back to his office building , brawling with pro-yushchenko security guards in the process .
it was the first outbreak violence between organized units of competing branches of the country 's government , since ukraine 's 1991 independence .
troop build-up disperses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops loyal to the president massed outside kiev yushchenko ordered all state buildings in the capital secured and some 2,000 troops were en route to kiev saturday , but the forces were held up outside the city by police loyal to yanukovich .
observers feared a possible assault on the prosecutor general 's office , and uniformed police were unloading steel barriers at the building late saturday evening .
troop columns were returning to bases on sunday , as were pro-yanukovich police at the prosecutor general 's office building .
kiev 's streets barely registered the conflict , with vehicle and pedestrian traffic moving normally under clear skies .
the grounds around the prosecutor general office often resembled a vacation park more than a protest epicentre , with demonstrators and riot police alike seen relaxing , drinking water , sitting on benches , and unbuttoning exterior clothing in the face of unseasonably hot temperatures exceeding 33 degrees in the shade .
the two sides announced a deal was reached after marathon talks ending at around 3 am in kiev .
process for new elections to begin soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko made concessions to ease the crisis parliament will meet for a special session on may 29 and 30 to go through the procedure of setting new elections .
a " special mechanism " in the form of a joint council will oversee legal changes , yushchenko said .
the two sides also agreed that the country 's security forces would not be misused in the dispute .
parliamentary speaker alexander moroz , and opposition leader julia timoshenko joined in the talks , but timoshenko was not named as a participant in the compromise agreement .
the compromise deal conceded yushchenko 's right to call elections , but also pushed the date of the vote beyond the end of summer , a condition yushchenko earlier had described as unacceptable .
" we need to avoid repeating past mistakes , " yanukovich said .
other terms listed in a joint statement included changes in the membership of the central election committee , law making illegal judicial participation in political disputes and an overhaul in national voter rolls .
hope that this truce will hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two viktor 's have never seen eye-to-eye for long it was not the first time this week that yushchenko and yanukovich announced they had resolved the crisis , but the first time a concrete date for elections was set .
the pair in a joint announcement declared their agreement on constitutional amendments would be necessary , to prevent a repeat crisis .
moroz called the deal " not an ideal solution , but the best possible under the circumstances . "
yushchenko identified the inability of the constitutional court , prosecutors and the central election committee to do their jobs in the face of a conflict between the executive and legislative branches as the root of the problem .
" these institutions must be free of political influence , " he said .
" most likely , we will have to find answers in a new constitution . "
ukraine 's last constitution was signed into law in 2006 .
in a possible sign of real willingness to compromise , both yushchenko and yanukovich said they would appear in public together to attend the national cup match of the ukrainian professional soccer league , pitting dynamo kiev against shakhtar donetsk .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 27.05.2007 iran says nuke talks with eu back on hours after cancellation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and iran will restart their discussions over tehran 's disputed nucleat program iran announced sunday that crunch talks with the eu to break the deadlock over its disputed nuclear program would go ahead as planned , hours after saying they had been postponed .
the discussions are scheduled for may 31 . iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani and eu foreign policy chief javier solana had been due to meet on thursday , possibly in spain , for their second encounter in just over a month .
however iran 's foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini unexpectedly told reporters at his morning press briefing the meeting had been postponed to allow both sides more time .
" for the larijani-solana meeting , no date or venue has been set .
with the agreement of both sides it has been postponed , " he said .
however amid confusion and concern over why the key meeting had been so suddenly shelved , the foreign ministry later issued a statement from hosseini 's office saying that the talks would , as planned , be held on thursday .
it also indicated that the two men had been in touch recently to confirm the date but did not say if this was after the announcement of the postponement early sunday morning .
early cancellation later retracted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani. right , and javier solana will meet again " in the light of the latest agreement between mr larijani and mr solana , the date for the negotiations is thursday , may 31 , " said the statement .
" the venue will be decided through their contacts , " it added .
there was no explanation for the morning 's announcement .
the meetings between larijani and solana are central to diplomatic efforts to resolve the standoff , which has already seen iran slapped with two sets of un sanctions for its refusal to suspend uranium enrichment .
after missing the latest un security council deadline to suspend the process , western powers are now pressing for iran to face further penalties for its defiance .
freezing of enrichment a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans will be looking for movement from iran even when the pair meet , it remains unclear whether the two sides will be able to achieve any breakthrough , with the eu wanting iran to freeze uranium enrichment and tehran refusing to even consider such a move .
iran 's right to enrichment is the main obstacle toward resolving the standoff as the sensitive process can be used both to make nuclear fuel and , in highly extended form , to produce the fissile core of a bomb .
the united states accuses iran of seeking nuclear weapons , a charge vehemently denied by tehran , which says it just wants to produce energy for a growing population whose fossil fuels will eventually run out .
washington has never ruled out the use of force to resolve the standoff and has sent a clear warning to iran by sailing two nuclear-powered aircraft carriers through the straits of hormuz .
hosseini however brushed off the move .
" the us military build-up in the persian gulf is aimed mostly at lifting their spirits , " he commented .
us-iran dialogue to reopen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq may be the main topic but both sides have other issues the larijani-solana talks are due just three days after eagerly awaited talks in baghdad on monday between iran and its arch enemy the united states .
the talks between us ambassador to iraq ryan crocker and iranian ambassador hassan kazemi will be the highest-level public talks involving only envoys of the two sides since the 1979 islamic revolution .
however both sides have insisted that the talks be strictly limited to iraq , with no chance of the discussions straying into the nuclear crisis .

the two leaders had been locked in a long-running battle over the legality of early parliamentary elections that had been called by yushchenko , and moves by yanukovich 's coalition to dominate parliament .
the dispute degenerated further this week after yushchenko fired a prosecutor general supported by yanukovich , who in turn had loyal police break in and escort the prosecutor general back to his office building , brawling with pro-yushchenko security guards in the process .
it was the first outbreak violence between organized units of competing branches of the country 's government , since ukraine 's 1991 independence .
troop build-up disperses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops loyal to the president massed outside kiev yushchenko ordered all state buildings in the capital secured and some 2,000 troops were en route to kiev saturday , but the forces were held up outside the city by police loyal to yanukovich .
observers feared a possible assault on the prosecutor general 's office , and uniformed police were unloading steel barriers at the building late saturday evening .
troop columns were returning to bases on sunday , as were pro-yanukovich police at the prosecutor general 's office building .
kiev 's streets barely registered the conflict , with vehicle and pedestrian traffic moving normally under clear skies .
the grounds around the prosecutor general office often resembled a vacation park more than a protest epicentre , with demonstrators and riot police alike seen relaxing , drinking water , sitting on benches , and unbuttoning exterior clothing in the face of unseasonably hot temperatures exceeding 33 degrees in the shade .
the two sides announced a deal was reached after marathon talks ending at around 3 am in kiev .

a " special mechanism " in the form of a joint council will oversee legal changes , yushchenko said .
the two sides also agreed that the country 's security forces would not be misused in the dispute .
parliamentary speaker alexander moroz , and opposition leader julia timoshenko joined in the talks , but timoshenko was not named as a participant in the compromise agreement .
the compromise deal conceded yushchenko 's right to call elections , but also pushed the date of the vote beyond the end of summer , a condition yushchenko earlier had described as unacceptable .
" we need to avoid repeating past mistakes , " yanukovich said .
other terms listed in a joint statement included changes in the membership of the central election committee , law making illegal judicial participation in political disputes and an overhaul in national voter rolls .

the pair in a joint announcement declared their agreement on constitutional amendments would be necessary , to prevent a repeat crisis .
moroz called the deal " not an ideal solution , but the best possible under the circumstances . "
yushchenko identified the inability of the constitutional court , prosecutors and the central election committee to do their jobs in the face of a conflict between the executive and legislative branches as the root of the problem .
" these institutions must be free of political influence , " he said .
" most likely , we will have to find answers in a new constitution . "
ukraine 's last constitution was signed into law in 2006 .

the discussions are scheduled for may 31 . iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani and eu foreign policy chief javier solana had been due to meet on thursday , possibly in spain , for their second encounter in just over a month .
however iran 's foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini unexpectedly told reporters at his morning press briefing the meeting had been postponed to allow both sides more time .
" for the larijani-solana meeting , no date or venue has been set .
with the agreement of both sides it has been postponed , " he said .
however amid confusion and concern over why the key meeting had been so suddenly shelved , the foreign ministry later issued a statement from hosseini 's office saying that the talks would , as planned , be held on thursday .
it also indicated that the two men had been in touch recently to confirm the date but did not say if this was after the announcement of the postponement early sunday morning .
early cancellation later retracted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani. right , and javier solana will meet again " in the light of the latest agreement between mr larijani and mr solana , the date for the negotiations is thursday , may 31 , " said the statement .
" the venue will be decided through their contacts , " it added .
there was no explanation for the morning 's announcement .
the meetings between larijani and solana are central to diplomatic efforts to resolve the standoff , which has already seen iran slapped with two sets of un sanctions for its refusal to suspend uranium enrichment .
after missing the latest un security council deadline to suspend the process , western powers are now pressing for iran to face further penalties for its defiance .
freezing of enrichment a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans will be looking for movement from iran even when the pair meet , it remains unclear whether the two sides will be able to achieve any breakthrough , with the eu wanting iran to freeze uranium enrichment and tehran refusing to even consider such a move .
iran 's right to enrichment is the main obstacle toward resolving the standoff as the sensitive process can be used both to make nuclear fuel and , in highly extended form , to produce the fissile core of a bomb .
the united states accuses iran of seeking nuclear weapons , a charge vehemently denied by tehran , which says it just wants to produce energy for a growing population whose fossil fuels will eventually run out .
washington has never ruled out the use of force to resolve the standoff and has sent a clear warning to iran by sailing two nuclear-powered aircraft carriers through the straits of hormuz .
hosseini however brushed off the move .
" the us military build-up in the persian gulf is aimed mostly at lifting their spirits , " he commented .
us-iran dialogue to reopen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq may be the main topic but both sides have other issues the larijani-solana talks are due just three days after eagerly awaited talks in baghdad on monday between iran and its arch enemy the united states .

the environmental protection group greenpeace saturday published a leaked document showing that the united states had raised serious new objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by the german hosts .
it looked to observers as though us objections in the form of amendments had drained the substance from the german statement .
" the united states still has serious , fundamental concerns about this draft statement , " the document stated .
washington rejects the idea of setting mandatory emissions targets , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel 's proposed climate statement calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
" the treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses multiple ' red lines ' in terms of what we simply can not agree to , " the us document said .
sources close to negotiations told afp the us amendments seek to remove any idea of an urgent problem of climate change requiring a firm international response .
us rejects climate change as an ' urgent problem ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us denies the scientific evidence is conclusive " the preliminary sessions clearly indicate the american desire to minimalise -lrb- the draft -rrb- , " said one european diplomatic source .
the us was refusing to take account of findings by an intergovernmental group of experts on climate change , whose latest conclusions have been used by the germans in their draft climate statement , the source said .
" i ca n't remember any major international climate meeting with that kind of complete divergence of views , " said phil clapp , head of the national environment trust in washington .
" there is a fundamental disagreement between the eu and the bush administration positions .
it 's hard to see how governments could sign the sort of statement that washington wants . "
clapp added that " at this point we do n't see signs that the -lrb- bush -rrb- administration will change its position ... and as a matter of fact the signs go in exactly the opposite direction . "
in washington , white house spokeswoman dana perino played down the document leaked by greenpeace while acknowledging differences .
" we believe that there are many different approaches to climate change , " she said .
" by no means is there a final document . "
washington does not recognise the un convention on climate change as an appropriate forum for multilateral negotiations on global warming , but only as one of several possible forums .
kyoto successor also in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a follow-up climate protocol to kyoto could also be in danger this also does not augur well for a conference scheduled in bali in december at which states signatory to the convention will have to negotiate a follow-up to the kyoto protocol on climate change which runs out in 2012 .
the us has not signed the protocol .
" these latest proposals display a complete absence of reconciliation between the american technological approach and that of the eu ... " said the diplomatic source .
" and all this despite appeals by major american companies and republican party personalities like arnold schwarzenegger . "
on may 18 , senior us lawmakers wrote to bush expressing deep concern over reports that his administration was seeking to weaken a g8 declaration on climate change .
" us leadership is critical to tackling this global threat .
but we need an executive branch that engages the rest of the world to solve this problem rather than stubbornly ignoring it , " the 15 heads of congressional committees wrote in a letter . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : us rejects germany 's g8 climate declaration the united states has raised new serious objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by germany for next month 's group of eight summit , the washington post reported saturday .

the environmental protection group greenpeace saturday published a leaked document showing that the united states had raised serious new objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by the german hosts .
it looked to observers as though us objections in the form of amendments had drained the substance from the german statement .
" the united states still has serious , fundamental concerns about this draft statement , " the document stated .
washington rejects the idea of setting mandatory emissions targets , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel 's proposed climate statement calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
" the treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses multiple ' red lines ' in terms of what we simply can not agree to , " the us document said .
sources close to negotiations told afp the us amendments seek to remove any idea of an urgent problem of climate change requiring a firm international response .
us rejects climate change as an ' urgent problem ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us denies the scientific evidence is conclusive " the preliminary sessions clearly indicate the american desire to minimalise -lrb- the draft -rrb- , " said one european diplomatic source .
the us was refusing to take account of findings by an intergovernmental group of experts on climate change , whose latest conclusions have been used by the germans in their draft climate statement , the source said .
" i ca n't remember any major international climate meeting with that kind of complete divergence of views , " said phil clapp , head of the national environment trust in washington .
" there is a fundamental disagreement between the eu and the bush administration positions .
it 's hard to see how governments could sign the sort of statement that washington wants . "
clapp added that " at this point we do n't see signs that the -lrb- bush -rrb- administration will change its position ... and as a matter of fact the signs go in exactly the opposite direction . "
in washington , white house spokeswoman dana perino played down the document leaked by greenpeace while acknowledging differences .
" we believe that there are many different approaches to climate change , " she said .
" by no means is there a final document . "
washington does not recognise the un convention on climate change as an appropriate forum for multilateral negotiations on global warming , but only as one of several possible forums .
kyoto successor also in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a follow-up climate protocol to kyoto could also be in danger this also does not augur well for a conference scheduled in bali in december at which states signatory to the convention will have to negotiate a follow-up to the kyoto protocol on climate change which runs out in 2012 .
the us has not signed the protocol .
" these latest proposals display a complete absence of reconciliation between the american technological approach and that of the eu ... " said the diplomatic source .
" and all this despite appeals by major american companies and republican party personalities like arnold schwarzenegger . "
on may 18 , senior us lawmakers wrote to bush expressing deep concern over reports that his administration was seeking to weaken a g8 declaration on climate change .
" us leadership is critical to tackling this global threat .

" the benes decrees are incompatible with the law , the spirit and the culture of europe , " he told a rally of the sudeten german association in the bavarian city of augsburg .
stoiber said human rights , freedom , justice and the right to a homeland were basic rights in the european union .
the future of europe could be built on this , he said , not on a set of laws leading to expulsions .
laws proclaimed by the late president edvard benes led to the confiscation of german property and the deportation of sudeten germans , who were collectively accused of having been nazi collaborators .
many died in the brutal expulsions and hundreds of thousands later settled in germany and austria , where they and their descendants still live , preserving their dialect and folk customs .
stoiber defended the sudeten german association from criticism by czech president vaclav klaus , who said the real goal of the organization was to wreck czech-german relations .

" the benes decrees are incompatible with the law , the spirit and the culture of europe , " he told a rally of the sudeten german association in the bavarian city of augsburg .
stoiber said human rights , freedom , justice and the right to a homeland were basic rights in the european union .
the future of europe could be built on this , he said , not on a set of laws leading to expulsions .
laws proclaimed by the late president edvard benes led to the confiscation of german property and the deportation of sudeten germans , who were collectively accused of having been nazi collaborators .
many died in the brutal expulsions and hundreds of thousands later settled in germany and austria , where they and their descendants still live , preserving their dialect and folk customs .

the discussions are scheduled for may 31 . iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani and eu foreign policy chief javier solana had been due to meet on thursday , possibly in spain , for their second encounter in just over a month .
however iran 's foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini unexpectedly told reporters at his morning press briefing the meeting had been postponed to allow both sides more time .
" for the larijani-solana meeting , no date or venue has been set .
with the agreement of both sides it has been postponed , " he said .
however amid confusion and concern over why the key meeting had been so suddenly shelved , the foreign ministry later issued a statement from hosseini 's office saying that the talks would , as planned , be held on thursday .
it also indicated that the two men had been in touch recently to confirm the date but did not say if this was after the announcement of the postponement early sunday morning .

" the venue will be decided through their contacts , " it added .
there was no explanation for the morning 's announcement .
the meetings between larijani and solana are central to diplomatic efforts to resolve the standoff , which has already seen iran slapped with two sets of un sanctions for its refusal to suspend uranium enrichment .
after missing the latest un security council deadline to suspend the process , western powers are now pressing for iran to face further penalties for its defiance .
freezing of enrichment a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans will be looking for movement from iran even when the pair meet , it remains unclear whether the two sides will be able to achieve any breakthrough , with the eu wanting iran to freeze uranium enrichment and tehran refusing to even consider such a move .
iran 's right to enrichment is the main obstacle toward resolving the standoff as the sensitive process can be used both to make nuclear fuel and , in highly extended form , to produce the fissile core of a bomb .
the united states accuses iran of seeking nuclear weapons , a charge vehemently denied by tehran , which says it just wants to produce energy for a growing population whose fossil fuels will eventually run out .
washington has never ruled out the use of force to resolve the standoff and has sent a clear warning to iran by sailing two nuclear-powered aircraft carriers through the straits of hormuz .
hosseini however brushed off the move .
" the us military build-up in the persian gulf is aimed mostly at lifting their spirits , " he commented .
us-iran dialogue to reopen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq may be the main topic but both sides have other issues the larijani-solana talks are due just three days after eagerly awaited talks in baghdad on monday between iran and its arch enemy the united states .
the talks between us ambassador to iraq ryan crocker and iranian ambassador hassan kazemi will be the highest-level public talks involving only envoys of the two sides since the 1979 islamic revolution .
however both sides have insisted that the talks be strictly limited to iraq , with no chance of the discussions straying into the nuclear crisis .
in a sign of the tension that still exists between the two foes , iran 's intelligence minister said on saturday that the islamic republic had smashed several spy networks run by the us-led coalition in iraq .
" several espionage networks linked to the occupation forces in iraq have been identified and dismantled in the west , southwest and central regions of iran , " said gholam hossein mohseni ejeie , without elaborating . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , eu urges belligerent iran to rethink nuclear program the german presidency of the eu on thursday urged iran to rethink its nuclear program after the un atomic watchdog warned that tehran could acquire nuclear weapons within three to eight years .

the discussions are scheduled for may 31 . iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani and eu foreign policy chief javier solana had been due to meet on thursday , possibly in spain , for their second encounter in just over a month .
however iran 's foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini unexpectedly told reporters at his morning press briefing the meeting had been postponed to allow both sides more time .
" for the larijani-solana meeting , no date or venue has been set .
with the agreement of both sides it has been postponed , " he said .
however amid confusion and concern over why the key meeting had been so suddenly shelved , the foreign ministry later issued a statement from hosseini 's office saying that the talks would , as planned , be held on thursday .
it also indicated that the two men had been in touch recently to confirm the date but did not say if this was after the announcement of the postponement early sunday morning .
early cancellation later retracted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani. right , and javier solana will meet again " in the light of the latest agreement between mr larijani and mr solana , the date for the negotiations is thursday , may 31 , " said the statement .
" the venue will be decided through their contacts , " it added .
there was no explanation for the morning 's announcement .
the meetings between larijani and solana are central to diplomatic efforts to resolve the standoff , which has already seen iran slapped with two sets of un sanctions for its refusal to suspend uranium enrichment .
after missing the latest un security council deadline to suspend the process , western powers are now pressing for iran to face further penalties for its defiance .
freezing of enrichment a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans will be looking for movement from iran even when the pair meet , it remains unclear whether the two sides will be able to achieve any breakthrough , with the eu wanting iran to freeze uranium enrichment and tehran refusing to even consider such a move .
iran 's right to enrichment is the main obstacle toward resolving the standoff as the sensitive process can be used both to make nuclear fuel and , in highly extended form , to produce the fissile core of a bomb .
the united states accuses iran of seeking nuclear weapons , a charge vehemently denied by tehran , which says it just wants to produce energy for a growing population whose fossil fuels will eventually run out .
washington has never ruled out the use of force to resolve the standoff and has sent a clear warning to iran by sailing two nuclear-powered aircraft carriers through the straits of hormuz .
hosseini however brushed off the move .
" the us military build-up in the persian gulf is aimed mostly at lifting their spirits , " he commented .
us-iran dialogue to reopen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq may be the main topic but both sides have other issues the larijani-solana talks are due just three days after eagerly awaited talks in baghdad on monday between iran and its arch enemy the united states .
the talks between us ambassador to iraq ryan crocker and iranian ambassador hassan kazemi will be the highest-level public talks involving only envoys of the two sides since the 1979 islamic revolution .
however both sides have insisted that the talks be strictly limited to iraq , with no chance of the discussions straying into the nuclear crisis .
in a sign of the tension that still exists between the two foes , iran 's intelligence minister said on saturday that the islamic republic had smashed several spy networks run by the us-led coalition in iraq .
" several espionage networks linked to the occupation forces in iraq have been identified and dismantled in the west , southwest and central regions of iran , " said gholam hossein mohseni ejeie , without elaborating . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , eu urges belligerent iran to rethink nuclear program the german presidency of the eu on thursday urged iran to rethink its nuclear program after the un atomic watchdog warned that tehran could acquire nuclear weapons within three to eight years .

the environmental protection group greenpeace saturday published a leaked document showing that the united states had raised serious new objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by the german hosts .
it looked to observers as though us objections in the form of amendments had drained the substance from the german statement .
" the united states still has serious , fundamental concerns about this draft statement , " the document stated .
washington rejects the idea of setting mandatory emissions targets , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel 's proposed climate statement calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
" the treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses multiple ' red lines ' in terms of what we simply can not agree to , " the us document said .
sources close to negotiations told afp the us amendments seek to remove any idea of an urgent problem of climate change requiring a firm international response .
us rejects climate change as an ' urgent problem ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us denies the scientific evidence is conclusive " the preliminary sessions clearly indicate the american desire to minimalise -lrb- the draft -rrb- , " said one european diplomatic source .
the us was refusing to take account of findings by an intergovernmental group of experts on climate change , whose latest conclusions have been used by the germans in their draft climate statement , the source said .
" i ca n't remember any major international climate meeting with that kind of complete divergence of views , " said phil clapp , head of the national environment trust in washington .
" there is a fundamental disagreement between the eu and the bush administration positions .
it 's hard to see how governments could sign the sort of statement that washington wants . "
clapp added that " at this point we do n't see signs that the -lrb- bush -rrb- administration will change its position ... and as a matter of fact the signs go in exactly the opposite direction . "
in washington , white house spokeswoman dana perino played down the document leaked by greenpeace while acknowledging differences .
" we believe that there are many different approaches to climate change , " she said .
" by no means is there a final document . "
washington does not recognise the un convention on climate change as an appropriate forum for multilateral negotiations on global warming , but only as one of several possible forums .
kyoto successor also in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a follow-up climate protocol to kyoto could also be in danger this also does not augur well for a conference scheduled in bali in december at which states signatory to the convention will have to negotiate a follow-up to the kyoto protocol on climate change which runs out in 2012 .
the us has not signed the protocol .
" these latest proposals display a complete absence of reconciliation between the american technological approach and that of the eu ... " said the diplomatic source .
" and all this despite appeals by major american companies and republican party personalities like arnold schwarzenegger . "
on may 18 , senior us lawmakers wrote to bush expressing deep concern over reports that his administration was seeking to weaken a g8 declaration on climate change .
" us leadership is critical to tackling this global threat .
but we need an executive branch that engages the rest of the world to solve this problem rather than stubbornly ignoring it , " the 15 heads of congressional committees wrote in a letter . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : us rejects germany 's g8 climate declaration the united states has raised new serious objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by germany for next month 's group of eight summit , the washington post reported saturday .

" i injected him once with epo in the arm , " said d 'hont .
" it lasted around 10 seconds .
it was as if i was injecting some insulin into someone who was ill . "
it is the first time that d 'hont has revealed who in the telekom team he administered drugs to .
ullrich has been under suspicion of doping since being implicated , along with dozens of other riders , in the spanish doping investigation dubbed ' operation puerto ' which has engulfed the sport since may 2006 .
the 33-year-old german has always denied being involved in the affair , which was uncovered by police in spain and led to the arrest of spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes after doping products and bags of blood were found on his premises .
after months of denials italy 's ivan basso , the tour of italy champion , has recently admitted he worked with fuentes .
the 31-year-old stopped short of saying he actually doped , but is facing a 21-month ban from the italian olympic committee -lrb- coni -rrb- .
germany 's fallen cycling idol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich ended his controversial career after the allegations since being suspended from last year 's tour de france ullrich has retired from the sport , although existing suspicion has heightened in the wake of some stunning confessions from ullrich 's former team-mates this week .
denmark 's bjarne riis , the 1996 tour de france winner , admitted on friday he had used epo while at telekom , who also won the race in 1997 thanks to ullrich .
several of riis 's former telekom teammates , including top sprinter erik zabel of germany , rolf aldag , bert dietz , christian henn and udo boelts , have also admitting using the drug .
the drama provided by the series of stunning confessions took another twist saturday when a doctor employed by several sports federations in germany admitted supplying drugs to amateur cyclists between 1980 and 1990 .
georg huber , a top physician at the university of freiberg clinic , was immediately suspended from his post by the german cycling federation -lrb- bdr -rrb- after admitting to the offences .
huber said he had given the banned male sex hormone testosterone to amateur riders during 1980-1990 , according to a statement by the university clinic of freiberg - considered germany 's top sports medicine facility .
cycling 's wake-up call or death knell ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zabel begged forgiveness for his use of doping the bombshells dropped this week by zabel and riis - two of the german outfits former high profile stars - are being seen as a positive development as cycling fights to rebuild its image .
international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- president pat mcquaid said saturday : " the confessions from germany and denmark show that people are now ready to speak out .
this is extremely positive .
" the law of silence no longer applies - each person must now assume the full consequences of their actions . "
more than eight years on , riis and the other repentants can not now be sanctioned , although the 43-year-old dane is ready to hand back his yellow jersey from his 1996 victory .
the uci and tour de france officials feel it would be a symbolic gesture that would help put the sport on a more sound footing .
it now remains to be seen if the latest claims against ullrich , one of the tour de france 's main protagonists over the past decade , lead to a similar scenario .
d 'hont claimed that ullrich was only following other riders in taking epo , and he urged the german to follow his former team-mates in confessing .
" he did the same as all the others .
it would be good for him to speak out and get things out into the open , it would liberate him , " added d 'hont , who nonetheless could not hide his admiration for the 2000 olympic champion who finished a runner-up five time on the tour .
" if everyone was clean , ullrich would have won the tour de france at least 10 times . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more confessions as merkel urges doping cyclists to come clean german chancellor angela merkel has urged all cyclists involved in doping to own up and come clean as more confessions from top stars pile up in what is becoming the sport 's biggest ever scandal .

" i injected him once with epo in the arm , " said d 'hont .
" it lasted around 10 seconds .
it was as if i was injecting some insulin into someone who was ill . "
it is the first time that d 'hont has revealed who in the telekom team he administered drugs to .
ullrich has been under suspicion of doping since being implicated , along with dozens of other riders , in the spanish doping investigation dubbed ' operation puerto ' which has engulfed the sport since may 2006 .
the 33-year-old german has always denied being involved in the affair , which was uncovered by police in spain and led to the arrest of spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes after doping products and bags of blood were found on his premises .
after months of denials italy 's ivan basso , the tour of italy champion , has recently admitted he worked with fuentes .
the 31-year-old stopped short of saying he actually doped , but is facing a 21-month ban from the italian olympic committee -lrb- coni -rrb- .
germany 's fallen cycling idol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich ended his controversial career after the allegations since being suspended from last year 's tour de france ullrich has retired from the sport , although existing suspicion has heightened in the wake of some stunning confessions from ullrich 's former team-mates this week .
denmark 's bjarne riis , the 1996 tour de france winner , admitted on friday he had used epo while at telekom , who also won the race in 1997 thanks to ullrich .
several of riis 's former telekom teammates , including top sprinter erik zabel of germany , rolf aldag , bert dietz , christian henn and udo boelts , have also admitting using the drug .
the drama provided by the series of stunning confessions took another twist saturday when a doctor employed by several sports federations in germany admitted supplying drugs to amateur cyclists between 1980 and 1990 .
georg huber , a top physician at the university of freiberg clinic , was immediately suspended from his post by the german cycling federation -lrb- bdr -rrb- after admitting to the offences .
huber said he had given the banned male sex hormone testosterone to amateur riders during 1980-1990 , according to a statement by the university clinic of freiberg - considered germany 's top sports medicine facility .

international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- president pat mcquaid said saturday : " the confessions from germany and denmark show that people are now ready to speak out .
this is extremely positive .
" the law of silence no longer applies - each person must now assume the full consequences of their actions . "
more than eight years on , riis and the other repentants can not now be sanctioned , although the 43-year-old dane is ready to hand back his yellow jersey from his 1996 victory .
the uci and tour de france officials feel it would be a symbolic gesture that would help put the sport on a more sound footing .
it now remains to be seen if the latest claims against ullrich , one of the tour de france 's main protagonists over the past decade , lead to a similar scenario .
d 'hont claimed that ullrich was only following other riders in taking epo , and he urged the german to follow his former team-mates in confessing .
" he did the same as all the others .
it would be good for him to speak out and get things out into the open , it would liberate him , " added d 'hont , who nonetheless could not hide his admiration for the 2000 olympic champion who finished a runner-up five time on the tour .

" i injected him once with epo in the arm , " said d 'hont .
" it lasted around 10 seconds .
it was as if i was injecting some insulin into someone who was ill . "
it is the first time that d 'hont has revealed who in the telekom team he administered drugs to .
ullrich has been under suspicion of doping since being implicated , along with dozens of other riders , in the spanish doping investigation dubbed ' operation puerto ' which has engulfed the sport since may 2006 .
the 33-year-old german has always denied being involved in the affair , which was uncovered by police in spain and led to the arrest of spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes after doping products and bags of blood were found on his premises .
after months of denials italy 's ivan basso , the tour of italy champion , has recently admitted he worked with fuentes .
the 31-year-old stopped short of saying he actually doped , but is facing a 21-month ban from the italian olympic committee -lrb- coni -rrb- .
germany 's fallen cycling idol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich ended his controversial career after the allegations since being suspended from last year 's tour de france ullrich has retired from the sport , although existing suspicion has heightened in the wake of some stunning confessions from ullrich 's former team-mates this week .
denmark 's bjarne riis , the 1996 tour de france winner , admitted on friday he had used epo while at telekom , who also won the race in 1997 thanks to ullrich .
several of riis 's former telekom teammates , including top sprinter erik zabel of germany , rolf aldag , bert dietz , christian henn and udo boelts , have also admitting using the drug .
the drama provided by the series of stunning confessions took another twist saturday when a doctor employed by several sports federations in germany admitted supplying drugs to amateur cyclists between 1980 and 1990 .
georg huber , a top physician at the university of freiberg clinic , was immediately suspended from his post by the german cycling federation -lrb- bdr -rrb- after admitting to the offences .
huber said he had given the banned male sex hormone testosterone to amateur riders during 1980-1990 , according to a statement by the university clinic of freiberg - considered germany 's top sports medicine facility .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zabel begged forgiveness for his use of doping the bombshells dropped this week by zabel and riis - two of the german outfits former high profile stars - are being seen as a positive development as cycling fights to rebuild its image .

this is extremely positive .
" the law of silence no longer applies - each person must now assume the full consequences of their actions . "
more than eight years on , riis and the other repentants can not now be sanctioned , although the 43-year-old dane is ready to hand back his yellow jersey from his 1996 victory .
the uci and tour de france officials feel it would be a symbolic gesture that would help put the sport on a more sound footing .
it now remains to be seen if the latest claims against ullrich , one of the tour de france 's main protagonists over the past decade , lead to a similar scenario .
d 'hont claimed that ullrich was only following other riders in taking epo , and he urged the german to follow his former team-mates in confessing .
" he did the same as all the others .
it would be good for him to speak out and get things out into the open , it would liberate him , " added d 'hont , who nonetheless could not hide his admiration for the 2000 olympic champion who finished a runner-up five time on the tour .

the two leaders had been locked in a long-running battle over the legality of early parliamentary elections that had been called by yushchenko , and moves by yanukovich 's coalition to dominate parliament .
the dispute degenerated further this week after yushchenko fired a prosecutor general supported by yanukovich , who in turn had loyal police break in and escort the prosecutor general back to his office building , brawling with pro-yushchenko security guards in the process .
it was the first outbreak violence between organized units of competing branches of the country 's government , since ukraine 's 1991 independence .
troop build-up disperses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops loyal to the president massed outside kiev yushchenko ordered all state buildings in the capital secured and some 2,000 troops were en route to kiev saturday , but the forces were held up outside the city by police loyal to yanukovich .
observers feared a possible assault on the prosecutor general 's office , and uniformed police were unloading steel barriers at the building late saturday evening .
troop columns were returning to bases on sunday , as were pro-yanukovich police at the prosecutor general 's office building .
kiev 's streets barely registered the conflict , with vehicle and pedestrian traffic moving normally under clear skies .
the grounds around the prosecutor general office often resembled a vacation park more than a protest epicentre , with demonstrators and riot police alike seen relaxing , drinking water , sitting on benches , and unbuttoning exterior clothing in the face of unseasonably hot temperatures exceeding 33 degrees in the shade .
the two sides announced a deal was reached after marathon talks ending at around 3 am in kiev .
process for new elections to begin soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko made concessions to ease the crisis parliament will meet for a special session on may 29 and 30 to go through the procedure of setting new elections .
a " special mechanism " in the form of a joint council will oversee legal changes , yushchenko said .
the two sides also agreed that the country 's security forces would not be misused in the dispute .
parliamentary speaker alexander moroz , and opposition leader julia timoshenko joined in the talks , but timoshenko was not named as a participant in the compromise agreement .
the compromise deal conceded yushchenko 's right to call elections , but also pushed the date of the vote beyond the end of summer , a condition yushchenko earlier had described as unacceptable .
" we need to avoid repeating past mistakes , " yanukovich said .
other terms listed in a joint statement included changes in the membership of the central election committee , law making illegal judicial participation in political disputes and an overhaul in national voter rolls .
hope that this truce will hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two viktor 's have never seen eye-to-eye for long it was not the first time this week that yushchenko and yanukovich announced they had resolved the crisis , but the first time a concrete date for elections was set .
the pair in a joint announcement declared their agreement on constitutional amendments would be necessary , to prevent a repeat crisis .
moroz called the deal " not an ideal solution , but the best possible under the circumstances . "
yushchenko identified the inability of the constitutional court , prosecutors and the central election committee to do their jobs in the face of a conflict between the executive and legislative branches as the root of the problem .
" these institutions must be free of political influence , " he said .
" most likely , we will have to find answers in a new constitution . "
ukraine 's last constitution was signed into law in 2006 .
in a possible sign of real willingness to compromise , both yushchenko and yanukovich said they would appear in public together to attend the national cup match of the ukrainian professional soccer league , pitting dynamo kiev against shakhtar donetsk .
enthusiasm for the sport of football is in ukraine one of the few areas the country 's feuding political clans find common ground .
however , yushchenko is a lifetime dynamo supporter , while yanukovich is a shakhtar fan . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de troops loyal to yushchenko attempt to enter kiev as talks stall troops loyal to ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko tried to enter the capital kiev saturday , the interior ministry said , as crisis talks between the feuding president and prime minister were delayed .

the discussions are scheduled for may 31 . iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani and eu foreign policy chief javier solana had been due to meet on thursday , possibly in spain , for their second encounter in just over a month .
however iran 's foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini unexpectedly told reporters at his morning press briefing the meeting had been postponed to allow both sides more time .
" for the larijani-solana meeting , no date or venue has been set .
with the agreement of both sides it has been postponed , " he said .
however amid confusion and concern over why the key meeting had been so suddenly shelved , the foreign ministry later issued a statement from hosseini 's office saying that the talks would , as planned , be held on thursday .
it also indicated that the two men had been in touch recently to confirm the date but did not say if this was after the announcement of the postponement early sunday morning .
early cancellation later retracted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani. right , and javier solana will meet again " in the light of the latest agreement between mr larijani and mr solana , the date for the negotiations is thursday , may 31 , " said the statement .
" the venue will be decided through their contacts , " it added .
there was no explanation for the morning 's announcement .
the meetings between larijani and solana are central to diplomatic efforts to resolve the standoff , which has already seen iran slapped with two sets of un sanctions for its refusal to suspend uranium enrichment .
after missing the latest un security council deadline to suspend the process , western powers are now pressing for iran to face further penalties for its defiance .
freezing of enrichment a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans will be looking for movement from iran even when the pair meet , it remains unclear whether the two sides will be able to achieve any breakthrough , with the eu wanting iran to freeze uranium enrichment and tehran refusing to even consider such a move .
iran 's right to enrichment is the main obstacle toward resolving the standoff as the sensitive process can be used both to make nuclear fuel and , in highly extended form , to produce the fissile core of a bomb .
the united states accuses iran of seeking nuclear weapons , a charge vehemently denied by tehran , which says it just wants to produce energy for a growing population whose fossil fuels will eventually run out .
washington has never ruled out the use of force to resolve the standoff and has sent a clear warning to iran by sailing two nuclear-powered aircraft carriers through the straits of hormuz .
hosseini however brushed off the move .
" the us military build-up in the persian gulf is aimed mostly at lifting their spirits , " he commented .
us-iran dialogue to reopen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq may be the main topic but both sides have other issues the larijani-solana talks are due just three days after eagerly awaited talks in baghdad on monday between iran and its arch enemy the united states .
the talks between us ambassador to iraq ryan crocker and iranian ambassador hassan kazemi will be the highest-level public talks involving only envoys of the two sides since the 1979 islamic revolution .
however both sides have insisted that the talks be strictly limited to iraq , with no chance of the discussions straying into the nuclear crisis .
in a sign of the tension that still exists between the two foes , iran 's intelligence minister said on saturday that the islamic republic had smashed several spy networks run by the us-led coalition in iraq .
" several espionage networks linked to the occupation forces in iraq have been identified and dismantled in the west , southwest and central regions of iran , " said gholam hossein mohseni ejeie , without elaborating . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , eu urges belligerent iran to rethink nuclear program the german presidency of the eu on thursday urged iran to rethink its nuclear program after the un atomic watchdog warned that tehran could acquire nuclear weapons within three to eight years .

" the benes decrees are incompatible with the law , the spirit and the culture of europe , " he told a rally of the sudeten german association in the bavarian city of augsburg .
stoiber said human rights , freedom , justice and the right to a homeland were basic rights in the european union .
the future of europe could be built on this , he said , not on a set of laws leading to expulsions .
laws proclaimed by the late president edvard benes led to the confiscation of german property and the deportation of sudeten germans , who were collectively accused of having been nazi collaborators .
many died in the brutal expulsions and hundreds of thousands later settled in germany and austria , where they and their descendants still live , preserving their dialect and folk customs .
stoiber defended the sudeten german association from criticism by czech president vaclav klaus , who said the real goal of the organization was to wreck czech-german relations .
" the opposite is true , " said the bavarian premier , who also called for the creation of a national center against expulsions in berlin .

on saturday , sudeten german leader bernd posselt urged the government in prague to end its " hysterical fear " of the group and hold round table discussions to help rebuild trust .
czech prime minister mirek topolanek declined an invitation to attend the two-day rally in augsburg on the grounds that his presence would not contribute to improving german-czech relations . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de explaining the expellee experience after world war ii , germans were expelled from eastern europe and sent to a divided germany .

the two leaders had been locked in a long-running battle over the legality of early parliamentary elections that had been called by yushchenko , and moves by yanukovich 's coalition to dominate parliament .
the dispute degenerated further this week after yushchenko fired a prosecutor general supported by yanukovich , who in turn had loyal police break in and escort the prosecutor general back to his office building , brawling with pro-yushchenko security guards in the process .
it was the first outbreak violence between organized units of competing branches of the country 's government , since ukraine 's 1991 independence .
troop build-up disperses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops loyal to the president massed outside kiev yushchenko ordered all state buildings in the capital secured and some 2,000 troops were en route to kiev saturday , but the forces were held up outside the city by police loyal to yanukovich .
observers feared a possible assault on the prosecutor general 's office , and uniformed police were unloading steel barriers at the building late saturday evening .
troop columns were returning to bases on sunday , as were pro-yanukovich police at the prosecutor general 's office building .
kiev 's streets barely registered the conflict , with vehicle and pedestrian traffic moving normally under clear skies .
the grounds around the prosecutor general office often resembled a vacation park more than a protest epicentre , with demonstrators and riot police alike seen relaxing , drinking water , sitting on benches , and unbuttoning exterior clothing in the face of unseasonably hot temperatures exceeding 33 degrees in the shade .
the two sides announced a deal was reached after marathon talks ending at around 3 am in kiev .
process for new elections to begin soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko made concessions to ease the crisis parliament will meet for a special session on may 29 and 30 to go through the procedure of setting new elections .
a " special mechanism " in the form of a joint council will oversee legal changes , yushchenko said .
the two sides also agreed that the country 's security forces would not be misused in the dispute .
parliamentary speaker alexander moroz , and opposition leader julia timoshenko joined in the talks , but timoshenko was not named as a participant in the compromise agreement .
the compromise deal conceded yushchenko 's right to call elections , but also pushed the date of the vote beyond the end of summer , a condition yushchenko earlier had described as unacceptable .
" we need to avoid repeating past mistakes , " yanukovich said .
other terms listed in a joint statement included changes in the membership of the central election committee , law making illegal judicial participation in political disputes and an overhaul in national voter rolls .
hope that this truce will hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two viktor 's have never seen eye-to-eye for long it was not the first time this week that yushchenko and yanukovich announced they had resolved the crisis , but the first time a concrete date for elections was set .
the pair in a joint announcement declared their agreement on constitutional amendments would be necessary , to prevent a repeat crisis .
moroz called the deal " not an ideal solution , but the best possible under the circumstances . "
yushchenko identified the inability of the constitutional court , prosecutors and the central election committee to do their jobs in the face of a conflict between the executive and legislative branches as the root of the problem .
" these institutions must be free of political influence , " he said .
" most likely , we will have to find answers in a new constitution . "
ukraine 's last constitution was signed into law in 2006 .
in a possible sign of real willingness to compromise , both yushchenko and yanukovich said they would appear in public together to attend the national cup match of the ukrainian professional soccer league , pitting dynamo kiev against shakhtar donetsk .
enthusiasm for the sport of football is in ukraine one of the few areas the country 's feuding political clans find common ground .

the environmental protection group greenpeace saturday published a leaked document showing that the united states had raised serious new objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by the german hosts .
it looked to observers as though us objections in the form of amendments had drained the substance from the german statement .
" the united states still has serious , fundamental concerns about this draft statement , " the document stated .
washington rejects the idea of setting mandatory emissions targets , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel 's proposed climate statement calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .

the two leaders had been locked in a long-running battle over the legality of early parliamentary elections that had been called by yushchenko , and moves by yanukovich 's coalition to dominate parliament .
the dispute degenerated further this week after yushchenko fired a prosecutor general supported by yanukovich , who in turn had loyal police break in and escort the prosecutor general back to his office building , brawling with pro-yushchenko security guards in the process .
it was the first outbreak violence between organized units of competing branches of the country 's government , since ukraine 's 1991 independence .
troop build-up disperses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops loyal to the president massed outside kiev yushchenko ordered all state buildings in the capital secured and some 2,000 troops were en route to kiev saturday , but the forces were held up outside the city by police loyal to yanukovich .
observers feared a possible assault on the prosecutor general 's office , and uniformed police were unloading steel barriers at the building late saturday evening .
troop columns were returning to bases on sunday , as were pro-yanukovich police at the prosecutor general 's office building .
kiev 's streets barely registered the conflict , with vehicle and pedestrian traffic moving normally under clear skies .
the grounds around the prosecutor general office often resembled a vacation park more than a protest epicentre , with demonstrators and riot police alike seen relaxing , drinking water , sitting on benches , and unbuttoning exterior clothing in the face of unseasonably hot temperatures exceeding 33 degrees in the shade .
the two sides announced a deal was reached after marathon talks ending at around 3 am in kiev .
process for new elections to begin soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko made concessions to ease the crisis parliament will meet for a special session on may 29 and 30 to go through the procedure of setting new elections .
a " special mechanism " in the form of a joint council will oversee legal changes , yushchenko said .
the two sides also agreed that the country 's security forces would not be misused in the dispute .
parliamentary speaker alexander moroz , and opposition leader julia timoshenko joined in the talks , but timoshenko was not named as a participant in the compromise agreement .
the compromise deal conceded yushchenko 's right to call elections , but also pushed the date of the vote beyond the end of summer , a condition yushchenko earlier had described as unacceptable .
" we need to avoid repeating past mistakes , " yanukovich said .
other terms listed in a joint statement included changes in the membership of the central election committee , law making illegal judicial participation in political disputes and an overhaul in national voter rolls .
hope that this truce will hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two viktor 's have never seen eye-to-eye for long it was not the first time this week that yushchenko and yanukovich announced they had resolved the crisis , but the first time a concrete date for elections was set .
the pair in a joint announcement declared their agreement on constitutional amendments would be necessary , to prevent a repeat crisis .
moroz called the deal " not an ideal solution , but the best possible under the circumstances . "
yushchenko identified the inability of the constitutional court , prosecutors and the central election committee to do their jobs in the face of a conflict between the executive and legislative branches as the root of the problem .
" these institutions must be free of political influence , " he said .
" most likely , we will have to find answers in a new constitution . "
ukraine 's last constitution was signed into law in 2006 .
in a possible sign of real willingness to compromise , both yushchenko and yanukovich said they would appear in public together to attend the national cup match of the ukrainian professional soccer league , pitting dynamo kiev against shakhtar donetsk .
enthusiasm for the sport of football is in ukraine one of the few areas the country 's feuding political clans find common ground .
however , yushchenko is a lifetime dynamo supporter , while yanukovich is a shakhtar fan . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de troops loyal to yushchenko attempt to enter kiev as talks stall troops loyal to ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko tried to enter the capital kiev saturday , the interior ministry said , as crisis talks between the feuding president and prime minister were delayed .

the two leaders had been locked in a long-running battle over the legality of early parliamentary elections that had been called by yushchenko , and moves by yanukovich 's coalition to dominate parliament .
the dispute degenerated further this week after yushchenko fired a prosecutor general supported by yanukovich , who in turn had loyal police break in and escort the prosecutor general back to his office building , brawling with pro-yushchenko security guards in the process .
it was the first outbreak violence between organized units of competing branches of the country 's government , since ukraine 's 1991 independence .
troop build-up disperses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops loyal to the president massed outside kiev yushchenko ordered all state buildings in the capital secured and some 2,000 troops were en route to kiev saturday , but the forces were held up outside the city by police loyal to yanukovich .
observers feared a possible assault on the prosecutor general 's office , and uniformed police were unloading steel barriers at the building late saturday evening .
troop columns were returning to bases on sunday , as were pro-yanukovich police at the prosecutor general 's office building .
kiev 's streets barely registered the conflict , with vehicle and pedestrian traffic moving normally under clear skies .
the grounds around the prosecutor general office often resembled a vacation park more than a protest epicentre , with demonstrators and riot police alike seen relaxing , drinking water , sitting on benches , and unbuttoning exterior clothing in the face of unseasonably hot temperatures exceeding 33 degrees in the shade .
the two sides announced a deal was reached after marathon talks ending at around 3 am in kiev .
process for new elections to begin soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko made concessions to ease the crisis parliament will meet for a special session on may 29 and 30 to go through the procedure of setting new elections .
a " special mechanism " in the form of a joint council will oversee legal changes , yushchenko said .
the two sides also agreed that the country 's security forces would not be misused in the dispute .
parliamentary speaker alexander moroz , and opposition leader julia timoshenko joined in the talks , but timoshenko was not named as a participant in the compromise agreement .
the compromise deal conceded yushchenko 's right to call elections , but also pushed the date of the vote beyond the end of summer , a condition yushchenko earlier had described as unacceptable .
" we need to avoid repeating past mistakes , " yanukovich said .
other terms listed in a joint statement included changes in the membership of the central election committee , law making illegal judicial participation in political disputes and an overhaul in national voter rolls .
hope that this truce will hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two viktor 's have never seen eye-to-eye for long it was not the first time this week that yushchenko and yanukovich announced they had resolved the crisis , but the first time a concrete date for elections was set .
the pair in a joint announcement declared their agreement on constitutional amendments would be necessary , to prevent a repeat crisis .
moroz called the deal " not an ideal solution , but the best possible under the circumstances . "
yushchenko identified the inability of the constitutional court , prosecutors and the central election committee to do their jobs in the face of a conflict between the executive and legislative branches as the root of the problem .
" these institutions must be free of political influence , " he said .
" most likely , we will have to find answers in a new constitution . "
ukraine 's last constitution was signed into law in 2006 .
in a possible sign of real willingness to compromise , both yushchenko and yanukovich said they would appear in public together to attend the national cup match of the ukrainian professional soccer league , pitting dynamo kiev against shakhtar donetsk .
enthusiasm for the sport of football is in ukraine one of the few areas the country 's feuding political clans find common ground .
however , yushchenko is a lifetime dynamo supporter , while yanukovich is a shakhtar fan . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de troops loyal to yushchenko attempt to enter kiev as talks stall troops loyal to ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko tried to enter the capital kiev saturday , the interior ministry said , as crisis talks between the feuding president and prime minister were delayed .

" i injected him once with epo in the arm , " said d 'hont .
" it lasted around 10 seconds .
it was as if i was injecting some insulin into someone who was ill . "
it is the first time that d 'hont has revealed who in the telekom team he administered drugs to .
ullrich has been under suspicion of doping since being implicated , along with dozens of other riders , in the spanish doping investigation dubbed ' operation puerto ' which has engulfed the sport since may 2006 .
the 33-year-old german has always denied being involved in the affair , which was uncovered by police in spain and led to the arrest of spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes after doping products and bags of blood were found on his premises .
after months of denials italy 's ivan basso , the tour of italy champion , has recently admitted he worked with fuentes .
the 31-year-old stopped short of saying he actually doped , but is facing a 21-month ban from the italian olympic committee -lrb- coni -rrb- .
germany 's fallen cycling idol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich ended his controversial career after the allegations since being suspended from last year 's tour de france ullrich has retired from the sport , although existing suspicion has heightened in the wake of some stunning confessions from ullrich 's former team-mates this week .
denmark 's bjarne riis , the 1996 tour de france winner , admitted on friday he had used epo while at telekom , who also won the race in 1997 thanks to ullrich .
several of riis 's former telekom teammates , including top sprinter erik zabel of germany , rolf aldag , bert dietz , christian henn and udo boelts , have also admitting using the drug .
the drama provided by the series of stunning confessions took another twist saturday when a doctor employed by several sports federations in germany admitted supplying drugs to amateur cyclists between 1980 and 1990 .
georg huber , a top physician at the university of freiberg clinic , was immediately suspended from his post by the german cycling federation -lrb- bdr -rrb- after admitting to the offences .
huber said he had given the banned male sex hormone testosterone to amateur riders during 1980-1990 , according to a statement by the university clinic of freiberg - considered germany 's top sports medicine facility .
cycling 's wake-up call or death knell ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zabel begged forgiveness for his use of doping the bombshells dropped this week by zabel and riis - two of the german outfits former high profile stars - are being seen as a positive development as cycling fights to rebuild its image .
international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- president pat mcquaid said saturday : " the confessions from germany and denmark show that people are now ready to speak out .
this is extremely positive .
" the law of silence no longer applies - each person must now assume the full consequences of their actions . "
more than eight years on , riis and the other repentants can not now be sanctioned , although the 43-year-old dane is ready to hand back his yellow jersey from his 1996 victory .
the uci and tour de france officials feel it would be a symbolic gesture that would help put the sport on a more sound footing .
it now remains to be seen if the latest claims against ullrich , one of the tour de france 's main protagonists over the past decade , lead to a similar scenario .
d 'hont claimed that ullrich was only following other riders in taking epo , and he urged the german to follow his former team-mates in confessing .
" he did the same as all the others .
it would be good for him to speak out and get things out into the open , it would liberate him , " added d 'hont , who nonetheless could not hide his admiration for the 2000 olympic champion who finished a runner-up five time on the tour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 27.05.2007 ukraine crisis abates with plans for new elections in september großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president yushchenko and prime minister yanukovych put aside their differences for now ukraine 's sparring political parties agreed to a date for fresh parliamentary elections early sunday in a breakthrough hailed by both sides as an end to their feud , and the threat of military confrontation in kiev . pro-european president viktor yushchenko and pro-russian prime minister viktor yanukovich agreed to hold the elections on september 30 , the interfax news agency reported .
the two leaders had been locked in a long-running battle over the legality of early parliamentary elections that had been called by yushchenko , and moves by yanukovich 's coalition to dominate parliament .
the dispute degenerated further this week after yushchenko fired a prosecutor general supported by yanukovich , who in turn had loyal police break in and escort the prosecutor general back to his office building , brawling with pro-yushchenko security guards in the process .
it was the first outbreak violence between organized units of competing branches of the country 's government , since ukraine 's 1991 independence .
troop build-up disperses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops loyal to the president massed outside kiev yushchenko ordered all state buildings in the capital secured and some 2,000 troops were en route to kiev saturday , but the forces were held up outside the city by police loyal to yanukovich .
observers feared a possible assault on the prosecutor general 's office , and uniformed police were unloading steel barriers at the building late saturday evening .
troop columns were returning to bases on sunday , as were pro-yanukovich police at the prosecutor general 's office building .
kiev 's streets barely registered the conflict , with vehicle and pedestrian traffic moving normally under clear skies .
the grounds around the prosecutor general office often resembled a vacation park more than a protest epicentre , with demonstrators and riot police alike seen relaxing , drinking water , sitting on benches , and unbuttoning exterior clothing in the face of unseasonably hot temperatures exceeding 33 degrees in the shade .
the two sides announced a deal was reached after marathon talks ending at around 3 am in kiev .
process for new elections to begin soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko made concessions to ease the crisis parliament will meet for a special session on may 29 and 30 to go through the procedure of setting new elections .
a " special mechanism " in the form of a joint council will oversee legal changes , yushchenko said .
the two sides also agreed that the country 's security forces would not be misused in the dispute .
parliamentary speaker alexander moroz , and opposition leader julia timoshenko joined in the talks , but timoshenko was not named as a participant in the compromise agreement .
the compromise deal conceded yushchenko 's right to call elections , but also pushed the date of the vote beyond the end of summer , a condition yushchenko earlier had described as unacceptable .
" we need to avoid repeating past mistakes , " yanukovich said .
other terms listed in a joint statement included changes in the membership of the central election committee , law making illegal judicial participation in political disputes and an overhaul in national voter rolls .
hope that this truce will hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two viktor 's have never seen eye-to-eye for long it was not the first time this week that yushchenko and yanukovich announced they had resolved the crisis , but the first time a concrete date for elections was set .
the pair in a joint announcement declared their agreement on constitutional amendments would be necessary , to prevent a repeat crisis .
moroz called the deal " not an ideal solution , but the best possible under the circumstances . "
yushchenko identified the inability of the constitutional court , prosecutors and the central election committee to do their jobs in the face of a conflict between the executive and legislative branches as the root of the problem .
" these institutions must be free of political influence , " he said .
" most likely , we will have to find answers in a new constitution . "
ukraine 's last constitution was signed into law in 2006 .

the two leaders had been locked in a long-running battle over the legality of early parliamentary elections that had been called by yushchenko , and moves by yanukovich 's coalition to dominate parliament .
the dispute degenerated further this week after yushchenko fired a prosecutor general supported by yanukovich , who in turn had loyal police break in and escort the prosecutor general back to his office building , brawling with pro-yushchenko security guards in the process .
it was the first outbreak violence between organized units of competing branches of the country 's government , since ukraine 's 1991 independence .
troop build-up disperses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops loyal to the president massed outside kiev yushchenko ordered all state buildings in the capital secured and some 2,000 troops were en route to kiev saturday , but the forces were held up outside the city by police loyal to yanukovich .
observers feared a possible assault on the prosecutor general 's office , and uniformed police were unloading steel barriers at the building late saturday evening .
troop columns were returning to bases on sunday , as were pro-yanukovich police at the prosecutor general 's office building .
kiev 's streets barely registered the conflict , with vehicle and pedestrian traffic moving normally under clear skies .
the grounds around the prosecutor general office often resembled a vacation park more than a protest epicentre , with demonstrators and riot police alike seen relaxing , drinking water , sitting on benches , and unbuttoning exterior clothing in the face of unseasonably hot temperatures exceeding 33 degrees in the shade .
the two sides announced a deal was reached after marathon talks ending at around 3 am in kiev .
process for new elections to begin soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko made concessions to ease the crisis parliament will meet for a special session on may 29 and 30 to go through the procedure of setting new elections .
a " special mechanism " in the form of a joint council will oversee legal changes , yushchenko said .
the two sides also agreed that the country 's security forces would not be misused in the dispute .
parliamentary speaker alexander moroz , and opposition leader julia timoshenko joined in the talks , but timoshenko was not named as a participant in the compromise agreement .
the compromise deal conceded yushchenko 's right to call elections , but also pushed the date of the vote beyond the end of summer , a condition yushchenko earlier had described as unacceptable .
" we need to avoid repeating past mistakes , " yanukovich said .
other terms listed in a joint statement included changes in the membership of the central election committee , law making illegal judicial participation in political disputes and an overhaul in national voter rolls .

the pair in a joint announcement declared their agreement on constitutional amendments would be necessary , to prevent a repeat crisis .
moroz called the deal " not an ideal solution , but the best possible under the circumstances . "
yushchenko identified the inability of the constitutional court , prosecutors and the central election committee to do their jobs in the face of a conflict between the executive and legislative branches as the root of the problem .
" these institutions must be free of political influence , " he said .
" most likely , we will have to find answers in a new constitution . "

now , there may be progress in making islam a regular course in german schools . more than 700,000 muslim students attend school in germany , but nowhere does the religious curriculum deal with islam in the same way as christianity .
the problem is that most schools rely on their local mosque for guidance , which means there can be large discrepancies in the content and quality of instruction .
that is why german state governments and muslim organizations alike are looking to create a more standardized approach to teaching islam .
it is not an easy task , however .
about two-and-a-half million of germany 's muslims belong to the sunni denomination of islam .
but the rest are mainly shiites , alevis or followers of the south asian ahmaddiyya movement .
broad spectrum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no standardized method for teaching islam with such a broad spectrum of beliefs among them , islam expert michael kiefer said creating a single combined course would be difficult .
" we 've seen in austria , for example , that the concept of one course for all muslims is controversial , because the smaller denominations are left out , " he said .
that is why authorities in the german state of baden-württemberg have decided to offer with two courses : one for sunni and shia students , and another for alevis .
so far , it looks like a number of other states will base their systems on this model as well , he said .
the states of north rhine-westphalia , bavaria and lower saxony , however , are still looking for ways to create one standard curriculum with the help of various muslim groups . fundamental principles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are divergent views about how to teach islam in lower saxony , for example , a number of muslim organizations have come together to form a " shura , " or council , to help authorities define the fundamental principles to be included in courses on islam .
state education minister heidemarie ballasch says the body 's recommendations have been put to the test in a pilot project at 21 schools since 2003 .
" one of the political goals of the trial is to promote integration instead of parallel social structures , " ballasch said .
" another is to help school students learn about their islam and other religions , so that when the time comes , they 're in a position to declare their faith , " she added .
while most german state education systems limit islamic instruction to primary school , north rhine-westphalia has gone down a different path , offering courses from year 1-10 .
last year , more than 130 schools with some 10,000 muslim students took part in the project .
thousands have participated in the capital berlin , some 4,500 school students have taken part in islamic studies courses since 2003 , while another ten schools recently added material relevant to alevism to their curricula as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over half a million muslims attend german schools " our co-operation with the islamic federation has , by and large , led to a positive expansion of religious education in our schools , ” said hans-jürgen pokall of berlin 's education , science and research administration .
" the initial problems we experienced , which had more to do with the way some teachers interacted with the students than the actual content of the courses , have subsided , " he said .
berlin ’ s islamic federation expects that the demand for school teachers with qualifications in islamic religious instruction will grow as more and more parents request courses for their children .
it is also calling for long-term planning to meet the demand .
the university of münster , for example , was quick to react to the trend and has been training specialist teachers since 2005 .
other institutes , such as the university of osnabrück , are already following suit . sabine ripperger -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de many see progress at berlin islam talks , but differences remain the german government attempted to reach out to the country 's more than three million muslims on wednesday but faced criticism from a muslim leader for organizing " aimless " talks .

the environmental protection group greenpeace saturday published a leaked document showing that the united states had raised serious new objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by the german hosts .
it looked to observers as though us objections in the form of amendments had drained the substance from the german statement .
" the united states still has serious , fundamental concerns about this draft statement , " the document stated .
washington rejects the idea of setting mandatory emissions targets , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel 's proposed climate statement calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
" the treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses multiple ' red lines ' in terms of what we simply can not agree to , " the us document said .
sources close to negotiations told afp the us amendments seek to remove any idea of an urgent problem of climate change requiring a firm international response .
us rejects climate change as an ' urgent problem ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us denies the scientific evidence is conclusive " the preliminary sessions clearly indicate the american desire to minimalise -lrb- the draft -rrb- , " said one european diplomatic source .
the us was refusing to take account of findings by an intergovernmental group of experts on climate change , whose latest conclusions have been used by the germans in their draft climate statement , the source said .
" i ca n't remember any major international climate meeting with that kind of complete divergence of views , " said phil clapp , head of the national environment trust in washington .
" there is a fundamental disagreement between the eu and the bush administration positions .
it 's hard to see how governments could sign the sort of statement that washington wants . "
clapp added that " at this point we do n't see signs that the -lrb- bush -rrb- administration will change its position ... and as a matter of fact the signs go in exactly the opposite direction . "
in washington , white house spokeswoman dana perino played down the document leaked by greenpeace while acknowledging differences .
" we believe that there are many different approaches to climate change , " she said .
" by no means is there a final document . "
washington does not recognise the un convention on climate change as an appropriate forum for multilateral negotiations on global warming , but only as one of several possible forums .
kyoto successor also in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a follow-up climate protocol to kyoto could also be in danger this also does not augur well for a conference scheduled in bali in december at which states signatory to the convention will have to negotiate a follow-up to the kyoto protocol on climate change which runs out in 2012 .
the us has not signed the protocol .
" these latest proposals display a complete absence of reconciliation between the american technological approach and that of the eu ... " said the diplomatic source .
" and all this despite appeals by major american companies and republican party personalities like arnold schwarzenegger . "
on may 18 , senior us lawmakers wrote to bush expressing deep concern over reports that his administration was seeking to weaken a g8 declaration on climate change .
" us leadership is critical to tackling this global threat .
but we need an executive branch that engages the rest of the world to solve this problem rather than stubbornly ignoring it , " the 15 heads of congressional committees wrote in a letter . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : us rejects germany 's g8 climate declaration the united states has raised new serious objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by germany for next month 's group of eight summit , the washington post reported saturday .

the environmental protection group greenpeace saturday published a leaked document showing that the united states had raised serious new objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by the german hosts .
it looked to observers as though us objections in the form of amendments had drained the substance from the german statement .
" the united states still has serious , fundamental concerns about this draft statement , " the document stated .
washington rejects the idea of setting mandatory emissions targets , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel 's proposed climate statement calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
" the treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses multiple ' red lines ' in terms of what we simply can not agree to , " the us document said .
sources close to negotiations told afp the us amendments seek to remove any idea of an urgent problem of climate change requiring a firm international response .
us rejects climate change as an ' urgent problem ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us denies the scientific evidence is conclusive " the preliminary sessions clearly indicate the american desire to minimalise -lrb- the draft -rrb- , " said one european diplomatic source .
the us was refusing to take account of findings by an intergovernmental group of experts on climate change , whose latest conclusions have been used by the germans in their draft climate statement , the source said .
" i ca n't remember any major international climate meeting with that kind of complete divergence of views , " said phil clapp , head of the national environment trust in washington .
" there is a fundamental disagreement between the eu and the bush administration positions .
it 's hard to see how governments could sign the sort of statement that washington wants . "
clapp added that " at this point we do n't see signs that the -lrb- bush -rrb- administration will change its position ... and as a matter of fact the signs go in exactly the opposite direction . "
in washington , white house spokeswoman dana perino played down the document leaked by greenpeace while acknowledging differences .
" we believe that there are many different approaches to climate change , " she said .
" by no means is there a final document . "
washington does not recognise the un convention on climate change as an appropriate forum for multilateral negotiations on global warming , but only as one of several possible forums .
kyoto successor also in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a follow-up climate protocol to kyoto could also be in danger this also does not augur well for a conference scheduled in bali in december at which states signatory to the convention will have to negotiate a follow-up to the kyoto protocol on climate change which runs out in 2012 .
the us has not signed the protocol .
" these latest proposals display a complete absence of reconciliation between the american technological approach and that of the eu ... " said the diplomatic source .
" and all this despite appeals by major american companies and republican party personalities like arnold schwarzenegger . "
on may 18 , senior us lawmakers wrote to bush expressing deep concern over reports that his administration was seeking to weaken a g8 declaration on climate change .
" us leadership is critical to tackling this global threat .

the two leaders had been locked in a long-running battle over the legality of early parliamentary elections that had been called by yushchenko , and moves by yanukovich 's coalition to dominate parliament .
the dispute degenerated further this week after yushchenko fired a prosecutor general supported by yanukovich , who in turn had loyal police break in and escort the prosecutor general back to his office building , brawling with pro-yushchenko security guards in the process .
it was the first outbreak violence between organized units of competing branches of the country 's government , since ukraine 's 1991 independence .
troop build-up disperses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops loyal to the president massed outside kiev yushchenko ordered all state buildings in the capital secured and some 2,000 troops were en route to kiev saturday , but the forces were held up outside the city by police loyal to yanukovich .
observers feared a possible assault on the prosecutor general 's office , and uniformed police were unloading steel barriers at the building late saturday evening .
troop columns were returning to bases on sunday , as were pro-yanukovich police at the prosecutor general 's office building .
kiev 's streets barely registered the conflict , with vehicle and pedestrian traffic moving normally under clear skies .
the grounds around the prosecutor general office often resembled a vacation park more than a protest epicentre , with demonstrators and riot police alike seen relaxing , drinking water , sitting on benches , and unbuttoning exterior clothing in the face of unseasonably hot temperatures exceeding 33 degrees in the shade .
the two sides announced a deal was reached after marathon talks ending at around 3 am in kiev .
process for new elections to begin soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko made concessions to ease the crisis parliament will meet for a special session on may 29 and 30 to go through the procedure of setting new elections .
a " special mechanism " in the form of a joint council will oversee legal changes , yushchenko said .
the two sides also agreed that the country 's security forces would not be misused in the dispute .
parliamentary speaker alexander moroz , and opposition leader julia timoshenko joined in the talks , but timoshenko was not named as a participant in the compromise agreement .
the compromise deal conceded yushchenko 's right to call elections , but also pushed the date of the vote beyond the end of summer , a condition yushchenko earlier had described as unacceptable .
" we need to avoid repeating past mistakes , " yanukovich said .
other terms listed in a joint statement included changes in the membership of the central election committee , law making illegal judicial participation in political disputes and an overhaul in national voter rolls .
hope that this truce will hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two viktor 's have never seen eye-to-eye for long it was not the first time this week that yushchenko and yanukovich announced they had resolved the crisis , but the first time a concrete date for elections was set .
the pair in a joint announcement declared their agreement on constitutional amendments would be necessary , to prevent a repeat crisis .
moroz called the deal " not an ideal solution , but the best possible under the circumstances . "
yushchenko identified the inability of the constitutional court , prosecutors and the central election committee to do their jobs in the face of a conflict between the executive and legislative branches as the root of the problem .
" these institutions must be free of political influence , " he said .
" most likely , we will have to find answers in a new constitution . "
ukraine 's last constitution was signed into law in 2006 .
in a possible sign of real willingness to compromise , both yushchenko and yanukovich said they would appear in public together to attend the national cup match of the ukrainian professional soccer league , pitting dynamo kiev against shakhtar donetsk .
enthusiasm for the sport of football is in ukraine one of the few areas the country 's feuding political clans find common ground .

the discussions are scheduled for may 31 . iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani and eu foreign policy chief javier solana had been due to meet on thursday , possibly in spain , for their second encounter in just over a month .
however iran 's foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini unexpectedly told reporters at his morning press briefing the meeting had been postponed to allow both sides more time .
" for the larijani-solana meeting , no date or venue has been set .

however amid confusion and concern over why the key meeting had been so suddenly shelved , the foreign ministry later issued a statement from hosseini 's office saying that the talks would , as planned , be held on thursday .

there was no explanation for the morning 's announcement .
the meetings between larijani and solana are central to diplomatic efforts to resolve the standoff , which has already seen iran slapped with two sets of un sanctions for its refusal to suspend uranium enrichment .

iran 's right to enrichment is the main obstacle toward resolving the standoff as the sensitive process can be used both to make nuclear fuel and , in highly extended form , to produce the fissile core of a bomb .
the united states accuses iran of seeking nuclear weapons , a charge vehemently denied by tehran , which says it just wants to produce energy for a growing population whose fossil fuels will eventually run out .
washington has never ruled out the use of force to resolve the standoff and has sent a clear warning to iran by sailing two nuclear-powered aircraft carriers through the straits of hormuz .
hosseini however brushed off the move .

however both sides have insisted that the talks be strictly limited to iraq , with no chance of the discussions straying into the nuclear crisis .

the environmental protection group greenpeace saturday published a leaked document showing that the united states had raised serious new objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by the german hosts .
it looked to observers as though us objections in the form of amendments had drained the substance from the german statement .
" the united states still has serious , fundamental concerns about this draft statement , " the document stated .
washington rejects the idea of setting mandatory emissions targets , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel 's proposed climate statement calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
" the treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses multiple ' red lines ' in terms of what we simply can not agree to , " the us document said .
sources close to negotiations told afp the us amendments seek to remove any idea of an urgent problem of climate change requiring a firm international response .
us rejects climate change as an ' urgent problem ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us denies the scientific evidence is conclusive " the preliminary sessions clearly indicate the american desire to minimalise -lrb- the draft -rrb- , " said one european diplomatic source .
the us was refusing to take account of findings by an intergovernmental group of experts on climate change , whose latest conclusions have been used by the germans in their draft climate statement , the source said .
" i ca n't remember any major international climate meeting with that kind of complete divergence of views , " said phil clapp , head of the national environment trust in washington .
" there is a fundamental disagreement between the eu and the bush administration positions .
it 's hard to see how governments could sign the sort of statement that washington wants . "
clapp added that " at this point we do n't see signs that the -lrb- bush -rrb- administration will change its position ... and as a matter of fact the signs go in exactly the opposite direction . "
in washington , white house spokeswoman dana perino played down the document leaked by greenpeace while acknowledging differences .
" we believe that there are many different approaches to climate change , " she said .
" by no means is there a final document . "
washington does not recognise the un convention on climate change as an appropriate forum for multilateral negotiations on global warming , but only as one of several possible forums .
kyoto successor also in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a follow-up climate protocol to kyoto could also be in danger this also does not augur well for a conference scheduled in bali in december at which states signatory to the convention will have to negotiate a follow-up to the kyoto protocol on climate change which runs out in 2012 .
the us has not signed the protocol .
" these latest proposals display a complete absence of reconciliation between the american technological approach and that of the eu ... " said the diplomatic source .
" and all this despite appeals by major american companies and republican party personalities like arnold schwarzenegger . "
on may 18 , senior us lawmakers wrote to bush expressing deep concern over reports that his administration was seeking to weaken a g8 declaration on climate change .
" us leadership is critical to tackling this global threat .
but we need an executive branch that engages the rest of the world to solve this problem rather than stubbornly ignoring it , " the 15 heads of congressional committees wrote in a letter . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : us rejects germany 's g8 climate declaration the united states has raised new serious objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by germany for next month 's group of eight summit , the washington post reported saturday .

" the benes decrees are incompatible with the law , the spirit and the culture of europe , " he told a rally of the sudeten german association in the bavarian city of augsburg .
stoiber said human rights , freedom , justice and the right to a homeland were basic rights in the european union .
the future of europe could be built on this , he said , not on a set of laws leading to expulsions .
laws proclaimed by the late president edvard benes led to the confiscation of german property and the deportation of sudeten germans , who were collectively accused of having been nazi collaborators .
many died in the brutal expulsions and hundreds of thousands later settled in germany and austria , where they and their descendants still live , preserving their dialect and folk customs .
stoiber defended the sudeten german association from criticism by czech president vaclav klaus , who said the real goal of the organization was to wreck czech-german relations .
" the opposite is true , " said the bavarian premier , who also called for the creation of a national center against expulsions in berlin .
opposition to national expellee center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exhibitions have told the story but no permament site exists the czech government and poland are opposed to such a center , fearing it could attempt to rewrite history by portraying germans as victims of the war .
on saturday , sudeten german leader bernd posselt urged the government in prague to end its " hysterical fear " of the group and hold round table discussions to help rebuild trust .
czech prime minister mirek topolanek declined an invitation to attend the two-day rally in augsburg on the grounds that his presence would not contribute to improving german-czech relations . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de explaining the expellee experience after world war ii , germans were expelled from eastern europe and sent to a divided germany .

the discussions are scheduled for may 31 . iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani and eu foreign policy chief javier solana had been due to meet on thursday , possibly in spain , for their second encounter in just over a month .
however iran 's foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini unexpectedly told reporters at his morning press briefing the meeting had been postponed to allow both sides more time .
" for the larijani-solana meeting , no date or venue has been set .
with the agreement of both sides it has been postponed , " he said .
however amid confusion and concern over why the key meeting had been so suddenly shelved , the foreign ministry later issued a statement from hosseini 's office saying that the talks would , as planned , be held on thursday .
it also indicated that the two men had been in touch recently to confirm the date but did not say if this was after the announcement of the postponement early sunday morning .
early cancellation later retracted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani. right , and javier solana will meet again " in the light of the latest agreement between mr larijani and mr solana , the date for the negotiations is thursday , may 31 , " said the statement .
" the venue will be decided through their contacts , " it added .
there was no explanation for the morning 's announcement .
the meetings between larijani and solana are central to diplomatic efforts to resolve the standoff , which has already seen iran slapped with two sets of un sanctions for its refusal to suspend uranium enrichment .
after missing the latest un security council deadline to suspend the process , western powers are now pressing for iran to face further penalties for its defiance .
freezing of enrichment a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans will be looking for movement from iran even when the pair meet , it remains unclear whether the two sides will be able to achieve any breakthrough , with the eu wanting iran to freeze uranium enrichment and tehran refusing to even consider such a move .
iran 's right to enrichment is the main obstacle toward resolving the standoff as the sensitive process can be used both to make nuclear fuel and , in highly extended form , to produce the fissile core of a bomb .
the united states accuses iran of seeking nuclear weapons , a charge vehemently denied by tehran , which says it just wants to produce energy for a growing population whose fossil fuels will eventually run out .
washington has never ruled out the use of force to resolve the standoff and has sent a clear warning to iran by sailing two nuclear-powered aircraft carriers through the straits of hormuz .
hosseini however brushed off the move .
" the us military build-up in the persian gulf is aimed mostly at lifting their spirits , " he commented .
us-iran dialogue to reopen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq may be the main topic but both sides have other issues the larijani-solana talks are due just three days after eagerly awaited talks in baghdad on monday between iran and its arch enemy the united states .
the talks between us ambassador to iraq ryan crocker and iranian ambassador hassan kazemi will be the highest-level public talks involving only envoys of the two sides since the 1979 islamic revolution .
however both sides have insisted that the talks be strictly limited to iraq , with no chance of the discussions straying into the nuclear crisis .
in a sign of the tension that still exists between the two foes , iran 's intelligence minister said on saturday that the islamic republic had smashed several spy networks run by the us-led coalition in iraq .
" several espionage networks linked to the occupation forces in iraq have been identified and dismantled in the west , southwest and central regions of iran , " said gholam hossein mohseni ejeie , without elaborating . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , eu urges belligerent iran to rethink nuclear program the german presidency of the eu on thursday urged iran to rethink its nuclear program after the un atomic watchdog warned that tehran could acquire nuclear weapons within three to eight years .
-lrb- 24.05.2007 -rrb- iran expects " new ideas " from eu to end nuclear standoff iran 's nuclear negotiator ali larijani said wednesday that he expected new ideas from eu foreign policy chief javier solana on breaking the standoff over tehran 's disputed nuclear program .
-lrb- 25.04.2007 -rrb- iran faces isolation as security council agrees further sanctions the un security council has slapped new sanctions on iran over its suspect nuclear program as western powers warned tehran it faced becoming even more internationally isolated .

now , there may be progress in making islam a regular course in german schools . more than 700,000 muslim students attend school in germany , but nowhere does the religious curriculum deal with islam in the same way as christianity .
the problem is that most schools rely on their local mosque for guidance , which means there can be large discrepancies in the content and quality of instruction .
that is why german state governments and muslim organizations alike are looking to create a more standardized approach to teaching islam .
it is not an easy task , however .
about two-and-a-half million of germany 's muslims belong to the sunni denomination of islam .
but the rest are mainly shiites , alevis or followers of the south asian ahmaddiyya movement .
broad spectrum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no standardized method for teaching islam with such a broad spectrum of beliefs among them , islam expert michael kiefer said creating a single combined course would be difficult .
" we 've seen in austria , for example , that the concept of one course for all muslims is controversial , because the smaller denominations are left out , " he said .
that is why authorities in the german state of baden-württemberg have decided to offer with two courses : one for sunni and shia students , and another for alevis .
so far , it looks like a number of other states will base their systems on this model as well , he said .
the states of north rhine-westphalia , bavaria and lower saxony , however , are still looking for ways to create one standard curriculum with the help of various muslim groups . fundamental principles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are divergent views about how to teach islam in lower saxony , for example , a number of muslim organizations have come together to form a " shura , " or council , to help authorities define the fundamental principles to be included in courses on islam .
state education minister heidemarie ballasch says the body 's recommendations have been put to the test in a pilot project at 21 schools since 2003 .
" one of the political goals of the trial is to promote integration instead of parallel social structures , " ballasch said .
" another is to help school students learn about their islam and other religions , so that when the time comes , they 're in a position to declare their faith , " she added .
while most german state education systems limit islamic instruction to primary school , north rhine-westphalia has gone down a different path , offering courses from year 1-10 .
last year , more than 130 schools with some 10,000 muslim students took part in the project .
thousands have participated in the capital berlin , some 4,500 school students have taken part in islamic studies courses since 2003 , while another ten schools recently added material relevant to alevism to their curricula as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over half a million muslims attend german schools " our co-operation with the islamic federation has , by and large , led to a positive expansion of religious education in our schools , ” said hans-jürgen pokall of berlin 's education , science and research administration .
" the initial problems we experienced , which had more to do with the way some teachers interacted with the students than the actual content of the courses , have subsided , " he said .
berlin ’ s islamic federation expects that the demand for school teachers with qualifications in islamic religious instruction will grow as more and more parents request courses for their children .
it is also calling for long-term planning to meet the demand .

" i injected him once with epo in the arm , " said d 'hont .
" it lasted around 10 seconds .
it was as if i was injecting some insulin into someone who was ill . "
it is the first time that d 'hont has revealed who in the telekom team he administered drugs to .
ullrich has been under suspicion of doping since being implicated , along with dozens of other riders , in the spanish doping investigation dubbed ' operation puerto ' which has engulfed the sport since may 2006 .
the 33-year-old german has always denied being involved in the affair , which was uncovered by police in spain and led to the arrest of spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes after doping products and bags of blood were found on his premises .
after months of denials italy 's ivan basso , the tour of italy champion , has recently admitted he worked with fuentes .
the 31-year-old stopped short of saying he actually doped , but is facing a 21-month ban from the italian olympic committee -lrb- coni -rrb- .
germany 's fallen cycling idol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich ended his controversial career after the allegations since being suspended from last year 's tour de france ullrich has retired from the sport , although existing suspicion has heightened in the wake of some stunning confessions from ullrich 's former team-mates this week .
denmark 's bjarne riis , the 1996 tour de france winner , admitted on friday he had used epo while at telekom , who also won the race in 1997 thanks to ullrich .
several of riis 's former telekom teammates , including top sprinter erik zabel of germany , rolf aldag , bert dietz , christian henn and udo boelts , have also admitting using the drug .
the drama provided by the series of stunning confessions took another twist saturday when a doctor employed by several sports federations in germany admitted supplying drugs to amateur cyclists between 1980 and 1990 .
georg huber , a top physician at the university of freiberg clinic , was immediately suspended from his post by the german cycling federation -lrb- bdr -rrb- after admitting to the offences .
huber said he had given the banned male sex hormone testosterone to amateur riders during 1980-1990 , according to a statement by the university clinic of freiberg - considered germany 's top sports medicine facility .
cycling 's wake-up call or death knell ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zabel begged forgiveness for his use of doping the bombshells dropped this week by zabel and riis - two of the german outfits former high profile stars - are being seen as a positive development as cycling fights to rebuild its image .
international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- president pat mcquaid said saturday : " the confessions from germany and denmark show that people are now ready to speak out .
this is extremely positive .
" the law of silence no longer applies - each person must now assume the full consequences of their actions . "
more than eight years on , riis and the other repentants can not now be sanctioned , although the 43-year-old dane is ready to hand back his yellow jersey from his 1996 victory .
the uci and tour de france officials feel it would be a symbolic gesture that would help put the sport on a more sound footing .
it now remains to be seen if the latest claims against ullrich , one of the tour de france 's main protagonists over the past decade , lead to a similar scenario .
d 'hont claimed that ullrich was only following other riders in taking epo , and he urged the german to follow his former team-mates in confessing .
" he did the same as all the others .

" i injected him once with epo in the arm , " said d 'hont .
" it lasted around 10 seconds .
it was as if i was injecting some insulin into someone who was ill . "
it is the first time that d 'hont has revealed who in the telekom team he administered drugs to .
ullrich has been under suspicion of doping since being implicated , along with dozens of other riders , in the spanish doping investigation dubbed ' operation puerto ' which has engulfed the sport since may 2006 .
the 33-year-old german has always denied being involved in the affair , which was uncovered by police in spain and led to the arrest of spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes after doping products and bags of blood were found on his premises .
after months of denials italy 's ivan basso , the tour of italy champion , has recently admitted he worked with fuentes .
the 31-year-old stopped short of saying he actually doped , but is facing a 21-month ban from the italian olympic committee -lrb- coni -rrb- .
germany 's fallen cycling idol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich ended his controversial career after the allegations since being suspended from last year 's tour de france ullrich has retired from the sport , although existing suspicion has heightened in the wake of some stunning confessions from ullrich 's former team-mates this week .
denmark 's bjarne riis , the 1996 tour de france winner , admitted on friday he had used epo while at telekom , who also won the race in 1997 thanks to ullrich .
several of riis 's former telekom teammates , including top sprinter erik zabel of germany , rolf aldag , bert dietz , christian henn and udo boelts , have also admitting using the drug .
the drama provided by the series of stunning confessions took another twist saturday when a doctor employed by several sports federations in germany admitted supplying drugs to amateur cyclists between 1980 and 1990 .
georg huber , a top physician at the university of freiberg clinic , was immediately suspended from his post by the german cycling federation -lrb- bdr -rrb- after admitting to the offences .
huber said he had given the banned male sex hormone testosterone to amateur riders during 1980-1990 , according to a statement by the university clinic of freiberg - considered germany 's top sports medicine facility .
cycling 's wake-up call or death knell ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zabel begged forgiveness for his use of doping the bombshells dropped this week by zabel and riis - two of the german outfits former high profile stars - are being seen as a positive development as cycling fights to rebuild its image .
international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- president pat mcquaid said saturday : " the confessions from germany and denmark show that people are now ready to speak out .
this is extremely positive .
" the law of silence no longer applies - each person must now assume the full consequences of their actions . "
more than eight years on , riis and the other repentants can not now be sanctioned , although the 43-year-old dane is ready to hand back his yellow jersey from his 1996 victory .
the uci and tour de france officials feel it would be a symbolic gesture that would help put the sport on a more sound footing .
it now remains to be seen if the latest claims against ullrich , one of the tour de france 's main protagonists over the past decade , lead to a similar scenario .
d 'hont claimed that ullrich was only following other riders in taking epo , and he urged the german to follow his former team-mates in confessing .
" he did the same as all the others .
it would be good for him to speak out and get things out into the open , it would liberate him , " added d 'hont , who nonetheless could not hide his admiration for the 2000 olympic champion who finished a runner-up five time on the tour .

now , there may be progress in making islam a regular course in german schools . more than 700,000 muslim students attend school in germany , but nowhere does the religious curriculum deal with islam in the same way as christianity .
the problem is that most schools rely on their local mosque for guidance , which means there can be large discrepancies in the content and quality of instruction .
that is why german state governments and muslim organizations alike are looking to create a more standardized approach to teaching islam .
it is not an easy task , however .
about two-and-a-half million of germany 's muslims belong to the sunni denomination of islam .
but the rest are mainly shiites , alevis or followers of the south asian ahmaddiyya movement .
broad spectrum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no standardized method for teaching islam with such a broad spectrum of beliefs among them , islam expert michael kiefer said creating a single combined course would be difficult .
" we 've seen in austria , for example , that the concept of one course for all muslims is controversial , because the smaller denominations are left out , " he said .
that is why authorities in the german state of baden-württemberg have decided to offer with two courses : one for sunni and shia students , and another for alevis .
so far , it looks like a number of other states will base their systems on this model as well , he said .
the states of north rhine-westphalia , bavaria and lower saxony , however , are still looking for ways to create one standard curriculum with the help of various muslim groups . fundamental principles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are divergent views about how to teach islam in lower saxony , for example , a number of muslim organizations have come together to form a " shura , " or council , to help authorities define the fundamental principles to be included in courses on islam .
state education minister heidemarie ballasch says the body 's recommendations have been put to the test in a pilot project at 21 schools since 2003 .
" one of the political goals of the trial is to promote integration instead of parallel social structures , " ballasch said .
" another is to help school students learn about their islam and other religions , so that when the time comes , they 're in a position to declare their faith , " she added .
while most german state education systems limit islamic instruction to primary school , north rhine-westphalia has gone down a different path , offering courses from year 1-10 .
last year , more than 130 schools with some 10,000 muslim students took part in the project .
thousands have participated in the capital berlin , some 4,500 school students have taken part in islamic studies courses since 2003 , while another ten schools recently added material relevant to alevism to their curricula as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over half a million muslims attend german schools " our co-operation with the islamic federation has , by and large , led to a positive expansion of religious education in our schools , ” said hans-jürgen pokall of berlin 's education , science and research administration .
" the initial problems we experienced , which had more to do with the way some teachers interacted with the students than the actual content of the courses , have subsided , " he said .
berlin ’ s islamic federation expects that the demand for school teachers with qualifications in islamic religious instruction will grow as more and more parents request courses for their children .
it is also calling for long-term planning to meet the demand .
the university of münster , for example , was quick to react to the trend and has been training specialist teachers since 2005 .

now , there may be progress in making islam a regular course in german schools . more than 700,000 muslim students attend school in germany , but nowhere does the religious curriculum deal with islam in the same way as christianity .
the problem is that most schools rely on their local mosque for guidance , which means there can be large discrepancies in the content and quality of instruction .
that is why german state governments and muslim organizations alike are looking to create a more standardized approach to teaching islam .
it is not an easy task , however .
about two-and-a-half million of germany 's muslims belong to the sunni denomination of islam .
but the rest are mainly shiites , alevis or followers of the south asian ahmaddiyya movement .
broad spectrum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no standardized method for teaching islam with such a broad spectrum of beliefs among them , islam expert michael kiefer said creating a single combined course would be difficult .
" we 've seen in austria , for example , that the concept of one course for all muslims is controversial , because the smaller denominations are left out , " he said .
that is why authorities in the german state of baden-württemberg have decided to offer with two courses : one for sunni and shia students , and another for alevis .
so far , it looks like a number of other states will base their systems on this model as well , he said .
the states of north rhine-westphalia , bavaria and lower saxony , however , are still looking for ways to create one standard curriculum with the help of various muslim groups . fundamental principles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are divergent views about how to teach islam in lower saxony , for example , a number of muslim organizations have come together to form a " shura , " or council , to help authorities define the fundamental principles to be included in courses on islam .
state education minister heidemarie ballasch says the body 's recommendations have been put to the test in a pilot project at 21 schools since 2003 .
" one of the political goals of the trial is to promote integration instead of parallel social structures , " ballasch said .
" another is to help school students learn about their islam and other religions , so that when the time comes , they 're in a position to declare their faith , " she added .
while most german state education systems limit islamic instruction to primary school , north rhine-westphalia has gone down a different path , offering courses from year 1-10 .
last year , more than 130 schools with some 10,000 muslim students took part in the project .
thousands have participated in the capital berlin , some 4,500 school students have taken part in islamic studies courses since 2003 , while another ten schools recently added material relevant to alevism to their curricula as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over half a million muslims attend german schools " our co-operation with the islamic federation has , by and large , led to a positive expansion of religious education in our schools , ” said hans-jürgen pokall of berlin 's education , science and research administration .
" the initial problems we experienced , which had more to do with the way some teachers interacted with the students than the actual content of the courses , have subsided , " he said .
berlin ’ s islamic federation expects that the demand for school teachers with qualifications in islamic religious instruction will grow as more and more parents request courses for their children .
it is also calling for long-term planning to meet the demand .
the university of münster , for example , was quick to react to the trend and has been training specialist teachers since 2005 .
other institutes , such as the university of osnabrück , are already following suit . sabine ripperger -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de many see progress at berlin islam talks , but differences remain the german government attempted to reach out to the country 's more than three million muslims on wednesday but faced criticism from a muslim leader for organizing " aimless " talks .
-lrb- 02.05.2007 -rrb- female imams in german mosques get a mixed reception turkey 's religious council has already sent 13 women to germany to serve in mosques .
there have been requests for more , even if some reject teaching from a woman .
-lrb- 07.10.2006 -rrb- mosque on wheels takes islam to the german streets this summer , a group of muslims is touring germany with a mosque on wheels .
they hope their ' ' rolling mosque " will help change german public opinion , which often associates islam and muslims with terror and fanaticism .

the environmental protection group greenpeace saturday published a leaked document showing that the united states had raised serious new objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by the german hosts .
it looked to observers as though us objections in the form of amendments had drained the substance from the german statement .
" the united states still has serious , fundamental concerns about this draft statement , " the document stated .
washington rejects the idea of setting mandatory emissions targets , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel 's proposed climate statement calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
" the treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses multiple ' red lines ' in terms of what we simply can not agree to , " the us document said .

clapp added that " at this point we do n't see signs that the -lrb- bush -rrb- administration will change its position ... and as a matter of fact the signs go in exactly the opposite direction . "

" i injected him once with epo in the arm , " said d 'hont .
" it lasted around 10 seconds .
it was as if i was injecting some insulin into someone who was ill . "
it is the first time that d 'hont has revealed who in the telekom team he administered drugs to .
ullrich has been under suspicion of doping since being implicated , along with dozens of other riders , in the spanish doping investigation dubbed ' operation puerto ' which has engulfed the sport since may 2006 .
the 33-year-old german has always denied being involved in the affair , which was uncovered by police in spain and led to the arrest of spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes after doping products and bags of blood were found on his premises .
after months of denials italy 's ivan basso , the tour of italy champion , has recently admitted he worked with fuentes .
the 31-year-old stopped short of saying he actually doped , but is facing a 21-month ban from the italian olympic committee -lrb- coni -rrb- .
germany 's fallen cycling idol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich ended his controversial career after the allegations since being suspended from last year 's tour de france ullrich has retired from the sport , although existing suspicion has heightened in the wake of some stunning confessions from ullrich 's former team-mates this week .
denmark 's bjarne riis , the 1996 tour de france winner , admitted on friday he had used epo while at telekom , who also won the race in 1997 thanks to ullrich .
several of riis 's former telekom teammates , including top sprinter erik zabel of germany , rolf aldag , bert dietz , christian henn and udo boelts , have also admitting using the drug .
the drama provided by the series of stunning confessions took another twist saturday when a doctor employed by several sports federations in germany admitted supplying drugs to amateur cyclists between 1980 and 1990 .
georg huber , a top physician at the university of freiberg clinic , was immediately suspended from his post by the german cycling federation -lrb- bdr -rrb- after admitting to the offences .
huber said he had given the banned male sex hormone testosterone to amateur riders during 1980-1990 , according to a statement by the university clinic of freiberg - considered germany 's top sports medicine facility .
cycling 's wake-up call or death knell ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zabel begged forgiveness for his use of doping the bombshells dropped this week by zabel and riis - two of the german outfits former high profile stars - are being seen as a positive development as cycling fights to rebuild its image .
international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- president pat mcquaid said saturday : " the confessions from germany and denmark show that people are now ready to speak out .
this is extremely positive .
" the law of silence no longer applies - each person must now assume the full consequences of their actions . "
more than eight years on , riis and the other repentants can not now be sanctioned , although the 43-year-old dane is ready to hand back his yellow jersey from his 1996 victory .
the uci and tour de france officials feel it would be a symbolic gesture that would help put the sport on a more sound footing .
it now remains to be seen if the latest claims against ullrich , one of the tour de france 's main protagonists over the past decade , lead to a similar scenario .
d 'hont claimed that ullrich was only following other riders in taking epo , and he urged the german to follow his former team-mates in confessing .
" he did the same as all the others .
it would be good for him to speak out and get things out into the open , it would liberate him , " added d 'hont , who nonetheless could not hide his admiration for the 2000 olympic champion who finished a runner-up five time on the tour .
" if everyone was clean , ullrich would have won the tour de france at least 10 times .

the two leaders had been locked in a long-running battle over the legality of early parliamentary elections that had been called by yushchenko , and moves by yanukovich 's coalition to dominate parliament .
the dispute degenerated further this week after yushchenko fired a prosecutor general supported by yanukovich , who in turn had loyal police break in and escort the prosecutor general back to his office building , brawling with pro-yushchenko security guards in the process .
it was the first outbreak violence between organized units of competing branches of the country 's government , since ukraine 's 1991 independence .
troop build-up disperses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops loyal to the president massed outside kiev yushchenko ordered all state buildings in the capital secured and some 2,000 troops were en route to kiev saturday , but the forces were held up outside the city by police loyal to yanukovich .
observers feared a possible assault on the prosecutor general 's office , and uniformed police were unloading steel barriers at the building late saturday evening .
troop columns were returning to bases on sunday , as were pro-yanukovich police at the prosecutor general 's office building .
kiev 's streets barely registered the conflict , with vehicle and pedestrian traffic moving normally under clear skies .
the grounds around the prosecutor general office often resembled a vacation park more than a protest epicentre , with demonstrators and riot police alike seen relaxing , drinking water , sitting on benches , and unbuttoning exterior clothing in the face of unseasonably hot temperatures exceeding 33 degrees in the shade .
the two sides announced a deal was reached after marathon talks ending at around 3 am in kiev .
process for new elections to begin soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko made concessions to ease the crisis parliament will meet for a special session on may 29 and 30 to go through the procedure of setting new elections .
a " special mechanism " in the form of a joint council will oversee legal changes , yushchenko said .
the two sides also agreed that the country 's security forces would not be misused in the dispute .
parliamentary speaker alexander moroz , and opposition leader julia timoshenko joined in the talks , but timoshenko was not named as a participant in the compromise agreement .
the compromise deal conceded yushchenko 's right to call elections , but also pushed the date of the vote beyond the end of summer , a condition yushchenko earlier had described as unacceptable .
" we need to avoid repeating past mistakes , " yanukovich said .
other terms listed in a joint statement included changes in the membership of the central election committee , law making illegal judicial participation in political disputes and an overhaul in national voter rolls .
hope that this truce will hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two viktor 's have never seen eye-to-eye for long it was not the first time this week that yushchenko and yanukovich announced they had resolved the crisis , but the first time a concrete date for elections was set .
the pair in a joint announcement declared their agreement on constitutional amendments would be necessary , to prevent a repeat crisis .
moroz called the deal " not an ideal solution , but the best possible under the circumstances . "
yushchenko identified the inability of the constitutional court , prosecutors and the central election committee to do their jobs in the face of a conflict between the executive and legislative branches as the root of the problem .
" these institutions must be free of political influence , " he said .
" most likely , we will have to find answers in a new constitution . "
ukraine 's last constitution was signed into law in 2006 .
in a possible sign of real willingness to compromise , both yushchenko and yanukovich said they would appear in public together to attend the national cup match of the ukrainian professional soccer league , pitting dynamo kiev against shakhtar donetsk .
enthusiasm for the sport of football is in ukraine one of the few areas the country 's feuding political clans find common ground .
however , yushchenko is a lifetime dynamo supporter , while yanukovich is a shakhtar fan . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de troops loyal to yushchenko attempt to enter kiev as talks stall troops loyal to ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko tried to enter the capital kiev saturday , the interior ministry said , as crisis talks between the feuding president and prime minister were delayed .

" i injected him once with epo in the arm , " said d 'hont .
" it lasted around 10 seconds .
it was as if i was injecting some insulin into someone who was ill . "
it is the first time that d 'hont has revealed who in the telekom team he administered drugs to .
ullrich has been under suspicion of doping since being implicated , along with dozens of other riders , in the spanish doping investigation dubbed ' operation puerto ' which has engulfed the sport since may 2006 .
the 33-year-old german has always denied being involved in the affair , which was uncovered by police in spain and led to the arrest of spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes after doping products and bags of blood were found on his premises .
after months of denials italy 's ivan basso , the tour of italy champion , has recently admitted he worked with fuentes .
the 31-year-old stopped short of saying he actually doped , but is facing a 21-month ban from the italian olympic committee -lrb- coni -rrb- .

denmark 's bjarne riis , the 1996 tour de france winner , admitted on friday he had used epo while at telekom , who also won the race in 1997 thanks to ullrich .
several of riis 's former telekom teammates , including top sprinter erik zabel of germany , rolf aldag , bert dietz , christian henn and udo boelts , have also admitting using the drug .
the drama provided by the series of stunning confessions took another twist saturday when a doctor employed by several sports federations in germany admitted supplying drugs to amateur cyclists between 1980 and 1990 .
georg huber , a top physician at the university of freiberg clinic , was immediately suspended from his post by the german cycling federation -lrb- bdr -rrb- after admitting to the offences .
huber said he had given the banned male sex hormone testosterone to amateur riders during 1980-1990 , according to a statement by the university clinic of freiberg - considered germany 's top sports medicine facility .

it would be good for him to speak out and get things out into the open , it would liberate him , " added d 'hont , who nonetheless could not hide his admiration for the 2000 olympic champion who finished a runner-up five time on the tour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 27.05.2007 us on collision course with g8 partners over climate agreement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us objects to the germany-proposed climate agreement on many levels the prospect looms of a major clash between the united states and its g8 partners over global warming , with washington 's view threatening to block agreement at next month 's summit of the leading industrial nations . german environment minister sigmar gabriel saturday criticised the us climate policy in a newspaper interview , saying it " was going to difficult to achieve success " at the june 6-8 session hosted by chancellor angela merkel , who has made climate change a priority during germany 's presidency of the group of eight .
the environmental protection group greenpeace saturday published a leaked document showing that the united states had raised serious new objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by the german hosts .
it looked to observers as though us objections in the form of amendments had drained the substance from the german statement .
" the united states still has serious , fundamental concerns about this draft statement , " the document stated .
washington rejects the idea of setting mandatory emissions targets , as well as language calling for g8 nations to raise overall energy efficiencies by 20 percent by 2020 .
merkel 's proposed climate statement calls for limiting the worldwide temperature rise this century to 3.6 degrees fahrenheit and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
" the treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses multiple ' red lines ' in terms of what we simply can not agree to , " the us document said .
sources close to negotiations told afp the us amendments seek to remove any idea of an urgent problem of climate change requiring a firm international response .
us rejects climate change as an ' urgent problem ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us denies the scientific evidence is conclusive " the preliminary sessions clearly indicate the american desire to minimalise -lrb- the draft -rrb- , " said one european diplomatic source .
the us was refusing to take account of findings by an intergovernmental group of experts on climate change , whose latest conclusions have been used by the germans in their draft climate statement , the source said .
" i ca n't remember any major international climate meeting with that kind of complete divergence of views , " said phil clapp , head of the national environment trust in washington .
" there is a fundamental disagreement between the eu and the bush administration positions .
it 's hard to see how governments could sign the sort of statement that washington wants . "
clapp added that " at this point we do n't see signs that the -lrb- bush -rrb- administration will change its position ... and as a matter of fact the signs go in exactly the opposite direction . "
in washington , white house spokeswoman dana perino played down the document leaked by greenpeace while acknowledging differences .
" we believe that there are many different approaches to climate change , " she said .
" by no means is there a final document . "
washington does not recognise the un convention on climate change as an appropriate forum for multilateral negotiations on global warming , but only as one of several possible forums .
kyoto successor also in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a follow-up climate protocol to kyoto could also be in danger this also does not augur well for a conference scheduled in bali in december at which states signatory to the convention will have to negotiate a follow-up to the kyoto protocol on climate change which runs out in 2012 .
the us has not signed the protocol .
" these latest proposals display a complete absence of reconciliation between the american technological approach and that of the eu ... " said the diplomatic source .
" and all this despite appeals by major american companies and republican party personalities like arnold schwarzenegger . "
on may 18 , senior us lawmakers wrote to bush expressing deep concern over reports that his administration was seeking to weaken a g8 declaration on climate change .
" us leadership is critical to tackling this global threat .
but we need an executive branch that engages the rest of the world to solve this problem rather than stubbornly ignoring it , " the 15 heads of congressional committees wrote in a letter . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : us rejects germany 's g8 climate declaration the united states has raised new serious objections to a proposed global warming declaration prepared by germany for next month 's group of eight summit , the washington post reported saturday .
-lrb- 26.05.2007 -rrb- merkel sets g8 agenda , doubts concrete results climate change , development aid and hedge-fund transparency would top the agenda at the g8 summit on june 6-8 , said chancellor angela merkel thursday , but she was n't confident that much progress would be made .
-lrb- 24.05.2007 -rrb- " we are taxing the lives of future generations " jakob von uexküll founded the world future council to provide a voice for future generations on topics like climate change , poverty and fair trade .
people are waiting for integrated answers to global crises , he told dw .
-lrb- 10.05.2007 -rrb- eu leads clamor for carbon cuts after un climate report europe led demands for a deal to slash global greenhouse gas emissions after the un 's top scientific panel said early , deep cuts could avert the worst of long-term climate damage - and at a modest cost .

" the law of silence no longer applies - each person must now assume the full consequences of their actions . "
more than eight years on , riis and the other repentants can not now be sanctioned , although the 43-year-old dane is ready to hand back his yellow jersey from his 1996 victory .
the uci and tour de france officials feel it would be a symbolic gesture that would help put the sport on a more sound footing .
it now remains to be seen if the latest claims against ullrich , one of the tour de france 's main protagonists over the past decade , lead to a similar scenario .
d 'hont claimed that ullrich was only following other riders in taking epo , and he urged the german to follow his former team-mates in confessing .
" he did the same as all the others .
it would be good for him to speak out and get things out into the open , it would liberate him , " added d 'hont , who nonetheless could not hide his admiration for the 2000 olympic champion who finished a runner-up five time on the tour .
" if everyone was clean , ullrich would have won the tour de france at least 10 times . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more confessions as merkel urges doping cyclists to come clean german chancellor angela merkel has urged all cyclists involved in doping to own up and come clean as more confessions from top stars pile up in what is becoming the sport 's biggest ever scandal .

speaking at a labour party hustings meeting in bristol , the chancellor said the handling of the war had been a divisive issue for the nation .
he said the government and others had fallen short when it came to rebuilding iraq 's economy after the war .
education debate speaking later at the hay festival , in mid wales , he said he took " collective responsibility " for the decision to go to war with iraq and reiterated that it had " clearly divided the country . "
saturday 's hustings with trade unionists also saw debate about proposals by mr johnson , the education secretary , for private schools to lend teachers to state schools and share other facilities .
mr johnson said independent schools in england and wales should do more to justify their charitable status .
but fellow labour candidate jon cruddas said private schools should lose their charitable status entirely .
candidates also demanded an expansion in council house provision after trade minister margaret hodge argued british people should be given priority over migrants .
when asked to pick his favourite deputy leadership candidate , mr brown said : " they are all good candidates .
they are all excellent .
it 's up to the labour party to make that decision . "
vote allocation ordinary party members have a third of the vote in next month 's election .
another third go to around three million members of unions and other affiliated bodies and the rest are controlled by the party 's mps and meps .
the winner will be announced at a special labour conference in manchester on sunday 24 june .
the candidates are to appear in a live television debate on newsnight on bbc two on tuesday .

the agreement follows a mounting stand-off between president viktor yushchenko , a pro-western liberal , and prime minister viktor yanukovych , whose supporters favour closer ties with russia .
here we examine the background to the crisis .
will elections solve the crisis ?
supporters of the president and prime minister certainly say so , as they turn their attention to gearing up for the election itself .
but parliament still needs to approve the election timetable , and there are plenty of other grounds for disagreement .
some analysts say the two rivals ' differences underline deeper splits in the country , which even elections may not be able to resolve .
what triggered the latest war of words ?
president yushchenko decided to dismiss the prosecutor general , svyatoslav piskun , an ally of the prime minister .
that led to a dramatic storming of the prosecutor general 's office on 24 may by riot police and interior minister vasyl tsushko , who claimed the president was usurping power .
president yushchenko hit back by placing the 40,000 interior ministry troops under his direct command .
prime minister yanukovych then condemned his action , saying it violated the constitution .
the interior ministry said it would defy the president 's order .
what are the longer-term causes ?
president yushchenko dissolved parliament on 2 april and called early elections .
tensions have been running high since then , with mr yanukovych and his allies disputing the president 's authority to do so .
at one stage , the two leaders announced they had reached a compromise - but mps who stand to lose from early elections said they would not support it .
so the political system has been paralysed by arguments over who has authority to do what .
ukraine 's constitution provides for a presidential political system , but successive legislation has transferred many powers to the prime minister and parliament .
this has led to a legal quagmire , with electoral law , the constitution and parliamentary standing orders contradicting each other .
mr yanukovych has built a majority in parliament , with the help of communists and socialists .
but mr yushchenko has accused him of poaching parliamentary deputies from other blocs , in violation of the constitution .
he says the constitution only allows whole parliamentary blocs to change sides , not individuals .
mr yanukovych currently controls about 250 seats in parliament .
if he were to reach 300 , he could reject presidential vetoes , vote through changes to the constitution , and impeach the president .
has the president the power to dissolve parliament ?
the constitution lists three situations in which the president has the right to dissolve parliament , and the poaching of deputies is not among them .
on the other hand , it does say presidential decrees must be fulfilled .
constitutional reforms carried out as a result of the orange revolution weakened the president and strengthened parliament - but mr yushchenko and mr yanukovych have clashed over the details .
so who will win the elections ?
key dates 21 nov 04 yanukovych declared winner of presidential election - protests begin 3 dec 04 election annulled 11 jan 05 yushchenko declared winner of re-run election 8 sep 05 yushchenko sacks tymoshenko government 26 mar 06 yanukovych party wins most votes in general election 3 aug 06 after four-month deadlock , yushchenko agrees yanukovych can be pm 2 apr 07 yushchenko issues decree dissolving parliament it is quite possible that mr yanukovych 's party will be returned again as the largest party , in which case little would have changed .
the only other leader with a chance of leading a parliamentary majority after the election is mr yushchenko 's orange revolution ally , yulia tymoshenko .
she and mr yushchenko fell out when he sacked her as prime minister in september 2005 .
they are now on the same side again , but it is not clear how strong the relationship is .
can the constitutional court resolve the problem ?
in theory , yes .
one of the encouraging things about this crisis is that both sides justify their actions in terms of the law and the constitution , so they ought to obey court rulings .
on the other hand , both sides have already made appeals to the court over the last eight months , and the court has yet to rule on a single case .
so the court may not provide a quick way out .
could the political course once again be determined by mass protests ?
this seems unlikely .
mass street protests occurred in 2004 , as a result of years of frustration bottled up during the presidency of leonid kuchma .
as the protests gathered strength , euphoria swept through the pro-western part of the population that was most hungry for change .
these same people are now mostly deeply disillusioned by the last two years of political compromises and internal bickering .
mr yanukovych 's supporters are hampered by the fact that their power base is in the east of the country rather than in the capital , kiev .
could the country split ?
this is always a worry in ukraine when politicians seen as pro-western -lrb- mr yushchenko -rrb- and pro-russian -lrb- mr yanukovych -rrb- are in conflict with one another .
it is broadly true that the west of the country is pro-european and the east is pro-russian .
however , mr yanukovych has not been militantly pro-russian as prime minister .
he even intervened to stop regions in the east of the country unilaterally introducing russian as a second state language - even though upgrading the status of the russian language was one of his manifesto pledges .
does this crisis matter to the wider world ?
any kind of armed conflict in ukraine would bring with it the risk of a russian intervention , which would cause major east-west tensions .
a long-running political stand-off could paralyse the country , but would probably not have many repercussions overseas .
russia was unhappy about what it regarded as western interference in the orange revolution , and the west was critical of russia 's open support for mr yanukovych , but relations were not seriously affected .
the main pipeline delivering russian gas to europe passes through ukraine , but there would not appear to be any threat to supplies at present .

the agreement follows a mounting stand-off between president viktor yushchenko , a pro-western liberal , and prime minister viktor yanukovych , whose supporters favour closer ties with russia .
here we examine the background to the crisis .
will elections solve the crisis ?
supporters of the president and prime minister certainly say so , as they turn their attention to gearing up for the election itself .
but parliament still needs to approve the election timetable , and there are plenty of other grounds for disagreement .
some analysts say the two rivals ' differences underline deeper splits in the country , which even elections may not be able to resolve .
what triggered the latest war of words ?
president yushchenko decided to dismiss the prosecutor general , svyatoslav piskun , an ally of the prime minister .
that led to a dramatic storming of the prosecutor general 's office on 24 may by riot police and interior minister vasyl tsushko , who claimed the president was usurping power .
president yushchenko hit back by placing the 40,000 interior ministry troops under his direct command .
prime minister yanukovych then condemned his action , saying it violated the constitution .
the interior ministry said it would defy the president 's order .
what are the longer-term causes ?
president yushchenko dissolved parliament on 2 april and called early elections .
tensions have been running high since then , with mr yanukovych and his allies disputing the president 's authority to do so .
at one stage , the two leaders announced they had reached a compromise - but mps who stand to lose from early elections said they would not support it .
so the political system has been paralysed by arguments over who has authority to do what .
ukraine 's constitution provides for a presidential political system , but successive legislation has transferred many powers to the prime minister and parliament .
this has led to a legal quagmire , with electoral law , the constitution and parliamentary standing orders contradicting each other .
mr yanukovych has built a majority in parliament , with the help of communists and socialists .
but mr yushchenko has accused him of poaching parliamentary deputies from other blocs , in violation of the constitution .
he says the constitution only allows whole parliamentary blocs to change sides , not individuals .
mr yanukovych currently controls about 250 seats in parliament .
if he were to reach 300 , he could reject presidential vetoes , vote through changes to the constitution , and impeach the president .
has the president the power to dissolve parliament ?
the constitution lists three situations in which the president has the right to dissolve parliament , and the poaching of deputies is not among them .
on the other hand , it does say presidential decrees must be fulfilled .
constitutional reforms carried out as a result of the orange revolution weakened the president and strengthened parliament - but mr yushchenko and mr yanukovych have clashed over the details .
so who will win the elections ?
key dates 21 nov 04 yanukovych declared winner of presidential election - protests begin 3 dec 04 election annulled 11 jan 05 yushchenko declared winner of re-run election 8 sep 05 yushchenko sacks tymoshenko government 26 mar 06 yanukovych party wins most votes in general election 3 aug 06 after four-month deadlock , yushchenko agrees yanukovych can be pm 2 apr 07 yushchenko issues decree dissolving parliament it is quite possible that mr yanukovych 's party will be returned again as the largest party , in which case little would have changed .
the only other leader with a chance of leading a parliamentary majority after the election is mr yushchenko 's orange revolution ally , yulia tymoshenko .
she and mr yushchenko fell out when he sacked her as prime minister in september 2005 .
they are now on the same side again , but it is not clear how strong the relationship is .
can the constitutional court resolve the problem ?
in theory , yes .
one of the encouraging things about this crisis is that both sides justify their actions in terms of the law and the constitution , so they ought to obey court rulings .
on the other hand , both sides have already made appeals to the court over the last eight months , and the court has yet to rule on a single case .
so the court may not provide a quick way out .
could the political course once again be determined by mass protests ?
this seems unlikely .
mass street protests occurred in 2004 , as a result of years of frustration bottled up during the presidency of leonid kuchma .
as the protests gathered strength , euphoria swept through the pro-western part of the population that was most hungry for change .
these same people are now mostly deeply disillusioned by the last two years of political compromises and internal bickering .
mr yanukovych 's supporters are hampered by the fact that their power base is in the east of the country rather than in the capital , kiev .
could the country split ?
this is always a worry in ukraine when politicians seen as pro-western -lrb- mr yushchenko -rrb- and pro-russian -lrb- mr yanukovych -rrb- are in conflict with one another .
it is broadly true that the west of the country is pro-european and the east is pro-russian .
however , mr yanukovych has not been militantly pro-russian as prime minister .
he even intervened to stop regions in the east of the country unilaterally introducing russian as a second state language - even though upgrading the status of the russian language was one of his manifesto pledges .
does this crisis matter to the wider world ?
any kind of armed conflict in ukraine would bring with it the risk of a russian intervention , which would cause major east-west tensions .
a long-running political stand-off could paralyse the country , but would probably not have many repercussions overseas .
russia was unhappy about what it regarded as western interference in the orange revolution , and the west was critical of russia 's open support for mr yanukovych , but relations were not seriously affected .

the company said new clean-coal technology could lead it to exploit the vast reserves of coal in scotland .
scottish coal said it had identified a site in the west of scotland which could supply longannet power station in fife for at least 80 years .
but it does not want to develop mines if they do not have a long-term future .
scotland 's last underground mine closed in 2002 .
since then all coal mined in scotland has been from open-cast sites .
clean coal technology means deep coal , which has a high sulphur content and would normally create too much pollution , can once again be used in scottish power plants .
energy supply on thursday , scottish power said scotland 's two coal-fired power stations could be converted to clean coal technology .
it said the scheme would cut carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions at the two stations by a fifth .
first minister alex salmond met company bosses at longannet to discuss the plans .
he said : " if we can reduce carbon emissions , coal can play a vital role in giving scotland the diversity of energy sources which is essential for security of energy supply . "
mr salmond 's visit came the day after the government at westminster unveiled its energy white paper .
it backed renewable energy and efficiency measures - but said the " preliminary view " supported more nuclear plants .
however , building new nuclear power plants in scotland has been ruled out by the scottish executive .

the company said new clean-coal technology could lead it to exploit the vast reserves of coal in scotland .
scottish coal said it had identified a site in the west of scotland which could supply longannet power station in fife for at least 80 years .
but it does not want to develop mines if they do not have a long-term future .
scotland 's last underground mine closed in 2002 .
since then all coal mined in scotland has been from open-cast sites .
clean coal technology means deep coal , which has a high sulphur content and would normally create too much pollution , can once again be used in scottish power plants .
energy supply on thursday , scottish power said scotland 's two coal-fired power stations could be converted to clean coal technology .
it said the scheme would cut carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions at the two stations by a fifth .
first minister alex salmond met company bosses at longannet to discuss the plans .
he said : " if we can reduce carbon emissions , coal can play a vital role in giving scotland the diversity of energy sources which is essential for security of energy supply . "
mr salmond 's visit came the day after the government at westminster unveiled its energy white paper .
it backed renewable energy and efficiency measures - but said the " preliminary view " supported more nuclear plants .
however , building new nuclear power plants in scotland has been ruled out by the scottish executive .

christie 's is expecting record prices on some modern chinese paintings and imperial ceramics .
the booming art market in asia and particularly the growing interest of chinese buyers is fuelling the buying spree .
but china 's art boom is driven as much by investment goals as by a real interest in the art .
the works of art might be beautiful but the prices are awe-inspiring .
we are expecting tremendous potential growth in the chinese market ken yeh , christie 's reserve prices on a few of the top lots at this year 's auction range between $ 2m -lrb- £ 1m -rrb- and $ 5m .
modern twentieth century paintings usually draw the highest prices , but hundreds of thousands of dollars are expected for calligraphy and even for a korean mixed media and video installation .
bids of at least $ 4m are expected for a pair of fine peach bowls to be sold in the sale .
' tremendous growth ' ken yeh , deputy chairman of christie 's in asia , says hong kong is now the third most important art sales centre in the world after new york and london .
" we are expecting tremendous potential growth in the chinese market , " he said .
" because as the chinese economy is growing , when you have extra disposable income , the first thing they buy is what they feel comfortable with , and that 's chinese art . "
these two peach bowls are expected to fetch around $ 4m so heated is the art market that some critics have described it as an investment bubble , which could collapse as quickly as it began .
ken yeh disagrees .
" i do n't see it that way because actually the people who buy chinese contemporary are not really mainland chinese , " he says .
" actually it 's globally - you have europeans coming in , you have americans coming in , obviously you also have people from taiwan , from hong kong , from south east asia . "
" i do n't see there 's a bubble there , i think -lsb- the -rsb- market will continue growing , maybe at some point there 's some correction but i do n't think there 's a bubble . "
' flashy rubbish ' aside from the classical and modern chinese and asian art on sale , the last day of the auction will be focused on the more established rich buyers from hong kong and south east asia .
what they want is wearable art that their peers can admire and envy .
rare watches and exquisite jewels will also fetch millions of dollars .
flashy rubbish is how some established art dealers describe the more speculative art purchases .
some galleries in hong kong are pandering to the new-found greed for chinese painting by selling works which follow a formula of bright colours , wide faces , and references to the cultural revolution and sex .
but the fashion , fuelled by the growing world-class auction business , is also helping to send more money to struggling artists .

dr kaveh manavi , a consultant in hiv medicine at birmingham 's selly oak hospital , told the bbc everyone should be tested unless they opted out .
he said the current system , which targets high-risk groups , such as gay men and drug users , missed many people .
hiv charity the terrence higgins trust says targeted testing by gps and clinics would be more cost effective .
late diagnosis dr manavi told bbc radio five live the current testing system failed to pick up many adults outside the key targeted groups who were at risk of infection .
he said studies suggested a fourth of patients infected with hiv were diagnosed late and that the target-based hiv tests were not tackling these figures .
" target-based hiv tests - offering the test to intravenous drug users and gay men - is not going to work because individuals may not identify themselves as a risk , " he said .
the sooner an individual is diagnosed with hiv , the higher their likelihood of a better prognosis dr kaveh manavi " all the current data suggests a large proportion of patients , in the uk at least , are heterosexual , so we will miss a proportion of hiv-infected patients . "
dr manavi wants to see wider screening so that more patients are diagnosed early .
they could then be offered better treatment as well as given the option of altering their behaviour to cut the risk of passing on the virus , he said .
' better prognosis ' such widespread screening is already carried out on pregnant women who are routinely checked to reduce the risk of passing on the virus to their babies .
" early diagnosis of hiv has got advantages for patients , " said dr manavi .
" it will prevent them from developing aids and it will prevent them from transmitting infection to other individuals . "
he added : " the sooner an individual is diagnosed with hiv , the higher their likelihood of a better prognosis . "
but the terrence higgins trust , said that rather than blanket-testing , it would be much more useful if gps and family planning clinics conducted the tests because they had a " better idea of whether their patients are sexually active " .
lisa power , the charity 's head of policy , said : " we do n't disagree with this doctor about the need to better diagnose hiv .
" we 're just questioning whether blanket testing in accident and emergency would be the best way of spending the limited amount of money that the nhs has . "
one person in three who are hiv do not know they have the virus while others who have been at risk refuse a test because of the stigma associated with the virus , said ms power .
she said ways other than blanket-testing needed to be found to tackle these issues .
have your say as long as it 's not intrusive .
when i give blood i have an hiv check .
ca n't be a bad thing can it ?
iain murray , poole send us your comments a department of health spokeswoman said it was committed to reducing the number of hiv cases , particularly in high-risk groups , " through screening , more frequent testing and targeted campaigns " .
" reducing undiagnosed hiv is a priority of the department of health which is why genito-urinary medicine clinics offer all first-time attendees an hiv test with follow-up testing for those in high-risk groups , " she said .
she also pointed out that the " vast majority " of hiv infections found in the uk are in gay and bisexual men and amongst african communities .
