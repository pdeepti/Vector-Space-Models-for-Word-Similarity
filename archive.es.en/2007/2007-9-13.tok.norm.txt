it 's survival is threatened since russia decided to pull out . speaking in the german parliament on wednesday , sept .
12 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that germany could not permit the treaty , which is aimed at limiting conventional arms and was developed over a long period of time , to be dissolved .
" i will be just as annoyed as you if this treaty is suspended , " steinmeier told lawmakers , adding that the conference in berlin would try to " rebuild lost trust . "
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 and updated in 1999 .
it limits the number of tanks , artillery , aircraft and helicopters stationed in europe .
russia announced in july that it no longer considered the treaty effective .
moscow said that the failure of nato countries to ratify the latest version of the treaty was the main reason for the decision .
but russian officials also said that a us plan to station parts of a new missile defense system in central european countries also played a role , reuters news service reported .
they consider the system a threat to russia 's national security .
nato members , meanwhile , have said that they will not ratify the latest cfe treaty version until russia withdraws its troops from the former soviet republics of moldova and georgia , which moscow promised to do in 1999 when the treaty was signed . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the faithful believe those who discover the holy spirit will lead transformed lives and that sickness and misfortune can only befall heathens . the success of the pentecostal churches lies with the belief in a god who fights the evil of pandemic disease , according to erhard kamphausen , head of the academy of missions at the university of hamburg .

" africans believe in miracles and witchcraft . " german crusader in africa reaches millions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german evangelist reinhard bonnke has led crusades for decades in africa they are n't alone .
german evangelist reinhard bonnke , who is known for his gospel crusades in nigeria , had an epiphany at the age of 9 and decided to devote his life to god . bonnke has held sermons in africa for nearly 30 years , and one of these massive mega-events was attended by 1.6 million followers .
earlier this year , another event was broadcast live on " god tv " by 200 countries , reaching an even broader audience and establishing his reputation as " undoubtedly the most successful missionary of our times . " the web site of the evangelist 's bible association " christ for all nations " sells books and other promotional material on supernatural intervention and miracle cures in seven languages .

shortly afterwards , some armed robbers stormed the restaurant and those in the first queue were injured , but hondeh was unharmed . " i believe it was god 's will , " she said . a few weeks before the pastor had reminded her congregation that god 's blessing was not guaranteed every year . " he said we had to pray twice as hard and double our donation to the church , " hondeh said .
" i quadrupled my contribution to the collection plate every sunday .

its german head is returning home just months after his appointment . jaap de hoop scheffer is set to ask germany on thursday , sept .
13 , for police trainers to be deployed in southern afghanistan where alliance forces are dealing with an upsurge in violence and suicide bomb attacks by the taliban , al qaeda and local warlords .
the request comes at a time when the eu 's special police training mission is also hampered by complaints of inadequate eu planning and insufficient nato security support .
german head of eu mission to quit this week , the german interior ministry confirmed that brigadier general friedrich eichele is returning to germany just months after he was appointed to head the eu training mission in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich eichele is returning home to germany eichele , a former commander of the german federal police 's elite gsg 9 counter-terrorism unit , is said to be returning to oversee reforms of the domestic police force .
but , according to german newsmagazine der spiegel , tensions with the eu 's special envoy to afghanistan , francesc vendrell , are the actual reasons behind eichele 's early exit .
vendrell reportedly wanted political control of the mission , something that eichele opposed .
the german embassy in kabul described eichele as simply " overburdened , " the magazine said .
mission plagued by trouble eichele 's early departure reflects the difficulties in trying to establish the mission of 190 european trainers in afghanistan at a time when an increase in violence and suicide attacks by the taliban and al qaeda has raised pressure on isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- countries to scale down their afghan troop presence .
last month , three german police officers responsible for protecting the german ambassador to afghanistan died and a fourth was injured when their vehicles were blown up on a road to the east of kabul .
germany has some 3,000 troops stationed in afghanistan , mostly in the relatively stable north of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf soldiers investigate the scene of an explosion that killed three german police officers until a few months ago , germany was considered to be leading the way in training afghan police and border guards .
it was in charge of the police training from 2002 until this year .
that was one of the reasons why , when the eu took over the mission in june , the top post remained in german hands .
like germany , several eu members , some of whom are also part of nato , have police and military working in afghanistan under separate civil and military mandates .
trainers , incentives missing but in recent months , the training mission has faltered , with critics saying it 's been underfunded , understaffed and poorly prepared .
the european commission has still not approved the budget for armored cars , computers and office equipment for the mission headquarters in kabul , according to news reports .
in addition , the mission has gotten off to a slow start , with reports saying not enough european police trainers or afghan participants have turned up .
some 90 trainers were expected to come from 21 nations , but eu member states have so far provided only half the personnel .
germany has promised up to 60 officials but still has n't delivered on its promise .
der spiegel reported last month that officials have not resolved how to keep newly trained afghan police officers and soldiers from joining the taliban , local militia leaders or drug barons , all of whom offer better pay than the government in kabul .
eu ill prepared , poor nato security ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the eu 's efforts to train the afghan army and police are falling short the mission has also been hampered by nato-member turkey 's blocking of an agreement to regulate cooperation between the alliance and the eu in afghanistan .
turkey has tried to curb military cooperation between the two because the european union has refused to guarantee cypriot officers would not participate .
but nato spokesman james appathurai denied suggestions that nato support for the eu police trainers was inadequate .
" nato has been providing support to the european police in afghanistan , and we can not imagine that nato will provide any less support to the eu police than it does to other organizations such as the united nations , " he said .
on wednesday , nato 's top civilian official in afghanistan , daan everts , said the eu is still not fully contributing to international efforts to bring peace and the rule of law to afghanistan , with incompetence and corruption rife among local afghan forces . " that has to be addressed in a more concerted and forceful manner , " everts said during a news conference .
other observers questioned whether the eu was properly prepared to coordinate operations so far away from its national borders .
" it seems that the eu was not really properly prepared for such a complex mission , " ronja kempin , an afghanistan expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told the international herald tribune this week .
" the eu seemed to have rushed into setting up this mission , " kempin said , adding that massive corruption in the afghan interior ministry compounded the troubles . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we will maintain the predominance of our military presence in the north , and regarding the specific tasks , we will focus on training the afghan army , " steinmeier told reporters after meeting de hoop scheffer . the german army 's afghanistan mandates prevent it from being used in the south , where military casualties are higher .
there has been pressure on germany to lift this restriction , particularly to allow military instructors to accompany the afghan troops they have trained . germany has also sent six reconnaissance tornado jets to afghanistan to assist isaf operations throughout the country .

he is also deputy head of the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- core values commission .
dw-world.de : membership of germany 's mainstream parties has been steadily dwindling .
if this trend continues , does it mean their days are numbered ?
thomas meyer : membership is on the decline , so in this respect the role of the mainstream parties is changing .
more parties are needed in order to form government coalitions , and there are more parties in the party system , which inevitably means the system is changing .
does that the fact that the mainstream parties are shrinking mean that the state has a more limited power to act ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's two-party administration is nothing compared to other coalitions no , not directly .
many countries have stable democracies despite having many more parties .
government coalitions might need four or five parties .
the process of forming a coalition might be trickier , but it by no means weakens the state .
the social democrats are suffering the sharpest decline in membership .
why is this ?
right now , the spd 's role is an especially difficult one .
the party is trapped between a christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- which has shifted to the left and appears to be adopting some of the social democrats ' traditional positions , and the new left party which is occupying what used to be the social democrats ' far-left ground .
sandwiched between these two poles , the party is having trouble maintaining its identity and remaining on the offensive .
to what extent is the left party responsible for the crisis within the spd ?
the left party is , to some extent , an expression of this crisis .
it is partly made up of left-wing party members whom the spd was unable to integrate into its policies and political style .
its founding is definitely one of the factors contributing to the spd 's crisis .
are lafontaine and co . -lsb- former spd members who left to establish an alternative party , the left -rsb- luring voters away from the spd ?
definitely , to some extent .
if the left party attracts ten percent of voters then a large part , if not the majority of these voters , are bound to be disappointed spd voters .
on the whole , the left party stands for traditional spd positions while the cdu stands for neo-liberal spd positions .
meanwhile , the greens are further left than the spd on social and economic issues .
is there any political ground the spd can still claim as its own ?
that description is a little too pat .
the cdu is trying to muscle in on some sdp territory , but the neo-liberal elements of the cdu political agenda are still intact .
the left party has moved in on some of the spd past positions , which had become politically untenable .
stuck in the middle , the sdp is unable to assert itself .
but basically , this would not be impossible were the party to better push through its social democratic positions , which are in fact perfectly viable right now .
within the grand coalition , the cdu is increasingly to the left of the spd .
does the cdu have a social conscience ?
the cdu has always been contradictory , poised between the social elements drawn from its catholic social doctrine , and the neo-liberal , political substance based on the party 's economic principles .
it can show either one of these faces according to election results and public opinion .
for now , after the last , very close election , in which the party fared far worse than it had expected to , it is making an effort to show its social face .
does the sdp still have a loyal base ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor unions , seen here on strike , are a traditional spd base yes it does , but all the parties are seeing their bases shrink .
the number of swing voters is on the rise .
that hits other parties as much as it does the spd .
any young people with political ideals no longer join the political parties but ngos instead - as illustrated by the scenes at the g8 we all saw on television .
why are the political parties no longer so attractive to young people ?
many young people prefer smaller-scale organizations , where they feel they might have some effect and which are concerned with just one or two issues they can easily follow .
they feel that the mainstream parties , and large-scale organizations in general , are too anonymous , concerned with too many issues and too willing to compromise .
the result is that young people are not terribly interested in the parties in their current form .
top spd politicians matthias platzeck , peer steinbrück and frank-walter steinmeier recently published their book " auf der höhe der zeit " about social democracy and progress in the 21st century .
one of the key terms in the book is the " careful welfare state . "
what 's new about this concept ?
basically , the idea is to adopt certain elements of the scandinavian welfare state , primarily with more investment in education , more equal opportunities within education , low-risk political strategies which allow people to thrive in today 's changing society and therefore depend on less long-term welfare support .
basically , it 's a very sensible project but not necessarily a new one .
parts of it already featured in the spd 's berlin program in 1989 .
but in this more extensive version it sets new foci and will serve as the cornerstone of the spd 's new party platform .
the spd will unveil its new policy statements in october .
can we expect anything new ?
there will be a number of new foci : the careful welfare state , a strong emphasis on the environment , especially in the area of climate policy , a strong emphasis on europe and globalization policies .
we wo n't be seeing a new spd but there will be a greater , better and more offensive emphasis on building the foundations for social democracy in the age of globalization .
spd chief kurt beck is not doing too well in the popularity stakes .
does the spd need a media star like gerhard schröder to front it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has n't captured germany 's imagination in the past we have seen that politicians such as helmut kohl , did badly in the opinion polls but were still elected because they had certain persuasive characteristics and persuasive platforms .
beck may well find himself in a similar position .
surveys are not the same as elections , and for the time being it remains to be seen whether beck can mobilize support .
but the next elections are still a long way off .
in the last election , observers said that merkel would never be as media savvy as schröder .
but a look at current opinion polls suggests that she has managed to cut an even better figure within the media than her predecessor .
is that true ?
merkel has managed to create a very good media presence .
she 's accepted both by the public and the media .
it 's helped that she 's concentrated heavily on foreign policy .
it 's always easy to boost popularity with foreign policy : it 's not controversial domestically , and it always looks good to be seen with top international politicians .
that also goes to show that certain politicians can grow into their role , and if they are given the opportunity , they can gain unexpected support . interview by fengbo wang -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is also deputy head of the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- core values commission .
dw-world.de : membership of germany 's mainstream parties has been steadily dwindling .
if this trend continues , does it mean their days are numbered ?
thomas meyer : membership is on the decline , so in this respect the role of the mainstream parties is changing .
more parties are needed in order to form government coalitions , and there are more parties in the party system , which inevitably means the system is changing .
does that the fact that the mainstream parties are shrinking mean that the state has a more limited power to act ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's two-party administration is nothing compared to other coalitions no , not directly .
many countries have stable democracies despite having many more parties .
government coalitions might need four or five parties .
the process of forming a coalition might be trickier , but it by no means weakens the state .
the social democrats are suffering the sharpest decline in membership .
why is this ?
right now , the spd 's role is an especially difficult one .
the party is trapped between a christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- which has shifted to the left and appears to be adopting some of the social democrats ' traditional positions , and the new left party which is occupying what used to be the social democrats ' far-left ground .
sandwiched between these two poles , the party is having trouble maintaining its identity and remaining on the offensive .
to what extent is the left party responsible for the crisis within the spd ?
the left party is , to some extent , an expression of this crisis .
it is partly made up of left-wing party members whom the spd was unable to integrate into its policies and political style .
its founding is definitely one of the factors contributing to the spd 's crisis .
are lafontaine and co . -lsb- former spd members who left to establish an alternative party , the left -rsb- luring voters away from the spd ?
definitely , to some extent .
if the left party attracts ten percent of voters then a large part , if not the majority of these voters , are bound to be disappointed spd voters .
on the whole , the left party stands for traditional spd positions while the cdu stands for neo-liberal spd positions .
meanwhile , the greens are further left than the spd on social and economic issues .
is there any political ground the spd can still claim as its own ?
that description is a little too pat .
the cdu is trying to muscle in on some sdp territory , but the neo-liberal elements of the cdu political agenda are still intact .
the left party has moved in on some of the spd past positions , which had become politically untenable .
stuck in the middle , the sdp is unable to assert itself .
but basically , this would not be impossible were the party to better push through its social democratic positions , which are in fact perfectly viable right now .
within the grand coalition , the cdu is increasingly to the left of the spd .
does the cdu have a social conscience ?
the cdu has always been contradictory , poised between the social elements drawn from its catholic social doctrine , and the neo-liberal , political substance based on the party 's economic principles .
it can show either one of these faces according to election results and public opinion .
for now , after the last , very close election , in which the party fared far worse than it had expected to , it is making an effort to show its social face .
does the sdp still have a loyal base ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor unions , seen here on strike , are a traditional spd base yes it does , but all the parties are seeing their bases shrink .
the number of swing voters is on the rise .
that hits other parties as much as it does the spd .
any young people with political ideals no longer join the political parties but ngos instead - as illustrated by the scenes at the g8 we all saw on television .
why are the political parties no longer so attractive to young people ?
many young people prefer smaller-scale organizations , where they feel they might have some effect and which are concerned with just one or two issues they can easily follow .
they feel that the mainstream parties , and large-scale organizations in general , are too anonymous , concerned with too many issues and too willing to compromise .
the result is that young people are not terribly interested in the parties in their current form .
top spd politicians matthias platzeck , peer steinbrück and frank-walter steinmeier recently published their book " auf der höhe der zeit " about social democracy and progress in the 21st century .
one of the key terms in the book is the " careful welfare state . "
what 's new about this concept ?
basically , the idea is to adopt certain elements of the scandinavian welfare state , primarily with more investment in education , more equal opportunities within education , low-risk political strategies which allow people to thrive in today 's changing society and therefore depend on less long-term welfare support .
basically , it 's a very sensible project but not necessarily a new one .
parts of it already featured in the spd 's berlin program in 1989 .
but in this more extensive version it sets new foci and will serve as the cornerstone of the spd 's new party platform .
the spd will unveil its new policy statements in october .
can we expect anything new ?
there will be a number of new foci : the careful welfare state , a strong emphasis on the environment , especially in the area of climate policy , a strong emphasis on europe and globalization policies .
we wo n't be seeing a new spd but there will be a greater , better and more offensive emphasis on building the foundations for social democracy in the age of globalization .
spd chief kurt beck is not doing too well in the popularity stakes .
does the spd need a media star like gerhard schröder to front it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has n't captured germany 's imagination in the past we have seen that politicians such as helmut kohl , did badly in the opinion polls but were still elected because they had certain persuasive characteristics and persuasive platforms .
beck may well find himself in a similar position .
surveys are not the same as elections , and for the time being it remains to be seen whether beck can mobilize support .
but the next elections are still a long way off .
in the last election , observers said that merkel would never be as media savvy as schröder .
but a look at current opinion polls suggests that she has managed to cut an even better figure within the media than her predecessor .
is that true ?
merkel has managed to create a very good media presence .
she 's accepted both by the public and the media .
it 's helped that she 's concentrated heavily on foreign policy .
it 's always easy to boost popularity with foreign policy : it 's not controversial domestically , and it always looks good to be seen with top international politicians .
that also goes to show that certain politicians can grow into their role , and if they are given the opportunity , they can gain unexpected support . interview by fengbo wang -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

basically , the idea is to adopt certain elements of the scandinavian welfare state , primarily with more investment in education , more equal opportunities within education , low-risk political strategies which allow people to thrive in today 's changing society and therefore depend on less long-term welfare support .
basically , it 's a very sensible project but not necessarily a new one .
parts of it already featured in the spd 's berlin program in 1989 .
but in this more extensive version it sets new foci and will serve as the cornerstone of the spd 's new party platform .
the spd will unveil its new policy statements in october .
can we expect anything new ?
there will be a number of new foci : the careful welfare state , a strong emphasis on the environment , especially in the area of climate policy , a strong emphasis on europe and globalization policies .
we wo n't be seeing a new spd but there will be a greater , better and more offensive emphasis on building the foundations for social democracy in the age of globalization .
spd chief kurt beck is not doing too well in the popularity stakes .
does the spd need a media star like gerhard schröder to front it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has n't captured germany 's imagination in the past we have seen that politicians such as helmut kohl , did badly in the opinion polls but were still elected because they had certain persuasive characteristics and persuasive platforms .
beck may well find himself in a similar position .
surveys are not the same as elections , and for the time being it remains to be seen whether beck can mobilize support .
but the next elections are still a long way off .
in the last election , observers said that merkel would never be as media savvy as schröder .
but a look at current opinion polls suggests that she has managed to cut an even better figure within the media than her predecessor .
is that true ?
merkel has managed to create a very good media presence .
she 's accepted both by the public and the media .
it 's helped that she 's concentrated heavily on foreign policy .
it 's always easy to boost popularity with foreign policy : it 's not controversial domestically , and it always looks good to be seen with top international politicians .
that also goes to show that certain politicians can grow into their role , and if they are given the opportunity , they can gain unexpected support . interview by fengbo wang -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its german head is returning home just months after his appointment . jaap de hoop scheffer is set to ask germany on thursday , sept .
13 , for police trainers to be deployed in southern afghanistan where alliance forces are dealing with an upsurge in violence and suicide bomb attacks by the taliban , al qaeda and local warlords .
the request comes at a time when the eu 's special police training mission is also hampered by complaints of inadequate eu planning and insufficient nato security support .
german head of eu mission to quit this week , the german interior ministry confirmed that brigadier general friedrich eichele is returning to germany just months after he was appointed to head the eu training mission in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich eichele is returning home to germany eichele , a former commander of the german federal police 's elite gsg 9 counter-terrorism unit , is said to be returning to oversee reforms of the domestic police force .
but , according to german newsmagazine der spiegel , tensions with the eu 's special envoy to afghanistan , francesc vendrell , are the actual reasons behind eichele 's early exit .
vendrell reportedly wanted political control of the mission , something that eichele opposed .
the german embassy in kabul described eichele as simply " overburdened , " the magazine said .
mission plagued by trouble eichele 's early departure reflects the difficulties in trying to establish the mission of 190 european trainers in afghanistan at a time when an increase in violence and suicide attacks by the taliban and al qaeda has raised pressure on isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- countries to scale down their afghan troop presence .
last month , three german police officers responsible for protecting the german ambassador to afghanistan died and a fourth was injured when their vehicles were blown up on a road to the east of kabul .
germany has some 3,000 troops stationed in afghanistan , mostly in the relatively stable north of the country .

it was in charge of the police training from 2002 until this year .

the european commission has still not approved the budget for armored cars , computers and office equipment for the mission headquarters in kabul , according to news reports .
in addition , the mission has gotten off to a slow start , with reports saying not enough european police trainers or afghan participants have turned up .
some 90 trainers were expected to come from 21 nations , but eu member states have so far provided only half the personnel .
germany has promised up to 60 officials but still has n't delivered on its promise .
der spiegel reported last month that officials have not resolved how to keep newly trained afghan police officers and soldiers from joining the taliban , local militia leaders or drug barons , all of whom offer better pay than the government in kabul .
eu ill prepared , poor nato security ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the eu 's efforts to train the afghan army and police are falling short the mission has also been hampered by nato-member turkey 's blocking of an agreement to regulate cooperation between the alliance and the eu in afghanistan .
turkey has tried to curb military cooperation between the two because the european union has refused to guarantee cypriot officers would not participate .
but nato spokesman james appathurai denied suggestions that nato support for the eu police trainers was inadequate .
" nato has been providing support to the european police in afghanistan , and we can not imagine that nato will provide any less support to the eu police than it does to other organizations such as the united nations , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 13.09.2007 opinion : putin pulls a rabbit out of his hat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's cornelia rabitz says that the russian president 's decision to change the government is completely in line with his leadership style .
but it 's not good news for democracy in the country , she adds . viktor zubkov 's the name of the rabbit that russian president vladmir putin pulled out of his hat .
as is customary for such magic tricks , the public is surprised , says " oh " and " ah " - and marvels .
who is this zubkov ?
not much is known about him .
he 's a finance expert , a putin confidant from the old days in st. petersburg .
he 's an inconspicuous guy in the second row .
a dark horse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz maybe that 's not even so important .
what is important is that putin has shown people the ropes once again .
he 's a politician who likes to present the public with riddles , who throws smoke grenades , who acts in secret and surprises people , showing the world that there 's only one person pulling the strings in russian domestic politics .
vladimir vladimirovich putin - the president with a kgb past .
his second and last term in office will be over in march 2008 , but people will have to continue to include him in the equation .
he 's still far from being out of breath .
putin is already setting the course for the time after his departure .
nothing 's meant to go wrong .
by nominating the bland zubkov , the russian president has shown once again what kind of person he deems capable of leading a country that 's shaped by big economic successes and political problems : it 's either secret intelligence people with dubious pasts or technocrats , apolitical , dry figures , who are experts for something - agriculture , military or finance .
he just does n't want experienced , charismatic and democratically legitimated politicians who care about more than taking care of business .
putin banks on apolitical politicians .
with a bit of good will , it 's possible to write off the events in moscow as " normal procedure . "
of course , outside russia , the reasons for a change of government seem odd .
do you swap out a cabinet when elections are coming up ?
putin said that , ahead of parliamentary and presidential elections , the government should be ready to prepare the country for changes that are bound to happen .

it 's survival is threatened since russia decided to pull out . speaking in the german parliament on wednesday , sept .
12 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that germany could not permit the treaty , which is aimed at limiting conventional arms and was developed over a long period of time , to be dissolved .
" i will be just as annoyed as you if this treaty is suspended , " steinmeier told lawmakers , adding that the conference in berlin would try to " rebuild lost trust . "
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 and updated in 1999 .
it limits the number of tanks , artillery , aircraft and helicopters stationed in europe .
russia announced in july that it no longer considered the treaty effective .
moscow said that the failure of nato countries to ratify the latest version of the treaty was the main reason for the decision .
but russian officials also said that a us plan to station parts of a new missile defense system in central european countries also played a role , reuters news service reported .
they consider the system a threat to russia 's national security .
nato members , meanwhile , have said that they will not ratify the latest cfe treaty version until russia withdraws its troops from the former soviet republics of moldova and georgia , which moscow promised to do in 1999 when the treaty was signed . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is also deputy head of the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- core values commission .
dw-world.de : membership of germany 's mainstream parties has been steadily dwindling .
if this trend continues , does it mean their days are numbered ?
thomas meyer : membership is on the decline , so in this respect the role of the mainstream parties is changing .
more parties are needed in order to form government coalitions , and there are more parties in the party system , which inevitably means the system is changing .
does that the fact that the mainstream parties are shrinking mean that the state has a more limited power to act ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's two-party administration is nothing compared to other coalitions no , not directly .
many countries have stable democracies despite having many more parties .
government coalitions might need four or five parties .
the process of forming a coalition might be trickier , but it by no means weakens the state .
the social democrats are suffering the sharpest decline in membership .
why is this ?
right now , the spd 's role is an especially difficult one .
the party is trapped between a christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- which has shifted to the left and appears to be adopting some of the social democrats ' traditional positions , and the new left party which is occupying what used to be the social democrats ' far-left ground .
sandwiched between these two poles , the party is having trouble maintaining its identity and remaining on the offensive .
to what extent is the left party responsible for the crisis within the spd ?
the left party is , to some extent , an expression of this crisis .
it is partly made up of left-wing party members whom the spd was unable to integrate into its policies and political style .
its founding is definitely one of the factors contributing to the spd 's crisis .
are lafontaine and co . -lsb- former spd members who left to establish an alternative party , the left -rsb- luring voters away from the spd ?
definitely , to some extent .
if the left party attracts ten percent of voters then a large part , if not the majority of these voters , are bound to be disappointed spd voters .
on the whole , the left party stands for traditional spd positions while the cdu stands for neo-liberal spd positions .
meanwhile , the greens are further left than the spd on social and economic issues .
is there any political ground the spd can still claim as its own ?
that description is a little too pat .
the cdu is trying to muscle in on some sdp territory , but the neo-liberal elements of the cdu political agenda are still intact .
the left party has moved in on some of the spd past positions , which had become politically untenable .
stuck in the middle , the sdp is unable to assert itself .
but basically , this would not be impossible were the party to better push through its social democratic positions , which are in fact perfectly viable right now .
within the grand coalition , the cdu is increasingly to the left of the spd .
does the cdu have a social conscience ?
the cdu has always been contradictory , poised between the social elements drawn from its catholic social doctrine , and the neo-liberal , political substance based on the party 's economic principles .
it can show either one of these faces according to election results and public opinion .
for now , after the last , very close election , in which the party fared far worse than it had expected to , it is making an effort to show its social face .
does the sdp still have a loyal base ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor unions , seen here on strike , are a traditional spd base yes it does , but all the parties are seeing their bases shrink .
the number of swing voters is on the rise .
that hits other parties as much as it does the spd .
any young people with political ideals no longer join the political parties but ngos instead - as illustrated by the scenes at the g8 we all saw on television .
why are the political parties no longer so attractive to young people ?
many young people prefer smaller-scale organizations , where they feel they might have some effect and which are concerned with just one or two issues they can easily follow .
they feel that the mainstream parties , and large-scale organizations in general , are too anonymous , concerned with too many issues and too willing to compromise .
the result is that young people are not terribly interested in the parties in their current form .
top spd politicians matthias platzeck , peer steinbrück and frank-walter steinmeier recently published their book " auf der höhe der zeit " about social democracy and progress in the 21st century .
one of the key terms in the book is the " careful welfare state . "
what 's new about this concept ?
basically , the idea is to adopt certain elements of the scandinavian welfare state , primarily with more investment in education , more equal opportunities within education , low-risk political strategies which allow people to thrive in today 's changing society and therefore depend on less long-term welfare support .
basically , it 's a very sensible project but not necessarily a new one .
parts of it already featured in the spd 's berlin program in 1989 .
but in this more extensive version it sets new foci and will serve as the cornerstone of the spd 's new party platform .
the spd will unveil its new policy statements in october .
can we expect anything new ?
there will be a number of new foci : the careful welfare state , a strong emphasis on the environment , especially in the area of climate policy , a strong emphasis on europe and globalization policies .
we wo n't be seeing a new spd but there will be a greater , better and more offensive emphasis on building the foundations for social democracy in the age of globalization .
spd chief kurt beck is not doing too well in the popularity stakes .
does the spd need a media star like gerhard schröder to front it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has n't captured germany 's imagination in the past we have seen that politicians such as helmut kohl , did badly in the opinion polls but were still elected because they had certain persuasive characteristics and persuasive platforms .
beck may well find himself in a similar position .
surveys are not the same as elections , and for the time being it remains to be seen whether beck can mobilize support .
but the next elections are still a long way off .
in the last election , observers said that merkel would never be as media savvy as schröder .
but a look at current opinion polls suggests that she has managed to cut an even better figure within the media than her predecessor .
is that true ?
merkel has managed to create a very good media presence .
she 's accepted both by the public and the media .
it 's helped that she 's concentrated heavily on foreign policy .
it 's always easy to boost popularity with foreign policy : it 's not controversial domestically , and it always looks good to be seen with top international politicians .
that also goes to show that certain politicians can grow into their role , and if they are given the opportunity , they can gain unexpected support . interview by fengbo wang -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it 's not good news for democracy in the country , she adds . viktor zubkov 's the name of the rabbit that russian president vladmir putin pulled out of his hat .
as is customary for such magic tricks , the public is surprised , says " oh " and " ah " - and marvels .
who is this zubkov ?
not much is known about him .
he 's a finance expert , a putin confidant from the old days in st. petersburg .
he 's an inconspicuous guy in the second row .
a dark horse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz maybe that 's not even so important .
what is important is that putin has shown people the ropes once again .
he 's a politician who likes to present the public with riddles , who throws smoke grenades , who acts in secret and surprises people , showing the world that there 's only one person pulling the strings in russian domestic politics .
vladimir vladimirovich putin - the president with a kgb past .
his second and last term in office will be over in march 2008 , but people will have to continue to include him in the equation .
he 's still far from being out of breath .
putin is already setting the course for the time after his departure .
nothing 's meant to go wrong .
by nominating the bland zubkov , the russian president has shown once again what kind of person he deems capable of leading a country that 's shaped by big economic successes and political problems : it 's either secret intelligence people with dubious pasts or technocrats , apolitical , dry figures , who are experts for something - agriculture , military or finance .
he just does n't want experienced , charismatic and democratically legitimated politicians who care about more than taking care of business .

with a bit of good will , it 's possible to write off the events in moscow as " normal procedure . "
of course , outside russia , the reasons for a change of government seem odd .
do you swap out a cabinet when elections are coming up ?
putin said that , ahead of parliamentary and presidential elections , the government should be ready to prepare the country for changes that are bound to happen .
the power structure has to be refreshed , he said .
that 's strange : if things happen in a democratic , free and fair way , a government faces the vote of the people and the population judges the accomplishments of the country 's leading elite , reconfirms it or votes it out of office .

despite a series of sloppy passes in the first half , the goal was enough to earn him a hearty applause from the 44,500-strong crowd when he was rotated out after an hour of play . " in the first half we did n't move enough and that made the combination game suffer , " said national coach joachim löw .

despite a series of sloppy passes in the first half , the goal was enough to earn him a hearty applause from the 44,500-strong crowd when he was rotated out after an hour of play . " in the first half we did n't move enough and that made the combination game suffer , " said national coach joachim löw .
" at half-time we asked ourselves how we could shake up this team , " he added . second-string strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a-team had a cleaner 2:0 win against wales on sept .
8 despite the weak first half , löw stuck with his strategy of sparing his key players and sending out the second-string - one that had n't proved successful in the 0:1 game against denmark six months ago . the next goal came from david odonkor -lrb- 65th minute -rrb- just moments after he 'd been sent onto the field along with teammates arne friedrich , simon rolfes and gonzalo castro .
odonkor first score in an international match was " assisted " with a fumble by the visiting goalie danut dumitru coman . lukas podolski secured the germans ' 2:1 lead with a final goal in the 82nd minute - his 23rd score in the 40 international games he 's played . though the " alternative 11 " did n't quite shine as bright as the a-team did during the recent victories against england -lrb- 2:1 -rrb- and wales -lrb- 2:0 -rrb- , they managed to claim revenge for germany 's embarrassing 1:5 loss against romania in april 2004 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is also the seat of the continent 's fastest growing christian missions . from the most obscure , tiny district church to the high-tech cathedral and shopping area in the heart of the city , the charismatic appeal of pentecostal churches is ever present . one of the main features of this kind of church is the use of broadcast , print and the internet in spreading its message .
another is the practice of incorporating elements of traditional african culture , such as upbeat music , loud sermons , and above all , reinforcing deeply held beliefs in witchcraft and demons . every sunday , hundreds of thousands of followers seek spiritual enlightenment .
the faithful storm the myriad big and small churches throughout the city . evangelical churches reinforce traditional african beliefs this religious revival under banners which proclaim " mountain of fire and of wonder " or " redemption from the dead " has become a worldwide symbol for the huge success of evangelical churches in africa . bildunterschrift : lagos is the commercial capital of nigeria and the seat of christendom in africa there are 3.9 million followers of the pentecostal faith in nigeria , the third-highest ranking in the world , according to the world christian database in boston . brazil , which is primarily roman catholic , is the worldwide leader of evangelical pentecostal churches , with more than 24 million followers , while the united states has roughly 6 million adherents . what appeals to church followers is the promise of cures from poverty and disease through god 's blessing . ejiah ndifon , a nigerian engineer founded his own church , the royal kingdom citizen international , based on these ideas . " there are so many people who could have had bigger and better lives , but they could not achieve their destiny , because there was no one to lead them with a vision , " the self-declared prophet said .
" royal kingdom citizen offers this guidance , and brings people together with god . " the faithful believe those who discover the holy spirit will lead transformed lives and that sickness and misfortune can only befall heathens . the success of the pentecostal churches lies with the belief in a god who fights the evil of pandemic disease , according to erhard kamphausen , head of the academy of missions at the university of hamburg . " old superstitions , which were marginalized by more mainstream christian missionaries , have come around full circle , " kamphausen said .
" africans believe in miracles and witchcraft . " german crusader in africa reaches millions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german evangelist reinhard bonnke has led crusades for decades in africa they are n't alone .
german evangelist reinhard bonnke , who is known for his gospel crusades in nigeria , had an epiphany at the age of 9 and decided to devote his life to god . bonnke has held sermons in africa for nearly 30 years , and one of these massive mega-events was attended by 1.6 million followers .
earlier this year , another event was broadcast live on " god tv " by 200 countries , reaching an even broader audience and establishing his reputation as " undoubtedly the most successful missionary of our times . " the web site of the evangelist 's bible association " christ for all nations " sells books and other promotional material on supernatural intervention and miracle cures in seven languages .
a film series on dvd sells for 249 euros -lrb- $ 346 -rrb- . donation to the church tied with god 's blessing ayimah hondeh is a regular at the popular redeemed christian church of god in lagos .
she said she became a true believer on christmas eve 2005 . a young man had shoved her while she was waiting in line at a fast-food restaurant , and not wanting to provoke a fight , she switched to another queue .
shortly afterwards , some armed robbers stormed the restaurant and those in the first queue were injured , but hondeh was unharmed . " i believe it was god 's will , " she said . a few weeks before the pastor had reminded her congregation that god 's blessing was not guaranteed every year . " he said we had to pray twice as hard and double our donation to the church , " hondeh said .
" i quadrupled my contribution to the collection plate every sunday .
i know that god spared me on that day . " a donation tied to god 's blessing is business as usual for evangelical churches .
small wonder that efforts devoted to proselytizing focus on miracle cures , according to kamphausen . islam , christianity battle for african souls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pentecostal-style revival tied to promises of miracles " miracles play a tremendous role , " he said .
" even fairly grounded pentecostal preachers say that there is no day that passes when some small miracle does n't occur . " in principle , chicanery has as much or as little to do with a true belief in the lourdes apparitions or any religion 's professed miracles , but still the theologian warned against such aggressive proselytizing by charismatic churches in africa that capitalize on local superstitions . the repercussions of such religious zeal could unleash conflicts with islam , the dominant faith in northern nigeria .
roughly half of all nigerians are muslim , 40 percent are christian and the remaining 10 percent are members of other faiths . " most churches which carry on their crusades in the north are dangerous and the tension between islam and christianity can only grow , " said kamphausen . thomas mösch , mansour bala bello and geraldo hoffmann -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's survival is threatened since russia decided to pull out . speaking in the german parliament on wednesday , sept .
12 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that germany could not permit the treaty , which is aimed at limiting conventional arms and was developed over a long period of time , to be dissolved .
" i will be just as annoyed as you if this treaty is suspended , " steinmeier told lawmakers , adding that the conference in berlin would try to " rebuild lost trust . "
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 and updated in 1999 .
it limits the number of tanks , artillery , aircraft and helicopters stationed in europe .
russia announced in july that it no longer considered the treaty effective .
moscow said that the failure of nato countries to ratify the latest version of the treaty was the main reason for the decision .
but russian officials also said that a us plan to station parts of a new missile defense system in central european countries also played a role , reuters news service reported .
they consider the system a threat to russia 's national security .
nato members , meanwhile , have said that they will not ratify the latest cfe treaty version until russia withdraws its troops from the former soviet republics of moldova and georgia , which moscow promised to do in 1999 when the treaty was signed . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : germany 's political parties in crisis germany 's political parties in crisis german parties begin early search for future partners expert says germany 's parties must reinvent themselves cdu puts new twist on conservative politics politics -pipe- 13.09.2007 germany 's social democratic party struggles to redefine its role großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other political parties are hanging over the spd like dark clouds dw-world.de spoke with political scientist thomas meyer about the social democratic party 's current identity crisis and where it can go from here . thomas meyer is a political scientist at dortmund university and director of the friedrich ebert foundation 's political academy .
he is also deputy head of the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- core values commission .
dw-world.de : membership of germany 's mainstream parties has been steadily dwindling .
if this trend continues , does it mean their days are numbered ?
thomas meyer : membership is on the decline , so in this respect the role of the mainstream parties is changing .
more parties are needed in order to form government coalitions , and there are more parties in the party system , which inevitably means the system is changing .
does that the fact that the mainstream parties are shrinking mean that the state has a more limited power to act ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's two-party administration is nothing compared to other coalitions no , not directly .
many countries have stable democracies despite having many more parties .
government coalitions might need four or five parties .
the process of forming a coalition might be trickier , but it by no means weakens the state .
the social democrats are suffering the sharpest decline in membership .
why is this ?
right now , the spd 's role is an especially difficult one .
the party is trapped between a christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- which has shifted to the left and appears to be adopting some of the social democrats ' traditional positions , and the new left party which is occupying what used to be the social democrats ' far-left ground .
sandwiched between these two poles , the party is having trouble maintaining its identity and remaining on the offensive .
to what extent is the left party responsible for the crisis within the spd ?
the left party is , to some extent , an expression of this crisis .
it is partly made up of left-wing party members whom the spd was unable to integrate into its policies and political style .
its founding is definitely one of the factors contributing to the spd 's crisis .
are lafontaine and co . -lsb- former spd members who left to establish an alternative party , the left -rsb- luring voters away from the spd ?
definitely , to some extent .
if the left party attracts ten percent of voters then a large part , if not the majority of these voters , are bound to be disappointed spd voters .
on the whole , the left party stands for traditional spd positions while the cdu stands for neo-liberal spd positions .
meanwhile , the greens are further left than the spd on social and economic issues .
is there any political ground the spd can still claim as its own ?
that description is a little too pat .
the cdu is trying to muscle in on some sdp territory , but the neo-liberal elements of the cdu political agenda are still intact .
the left party has moved in on some of the spd past positions , which had become politically untenable .
stuck in the middle , the sdp is unable to assert itself .
but basically , this would not be impossible were the party to better push through its social democratic positions , which are in fact perfectly viable right now .
within the grand coalition , the cdu is increasingly to the left of the spd .
does the cdu have a social conscience ?
the cdu has always been contradictory , poised between the social elements drawn from its catholic social doctrine , and the neo-liberal , political substance based on the party 's economic principles .
it can show either one of these faces according to election results and public opinion .
for now , after the last , very close election , in which the party fared far worse than it had expected to , it is making an effort to show its social face .
does the sdp still have a loyal base ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor unions , seen here on strike , are a traditional spd base yes it does , but all the parties are seeing their bases shrink .
the number of swing voters is on the rise .
that hits other parties as much as it does the spd .
any young people with political ideals no longer join the political parties but ngos instead - as illustrated by the scenes at the g8 we all saw on television .
why are the political parties no longer so attractive to young people ?
many young people prefer smaller-scale organizations , where they feel they might have some effect and which are concerned with just one or two issues they can easily follow .
they feel that the mainstream parties , and large-scale organizations in general , are too anonymous , concerned with too many issues and too willing to compromise .
the result is that young people are not terribly interested in the parties in their current form .
top spd politicians matthias platzeck , peer steinbrück and frank-walter steinmeier recently published their book " auf der höhe der zeit " about social democracy and progress in the 21st century .
one of the key terms in the book is the " careful welfare state . "
what 's new about this concept ?
basically , the idea is to adopt certain elements of the scandinavian welfare state , primarily with more investment in education , more equal opportunities within education , low-risk political strategies which allow people to thrive in today 's changing society and therefore depend on less long-term welfare support .
basically , it 's a very sensible project but not necessarily a new one .
parts of it already featured in the spd 's berlin program in 1989 .
but in this more extensive version it sets new foci and will serve as the cornerstone of the spd 's new party platform .
the spd will unveil its new policy statements in october .
can we expect anything new ?
there will be a number of new foci : the careful welfare state , a strong emphasis on the environment , especially in the area of climate policy , a strong emphasis on europe and globalization policies .
we wo n't be seeing a new spd but there will be a greater , better and more offensive emphasis on building the foundations for social democracy in the age of globalization .
spd chief kurt beck is not doing too well in the popularity stakes .
does the spd need a media star like gerhard schröder to front it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has n't captured germany 's imagination in the past we have seen that politicians such as helmut kohl , did badly in the opinion polls but were still elected because they had certain persuasive characteristics and persuasive platforms .
beck may well find himself in a similar position .
surveys are not the same as elections , and for the time being it remains to be seen whether beck can mobilize support .
but the next elections are still a long way off .
in the last election , observers said that merkel would never be as media savvy as schröder .
but a look at current opinion polls suggests that she has managed to cut an even better figure within the media than her predecessor .
is that true ?
merkel has managed to create a very good media presence .
she 's accepted both by the public and the media .
it 's helped that she 's concentrated heavily on foreign policy .
it 's always easy to boost popularity with foreign policy : it 's not controversial domestically , and it always looks good to be seen with top international politicians .
that also goes to show that certain politicians can grow into their role , and if they are given the opportunity , they can gain unexpected support . interview by fengbo wang -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is also the seat of the continent 's fastest growing christian missions . from the most obscure , tiny district church to the high-tech cathedral and shopping area in the heart of the city , the charismatic appeal of pentecostal churches is ever present . one of the main features of this kind of church is the use of broadcast , print and the internet in spreading its message .
another is the practice of incorporating elements of traditional african culture , such as upbeat music , loud sermons , and above all , reinforcing deeply held beliefs in witchcraft and demons . every sunday , hundreds of thousands of followers seek spiritual enlightenment .
the faithful storm the myriad big and small churches throughout the city . evangelical churches reinforce traditional african beliefs this religious revival under banners which proclaim " mountain of fire and of wonder " or " redemption from the dead " has become a worldwide symbol for the huge success of evangelical churches in africa . bildunterschrift : lagos is the commercial capital of nigeria and the seat of christendom in africa there are 3.9 million followers of the pentecostal faith in nigeria , the third-highest ranking in the world , according to the world christian database in boston . brazil , which is primarily roman catholic , is the worldwide leader of evangelical pentecostal churches , with more than 24 million followers , while the united states has roughly 6 million adherents . what appeals to church followers is the promise of cures from poverty and disease through god 's blessing . ejiah ndifon , a nigerian engineer founded his own church , the royal kingdom citizen international , based on these ideas . " there are so many people who could have had bigger and better lives , but they could not achieve their destiny , because there was no one to lead them with a vision , " the self-declared prophet said .
" royal kingdom citizen offers this guidance , and brings people together with god . " the faithful believe those who discover the holy spirit will lead transformed lives and that sickness and misfortune can only befall heathens . the success of the pentecostal churches lies with the belief in a god who fights the evil of pandemic disease , according to erhard kamphausen , head of the academy of missions at the university of hamburg . " old superstitions , which were marginalized by more mainstream christian missionaries , have come around full circle , " kamphausen said .
" africans believe in miracles and witchcraft . " german crusader in africa reaches millions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german evangelist reinhard bonnke has led crusades for decades in africa they are n't alone .
german evangelist reinhard bonnke , who is known for his gospel crusades in nigeria , had an epiphany at the age of 9 and decided to devote his life to god . bonnke has held sermons in africa for nearly 30 years , and one of these massive mega-events was attended by 1.6 million followers .
earlier this year , another event was broadcast live on " god tv " by 200 countries , reaching an even broader audience and establishing his reputation as " undoubtedly the most successful missionary of our times . " the web site of the evangelist 's bible association " christ for all nations " sells books and other promotional material on supernatural intervention and miracle cures in seven languages .
a film series on dvd sells for 249 euros -lrb- $ 346 -rrb- . donation to the church tied with god 's blessing ayimah hondeh is a regular at the popular redeemed christian church of god in lagos .
she said she became a true believer on christmas eve 2005 . a young man had shoved her while she was waiting in line at a fast-food restaurant , and not wanting to provoke a fight , she switched to another queue .
shortly afterwards , some armed robbers stormed the restaurant and those in the first queue were injured , but hondeh was unharmed . " i believe it was god 's will , " she said . a few weeks before the pastor had reminded her congregation that god 's blessing was not guaranteed every year . " he said we had to pray twice as hard and double our donation to the church , " hondeh said .
" i quadrupled my contribution to the collection plate every sunday .
i know that god spared me on that day . " a donation tied to god 's blessing is business as usual for evangelical churches .
small wonder that efforts devoted to proselytizing focus on miracle cures , according to kamphausen . islam , christianity battle for african souls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pentecostal-style revival tied to promises of miracles " miracles play a tremendous role , " he said .
" even fairly grounded pentecostal preachers say that there is no day that passes when some small miracle does n't occur . " in principle , chicanery has as much or as little to do with a true belief in the lourdes apparitions or any religion 's professed miracles , but still the theologian warned against such aggressive proselytizing by charismatic churches in africa that capitalize on local superstitions . the repercussions of such religious zeal could unleash conflicts with islam , the dominant faith in northern nigeria .
roughly half of all nigerians are muslim , 40 percent are christian and the remaining 10 percent are members of other faiths . " most churches which carry on their crusades in the north are dangerous and the tension between islam and christianity can only grow , " said kamphausen . thomas mösch , mansour bala bello and geraldo hoffmann -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its german head is returning home just months after his appointment . jaap de hoop scheffer is set to ask germany on thursday , sept .
13 , for police trainers to be deployed in southern afghanistan where alliance forces are dealing with an upsurge in violence and suicide bomb attacks by the taliban , al qaeda and local warlords .
the request comes at a time when the eu 's special police training mission is also hampered by complaints of inadequate eu planning and insufficient nato security support .
german head of eu mission to quit this week , the german interior ministry confirmed that brigadier general friedrich eichele is returning to germany just months after he was appointed to head the eu training mission in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich eichele is returning home to germany eichele , a former commander of the german federal police 's elite gsg 9 counter-terrorism unit , is said to be returning to oversee reforms of the domestic police force .
but , according to german newsmagazine der spiegel , tensions with the eu 's special envoy to afghanistan , francesc vendrell , are the actual reasons behind eichele 's early exit .
vendrell reportedly wanted political control of the mission , something that eichele opposed .
the german embassy in kabul described eichele as simply " overburdened , " the magazine said .
mission plagued by trouble eichele 's early departure reflects the difficulties in trying to establish the mission of 190 european trainers in afghanistan at a time when an increase in violence and suicide attacks by the taliban and al qaeda has raised pressure on isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- countries to scale down their afghan troop presence .
last month , three german police officers responsible for protecting the german ambassador to afghanistan died and a fourth was injured when their vehicles were blown up on a road to the east of kabul .
germany has some 3,000 troops stationed in afghanistan , mostly in the relatively stable north of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf soldiers investigate the scene of an explosion that killed three german police officers until a few months ago , germany was considered to be leading the way in training afghan police and border guards .
it was in charge of the police training from 2002 until this year .
that was one of the reasons why , when the eu took over the mission in june , the top post remained in german hands .
like germany , several eu members , some of whom are also part of nato , have police and military working in afghanistan under separate civil and military mandates .
trainers , incentives missing but in recent months , the training mission has faltered , with critics saying it 's been underfunded , understaffed and poorly prepared .
the european commission has still not approved the budget for armored cars , computers and office equipment for the mission headquarters in kabul , according to news reports .
in addition , the mission has gotten off to a slow start , with reports saying not enough european police trainers or afghan participants have turned up .
some 90 trainers were expected to come from 21 nations , but eu member states have so far provided only half the personnel .
germany has promised up to 60 officials but still has n't delivered on its promise .
der spiegel reported last month that officials have not resolved how to keep newly trained afghan police officers and soldiers from joining the taliban , local militia leaders or drug barons , all of whom offer better pay than the government in kabul .
eu ill prepared , poor nato security ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the eu 's efforts to train the afghan army and police are falling short the mission has also been hampered by nato-member turkey 's blocking of an agreement to regulate cooperation between the alliance and the eu in afghanistan .
turkey has tried to curb military cooperation between the two because the european union has refused to guarantee cypriot officers would not participate .
but nato spokesman james appathurai denied suggestions that nato support for the eu police trainers was inadequate .
" nato has been providing support to the european police in afghanistan , and we can not imagine that nato will provide any less support to the eu police than it does to other organizations such as the united nations , " he said .
on wednesday , nato 's top civilian official in afghanistan , daan everts , said the eu is still not fully contributing to international efforts to bring peace and the rule of law to afghanistan , with incompetence and corruption rife among local afghan forces . " that has to be addressed in a more concerted and forceful manner , " everts said during a news conference .
other observers questioned whether the eu was properly prepared to coordinate operations so far away from its national borders .
" it seems that the eu was not really properly prepared for such a complex mission , " ronja kempin , an afghanistan expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told the international herald tribune this week .
" the eu seemed to have rushed into setting up this mission , " kempin said , adding that massive corruption in the afghan interior ministry compounded the troubles . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany , however , never makes it anywhere near the top of any such list .
the country 's inhabitants have after all turned moaning and complaining in a national pastime that 's probably best practiced by those living in and around berlin .
southern germans seem to find it rather difficult to truly exceed at whining .
that 's why it 's a bit strange that a school in beautiful , picturesque heidelberg has now become the first one to take on the challenge of turning germans into happier people .
at one of the city 's high schools , some 60 students have started attending classes in happiness .

the request comes at a time when the eu 's special police training mission is also hampered by complaints of inadequate eu planning and insufficient nato security support .
german head of eu mission to quit this week , the german interior ministry confirmed that brigadier general friedrich eichele is returning to germany just months after he was appointed to head the eu training mission in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich eichele is returning home to germany eichele , a former commander of the german federal police 's elite gsg 9 counter-terrorism unit , is said to be returning to oversee reforms of the domestic police force .
but , according to german newsmagazine der spiegel , tensions with the eu 's special envoy to afghanistan , francesc vendrell , are the actual reasons behind eichele 's early exit .
vendrell reportedly wanted political control of the mission , something that eichele opposed .
the german embassy in kabul described eichele as simply " overburdened , " the magazine said .
mission plagued by trouble eichele 's early departure reflects the difficulties in trying to establish the mission of 190 european trainers in afghanistan at a time when an increase in violence and suicide attacks by the taliban and al qaeda has raised pressure on isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- countries to scale down their afghan troop presence .
last month , three german police officers responsible for protecting the german ambassador to afghanistan died and a fourth was injured when their vehicles were blown up on a road to the east of kabul .

in addition , the mission has gotten off to a slow start , with reports saying not enough european police trainers or afghan participants have turned up .

germany has promised up to 60 officials but still has n't delivered on its promise .

turkey has tried to curb military cooperation between the two because the european union has refused to guarantee cypriot officers would not participate .
but nato spokesman james appathurai denied suggestions that nato support for the eu police trainers was inadequate .
" nato has been providing support to the european police in afghanistan , and we can not imagine that nato will provide any less support to the eu police than it does to other organizations such as the united nations , " he said .

but it 's not good news for democracy in the country , she adds . viktor zubkov 's the name of the rabbit that russian president vladmir putin pulled out of his hat .
as is customary for such magic tricks , the public is surprised , says " oh " and " ah " - and marvels .
who is this zubkov ?
not much is known about him .
he 's a finance expert , a putin confidant from the old days in st. petersburg .
he 's an inconspicuous guy in the second row .
a dark horse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz maybe that 's not even so important .
what is important is that putin has shown people the ropes once again .
he 's a politician who likes to present the public with riddles , who throws smoke grenades , who acts in secret and surprises people , showing the world that there 's only one person pulling the strings in russian domestic politics .
vladimir vladimirovich putin - the president with a kgb past .
his second and last term in office will be over in march 2008 , but people will have to continue to include him in the equation .
he 's still far from being out of breath .
putin is already setting the course for the time after his departure .
nothing 's meant to go wrong .
by nominating the bland zubkov , the russian president has shown once again what kind of person he deems capable of leading a country that 's shaped by big economic successes and political problems : it 's either secret intelligence people with dubious pasts or technocrats , apolitical , dry figures , who are experts for something - agriculture , military or finance .
he just does n't want experienced , charismatic and democratically legitimated politicians who care about more than taking care of business .
putin banks on apolitical politicians .
with a bit of good will , it 's possible to write off the events in moscow as " normal procedure . "
of course , outside russia , the reasons for a change of government seem odd .
do you swap out a cabinet when elections are coming up ?
putin said that , ahead of parliamentary and presidential elections , the government should be ready to prepare the country for changes that are bound to happen .
the power structure has to be refreshed , he said .
that 's strange : if things happen in a democratic , free and fair way , a government faces the vote of the people and the population judges the accomplishments of the country 's leading elite , reconfirms it or votes it out of office .
but russia 's pre-election time seems to be a time for political intrigues , tricks and deception .
that bodes ill .

the request comes at a time when the eu 's special police training mission is also hampered by complaints of inadequate eu planning and insufficient nato security support .
german head of eu mission to quit this week , the german interior ministry confirmed that brigadier general friedrich eichele is returning to germany just months after he was appointed to head the eu training mission in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich eichele is returning home to germany eichele , a former commander of the german federal police 's elite gsg 9 counter-terrorism unit , is said to be returning to oversee reforms of the domestic police force .

vendrell reportedly wanted political control of the mission , something that eichele opposed .

it is also the seat of the continent 's fastest growing christian missions . from the most obscure , tiny district church to the high-tech cathedral and shopping area in the heart of the city , the charismatic appeal of pentecostal churches is ever present . one of the main features of this kind of church is the use of broadcast , print and the internet in spreading its message .
another is the practice of incorporating elements of traditional african culture , such as upbeat music , loud sermons , and above all , reinforcing deeply held beliefs in witchcraft and demons . every sunday , hundreds of thousands of followers seek spiritual enlightenment .
the faithful storm the myriad big and small churches throughout the city . evangelical churches reinforce traditional african beliefs this religious revival under banners which proclaim " mountain of fire and of wonder " or " redemption from the dead " has become a worldwide symbol for the huge success of evangelical churches in africa . bildunterschrift : lagos is the commercial capital of nigeria and the seat of christendom in africa there are 3.9 million followers of the pentecostal faith in nigeria , the third-highest ranking in the world , according to the world christian database in boston . brazil , which is primarily roman catholic , is the worldwide leader of evangelical pentecostal churches , with more than 24 million followers , while the united states has roughly 6 million adherents . what appeals to church followers is the promise of cures from poverty and disease through god 's blessing . ejiah ndifon , a nigerian engineer founded his own church , the royal kingdom citizen international , based on these ideas . " there are so many people who could have had bigger and better lives , but they could not achieve their destiny , because there was no one to lead them with a vision , " the self-declared prophet said .
" royal kingdom citizen offers this guidance , and brings people together with god . " the faithful believe those who discover the holy spirit will lead transformed lives and that sickness and misfortune can only befall heathens . the success of the pentecostal churches lies with the belief in a god who fights the evil of pandemic disease , according to erhard kamphausen , head of the academy of missions at the university of hamburg . " old superstitions , which were marginalized by more mainstream christian missionaries , have come around full circle , " kamphausen said .
" africans believe in miracles and witchcraft . " german crusader in africa reaches millions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german evangelist reinhard bonnke has led crusades for decades in africa they are n't alone .
german evangelist reinhard bonnke , who is known for his gospel crusades in nigeria , had an epiphany at the age of 9 and decided to devote his life to god . bonnke has held sermons in africa for nearly 30 years , and one of these massive mega-events was attended by 1.6 million followers .
earlier this year , another event was broadcast live on " god tv " by 200 countries , reaching an even broader audience and establishing his reputation as " undoubtedly the most successful missionary of our times . " the web site of the evangelist 's bible association " christ for all nations " sells books and other promotional material on supernatural intervention and miracle cures in seven languages .
a film series on dvd sells for 249 euros -lrb- $ 346 -rrb- . donation to the church tied with god 's blessing ayimah hondeh is a regular at the popular redeemed christian church of god in lagos .
she said she became a true believer on christmas eve 2005 . a young man had shoved her while she was waiting in line at a fast-food restaurant , and not wanting to provoke a fight , she switched to another queue .
shortly afterwards , some armed robbers stormed the restaurant and those in the first queue were injured , but hondeh was unharmed . " i believe it was god 's will , " she said . a few weeks before the pastor had reminded her congregation that god 's blessing was not guaranteed every year . " he said we had to pray twice as hard and double our donation to the church , " hondeh said .
" i quadrupled my contribution to the collection plate every sunday .
i know that god spared me on that day . " a donation tied to god 's blessing is business as usual for evangelical churches .
small wonder that efforts devoted to proselytizing focus on miracle cures , according to kamphausen . islam , christianity battle for african souls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pentecostal-style revival tied to promises of miracles " miracles play a tremendous role , " he said .
" even fairly grounded pentecostal preachers say that there is no day that passes when some small miracle does n't occur . " in principle , chicanery has as much or as little to do with a true belief in the lourdes apparitions or any religion 's professed miracles , but still the theologian warned against such aggressive proselytizing by charismatic churches in africa that capitalize on local superstitions . the repercussions of such religious zeal could unleash conflicts with islam , the dominant faith in northern nigeria .
roughly half of all nigerians are muslim , 40 percent are christian and the remaining 10 percent are members of other faiths . " most churches which carry on their crusades in the north are dangerous and the tension between islam and christianity can only grow , " said kamphausen . thomas mösch , mansour bala bello and geraldo hoffmann -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mission plagued by trouble eichele 's early departure reflects the difficulties in trying to establish the mission of 190 european trainers in afghanistan at a time when an increase in violence and suicide attacks by the taliban and al qaeda has raised pressure on isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- countries to scale down their afghan troop presence .
last month , three german police officers responsible for protecting the german ambassador to afghanistan died and a fourth was injured when their vehicles were blown up on a road to the east of kabul .

but it 's not good news for democracy in the country , she adds . viktor zubkov 's the name of the rabbit that russian president vladmir putin pulled out of his hat .
as is customary for such magic tricks , the public is surprised , says " oh " and " ah " - and marvels .
who is this zubkov ?
not much is known about him .
he 's a finance expert , a putin confidant from the old days in st. petersburg .
he 's an inconspicuous guy in the second row .
a dark horse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz maybe that 's not even so important .
what is important is that putin has shown people the ropes once again .
he 's a politician who likes to present the public with riddles , who throws smoke grenades , who acts in secret and surprises people , showing the world that there 's only one person pulling the strings in russian domestic politics .
vladimir vladimirovich putin - the president with a kgb past .
his second and last term in office will be over in march 2008 , but people will have to continue to include him in the equation .
he 's still far from being out of breath .
putin is already setting the course for the time after his departure .
nothing 's meant to go wrong .
by nominating the bland zubkov , the russian president has shown once again what kind of person he deems capable of leading a country that 's shaped by big economic successes and political problems : it 's either secret intelligence people with dubious pasts or technocrats , apolitical , dry figures , who are experts for something - agriculture , military or finance .
he just does n't want experienced , charismatic and democratically legitimated politicians who care about more than taking care of business .
putin banks on apolitical politicians .
with a bit of good will , it 's possible to write off the events in moscow as " normal procedure . "
of course , outside russia , the reasons for a change of government seem odd .
do you swap out a cabinet when elections are coming up ?
putin said that , ahead of parliamentary and presidential elections , the government should be ready to prepare the country for changes that are bound to happen .
the power structure has to be refreshed , he said .
that 's strange : if things happen in a democratic , free and fair way , a government faces the vote of the people and the population judges the accomplishments of the country 's leading elite , reconfirms it or votes it out of office .
but russia 's pre-election time seems to be a time for political intrigues , tricks and deception .
that bodes ill .

despite a series of sloppy passes in the first half , the goal was enough to earn him a hearty applause from the 44,500-strong crowd when he was rotated out after an hour of play . " in the first half we did n't move enough and that made the combination game suffer , " said national coach joachim löw .
" at half-time we asked ourselves how we could shake up this team , " he added . second-string strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a-team had a cleaner 2:0 win against wales on sept .

germany , however , never makes it anywhere near the top of any such list .
the country 's inhabitants have after all turned moaning and complaining in a national pastime that 's probably best practiced by those living in and around berlin .
southern germans seem to find it rather difficult to truly exceed at whining .
that 's why it 's a bit strange that a school in beautiful , picturesque heidelberg has now become the first one to take on the challenge of turning germans into happier people .
at one of the city 's high schools , some 60 students have started attending classes in happiness .
" we want to teach contentment , self-confidence and personal responsibility , " the school 's director , ernst fritz-schubert , told reporters , adding that often all that 's needed is a change of perspective : instead of saying : " i am lazy , " students should switch to " i 'm thinking about myself . "
the course 's lesson plan includes classes on " physical comfort " and " social competence " and aims to make students aware about themselves , their environment and society as a whole .
an actor and a relaxation therapist will also participate in some of the lesson units .
this would n't be germany , however , if students ' results were n't quantified , and grades will be issued in the happy class .

it 's survival is threatened since russia decided to pull out . speaking in the german parliament on wednesday , sept .
12 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that germany could not permit the treaty , which is aimed at limiting conventional arms and was developed over a long period of time , to be dissolved .
" i will be just as annoyed as you if this treaty is suspended , " steinmeier told lawmakers , adding that the conference in berlin would try to " rebuild lost trust . "
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 and updated in 1999 .
it limits the number of tanks , artillery , aircraft and helicopters stationed in europe .
russia announced in july that it no longer considered the treaty effective .
moscow said that the failure of nato countries to ratify the latest version of the treaty was the main reason for the decision .
but russian officials also said that a us plan to station parts of a new missile defense system in central european countries also played a role , reuters news service reported .
they consider the system a threat to russia 's national security .
nato members , meanwhile , have said that they will not ratify the latest cfe treaty version until russia withdraws its troops from the former soviet republics of moldova and georgia , which moscow promised to do in 1999 when the treaty was signed . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there has been pressure on germany to lift this restriction , particularly to allow military instructors to accompany the afghan troops they have trained . germany has also sent six reconnaissance tornado jets to afghanistan to assist isaf operations throughout the country .
the german parliament will debate renewing the mandates this autumn . german chancellor angela merkel on wednesday pledged her country 's support for peacekeeping in afghanistan despite increasing opposition from german voters to the mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer also met with german defense minister franz josef jung in berlin an opinion poll published by stern magazine on wednesday showed 52 percent of respondents in favor of withdrawing all german forces .
just 43 percent were in favor of them staying , compared with 60 percent two years ago . nato still necessary in kosovo de hoop scheffer and steinmeier also agreed the nato-led kfor force remained necessary for securing peace in kosovo . the nato head said the force provided a secure environment for the albanian majority in the serbian province and for the serbian minority . following failure to agree on kosovo 's final status at the united nations as a result of the threat of a russian veto in the security council , steinmeier said there was no alternative to the three-party talks on the future of the province , involving the united states , the european union and russia . a un mediation group has been given until dec .

it is also the seat of the continent 's fastest growing christian missions . from the most obscure , tiny district church to the high-tech cathedral and shopping area in the heart of the city , the charismatic appeal of pentecostal churches is ever present . one of the main features of this kind of church is the use of broadcast , print and the internet in spreading its message .
another is the practice of incorporating elements of traditional african culture , such as upbeat music , loud sermons , and above all , reinforcing deeply held beliefs in witchcraft and demons . every sunday , hundreds of thousands of followers seek spiritual enlightenment .
the faithful storm the myriad big and small churches throughout the city . evangelical churches reinforce traditional african beliefs this religious revival under banners which proclaim " mountain of fire and of wonder " or " redemption from the dead " has become a worldwide symbol for the huge success of evangelical churches in africa . bildunterschrift : lagos is the commercial capital of nigeria and the seat of christendom in africa there are 3.9 million followers of the pentecostal faith in nigeria , the third-highest ranking in the world , according to the world christian database in boston . brazil , which is primarily roman catholic , is the worldwide leader of evangelical pentecostal churches , with more than 24 million followers , while the united states has roughly 6 million adherents . what appeals to church followers is the promise of cures from poverty and disease through god 's blessing . ejiah ndifon , a nigerian engineer founded his own church , the royal kingdom citizen international , based on these ideas . " there are so many people who could have had bigger and better lives , but they could not achieve their destiny , because there was no one to lead them with a vision , " the self-declared prophet said .
" royal kingdom citizen offers this guidance , and brings people together with god . " the faithful believe those who discover the holy spirit will lead transformed lives and that sickness and misfortune can only befall heathens . the success of the pentecostal churches lies with the belief in a god who fights the evil of pandemic disease , according to erhard kamphausen , head of the academy of missions at the university of hamburg . " old superstitions , which were marginalized by more mainstream christian missionaries , have come around full circle , " kamphausen said .
" africans believe in miracles and witchcraft . " german crusader in africa reaches millions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german evangelist reinhard bonnke has led crusades for decades in africa they are n't alone .
german evangelist reinhard bonnke , who is known for his gospel crusades in nigeria , had an epiphany at the age of 9 and decided to devote his life to god . bonnke has held sermons in africa for nearly 30 years , and one of these massive mega-events was attended by 1.6 million followers .
earlier this year , another event was broadcast live on " god tv " by 200 countries , reaching an even broader audience and establishing his reputation as " undoubtedly the most successful missionary of our times . " the web site of the evangelist 's bible association " christ for all nations " sells books and other promotional material on supernatural intervention and miracle cures in seven languages .
a film series on dvd sells for 249 euros -lrb- $ 346 -rrb- . donation to the church tied with god 's blessing ayimah hondeh is a regular at the popular redeemed christian church of god in lagos .
she said she became a true believer on christmas eve 2005 . a young man had shoved her while she was waiting in line at a fast-food restaurant , and not wanting to provoke a fight , she switched to another queue .
shortly afterwards , some armed robbers stormed the restaurant and those in the first queue were injured , but hondeh was unharmed . " i believe it was god 's will , " she said . a few weeks before the pastor had reminded her congregation that god 's blessing was not guaranteed every year . " he said we had to pray twice as hard and double our donation to the church , " hondeh said .
" i quadrupled my contribution to the collection plate every sunday .
i know that god spared me on that day . " a donation tied to god 's blessing is business as usual for evangelical churches .
small wonder that efforts devoted to proselytizing focus on miracle cures , according to kamphausen . islam , christianity battle for african souls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pentecostal-style revival tied to promises of miracles " miracles play a tremendous role , " he said .
" even fairly grounded pentecostal preachers say that there is no day that passes when some small miracle does n't occur . " in principle , chicanery has as much or as little to do with a true belief in the lourdes apparitions or any religion 's professed miracles , but still the theologian warned against such aggressive proselytizing by charismatic churches in africa that capitalize on local superstitions . the repercussions of such religious zeal could unleash conflicts with islam , the dominant faith in northern nigeria .
roughly half of all nigerians are muslim , 40 percent are christian and the remaining 10 percent are members of other faiths . " most churches which carry on their crusades in the north are dangerous and the tension between islam and christianity can only grow , " said kamphausen . thomas mösch , mansour bala bello and geraldo hoffmann -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite a series of sloppy passes in the first half , the goal was enough to earn him a hearty applause from the 44,500-strong crowd when he was rotated out after an hour of play . " in the first half we did n't move enough and that made the combination game suffer , " said national coach joachim löw .
" at half-time we asked ourselves how we could shake up this team , " he added . second-string strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a-team had a cleaner 2:0 win against wales on sept .

" there is no pressure on germany to go into the south , " de hoop scheffer said after meeting foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on thursday , sept .
13 . he repeated , however , that the alliance would prefer its member countries to put as few restrictions on the use of their troops as possible .
other nato members , including the united states and canada , have requested nations drop restrictions on where troops are deployed . " it is unfair to criticize germany ...
i am realistic , i understand the domestic political situation in germany , " de hoop scheffer said . " and it is not only in southern afghanistan where there is danger .
germany has also had casualties in the north . " two german police officers and a foreign ministry employee were killed by a bomb in kabul in august , bringing the german death toll in afghanistan to 25 soldiers and three police officers .

" we will maintain the predominance of our military presence in the north , and regarding the specific tasks , we will focus on training the afghan army , " steinmeier told reporters after meeting de hoop scheffer . the german army 's afghanistan mandates prevent it from being used in the south , where military casualties are higher .
there has been pressure on germany to lift this restriction , particularly to allow military instructors to accompany the afghan troops they have trained . germany has also sent six reconnaissance tornado jets to afghanistan to assist isaf operations throughout the country .
the german parliament will debate renewing the mandates this autumn . german chancellor angela merkel on wednesday pledged her country 's support for peacekeeping in afghanistan despite increasing opposition from german voters to the mission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer also met with german defense minister franz josef jung in berlin an opinion poll published by stern magazine on wednesday showed 52 percent of respondents in favor of withdrawing all german forces .
just 43 percent were in favor of them staying , compared with 60 percent two years ago . nato still necessary in kosovo de hoop scheffer and steinmeier also agreed the nato-led kfor force remained necessary for securing peace in kosovo . the nato head said the force provided a secure environment for the albanian majority in the serbian province and for the serbian minority . following failure to agree on kosovo 's final status at the united nations as a result of the threat of a russian veto in the security council , steinmeier said there was no alternative to the three-party talks on the future of the province , involving the united states , the european union and russia . a un mediation group has been given until dec .
10 to draw up a proposal for the future status of the serbian province , which has been under un administration since 1999 . " nobody is able to say whether this will be successful , " steinmeier said .

germany , however , never makes it anywhere near the top of any such list .
the country 's inhabitants have after all turned moaning and complaining in a national pastime that 's probably best practiced by those living in and around berlin .
southern germans seem to find it rather difficult to truly exceed at whining .
that 's why it 's a bit strange that a school in beautiful , picturesque heidelberg has now become the first one to take on the challenge of turning germans into happier people .
at one of the city 's high schools , some 60 students have started attending classes in happiness .
" we want to teach contentment , self-confidence and personal responsibility , " the school 's director , ernst fritz-schubert , told reporters , adding that often all that 's needed is a change of perspective : instead of saying : " i am lazy , " students should switch to " i 'm thinking about myself . "
the course 's lesson plan includes classes on " physical comfort " and " social competence " and aims to make students aware about themselves , their environment and society as a whole .
an actor and a relaxation therapist will also participate in some of the lesson units .
this would n't be germany , however , if students ' results were n't quantified , and grades will be issued in the happy class .
admittedly , there are two advantages to that : for one thing , " happiness " might help to improve the grade average on people 's high school diplomas .
and secondly , just in case they 're not that great at being happy , they 'll get something to complain about . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is no pressure on germany to go into the south , " de hoop scheffer said after meeting foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on thursday , sept .

other nato members , including the united states and canada , have requested nations drop restrictions on where troops are deployed . " it is unfair to criticize germany ...
i am realistic , i understand the domestic political situation in germany , " de hoop scheffer said . " and it is not only in southern afghanistan where there is danger .
germany has also had casualties in the north . " two german police officers and a foreign ministry employee were killed by a bomb in kabul in august , bringing the german death toll in afghanistan to 25 soldiers and three police officers .

there has been pressure on germany to lift this restriction , particularly to allow military instructors to accompany the afghan troops they have trained . germany has also sent six reconnaissance tornado jets to afghanistan to assist isaf operations throughout the country .

it limits the number of tanks , artillery , aircraft and helicopters stationed in europe .
russia announced in july that it no longer considered the treaty effective .
moscow said that the failure of nato countries to ratify the latest version of the treaty was the main reason for the decision .
but russian officials also said that a us plan to station parts of a new missile defense system in central european countries also played a role , reuters news service reported .
they consider the system a threat to russia 's national security .
nato members , meanwhile , have said that they will not ratify the latest cfe treaty version until russia withdraws its troops from the former soviet republics of moldova and georgia , which moscow promised to do in 1999 when the treaty was signed . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is also the seat of the continent 's fastest growing christian missions . from the most obscure , tiny district church to the high-tech cathedral and shopping area in the heart of the city , the charismatic appeal of pentecostal churches is ever present . one of the main features of this kind of church is the use of broadcast , print and the internet in spreading its message .
another is the practice of incorporating elements of traditional african culture , such as upbeat music , loud sermons , and above all , reinforcing deeply held beliefs in witchcraft and demons . every sunday , hundreds of thousands of followers seek spiritual enlightenment .
the faithful storm the myriad big and small churches throughout the city . evangelical churches reinforce traditional african beliefs this religious revival under banners which proclaim " mountain of fire and of wonder " or " redemption from the dead " has become a worldwide symbol for the huge success of evangelical churches in africa . bildunterschrift : lagos is the commercial capital of nigeria and the seat of christendom in africa there are 3.9 million followers of the pentecostal faith in nigeria , the third-highest ranking in the world , according to the world christian database in boston . brazil , which is primarily roman catholic , is the worldwide leader of evangelical pentecostal churches , with more than 24 million followers , while the united states has roughly 6 million adherents . what appeals to church followers is the promise of cures from poverty and disease through god 's blessing . ejiah ndifon , a nigerian engineer founded his own church , the royal kingdom citizen international , based on these ideas . " there are so many people who could have had bigger and better lives , but they could not achieve their destiny , because there was no one to lead them with a vision , " the self-declared prophet said .
" royal kingdom citizen offers this guidance , and brings people together with god . " the faithful believe those who discover the holy spirit will lead transformed lives and that sickness and misfortune can only befall heathens . the success of the pentecostal churches lies with the belief in a god who fights the evil of pandemic disease , according to erhard kamphausen , head of the academy of missions at the university of hamburg . " old superstitions , which were marginalized by more mainstream christian missionaries , have come around full circle , " kamphausen said .
" africans believe in miracles and witchcraft . " german crusader in africa reaches millions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german evangelist reinhard bonnke has led crusades for decades in africa they are n't alone .
german evangelist reinhard bonnke , who is known for his gospel crusades in nigeria , had an epiphany at the age of 9 and decided to devote his life to god . bonnke has held sermons in africa for nearly 30 years , and one of these massive mega-events was attended by 1.6 million followers .
earlier this year , another event was broadcast live on " god tv " by 200 countries , reaching an even broader audience and establishing his reputation as " undoubtedly the most successful missionary of our times . " the web site of the evangelist 's bible association " christ for all nations " sells books and other promotional material on supernatural intervention and miracle cures in seven languages .
a film series on dvd sells for 249 euros -lrb- $ 346 -rrb- . donation to the church tied with god 's blessing ayimah hondeh is a regular at the popular redeemed christian church of god in lagos .
she said she became a true believer on christmas eve 2005 . a young man had shoved her while she was waiting in line at a fast-food restaurant , and not wanting to provoke a fight , she switched to another queue .
shortly afterwards , some armed robbers stormed the restaurant and those in the first queue were injured , but hondeh was unharmed . " i believe it was god 's will , " she said . a few weeks before the pastor had reminded her congregation that god 's blessing was not guaranteed every year . " he said we had to pray twice as hard and double our donation to the church , " hondeh said .
" i quadrupled my contribution to the collection plate every sunday .
i know that god spared me on that day . " a donation tied to god 's blessing is business as usual for evangelical churches .
small wonder that efforts devoted to proselytizing focus on miracle cures , according to kamphausen . islam , christianity battle for african souls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pentecostal-style revival tied to promises of miracles " miracles play a tremendous role , " he said .
" even fairly grounded pentecostal preachers say that there is no day that passes when some small miracle does n't occur . " in principle , chicanery has as much or as little to do with a true belief in the lourdes apparitions or any religion 's professed miracles , but still the theologian warned against such aggressive proselytizing by charismatic churches in africa that capitalize on local superstitions . the repercussions of such religious zeal could unleash conflicts with islam , the dominant faith in northern nigeria .
roughly half of all nigerians are muslim , 40 percent are christian and the remaining 10 percent are members of other faiths . " most churches which carry on their crusades in the north are dangerous and the tension between islam and christianity can only grow , " said kamphausen . thomas mösch , mansour bala bello and geraldo hoffmann -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not much is known about him .

vladimir vladimirovich putin - the president with a kgb past .

he 's still far from being out of breath .
putin is already setting the course for the time after his departure .
nothing 's meant to go wrong .
by nominating the bland zubkov , the russian president has shown once again what kind of person he deems capable of leading a country that 's shaped by big economic successes and political problems : it 's either secret intelligence people with dubious pasts or technocrats , apolitical , dry figures , who are experts for something - agriculture , military or finance .
he just does n't want experienced , charismatic and democratically legitimated politicians who care about more than taking care of business .
putin banks on apolitical politicians .
with a bit of good will , it 's possible to write off the events in moscow as " normal procedure . "
of course , outside russia , the reasons for a change of government seem odd .
do you swap out a cabinet when elections are coming up ?
putin said that , ahead of parliamentary and presidential elections , the government should be ready to prepare the country for changes that are bound to happen .
the power structure has to be refreshed , he said .
that 's strange : if things happen in a democratic , free and fair way , a government faces the vote of the people and the population judges the accomplishments of the country 's leading elite , reconfirms it or votes it out of office .

but it 's not good news for democracy in the country , she adds . viktor zubkov 's the name of the rabbit that russian president vladmir putin pulled out of his hat .
as is customary for such magic tricks , the public is surprised , says " oh " and " ah " - and marvels .
who is this zubkov ?
not much is known about him .
he 's a finance expert , a putin confidant from the old days in st. petersburg .
he 's an inconspicuous guy in the second row .
a dark horse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz maybe that 's not even so important .
what is important is that putin has shown people the ropes once again .
he 's a politician who likes to present the public with riddles , who throws smoke grenades , who acts in secret and surprises people , showing the world that there 's only one person pulling the strings in russian domestic politics .
vladimir vladimirovich putin - the president with a kgb past .
his second and last term in office will be over in march 2008 , but people will have to continue to include him in the equation .
he 's still far from being out of breath .
putin is already setting the course for the time after his departure .
nothing 's meant to go wrong .
by nominating the bland zubkov , the russian president has shown once again what kind of person he deems capable of leading a country that 's shaped by big economic successes and political problems : it 's either secret intelligence people with dubious pasts or technocrats , apolitical , dry figures , who are experts for something - agriculture , military or finance .
he just does n't want experienced , charismatic and democratically legitimated politicians who care about more than taking care of business .
putin banks on apolitical politicians .
with a bit of good will , it 's possible to write off the events in moscow as " normal procedure . "
of course , outside russia , the reasons for a change of government seem odd .
do you swap out a cabinet when elections are coming up ?
putin said that , ahead of parliamentary and presidential elections , the government should be ready to prepare the country for changes that are bound to happen .
the power structure has to be refreshed , he said .
that 's strange : if things happen in a democratic , free and fair way , a government faces the vote of the people and the population judges the accomplishments of the country 's leading elite , reconfirms it or votes it out of office .
but russia 's pre-election time seems to be a time for political intrigues , tricks and deception .

13 , for police trainers to be deployed in southern afghanistan where alliance forces are dealing with an upsurge in violence and suicide bomb attacks by the taliban , al qaeda and local warlords .
the request comes at a time when the eu 's special police training mission is also hampered by complaints of inadequate eu planning and insufficient nato security support .
german head of eu mission to quit this week , the german interior ministry confirmed that brigadier general friedrich eichele is returning to germany just months after he was appointed to head the eu training mission in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich eichele is returning home to germany eichele , a former commander of the german federal police 's elite gsg 9 counter-terrorism unit , is said to be returning to oversee reforms of the domestic police force .
but , according to german newsmagazine der spiegel , tensions with the eu 's special envoy to afghanistan , francesc vendrell , are the actual reasons behind eichele 's early exit .
vendrell reportedly wanted political control of the mission , something that eichele opposed .
the german embassy in kabul described eichele as simply " overburdened , " the magazine said .
mission plagued by trouble eichele 's early departure reflects the difficulties in trying to establish the mission of 190 european trainers in afghanistan at a time when an increase in violence and suicide attacks by the taliban and al qaeda has raised pressure on isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- countries to scale down their afghan troop presence .
last month , three german police officers responsible for protecting the german ambassador to afghanistan died and a fourth was injured when their vehicles were blown up on a road to the east of kabul .
germany has some 3,000 troops stationed in afghanistan , mostly in the relatively stable north of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf soldiers investigate the scene of an explosion that killed three german police officers until a few months ago , germany was considered to be leading the way in training afghan police and border guards .
it was in charge of the police training from 2002 until this year .
that was one of the reasons why , when the eu took over the mission in june , the top post remained in german hands .
like germany , several eu members , some of whom are also part of nato , have police and military working in afghanistan under separate civil and military mandates .
trainers , incentives missing but in recent months , the training mission has faltered , with critics saying it 's been underfunded , understaffed and poorly prepared .
the european commission has still not approved the budget for armored cars , computers and office equipment for the mission headquarters in kabul , according to news reports .
in addition , the mission has gotten off to a slow start , with reports saying not enough european police trainers or afghan participants have turned up .
some 90 trainers were expected to come from 21 nations , but eu member states have so far provided only half the personnel .
germany has promised up to 60 officials but still has n't delivered on its promise .
der spiegel reported last month that officials have not resolved how to keep newly trained afghan police officers and soldiers from joining the taliban , local militia leaders or drug barons , all of whom offer better pay than the government in kabul .
eu ill prepared , poor nato security ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the eu 's efforts to train the afghan army and police are falling short the mission has also been hampered by nato-member turkey 's blocking of an agreement to regulate cooperation between the alliance and the eu in afghanistan .
turkey has tried to curb military cooperation between the two because the european union has refused to guarantee cypriot officers would not participate .
but nato spokesman james appathurai denied suggestions that nato support for the eu police trainers was inadequate .
" nato has been providing support to the european police in afghanistan , and we can not imagine that nato will provide any less support to the eu police than it does to other organizations such as the united nations , " he said .
on wednesday , nato 's top civilian official in afghanistan , daan everts , said the eu is still not fully contributing to international efforts to bring peace and the rule of law to afghanistan , with incompetence and corruption rife among local afghan forces . " that has to be addressed in a more concerted and forceful manner , " everts said during a news conference .
other observers questioned whether the eu was properly prepared to coordinate operations so far away from its national borders .
" it seems that the eu was not really properly prepared for such a complex mission , " ronja kempin , an afghanistan expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told the international herald tribune this week .

but it 's not good news for democracy in the country , she adds . viktor zubkov 's the name of the rabbit that russian president vladmir putin pulled out of his hat .
as is customary for such magic tricks , the public is surprised , says " oh " and " ah " - and marvels .
who is this zubkov ?
not much is known about him .
he 's a finance expert , a putin confidant from the old days in st. petersburg .
he 's an inconspicuous guy in the second row .
a dark horse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz maybe that 's not even so important .
what is important is that putin has shown people the ropes once again .
he 's a politician who likes to present the public with riddles , who throws smoke grenades , who acts in secret and surprises people , showing the world that there 's only one person pulling the strings in russian domestic politics .
vladimir vladimirovich putin - the president with a kgb past .
his second and last term in office will be over in march 2008 , but people will have to continue to include him in the equation .
he 's still far from being out of breath .
putin is already setting the course for the time after his departure .
nothing 's meant to go wrong .
by nominating the bland zubkov , the russian president has shown once again what kind of person he deems capable of leading a country that 's shaped by big economic successes and political problems : it 's either secret intelligence people with dubious pasts or technocrats , apolitical , dry figures , who are experts for something - agriculture , military or finance .
he just does n't want experienced , charismatic and democratically legitimated politicians who care about more than taking care of business .
putin banks on apolitical politicians .
with a bit of good will , it 's possible to write off the events in moscow as " normal procedure . "
of course , outside russia , the reasons for a change of government seem odd .
do you swap out a cabinet when elections are coming up ?
putin said that , ahead of parliamentary and presidential elections , the government should be ready to prepare the country for changes that are bound to happen .
the power structure has to be refreshed , he said .
that 's strange : if things happen in a democratic , free and fair way , a government faces the vote of the people and the population judges the accomplishments of the country 's leading elite , reconfirms it or votes it out of office .
but russia 's pre-election time seems to be a time for political intrigues , tricks and deception .
that bodes ill .

he is also deputy head of the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- core values commission .
dw-world.de : membership of germany 's mainstream parties has been steadily dwindling .
if this trend continues , does it mean their days are numbered ?
thomas meyer : membership is on the decline , so in this respect the role of the mainstream parties is changing .
more parties are needed in order to form government coalitions , and there are more parties in the party system , which inevitably means the system is changing .
does that the fact that the mainstream parties are shrinking mean that the state has a more limited power to act ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's two-party administration is nothing compared to other coalitions no , not directly .
many countries have stable democracies despite having many more parties .
government coalitions might need four or five parties .
the process of forming a coalition might be trickier , but it by no means weakens the state .
the social democrats are suffering the sharpest decline in membership .
why is this ?
right now , the spd 's role is an especially difficult one .
the party is trapped between a christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- which has shifted to the left and appears to be adopting some of the social democrats ' traditional positions , and the new left party which is occupying what used to be the social democrats ' far-left ground .
sandwiched between these two poles , the party is having trouble maintaining its identity and remaining on the offensive .
to what extent is the left party responsible for the crisis within the spd ?
the left party is , to some extent , an expression of this crisis .
it is partly made up of left-wing party members whom the spd was unable to integrate into its policies and political style .
its founding is definitely one of the factors contributing to the spd 's crisis .
are lafontaine and co . -lsb- former spd members who left to establish an alternative party , the left -rsb- luring voters away from the spd ?
definitely , to some extent .
if the left party attracts ten percent of voters then a large part , if not the majority of these voters , are bound to be disappointed spd voters .
on the whole , the left party stands for traditional spd positions while the cdu stands for neo-liberal spd positions .
meanwhile , the greens are further left than the spd on social and economic issues .
is there any political ground the spd can still claim as its own ?
that description is a little too pat .
the cdu is trying to muscle in on some sdp territory , but the neo-liberal elements of the cdu political agenda are still intact .
the left party has moved in on some of the spd past positions , which had become politically untenable .
stuck in the middle , the sdp is unable to assert itself .
but basically , this would not be impossible were the party to better push through its social democratic positions , which are in fact perfectly viable right now .
within the grand coalition , the cdu is increasingly to the left of the spd .
does the cdu have a social conscience ?
the cdu has always been contradictory , poised between the social elements drawn from its catholic social doctrine , and the neo-liberal , political substance based on the party 's economic principles .
it can show either one of these faces according to election results and public opinion .
for now , after the last , very close election , in which the party fared far worse than it had expected to , it is making an effort to show its social face .
does the sdp still have a loyal base ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor unions , seen here on strike , are a traditional spd base yes it does , but all the parties are seeing their bases shrink .
the number of swing voters is on the rise .
that hits other parties as much as it does the spd .
any young people with political ideals no longer join the political parties but ngos instead - as illustrated by the scenes at the g8 we all saw on television .
why are the political parties no longer so attractive to young people ?
many young people prefer smaller-scale organizations , where they feel they might have some effect and which are concerned with just one or two issues they can easily follow .
they feel that the mainstream parties , and large-scale organizations in general , are too anonymous , concerned with too many issues and too willing to compromise .
the result is that young people are not terribly interested in the parties in their current form .
top spd politicians matthias platzeck , peer steinbrück and frank-walter steinmeier recently published their book " auf der höhe der zeit " about social democracy and progress in the 21st century .
one of the key terms in the book is the " careful welfare state . "
what 's new about this concept ?
basically , the idea is to adopt certain elements of the scandinavian welfare state , primarily with more investment in education , more equal opportunities within education , low-risk political strategies which allow people to thrive in today 's changing society and therefore depend on less long-term welfare support .
basically , it 's a very sensible project but not necessarily a new one .
parts of it already featured in the spd 's berlin program in 1989 .
but in this more extensive version it sets new foci and will serve as the cornerstone of the spd 's new party platform .
the spd will unveil its new policy statements in october .
can we expect anything new ?
there will be a number of new foci : the careful welfare state , a strong emphasis on the environment , especially in the area of climate policy , a strong emphasis on europe and globalization policies .
we wo n't be seeing a new spd but there will be a greater , better and more offensive emphasis on building the foundations for social democracy in the age of globalization .
spd chief kurt beck is not doing too well in the popularity stakes .
does the spd need a media star like gerhard schröder to front it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has n't captured germany 's imagination in the past we have seen that politicians such as helmut kohl , did badly in the opinion polls but were still elected because they had certain persuasive characteristics and persuasive platforms .
beck may well find himself in a similar position .
surveys are not the same as elections , and for the time being it remains to be seen whether beck can mobilize support .
but the next elections are still a long way off .
in the last election , observers said that merkel would never be as media savvy as schröder .
but a look at current opinion polls suggests that she has managed to cut an even better figure within the media than her predecessor .
is that true ?
merkel has managed to create a very good media presence .
she 's accepted both by the public and the media .
it 's helped that she 's concentrated heavily on foreign policy .
it 's always easy to boost popularity with foreign policy : it 's not controversial domestically , and it always looks good to be seen with top international politicians .
that also goes to show that certain politicians can grow into their role , and if they are given the opportunity , they can gain unexpected support . interview by fengbo wang -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is also deputy head of the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- core values commission .
dw-world.de : membership of germany 's mainstream parties has been steadily dwindling .
if this trend continues , does it mean their days are numbered ?
thomas meyer : membership is on the decline , so in this respect the role of the mainstream parties is changing .
more parties are needed in order to form government coalitions , and there are more parties in the party system , which inevitably means the system is changing .
does that the fact that the mainstream parties are shrinking mean that the state has a more limited power to act ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's two-party administration is nothing compared to other coalitions no , not directly .
many countries have stable democracies despite having many more parties .
government coalitions might need four or five parties .
the process of forming a coalition might be trickier , but it by no means weakens the state .
the social democrats are suffering the sharpest decline in membership .
why is this ?
right now , the spd 's role is an especially difficult one .
the party is trapped between a christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- which has shifted to the left and appears to be adopting some of the social democrats ' traditional positions , and the new left party which is occupying what used to be the social democrats ' far-left ground .
sandwiched between these two poles , the party is having trouble maintaining its identity and remaining on the offensive .
to what extent is the left party responsible for the crisis within the spd ?
the left party is , to some extent , an expression of this crisis .
it is partly made up of left-wing party members whom the spd was unable to integrate into its policies and political style .
its founding is definitely one of the factors contributing to the spd 's crisis .
are lafontaine and co . -lsb- former spd members who left to establish an alternative party , the left -rsb- luring voters away from the spd ?
definitely , to some extent .
if the left party attracts ten percent of voters then a large part , if not the majority of these voters , are bound to be disappointed spd voters .
on the whole , the left party stands for traditional spd positions while the cdu stands for neo-liberal spd positions .
meanwhile , the greens are further left than the spd on social and economic issues .
is there any political ground the spd can still claim as its own ?
that description is a little too pat .
the cdu is trying to muscle in on some sdp territory , but the neo-liberal elements of the cdu political agenda are still intact .
the left party has moved in on some of the spd past positions , which had become politically untenable .
stuck in the middle , the sdp is unable to assert itself .
but basically , this would not be impossible were the party to better push through its social democratic positions , which are in fact perfectly viable right now .
within the grand coalition , the cdu is increasingly to the left of the spd .
does the cdu have a social conscience ?
the cdu has always been contradictory , poised between the social elements drawn from its catholic social doctrine , and the neo-liberal , political substance based on the party 's economic principles .
it can show either one of these faces according to election results and public opinion .

the result is that young people are not terribly interested in the parties in their current form .
top spd politicians matthias platzeck , peer steinbrück and frank-walter steinmeier recently published their book " auf der höhe der zeit " about social democracy and progress in the 21st century .
one of the key terms in the book is the " careful welfare state . "
what 's new about this concept ?
basically , the idea is to adopt certain elements of the scandinavian welfare state , primarily with more investment in education , more equal opportunities within education , low-risk political strategies which allow people to thrive in today 's changing society and therefore depend on less long-term welfare support .
basically , it 's a very sensible project but not necessarily a new one .
parts of it already featured in the spd 's berlin program in 1989 .
but in this more extensive version it sets new foci and will serve as the cornerstone of the spd 's new party platform .
the spd will unveil its new policy statements in october .
can we expect anything new ?
there will be a number of new foci : the careful welfare state , a strong emphasis on the environment , especially in the area of climate policy , a strong emphasis on europe and globalization policies .
we wo n't be seeing a new spd but there will be a greater , better and more offensive emphasis on building the foundations for social democracy in the age of globalization .
spd chief kurt beck is not doing too well in the popularity stakes .
does the spd need a media star like gerhard schröder to front it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has n't captured germany 's imagination in the past we have seen that politicians such as helmut kohl , did badly in the opinion polls but were still elected because they had certain persuasive characteristics and persuasive platforms .
beck may well find himself in a similar position .
surveys are not the same as elections , and for the time being it remains to be seen whether beck can mobilize support .
but the next elections are still a long way off .
in the last election , observers said that merkel would never be as media savvy as schröder .
but a look at current opinion polls suggests that she has managed to cut an even better figure within the media than her predecessor .
is that true ?
merkel has managed to create a very good media presence .
she 's accepted both by the public and the media .
it 's helped that she 's concentrated heavily on foreign policy .
it 's always easy to boost popularity with foreign policy : it 's not controversial domestically , and it always looks good to be seen with top international politicians .
that also goes to show that certain politicians can grow into their role , and if they are given the opportunity , they can gain unexpected support . interview by fengbo wang -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is also deputy head of the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- core values commission .
dw-world.de : membership of germany 's mainstream parties has been steadily dwindling .
if this trend continues , does it mean their days are numbered ?
thomas meyer : membership is on the decline , so in this respect the role of the mainstream parties is changing .
more parties are needed in order to form government coalitions , and there are more parties in the party system , which inevitably means the system is changing .
does that the fact that the mainstream parties are shrinking mean that the state has a more limited power to act ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's two-party administration is nothing compared to other coalitions no , not directly .
many countries have stable democracies despite having many more parties .
government coalitions might need four or five parties .
the process of forming a coalition might be trickier , but it by no means weakens the state .
the social democrats are suffering the sharpest decline in membership .
why is this ?
right now , the spd 's role is an especially difficult one .
the party is trapped between a christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- which has shifted to the left and appears to be adopting some of the social democrats ' traditional positions , and the new left party which is occupying what used to be the social democrats ' far-left ground .
sandwiched between these two poles , the party is having trouble maintaining its identity and remaining on the offensive .
to what extent is the left party responsible for the crisis within the spd ?
the left party is , to some extent , an expression of this crisis .
it is partly made up of left-wing party members whom the spd was unable to integrate into its policies and political style .
its founding is definitely one of the factors contributing to the spd 's crisis .
are lafontaine and co . -lsb- former spd members who left to establish an alternative party , the left -rsb- luring voters away from the spd ?
definitely , to some extent .
if the left party attracts ten percent of voters then a large part , if not the majority of these voters , are bound to be disappointed spd voters .
on the whole , the left party stands for traditional spd positions while the cdu stands for neo-liberal spd positions .
meanwhile , the greens are further left than the spd on social and economic issues .
is there any political ground the spd can still claim as its own ?
that description is a little too pat .
the cdu is trying to muscle in on some sdp territory , but the neo-liberal elements of the cdu political agenda are still intact .
the left party has moved in on some of the spd past positions , which had become politically untenable .
stuck in the middle , the sdp is unable to assert itself .
but basically , this would not be impossible were the party to better push through its social democratic positions , which are in fact perfectly viable right now .
within the grand coalition , the cdu is increasingly to the left of the spd .
does the cdu have a social conscience ?
the cdu has always been contradictory , poised between the social elements drawn from its catholic social doctrine , and the neo-liberal , political substance based on the party 's economic principles .
it can show either one of these faces according to election results and public opinion .
for now , after the last , very close election , in which the party fared far worse than it had expected to , it is making an effort to show its social face .
does the sdp still have a loyal base ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor unions , seen here on strike , are a traditional spd base yes it does , but all the parties are seeing their bases shrink .
the number of swing voters is on the rise .
that hits other parties as much as it does the spd .
any young people with political ideals no longer join the political parties but ngos instead - as illustrated by the scenes at the g8 we all saw on television .
why are the political parties no longer so attractive to young people ?
many young people prefer smaller-scale organizations , where they feel they might have some effect and which are concerned with just one or two issues they can easily follow .
they feel that the mainstream parties , and large-scale organizations in general , are too anonymous , concerned with too many issues and too willing to compromise .

the spd will unveil its new policy statements in october .
can we expect anything new ?
there will be a number of new foci : the careful welfare state , a strong emphasis on the environment , especially in the area of climate policy , a strong emphasis on europe and globalization policies .
we wo n't be seeing a new spd but there will be a greater , better and more offensive emphasis on building the foundations for social democracy in the age of globalization .
spd chief kurt beck is not doing too well in the popularity stakes .
does the spd need a media star like gerhard schröder to front it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has n't captured germany 's imagination in the past we have seen that politicians such as helmut kohl , did badly in the opinion polls but were still elected because they had certain persuasive characteristics and persuasive platforms .
beck may well find himself in a similar position .
surveys are not the same as elections , and for the time being it remains to be seen whether beck can mobilize support .
but the next elections are still a long way off .
in the last election , observers said that merkel would never be as media savvy as schröder .
but a look at current opinion polls suggests that she has managed to cut an even better figure within the media than her predecessor .
is that true ?
merkel has managed to create a very good media presence .
she 's accepted both by the public and the media .
it 's helped that she 's concentrated heavily on foreign policy .
it 's always easy to boost popularity with foreign policy : it 's not controversial domestically , and it always looks good to be seen with top international politicians .
that also goes to show that certain politicians can grow into their role , and if they are given the opportunity , they can gain unexpected support . interview by fengbo wang -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite a series of sloppy passes in the first half , the goal was enough to earn him a hearty applause from the 44,500-strong crowd when he was rotated out after an hour of play . " in the first half we did n't move enough and that made the combination game suffer , " said national coach joachim löw .

odonkor first score in an international match was " assisted " with a fumble by the visiting goalie danut dumitru coman . lukas podolski secured the germans ' 2:1 lead with a final goal in the 82nd minute - his 23rd score in the 40 international games he 's played . though the " alternative 11 " did n't quite shine as bright as the a-team did during the recent victories against england -lrb- 2:1 -rrb- and wales -lrb- 2:0 -rrb- , they managed to claim revenge for germany 's embarrassing 1:5 loss against romania in april 2004 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany , however , never makes it anywhere near the top of any such list .
the country 's inhabitants have after all turned moaning and complaining in a national pastime that 's probably best practiced by those living in and around berlin .
southern germans seem to find it rather difficult to truly exceed at whining .
that 's why it 's a bit strange that a school in beautiful , picturesque heidelberg has now become the first one to take on the challenge of turning germans into happier people .
at one of the city 's high schools , some 60 students have started attending classes in happiness .
" we want to teach contentment , self-confidence and personal responsibility , " the school 's director , ernst fritz-schubert , told reporters , adding that often all that 's needed is a change of perspective : instead of saying : " i am lazy , " students should switch to " i 'm thinking about myself . "
the course 's lesson plan includes classes on " physical comfort " and " social competence " and aims to make students aware about themselves , their environment and society as a whole .
an actor and a relaxation therapist will also participate in some of the lesson units .
this would n't be germany , however , if students ' results were n't quantified , and grades will be issued in the happy class .
admittedly , there are two advantages to that : for one thing , " happiness " might help to improve the grade average on people 's high school diplomas .
and secondly , just in case they 're not that great at being happy , they 'll get something to complain about . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : germany 's political parties in crisis germany 's political parties in crisis german parties begin early search for future partners expert says germany 's parties must reinvent themselves cdu puts new twist on conservative politics politics -pipe- 13.09.2007 germany 's social democratic party struggles to redefine its role großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other political parties are hanging over the spd like dark clouds dw-world.de spoke with political scientist thomas meyer about the social democratic party 's current identity crisis and where it can go from here . thomas meyer is a political scientist at dortmund university and director of the friedrich ebert foundation 's political academy .
he is also deputy head of the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- core values commission .
dw-world.de : membership of germany 's mainstream parties has been steadily dwindling .
if this trend continues , does it mean their days are numbered ?
thomas meyer : membership is on the decline , so in this respect the role of the mainstream parties is changing .
more parties are needed in order to form government coalitions , and there are more parties in the party system , which inevitably means the system is changing .
does that the fact that the mainstream parties are shrinking mean that the state has a more limited power to act ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's two-party administration is nothing compared to other coalitions no , not directly .
many countries have stable democracies despite having many more parties .
government coalitions might need four or five parties .
the process of forming a coalition might be trickier , but it by no means weakens the state .
the social democrats are suffering the sharpest decline in membership .
why is this ?
right now , the spd 's role is an especially difficult one .
the party is trapped between a christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- which has shifted to the left and appears to be adopting some of the social democrats ' traditional positions , and the new left party which is occupying what used to be the social democrats ' far-left ground .
sandwiched between these two poles , the party is having trouble maintaining its identity and remaining on the offensive .
to what extent is the left party responsible for the crisis within the spd ?
the left party is , to some extent , an expression of this crisis .
it is partly made up of left-wing party members whom the spd was unable to integrate into its policies and political style .
its founding is definitely one of the factors contributing to the spd 's crisis .
are lafontaine and co . -lsb- former spd members who left to establish an alternative party , the left -rsb- luring voters away from the spd ?
definitely , to some extent .
if the left party attracts ten percent of voters then a large part , if not the majority of these voters , are bound to be disappointed spd voters .
on the whole , the left party stands for traditional spd positions while the cdu stands for neo-liberal spd positions .
meanwhile , the greens are further left than the spd on social and economic issues .
is there any political ground the spd can still claim as its own ?
that description is a little too pat .
the cdu is trying to muscle in on some sdp territory , but the neo-liberal elements of the cdu political agenda are still intact .
the left party has moved in on some of the spd past positions , which had become politically untenable .
stuck in the middle , the sdp is unable to assert itself .
but basically , this would not be impossible were the party to better push through its social democratic positions , which are in fact perfectly viable right now .
within the grand coalition , the cdu is increasingly to the left of the spd .
does the cdu have a social conscience ?
the cdu has always been contradictory , poised between the social elements drawn from its catholic social doctrine , and the neo-liberal , political substance based on the party 's economic principles .
it can show either one of these faces according to election results and public opinion .
for now , after the last , very close election , in which the party fared far worse than it had expected to , it is making an effort to show its social face .
does the sdp still have a loyal base ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor unions , seen here on strike , are a traditional spd base yes it does , but all the parties are seeing their bases shrink .
the number of swing voters is on the rise .
that hits other parties as much as it does the spd .
any young people with political ideals no longer join the political parties but ngos instead - as illustrated by the scenes at the g8 we all saw on television .
why are the political parties no longer so attractive to young people ?
many young people prefer smaller-scale organizations , where they feel they might have some effect and which are concerned with just one or two issues they can easily follow .
they feel that the mainstream parties , and large-scale organizations in general , are too anonymous , concerned with too many issues and too willing to compromise .
the result is that young people are not terribly interested in the parties in their current form .
top spd politicians matthias platzeck , peer steinbrück and frank-walter steinmeier recently published their book " auf der höhe der zeit " about social democracy and progress in the 21st century .
one of the key terms in the book is the " careful welfare state . "
what 's new about this concept ?
basically , the idea is to adopt certain elements of the scandinavian welfare state , primarily with more investment in education , more equal opportunities within education , low-risk political strategies which allow people to thrive in today 's changing society and therefore depend on less long-term welfare support .
basically , it 's a very sensible project but not necessarily a new one .
parts of it already featured in the spd 's berlin program in 1989 .
but in this more extensive version it sets new foci and will serve as the cornerstone of the spd 's new party platform .
the spd will unveil its new policy statements in october .
can we expect anything new ?
there will be a number of new foci : the careful welfare state , a strong emphasis on the environment , especially in the area of climate policy , a strong emphasis on europe and globalization policies .
we wo n't be seeing a new spd but there will be a greater , better and more offensive emphasis on building the foundations for social democracy in the age of globalization .
spd chief kurt beck is not doing too well in the popularity stakes .
does the spd need a media star like gerhard schröder to front it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has n't captured germany 's imagination in the past we have seen that politicians such as helmut kohl , did badly in the opinion polls but were still elected because they had certain persuasive characteristics and persuasive platforms .
beck may well find himself in a similar position .
surveys are not the same as elections , and for the time being it remains to be seen whether beck can mobilize support .
but the next elections are still a long way off .
in the last election , observers said that merkel would never be as media savvy as schröder .
but a look at current opinion polls suggests that she has managed to cut an even better figure within the media than her predecessor .
is that true ?
merkel has managed to create a very good media presence .
she 's accepted both by the public and the media .
it 's helped that she 's concentrated heavily on foreign policy .
it 's always easy to boost popularity with foreign policy : it 's not controversial domestically , and it always looks good to be seen with top international politicians .
that also goes to show that certain politicians can grow into their role , and if they are given the opportunity , they can gain unexpected support . interview by fengbo wang -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is also deputy head of the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- core values commission .
dw-world.de : membership of germany 's mainstream parties has been steadily dwindling .
if this trend continues , does it mean their days are numbered ?
thomas meyer : membership is on the decline , so in this respect the role of the mainstream parties is changing .
more parties are needed in order to form government coalitions , and there are more parties in the party system , which inevitably means the system is changing .
does that the fact that the mainstream parties are shrinking mean that the state has a more limited power to act ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's two-party administration is nothing compared to other coalitions no , not directly .
many countries have stable democracies despite having many more parties .
government coalitions might need four or five parties .
the process of forming a coalition might be trickier , but it by no means weakens the state .
the social democrats are suffering the sharpest decline in membership .
why is this ?
right now , the spd 's role is an especially difficult one .
the party is trapped between a christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- which has shifted to the left and appears to be adopting some of the social democrats ' traditional positions , and the new left party which is occupying what used to be the social democrats ' far-left ground .
sandwiched between these two poles , the party is having trouble maintaining its identity and remaining on the offensive .
to what extent is the left party responsible for the crisis within the spd ?
the left party is , to some extent , an expression of this crisis .
it is partly made up of left-wing party members whom the spd was unable to integrate into its policies and political style .
its founding is definitely one of the factors contributing to the spd 's crisis .
are lafontaine and co . -lsb- former spd members who left to establish an alternative party , the left -rsb- luring voters away from the spd ?
definitely , to some extent .
if the left party attracts ten percent of voters then a large part , if not the majority of these voters , are bound to be disappointed spd voters .
on the whole , the left party stands for traditional spd positions while the cdu stands for neo-liberal spd positions .
meanwhile , the greens are further left than the spd on social and economic issues .
is there any political ground the spd can still claim as its own ?
that description is a little too pat .
the cdu is trying to muscle in on some sdp territory , but the neo-liberal elements of the cdu political agenda are still intact .
the left party has moved in on some of the spd past positions , which had become politically untenable .
stuck in the middle , the sdp is unable to assert itself .
but basically , this would not be impossible were the party to better push through its social democratic positions , which are in fact perfectly viable right now .
within the grand coalition , the cdu is increasingly to the left of the spd .
does the cdu have a social conscience ?
the cdu has always been contradictory , poised between the social elements drawn from its catholic social doctrine , and the neo-liberal , political substance based on the party 's economic principles .
it can show either one of these faces according to election results and public opinion .
for now , after the last , very close election , in which the party fared far worse than it had expected to , it is making an effort to show its social face .
does the sdp still have a loyal base ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor unions , seen here on strike , are a traditional spd base yes it does , but all the parties are seeing their bases shrink .
the number of swing voters is on the rise .
that hits other parties as much as it does the spd .
any young people with political ideals no longer join the political parties but ngos instead - as illustrated by the scenes at the g8 we all saw on television .
why are the political parties no longer so attractive to young people ?
many young people prefer smaller-scale organizations , where they feel they might have some effect and which are concerned with just one or two issues they can easily follow .
they feel that the mainstream parties , and large-scale organizations in general , are too anonymous , concerned with too many issues and too willing to compromise .
the result is that young people are not terribly interested in the parties in their current form .
top spd politicians matthias platzeck , peer steinbrück and frank-walter steinmeier recently published their book " auf der höhe der zeit " about social democracy and progress in the 21st century .
one of the key terms in the book is the " careful welfare state . "
what 's new about this concept ?
basically , the idea is to adopt certain elements of the scandinavian welfare state , primarily with more investment in education , more equal opportunities within education , low-risk political strategies which allow people to thrive in today 's changing society and therefore depend on less long-term welfare support .
basically , it 's a very sensible project but not necessarily a new one .
parts of it already featured in the spd 's berlin program in 1989 .
but in this more extensive version it sets new foci and will serve as the cornerstone of the spd 's new party platform .
the spd will unveil its new policy statements in october .
can we expect anything new ?
there will be a number of new foci : the careful welfare state , a strong emphasis on the environment , especially in the area of climate policy , a strong emphasis on europe and globalization policies .
we wo n't be seeing a new spd but there will be a greater , better and more offensive emphasis on building the foundations for social democracy in the age of globalization .
spd chief kurt beck is not doing too well in the popularity stakes .
does the spd need a media star like gerhard schröder to front it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has n't captured germany 's imagination in the past we have seen that politicians such as helmut kohl , did badly in the opinion polls but were still elected because they had certain persuasive characteristics and persuasive platforms .
beck may well find himself in a similar position .
surveys are not the same as elections , and for the time being it remains to be seen whether beck can mobilize support .
but the next elections are still a long way off .
in the last election , observers said that merkel would never be as media savvy as schröder .
but a look at current opinion polls suggests that she has managed to cut an even better figure within the media than her predecessor .
is that true ?
merkel has managed to create a very good media presence .
she 's accepted both by the public and the media .
it 's helped that she 's concentrated heavily on foreign policy .
it 's always easy to boost popularity with foreign policy : it 's not controversial domestically , and it always looks good to be seen with top international politicians .
that also goes to show that certain politicians can grow into their role , and if they are given the opportunity , they can gain unexpected support . interview by fengbo wang -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its german head is returning home just months after his appointment . jaap de hoop scheffer is set to ask germany on thursday , sept .
13 , for police trainers to be deployed in southern afghanistan where alliance forces are dealing with an upsurge in violence and suicide bomb attacks by the taliban , al qaeda and local warlords .
the request comes at a time when the eu 's special police training mission is also hampered by complaints of inadequate eu planning and insufficient nato security support .
german head of eu mission to quit this week , the german interior ministry confirmed that brigadier general friedrich eichele is returning to germany just months after he was appointed to head the eu training mission in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich eichele is returning home to germany eichele , a former commander of the german federal police 's elite gsg 9 counter-terrorism unit , is said to be returning to oversee reforms of the domestic police force .
but , according to german newsmagazine der spiegel , tensions with the eu 's special envoy to afghanistan , francesc vendrell , are the actual reasons behind eichele 's early exit .
vendrell reportedly wanted political control of the mission , something that eichele opposed .
the german embassy in kabul described eichele as simply " overburdened , " the magazine said .
mission plagued by trouble eichele 's early departure reflects the difficulties in trying to establish the mission of 190 european trainers in afghanistan at a time when an increase in violence and suicide attacks by the taliban and al qaeda has raised pressure on isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- countries to scale down their afghan troop presence .
last month , three german police officers responsible for protecting the german ambassador to afghanistan died and a fourth was injured when their vehicles were blown up on a road to the east of kabul .
germany has some 3,000 troops stationed in afghanistan , mostly in the relatively stable north of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf soldiers investigate the scene of an explosion that killed three german police officers until a few months ago , germany was considered to be leading the way in training afghan police and border guards .
it was in charge of the police training from 2002 until this year .
that was one of the reasons why , when the eu took over the mission in june , the top post remained in german hands .
like germany , several eu members , some of whom are also part of nato , have police and military working in afghanistan under separate civil and military mandates .
trainers , incentives missing but in recent months , the training mission has faltered , with critics saying it 's been underfunded , understaffed and poorly prepared .
the european commission has still not approved the budget for armored cars , computers and office equipment for the mission headquarters in kabul , according to news reports .
in addition , the mission has gotten off to a slow start , with reports saying not enough european police trainers or afghan participants have turned up .
some 90 trainers were expected to come from 21 nations , but eu member states have so far provided only half the personnel .
germany has promised up to 60 officials but still has n't delivered on its promise .
der spiegel reported last month that officials have not resolved how to keep newly trained afghan police officers and soldiers from joining the taliban , local militia leaders or drug barons , all of whom offer better pay than the government in kabul .
eu ill prepared , poor nato security ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the eu 's efforts to train the afghan army and police are falling short the mission has also been hampered by nato-member turkey 's blocking of an agreement to regulate cooperation between the alliance and the eu in afghanistan .
turkey has tried to curb military cooperation between the two because the european union has refused to guarantee cypriot officers would not participate .
but nato spokesman james appathurai denied suggestions that nato support for the eu police trainers was inadequate .
" nato has been providing support to the european police in afghanistan , and we can not imagine that nato will provide any less support to the eu police than it does to other organizations such as the united nations , " he said .
on wednesday , nato 's top civilian official in afghanistan , daan everts , said the eu is still not fully contributing to international efforts to bring peace and the rule of law to afghanistan , with incompetence and corruption rife among local afghan forces . " that has to be addressed in a more concerted and forceful manner , " everts said during a news conference .
other observers questioned whether the eu was properly prepared to coordinate operations so far away from its national borders .
" it seems that the eu was not really properly prepared for such a complex mission , " ronja kempin , an afghanistan expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told the international herald tribune this week .
" the eu seemed to have rushed into setting up this mission , " kempin said , adding that massive corruption in the afghan interior ministry compounded the troubles . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it 's not good news for democracy in the country , she adds . viktor zubkov 's the name of the rabbit that russian president vladmir putin pulled out of his hat .
as is customary for such magic tricks , the public is surprised , says " oh " and " ah " - and marvels .
who is this zubkov ?
not much is known about him .
he 's a finance expert , a putin confidant from the old days in st. petersburg .
he 's an inconspicuous guy in the second row .
a dark horse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz maybe that 's not even so important .
what is important is that putin has shown people the ropes once again .
he 's a politician who likes to present the public with riddles , who throws smoke grenades , who acts in secret and surprises people , showing the world that there 's only one person pulling the strings in russian domestic politics .
vladimir vladimirovich putin - the president with a kgb past .
his second and last term in office will be over in march 2008 , but people will have to continue to include him in the equation .
he 's still far from being out of breath .
putin is already setting the course for the time after his departure .
nothing 's meant to go wrong .
by nominating the bland zubkov , the russian president has shown once again what kind of person he deems capable of leading a country that 's shaped by big economic successes and political problems : it 's either secret intelligence people with dubious pasts or technocrats , apolitical , dry figures , who are experts for something - agriculture , military or finance .
he just does n't want experienced , charismatic and democratically legitimated politicians who care about more than taking care of business .
putin banks on apolitical politicians .
with a bit of good will , it 's possible to write off the events in moscow as " normal procedure . "
of course , outside russia , the reasons for a change of government seem odd .
do you swap out a cabinet when elections are coming up ?
putin said that , ahead of parliamentary and presidential elections , the government should be ready to prepare the country for changes that are bound to happen .
the power structure has to be refreshed , he said .
that 's strange : if things happen in a democratic , free and fair way , a government faces the vote of the people and the population judges the accomplishments of the country 's leading elite , reconfirms it or votes it out of office .
but russia 's pre-election time seems to be a time for political intrigues , tricks and deception .
that bodes ill .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : germany 's political parties in crisis germany 's political parties in crisis german parties begin early search for future partners expert says germany 's parties must reinvent themselves cdu puts new twist on conservative politics politics -pipe- 13.09.2007 germany 's social democratic party struggles to redefine its role großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other political parties are hanging over the spd like dark clouds dw-world.de spoke with political scientist thomas meyer about the social democratic party 's current identity crisis and where it can go from here . thomas meyer is a political scientist at dortmund university and director of the friedrich ebert foundation 's political academy .
he is also deputy head of the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- core values commission .
dw-world.de : membership of germany 's mainstream parties has been steadily dwindling .
if this trend continues , does it mean their days are numbered ?
thomas meyer : membership is on the decline , so in this respect the role of the mainstream parties is changing .
more parties are needed in order to form government coalitions , and there are more parties in the party system , which inevitably means the system is changing .
does that the fact that the mainstream parties are shrinking mean that the state has a more limited power to act ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's two-party administration is nothing compared to other coalitions no , not directly .
many countries have stable democracies despite having many more parties .
government coalitions might need four or five parties .
the process of forming a coalition might be trickier , but it by no means weakens the state .
the social democrats are suffering the sharpest decline in membership .
why is this ?
right now , the spd 's role is an especially difficult one .
the party is trapped between a christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- which has shifted to the left and appears to be adopting some of the social democrats ' traditional positions , and the new left party which is occupying what used to be the social democrats ' far-left ground .
sandwiched between these two poles , the party is having trouble maintaining its identity and remaining on the offensive .
to what extent is the left party responsible for the crisis within the spd ?
the left party is , to some extent , an expression of this crisis .
it is partly made up of left-wing party members whom the spd was unable to integrate into its policies and political style .
its founding is definitely one of the factors contributing to the spd 's crisis .
are lafontaine and co . -lsb- former spd members who left to establish an alternative party , the left -rsb- luring voters away from the spd ?
definitely , to some extent .
if the left party attracts ten percent of voters then a large part , if not the majority of these voters , are bound to be disappointed spd voters .
on the whole , the left party stands for traditional spd positions while the cdu stands for neo-liberal spd positions .
meanwhile , the greens are further left than the spd on social and economic issues .
is there any political ground the spd can still claim as its own ?
that description is a little too pat .
the cdu is trying to muscle in on some sdp territory , but the neo-liberal elements of the cdu political agenda are still intact .
the left party has moved in on some of the spd past positions , which had become politically untenable .
stuck in the middle , the sdp is unable to assert itself .
but basically , this would not be impossible were the party to better push through its social democratic positions , which are in fact perfectly viable right now .
within the grand coalition , the cdu is increasingly to the left of the spd .
does the cdu have a social conscience ?
the cdu has always been contradictory , poised between the social elements drawn from its catholic social doctrine , and the neo-liberal , political substance based on the party 's economic principles .
it can show either one of these faces according to election results and public opinion .
for now , after the last , very close election , in which the party fared far worse than it had expected to , it is making an effort to show its social face .
does the sdp still have a loyal base ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor unions , seen here on strike , are a traditional spd base yes it does , but all the parties are seeing their bases shrink .
the number of swing voters is on the rise .
that hits other parties as much as it does the spd .
any young people with political ideals no longer join the political parties but ngos instead - as illustrated by the scenes at the g8 we all saw on television .
why are the political parties no longer so attractive to young people ?
many young people prefer smaller-scale organizations , where they feel they might have some effect and which are concerned with just one or two issues they can easily follow .
they feel that the mainstream parties , and large-scale organizations in general , are too anonymous , concerned with too many issues and too willing to compromise .
the result is that young people are not terribly interested in the parties in their current form .
top spd politicians matthias platzeck , peer steinbrück and frank-walter steinmeier recently published their book " auf der höhe der zeit " about social democracy and progress in the 21st century .
one of the key terms in the book is the " careful welfare state . "
what 's new about this concept ?
basically , the idea is to adopt certain elements of the scandinavian welfare state , primarily with more investment in education , more equal opportunities within education , low-risk political strategies which allow people to thrive in today 's changing society and therefore depend on less long-term welfare support .
basically , it 's a very sensible project but not necessarily a new one .
parts of it already featured in the spd 's berlin program in 1989 .
but in this more extensive version it sets new foci and will serve as the cornerstone of the spd 's new party platform .
the spd will unveil its new policy statements in october .
can we expect anything new ?
there will be a number of new foci : the careful welfare state , a strong emphasis on the environment , especially in the area of climate policy , a strong emphasis on europe and globalization policies .
we wo n't be seeing a new spd but there will be a greater , better and more offensive emphasis on building the foundations for social democracy in the age of globalization .
spd chief kurt beck is not doing too well in the popularity stakes .
does the spd need a media star like gerhard schröder to front it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has n't captured germany 's imagination in the past we have seen that politicians such as helmut kohl , did badly in the opinion polls but were still elected because they had certain persuasive characteristics and persuasive platforms .
beck may well find himself in a similar position .
surveys are not the same as elections , and for the time being it remains to be seen whether beck can mobilize support .
but the next elections are still a long way off .
in the last election , observers said that merkel would never be as media savvy as schröder .
but a look at current opinion polls suggests that she has managed to cut an even better figure within the media than her predecessor .
is that true ?
merkel has managed to create a very good media presence .
she 's accepted both by the public and the media .
it 's helped that she 's concentrated heavily on foreign policy .
it 's always easy to boost popularity with foreign policy : it 's not controversial domestically , and it always looks good to be seen with top international politicians .
that also goes to show that certain politicians can grow into their role , and if they are given the opportunity , they can gain unexpected support . interview by fengbo wang -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is also the seat of the continent 's fastest growing christian missions . from the most obscure , tiny district church to the high-tech cathedral and shopping area in the heart of the city , the charismatic appeal of pentecostal churches is ever present . one of the main features of this kind of church is the use of broadcast , print and the internet in spreading its message .
another is the practice of incorporating elements of traditional african culture , such as upbeat music , loud sermons , and above all , reinforcing deeply held beliefs in witchcraft and demons . every sunday , hundreds of thousands of followers seek spiritual enlightenment .
the faithful storm the myriad big and small churches throughout the city . evangelical churches reinforce traditional african beliefs this religious revival under banners which proclaim " mountain of fire and of wonder " or " redemption from the dead " has become a worldwide symbol for the huge success of evangelical churches in africa . bildunterschrift : lagos is the commercial capital of nigeria and the seat of christendom in africa there are 3.9 million followers of the pentecostal faith in nigeria , the third-highest ranking in the world , according to the world christian database in boston . brazil , which is primarily roman catholic , is the worldwide leader of evangelical pentecostal churches , with more than 24 million followers , while the united states has roughly 6 million adherents . what appeals to church followers is the promise of cures from poverty and disease through god 's blessing . ejiah ndifon , a nigerian engineer founded his own church , the royal kingdom citizen international , based on these ideas . " there are so many people who could have had bigger and better lives , but they could not achieve their destiny , because there was no one to lead them with a vision , " the self-declared prophet said .
" royal kingdom citizen offers this guidance , and brings people together with god . " the faithful believe those who discover the holy spirit will lead transformed lives and that sickness and misfortune can only befall heathens . the success of the pentecostal churches lies with the belief in a god who fights the evil of pandemic disease , according to erhard kamphausen , head of the academy of missions at the university of hamburg . " old superstitions , which were marginalized by more mainstream christian missionaries , have come around full circle , " kamphausen said .
" africans believe in miracles and witchcraft . " german crusader in africa reaches millions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german evangelist reinhard bonnke has led crusades for decades in africa they are n't alone .
german evangelist reinhard bonnke , who is known for his gospel crusades in nigeria , had an epiphany at the age of 9 and decided to devote his life to god . bonnke has held sermons in africa for nearly 30 years , and one of these massive mega-events was attended by 1.6 million followers .
earlier this year , another event was broadcast live on " god tv " by 200 countries , reaching an even broader audience and establishing his reputation as " undoubtedly the most successful missionary of our times . " the web site of the evangelist 's bible association " christ for all nations " sells books and other promotional material on supernatural intervention and miracle cures in seven languages .
a film series on dvd sells for 249 euros -lrb- $ 346 -rrb- . donation to the church tied with god 's blessing ayimah hondeh is a regular at the popular redeemed christian church of god in lagos .
she said she became a true believer on christmas eve 2005 . a young man had shoved her while she was waiting in line at a fast-food restaurant , and not wanting to provoke a fight , she switched to another queue .
shortly afterwards , some armed robbers stormed the restaurant and those in the first queue were injured , but hondeh was unharmed . " i believe it was god 's will , " she said . a few weeks before the pastor had reminded her congregation that god 's blessing was not guaranteed every year . " he said we had to pray twice as hard and double our donation to the church , " hondeh said .
" i quadrupled my contribution to the collection plate every sunday .
i know that god spared me on that day . " a donation tied to god 's blessing is business as usual for evangelical churches .
small wonder that efforts devoted to proselytizing focus on miracle cures , according to kamphausen . islam , christianity battle for african souls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pentecostal-style revival tied to promises of miracles " miracles play a tremendous role , " he said .
" even fairly grounded pentecostal preachers say that there is no day that passes when some small miracle does n't occur . " in principle , chicanery has as much or as little to do with a true belief in the lourdes apparitions or any religion 's professed miracles , but still the theologian warned against such aggressive proselytizing by charismatic churches in africa that capitalize on local superstitions . the repercussions of such religious zeal could unleash conflicts with islam , the dominant faith in northern nigeria .
roughly half of all nigerians are muslim , 40 percent are christian and the remaining 10 percent are members of other faiths .

he is also deputy head of the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- core values commission .
dw-world.de : membership of germany 's mainstream parties has been steadily dwindling .
if this trend continues , does it mean their days are numbered ?
thomas meyer : membership is on the decline , so in this respect the role of the mainstream parties is changing .
more parties are needed in order to form government coalitions , and there are more parties in the party system , which inevitably means the system is changing .
does that the fact that the mainstream parties are shrinking mean that the state has a more limited power to act ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's two-party administration is nothing compared to other coalitions no , not directly .
many countries have stable democracies despite having many more parties .
government coalitions might need four or five parties .
the process of forming a coalition might be trickier , but it by no means weakens the state .
the social democrats are suffering the sharpest decline in membership .
why is this ?
right now , the spd 's role is an especially difficult one .
the party is trapped between a christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- which has shifted to the left and appears to be adopting some of the social democrats ' traditional positions , and the new left party which is occupying what used to be the social democrats ' far-left ground .
sandwiched between these two poles , the party is having trouble maintaining its identity and remaining on the offensive .
to what extent is the left party responsible for the crisis within the spd ?
the left party is , to some extent , an expression of this crisis .
it is partly made up of left-wing party members whom the spd was unable to integrate into its policies and political style .
its founding is definitely one of the factors contributing to the spd 's crisis .
are lafontaine and co . -lsb- former spd members who left to establish an alternative party , the left -rsb- luring voters away from the spd ?
definitely , to some extent .
if the left party attracts ten percent of voters then a large part , if not the majority of these voters , are bound to be disappointed spd voters .
on the whole , the left party stands for traditional spd positions while the cdu stands for neo-liberal spd positions .
meanwhile , the greens are further left than the spd on social and economic issues .
is there any political ground the spd can still claim as its own ?
that description is a little too pat .
the cdu is trying to muscle in on some sdp territory , but the neo-liberal elements of the cdu political agenda are still intact .
the left party has moved in on some of the spd past positions , which had become politically untenable .
stuck in the middle , the sdp is unable to assert itself .
but basically , this would not be impossible were the party to better push through its social democratic positions , which are in fact perfectly viable right now .
within the grand coalition , the cdu is increasingly to the left of the spd .
does the cdu have a social conscience ?
the cdu has always been contradictory , poised between the social elements drawn from its catholic social doctrine , and the neo-liberal , political substance based on the party 's economic principles .
it can show either one of these faces according to election results and public opinion .
for now , after the last , very close election , in which the party fared far worse than it had expected to , it is making an effort to show its social face .
does the sdp still have a loyal base ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor unions , seen here on strike , are a traditional spd base yes it does , but all the parties are seeing their bases shrink .
the number of swing voters is on the rise .
that hits other parties as much as it does the spd .
any young people with political ideals no longer join the political parties but ngos instead - as illustrated by the scenes at the g8 we all saw on television .
why are the political parties no longer so attractive to young people ?
many young people prefer smaller-scale organizations , where they feel they might have some effect and which are concerned with just one or two issues they can easily follow .
they feel that the mainstream parties , and large-scale organizations in general , are too anonymous , concerned with too many issues and too willing to compromise .
the result is that young people are not terribly interested in the parties in their current form .
top spd politicians matthias platzeck , peer steinbrück and frank-walter steinmeier recently published their book " auf der höhe der zeit " about social democracy and progress in the 21st century .
one of the key terms in the book is the " careful welfare state . "
what 's new about this concept ?
basically , the idea is to adopt certain elements of the scandinavian welfare state , primarily with more investment in education , more equal opportunities within education , low-risk political strategies which allow people to thrive in today 's changing society and therefore depend on less long-term welfare support .
basically , it 's a very sensible project but not necessarily a new one .
parts of it already featured in the spd 's berlin program in 1989 .
but in this more extensive version it sets new foci and will serve as the cornerstone of the spd 's new party platform .
the spd will unveil its new policy statements in october .
can we expect anything new ?
there will be a number of new foci : the careful welfare state , a strong emphasis on the environment , especially in the area of climate policy , a strong emphasis on europe and globalization policies .
we wo n't be seeing a new spd but there will be a greater , better and more offensive emphasis on building the foundations for social democracy in the age of globalization .
spd chief kurt beck is not doing too well in the popularity stakes .
does the spd need a media star like gerhard schröder to front it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has n't captured germany 's imagination in the past we have seen that politicians such as helmut kohl , did badly in the opinion polls but were still elected because they had certain persuasive characteristics and persuasive platforms .
beck may well find himself in a similar position .
surveys are not the same as elections , and for the time being it remains to be seen whether beck can mobilize support .
but the next elections are still a long way off .
in the last election , observers said that merkel would never be as media savvy as schröder .
but a look at current opinion polls suggests that she has managed to cut an even better figure within the media than her predecessor .
is that true ?
merkel has managed to create a very good media presence .
she 's accepted both by the public and the media .
it 's helped that she 's concentrated heavily on foreign policy .
it 's always easy to boost popularity with foreign policy : it 's not controversial domestically , and it always looks good to be seen with top international politicians .
that also goes to show that certain politicians can grow into their role , and if they are given the opportunity , they can gain unexpected support . interview by fengbo wang -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its german head is returning home just months after his appointment . jaap de hoop scheffer is set to ask germany on thursday , sept .
13 , for police trainers to be deployed in southern afghanistan where alliance forces are dealing with an upsurge in violence and suicide bomb attacks by the taliban , al qaeda and local warlords .
the request comes at a time when the eu 's special police training mission is also hampered by complaints of inadequate eu planning and insufficient nato security support .
german head of eu mission to quit this week , the german interior ministry confirmed that brigadier general friedrich eichele is returning to germany just months after he was appointed to head the eu training mission in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich eichele is returning home to germany eichele , a former commander of the german federal police 's elite gsg 9 counter-terrorism unit , is said to be returning to oversee reforms of the domestic police force .
but , according to german newsmagazine der spiegel , tensions with the eu 's special envoy to afghanistan , francesc vendrell , are the actual reasons behind eichele 's early exit .
vendrell reportedly wanted political control of the mission , something that eichele opposed .
the german embassy in kabul described eichele as simply " overburdened , " the magazine said .
mission plagued by trouble eichele 's early departure reflects the difficulties in trying to establish the mission of 190 european trainers in afghanistan at a time when an increase in violence and suicide attacks by the taliban and al qaeda has raised pressure on isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- countries to scale down their afghan troop presence .
last month , three german police officers responsible for protecting the german ambassador to afghanistan died and a fourth was injured when their vehicles were blown up on a road to the east of kabul .
germany has some 3,000 troops stationed in afghanistan , mostly in the relatively stable north of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf soldiers investigate the scene of an explosion that killed three german police officers until a few months ago , germany was considered to be leading the way in training afghan police and border guards .
it was in charge of the police training from 2002 until this year .
that was one of the reasons why , when the eu took over the mission in june , the top post remained in german hands .
like germany , several eu members , some of whom are also part of nato , have police and military working in afghanistan under separate civil and military mandates .
trainers , incentives missing but in recent months , the training mission has faltered , with critics saying it 's been underfunded , understaffed and poorly prepared .
the european commission has still not approved the budget for armored cars , computers and office equipment for the mission headquarters in kabul , according to news reports .
in addition , the mission has gotten off to a slow start , with reports saying not enough european police trainers or afghan participants have turned up .
some 90 trainers were expected to come from 21 nations , but eu member states have so far provided only half the personnel .
germany has promised up to 60 officials but still has n't delivered on its promise .
der spiegel reported last month that officials have not resolved how to keep newly trained afghan police officers and soldiers from joining the taliban , local militia leaders or drug barons , all of whom offer better pay than the government in kabul .
eu ill prepared , poor nato security ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the eu 's efforts to train the afghan army and police are falling short the mission has also been hampered by nato-member turkey 's blocking of an agreement to regulate cooperation between the alliance and the eu in afghanistan .
turkey has tried to curb military cooperation between the two because the european union has refused to guarantee cypriot officers would not participate .
but nato spokesman james appathurai denied suggestions that nato support for the eu police trainers was inadequate .
" nato has been providing support to the european police in afghanistan , and we can not imagine that nato will provide any less support to the eu police than it does to other organizations such as the united nations , " he said .
on wednesday , nato 's top civilian official in afghanistan , daan everts , said the eu is still not fully contributing to international efforts to bring peace and the rule of law to afghanistan , with incompetence and corruption rife among local afghan forces . " that has to be addressed in a more concerted and forceful manner , " everts said during a news conference .
other observers questioned whether the eu was properly prepared to coordinate operations so far away from its national borders .
" it seems that the eu was not really properly prepared for such a complex mission , " ronja kempin , an afghanistan expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told the international herald tribune this week .
" the eu seemed to have rushed into setting up this mission , " kempin said , adding that massive corruption in the afghan interior ministry compounded the troubles . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" royal kingdom citizen offers this guidance , and brings people together with god . " the faithful believe those who discover the holy spirit will lead transformed lives and that sickness and misfortune can only befall heathens . the success of the pentecostal churches lies with the belief in a god who fights the evil of pandemic disease , according to erhard kamphausen , head of the academy of missions at the university of hamburg .

german evangelist reinhard bonnke , who is known for his gospel crusades in nigeria , had an epiphany at the age of 9 and decided to devote his life to god . bonnke has held sermons in africa for nearly 30 years , and one of these massive mega-events was attended by 1.6 million followers .
earlier this year , another event was broadcast live on " god tv " by 200 countries , reaching an even broader audience and establishing his reputation as " undoubtedly the most successful missionary of our times . " the web site of the evangelist 's bible association " christ for all nations " sells books and other promotional material on supernatural intervention and miracle cures in seven languages .

shortly afterwards , some armed robbers stormed the restaurant and those in the first queue were injured , but hondeh was unharmed . " i believe it was god 's will , " she said . a few weeks before the pastor had reminded her congregation that god 's blessing was not guaranteed every year . " he said we had to pray twice as hard and double our donation to the church , " hondeh said .
" i quadrupled my contribution to the collection plate every sunday .
i know that god spared me on that day . " a donation tied to god 's blessing is business as usual for evangelical churches .

" even fairly grounded pentecostal preachers say that there is no day that passes when some small miracle does n't occur .

its german head is returning home just months after his appointment . jaap de hoop scheffer is set to ask germany on thursday , sept .
13 , for police trainers to be deployed in southern afghanistan where alliance forces are dealing with an upsurge in violence and suicide bomb attacks by the taliban , al qaeda and local warlords .
the request comes at a time when the eu 's special police training mission is also hampered by complaints of inadequate eu planning and insufficient nato security support .
german head of eu mission to quit this week , the german interior ministry confirmed that brigadier general friedrich eichele is returning to germany just months after he was appointed to head the eu training mission in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich eichele is returning home to germany eichele , a former commander of the german federal police 's elite gsg 9 counter-terrorism unit , is said to be returning to oversee reforms of the domestic police force .
but , according to german newsmagazine der spiegel , tensions with the eu 's special envoy to afghanistan , francesc vendrell , are the actual reasons behind eichele 's early exit .
vendrell reportedly wanted political control of the mission , something that eichele opposed .
the german embassy in kabul described eichele as simply " overburdened , " the magazine said .
mission plagued by trouble eichele 's early departure reflects the difficulties in trying to establish the mission of 190 european trainers in afghanistan at a time when an increase in violence and suicide attacks by the taliban and al qaeda has raised pressure on isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- countries to scale down their afghan troop presence .
last month , three german police officers responsible for protecting the german ambassador to afghanistan died and a fourth was injured when their vehicles were blown up on a road to the east of kabul .
germany has some 3,000 troops stationed in afghanistan , mostly in the relatively stable north of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf soldiers investigate the scene of an explosion that killed three german police officers until a few months ago , germany was considered to be leading the way in training afghan police and border guards .
it was in charge of the police training from 2002 until this year .
that was one of the reasons why , when the eu took over the mission in june , the top post remained in german hands .
like germany , several eu members , some of whom are also part of nato , have police and military working in afghanistan under separate civil and military mandates .
trainers , incentives missing but in recent months , the training mission has faltered , with critics saying it 's been underfunded , understaffed and poorly prepared .
the european commission has still not approved the budget for armored cars , computers and office equipment for the mission headquarters in kabul , according to news reports .
in addition , the mission has gotten off to a slow start , with reports saying not enough european police trainers or afghan participants have turned up .
some 90 trainers were expected to come from 21 nations , but eu member states have so far provided only half the personnel .
germany has promised up to 60 officials but still has n't delivered on its promise .
der spiegel reported last month that officials have not resolved how to keep newly trained afghan police officers and soldiers from joining the taliban , local militia leaders or drug barons , all of whom offer better pay than the government in kabul .
eu ill prepared , poor nato security ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the eu 's efforts to train the afghan army and police are falling short the mission has also been hampered by nato-member turkey 's blocking of an agreement to regulate cooperation between the alliance and the eu in afghanistan .
turkey has tried to curb military cooperation between the two because the european union has refused to guarantee cypriot officers would not participate .
but nato spokesman james appathurai denied suggestions that nato support for the eu police trainers was inadequate .
" nato has been providing support to the european police in afghanistan , and we can not imagine that nato will provide any less support to the eu police than it does to other organizations such as the united nations , " he said .
on wednesday , nato 's top civilian official in afghanistan , daan everts , said the eu is still not fully contributing to international efforts to bring peace and the rule of law to afghanistan , with incompetence and corruption rife among local afghan forces . " that has to be addressed in a more concerted and forceful manner , " everts said during a news conference .
other observers questioned whether the eu was properly prepared to coordinate operations so far away from its national borders .
" it seems that the eu was not really properly prepared for such a complex mission , " ronja kempin , an afghanistan expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told the international herald tribune this week .
" the eu seemed to have rushed into setting up this mission , " kempin said , adding that massive corruption in the afghan interior ministry compounded the troubles . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is also the seat of the continent 's fastest growing christian missions . from the most obscure , tiny district church to the high-tech cathedral and shopping area in the heart of the city , the charismatic appeal of pentecostal churches is ever present . one of the main features of this kind of church is the use of broadcast , print and the internet in spreading its message .
another is the practice of incorporating elements of traditional african culture , such as upbeat music , loud sermons , and above all , reinforcing deeply held beliefs in witchcraft and demons . every sunday , hundreds of thousands of followers seek spiritual enlightenment .
the faithful storm the myriad big and small churches throughout the city . evangelical churches reinforce traditional african beliefs this religious revival under banners which proclaim " mountain of fire and of wonder " or " redemption from the dead " has become a worldwide symbol for the huge success of evangelical churches in africa . bildunterschrift : lagos is the commercial capital of nigeria and the seat of christendom in africa there are 3.9 million followers of the pentecostal faith in nigeria , the third-highest ranking in the world , according to the world christian database in boston . brazil , which is primarily roman catholic , is the worldwide leader of evangelical pentecostal churches , with more than 24 million followers , while the united states has roughly 6 million adherents . what appeals to church followers is the promise of cures from poverty and disease through god 's blessing . ejiah ndifon , a nigerian engineer founded his own church , the royal kingdom citizen international , based on these ideas . " there are so many people who could have had bigger and better lives , but they could not achieve their destiny , because there was no one to lead them with a vision , " the self-declared prophet said .
" royal kingdom citizen offers this guidance , and brings people together with god . " the faithful believe those who discover the holy spirit will lead transformed lives and that sickness and misfortune can only befall heathens . the success of the pentecostal churches lies with the belief in a god who fights the evil of pandemic disease , according to erhard kamphausen , head of the academy of missions at the university of hamburg . " old superstitions , which were marginalized by more mainstream christian missionaries , have come around full circle , " kamphausen said .
" africans believe in miracles and witchcraft . " german crusader in africa reaches millions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german evangelist reinhard bonnke has led crusades for decades in africa they are n't alone .
german evangelist reinhard bonnke , who is known for his gospel crusades in nigeria , had an epiphany at the age of 9 and decided to devote his life to god . bonnke has held sermons in africa for nearly 30 years , and one of these massive mega-events was attended by 1.6 million followers .
earlier this year , another event was broadcast live on " god tv " by 200 countries , reaching an even broader audience and establishing his reputation as " undoubtedly the most successful missionary of our times . " the web site of the evangelist 's bible association " christ for all nations " sells books and other promotional material on supernatural intervention and miracle cures in seven languages .
a film series on dvd sells for 249 euros -lrb- $ 346 -rrb- . donation to the church tied with god 's blessing ayimah hondeh is a regular at the popular redeemed christian church of god in lagos .
she said she became a true believer on christmas eve 2005 . a young man had shoved her while she was waiting in line at a fast-food restaurant , and not wanting to provoke a fight , she switched to another queue .
shortly afterwards , some armed robbers stormed the restaurant and those in the first queue were injured , but hondeh was unharmed . " i believe it was god 's will , " she said . a few weeks before the pastor had reminded her congregation that god 's blessing was not guaranteed every year . " he said we had to pray twice as hard and double our donation to the church , " hondeh said .
" i quadrupled my contribution to the collection plate every sunday .
i know that god spared me on that day . " a donation tied to god 's blessing is business as usual for evangelical churches .
small wonder that efforts devoted to proselytizing focus on miracle cures , according to kamphausen . islam , christianity battle for african souls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pentecostal-style revival tied to promises of miracles " miracles play a tremendous role , " he said .
" even fairly grounded pentecostal preachers say that there is no day that passes when some small miracle does n't occur . " in principle , chicanery has as much or as little to do with a true belief in the lourdes apparitions or any religion 's professed miracles , but still the theologian warned against such aggressive proselytizing by charismatic churches in africa that capitalize on local superstitions . the repercussions of such religious zeal could unleash conflicts with islam , the dominant faith in northern nigeria .
roughly half of all nigerians are muslim , 40 percent are christian and the remaining 10 percent are members of other faiths . " most churches which carry on their crusades in the north are dangerous and the tension between islam and christianity can only grow , " said kamphausen . thomas mösch , mansour bala bello and geraldo hoffmann -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany , however , never makes it anywhere near the top of any such list .
the country 's inhabitants have after all turned moaning and complaining in a national pastime that 's probably best practiced by those living in and around berlin .
southern germans seem to find it rather difficult to truly exceed at whining .
that 's why it 's a bit strange that a school in beautiful , picturesque heidelberg has now become the first one to take on the challenge of turning germans into happier people .
at one of the city 's high schools , some 60 students have started attending classes in happiness .
" we want to teach contentment , self-confidence and personal responsibility , " the school 's director , ernst fritz-schubert , told reporters , adding that often all that 's needed is a change of perspective : instead of saying : " i am lazy , " students should switch to " i 'm thinking about myself . "
the course 's lesson plan includes classes on " physical comfort " and " social competence " and aims to make students aware about themselves , their environment and society as a whole .
an actor and a relaxation therapist will also participate in some of the lesson units .
this would n't be germany , however , if students ' results were n't quantified , and grades will be issued in the happy class .
admittedly , there are two advantages to that : for one thing , " happiness " might help to improve the grade average on people 's high school diplomas .

it 's survival is threatened since russia decided to pull out . speaking in the german parliament on wednesday , sept .
12 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that germany could not permit the treaty , which is aimed at limiting conventional arms and was developed over a long period of time , to be dissolved .
" i will be just as annoyed as you if this treaty is suspended , " steinmeier told lawmakers , adding that the conference in berlin would try to " rebuild lost trust . "
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 and updated in 1999 .
it limits the number of tanks , artillery , aircraft and helicopters stationed in europe .
russia announced in july that it no longer considered the treaty effective .
moscow said that the failure of nato countries to ratify the latest version of the treaty was the main reason for the decision .
but russian officials also said that a us plan to station parts of a new missile defense system in central european countries also played a role , reuters news service reported .
they consider the system a threat to russia 's national security .
nato members , meanwhile , have said that they will not ratify the latest cfe treaty version until russia withdraws its troops from the former soviet republics of moldova and georgia , which moscow promised to do in 1999 when the treaty was signed . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as is customary for such magic tricks , the public is surprised , says " oh " and " ah " - and marvels .
who is this zubkov ?
not much is known about him .
he 's a finance expert , a putin confidant from the old days in st. petersburg .
he 's an inconspicuous guy in the second row .
a dark horse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz maybe that 's not even so important .
what is important is that putin has shown people the ropes once again .
he 's a politician who likes to present the public with riddles , who throws smoke grenades , who acts in secret and surprises people , showing the world that there 's only one person pulling the strings in russian domestic politics .
vladimir vladimirovich putin - the president with a kgb past .
his second and last term in office will be over in march 2008 , but people will have to continue to include him in the equation .
he 's still far from being out of breath .
putin is already setting the course for the time after his departure .
nothing 's meant to go wrong .
by nominating the bland zubkov , the russian president has shown once again what kind of person he deems capable of leading a country that 's shaped by big economic successes and political problems : it 's either secret intelligence people with dubious pasts or technocrats , apolitical , dry figures , who are experts for something - agriculture , military or finance .
he just does n't want experienced , charismatic and democratically legitimated politicians who care about more than taking care of business .

with a bit of good will , it 's possible to write off the events in moscow as " normal procedure . "
of course , outside russia , the reasons for a change of government seem odd .
do you swap out a cabinet when elections are coming up ?
putin said that , ahead of parliamentary and presidential elections , the government should be ready to prepare the country for changes that are bound to happen .
the power structure has to be refreshed , he said .
that 's strange : if things happen in a democratic , free and fair way , a government faces the vote of the people and the population judges the accomplishments of the country 's leading elite , reconfirms it or votes it out of office .

germany , however , never makes it anywhere near the top of any such list .
the country 's inhabitants have after all turned moaning and complaining in a national pastime that 's probably best practiced by those living in and around berlin .
southern germans seem to find it rather difficult to truly exceed at whining .
that 's why it 's a bit strange that a school in beautiful , picturesque heidelberg has now become the first one to take on the challenge of turning germans into happier people .
at one of the city 's high schools , some 60 students have started attending classes in happiness .
" we want to teach contentment , self-confidence and personal responsibility , " the school 's director , ernst fritz-schubert , told reporters , adding that often all that 's needed is a change of perspective : instead of saying : " i am lazy , " students should switch to " i 'm thinking about myself . "
the course 's lesson plan includes classes on " physical comfort " and " social competence " and aims to make students aware about themselves , their environment and society as a whole .
an actor and a relaxation therapist will also participate in some of the lesson units .
this would n't be germany , however , if students ' results were n't quantified , and grades will be issued in the happy class .
admittedly , there are two advantages to that : for one thing , " happiness " might help to improve the grade average on people 's high school diplomas .
and secondly , just in case they 're not that great at being happy , they 'll get something to complain about . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

vendrell reportedly wanted political control of the mission , something that eichele opposed .
the german embassy in kabul described eichele as simply " overburdened , " the magazine said .
mission plagued by trouble eichele 's early departure reflects the difficulties in trying to establish the mission of 190 european trainers in afghanistan at a time when an increase in violence and suicide attacks by the taliban and al qaeda has raised pressure on isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- countries to scale down their afghan troop presence .
last month , three german police officers responsible for protecting the german ambassador to afghanistan died and a fourth was injured when their vehicles were blown up on a road to the east of kabul .

" nato has been providing support to the european police in afghanistan , and we can not imagine that nato will provide any less support to the eu police than it does to other organizations such as the united nations , " he said .

its german head is returning home just months after his appointment . jaap de hoop scheffer is set to ask germany on thursday , sept .
13 , for police trainers to be deployed in southern afghanistan where alliance forces are dealing with an upsurge in violence and suicide bomb attacks by the taliban , al qaeda and local warlords .
the request comes at a time when the eu 's special police training mission is also hampered by complaints of inadequate eu planning and insufficient nato security support .
german head of eu mission to quit this week , the german interior ministry confirmed that brigadier general friedrich eichele is returning to germany just months after he was appointed to head the eu training mission in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich eichele is returning home to germany eichele , a former commander of the german federal police 's elite gsg 9 counter-terrorism unit , is said to be returning to oversee reforms of the domestic police force .
but , according to german newsmagazine der spiegel , tensions with the eu 's special envoy to afghanistan , francesc vendrell , are the actual reasons behind eichele 's early exit .
vendrell reportedly wanted political control of the mission , something that eichele opposed .
the german embassy in kabul described eichele as simply " overburdened , " the magazine said .
mission plagued by trouble eichele 's early departure reflects the difficulties in trying to establish the mission of 190 european trainers in afghanistan at a time when an increase in violence and suicide attacks by the taliban and al qaeda has raised pressure on isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- countries to scale down their afghan troop presence .
last month , three german police officers responsible for protecting the german ambassador to afghanistan died and a fourth was injured when their vehicles were blown up on a road to the east of kabul .
germany has some 3,000 troops stationed in afghanistan , mostly in the relatively stable north of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf soldiers investigate the scene of an explosion that killed three german police officers until a few months ago , germany was considered to be leading the way in training afghan police and border guards .
it was in charge of the police training from 2002 until this year .
that was one of the reasons why , when the eu took over the mission in june , the top post remained in german hands .
like germany , several eu members , some of whom are also part of nato , have police and military working in afghanistan under separate civil and military mandates .
trainers , incentives missing but in recent months , the training mission has faltered , with critics saying it 's been underfunded , understaffed and poorly prepared .
the european commission has still not approved the budget for armored cars , computers and office equipment for the mission headquarters in kabul , according to news reports .
in addition , the mission has gotten off to a slow start , with reports saying not enough european police trainers or afghan participants have turned up .
some 90 trainers were expected to come from 21 nations , but eu member states have so far provided only half the personnel .
germany has promised up to 60 officials but still has n't delivered on its promise .
der spiegel reported last month that officials have not resolved how to keep newly trained afghan police officers and soldiers from joining the taliban , local militia leaders or drug barons , all of whom offer better pay than the government in kabul .
eu ill prepared , poor nato security ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the eu 's efforts to train the afghan army and police are falling short the mission has also been hampered by nato-member turkey 's blocking of an agreement to regulate cooperation between the alliance and the eu in afghanistan .
turkey has tried to curb military cooperation between the two because the european union has refused to guarantee cypriot officers would not participate .
but nato spokesman james appathurai denied suggestions that nato support for the eu police trainers was inadequate .
" nato has been providing support to the european police in afghanistan , and we can not imagine that nato will provide any less support to the eu police than it does to other organizations such as the united nations , " he said .
on wednesday , nato 's top civilian official in afghanistan , daan everts , said the eu is still not fully contributing to international efforts to bring peace and the rule of law to afghanistan , with incompetence and corruption rife among local afghan forces . " that has to be addressed in a more concerted and forceful manner , " everts said during a news conference .
other observers questioned whether the eu was properly prepared to coordinate operations so far away from its national borders .
" it seems that the eu was not really properly prepared for such a complex mission , " ronja kempin , an afghanistan expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told the international herald tribune this week .
" the eu seemed to have rushed into setting up this mission , " kempin said , adding that massive corruption in the afghan interior ministry compounded the troubles . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german embassy in kabul described eichele as simply " overburdened , " the magazine said .
mission plagued by trouble eichele 's early departure reflects the difficulties in trying to establish the mission of 190 european trainers in afghanistan at a time when an increase in violence and suicide attacks by the taliban and al qaeda has raised pressure on isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- countries to scale down their afghan troop presence .
last month , three german police officers responsible for protecting the german ambassador to afghanistan died and a fourth was injured when their vehicles were blown up on a road to the east of kabul .
germany has some 3,000 troops stationed in afghanistan , mostly in the relatively stable north of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf soldiers investigate the scene of an explosion that killed three german police officers until a few months ago , germany was considered to be leading the way in training afghan police and border guards .
it was in charge of the police training from 2002 until this year .
that was one of the reasons why , when the eu took over the mission in june , the top post remained in german hands .
like germany , several eu members , some of whom are also part of nato , have police and military working in afghanistan under separate civil and military mandates .
trainers , incentives missing but in recent months , the training mission has faltered , with critics saying it 's been underfunded , understaffed and poorly prepared .
the european commission has still not approved the budget for armored cars , computers and office equipment for the mission headquarters in kabul , according to news reports .
in addition , the mission has gotten off to a slow start , with reports saying not enough european police trainers or afghan participants have turned up .
some 90 trainers were expected to come from 21 nations , but eu member states have so far provided only half the personnel .
germany has promised up to 60 officials but still has n't delivered on its promise .
der spiegel reported last month that officials have not resolved how to keep newly trained afghan police officers and soldiers from joining the taliban , local militia leaders or drug barons , all of whom offer better pay than the government in kabul .
eu ill prepared , poor nato security ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the eu 's efforts to train the afghan army and police are falling short the mission has also been hampered by nato-member turkey 's blocking of an agreement to regulate cooperation between the alliance and the eu in afghanistan .
turkey has tried to curb military cooperation between the two because the european union has refused to guarantee cypriot officers would not participate .
but nato spokesman james appathurai denied suggestions that nato support for the eu police trainers was inadequate .
" nato has been providing support to the european police in afghanistan , and we can not imagine that nato will provide any less support to the eu police than it does to other organizations such as the united nations , " he said .
on wednesday , nato 's top civilian official in afghanistan , daan everts , said the eu is still not fully contributing to international efforts to bring peace and the rule of law to afghanistan , with incompetence and corruption rife among local afghan forces . " that has to be addressed in a more concerted and forceful manner , " everts said during a news conference .
other observers questioned whether the eu was properly prepared to coordinate operations so far away from its national borders .
" it seems that the eu was not really properly prepared for such a complex mission , " ronja kempin , an afghanistan expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told the international herald tribune this week .
" the eu seemed to have rushed into setting up this mission , " kempin said , adding that massive corruption in the afghan interior ministry compounded the troubles . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it 's not good news for democracy in the country , she adds . viktor zubkov 's the name of the rabbit that russian president vladmir putin pulled out of his hat .
as is customary for such magic tricks , the public is surprised , says " oh " and " ah " - and marvels .
who is this zubkov ?
not much is known about him .
he 's a finance expert , a putin confidant from the old days in st. petersburg .
he 's an inconspicuous guy in the second row .
a dark horse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz maybe that 's not even so important .
what is important is that putin has shown people the ropes once again .
he 's a politician who likes to present the public with riddles , who throws smoke grenades , who acts in secret and surprises people , showing the world that there 's only one person pulling the strings in russian domestic politics .
vladimir vladimirovich putin - the president with a kgb past .
his second and last term in office will be over in march 2008 , but people will have to continue to include him in the equation .
he 's still far from being out of breath .
putin is already setting the course for the time after his departure .
nothing 's meant to go wrong .
by nominating the bland zubkov , the russian president has shown once again what kind of person he deems capable of leading a country that 's shaped by big economic successes and political problems : it 's either secret intelligence people with dubious pasts or technocrats , apolitical , dry figures , who are experts for something - agriculture , military or finance .
he just does n't want experienced , charismatic and democratically legitimated politicians who care about more than taking care of business .
putin banks on apolitical politicians .
with a bit of good will , it 's possible to write off the events in moscow as " normal procedure . "
of course , outside russia , the reasons for a change of government seem odd .
do you swap out a cabinet when elections are coming up ?
putin said that , ahead of parliamentary and presidential elections , the government should be ready to prepare the country for changes that are bound to happen .
the power structure has to be refreshed , he said .
that 's strange : if things happen in a democratic , free and fair way , a government faces the vote of the people and the population judges the accomplishments of the country 's leading elite , reconfirms it or votes it out of office .
but russia 's pre-election time seems to be a time for political intrigues , tricks and deception .
that bodes ill .

dw-world.de putin " prepares " russia for election with new prime minister in a surprise move , russian president vladimir putin has nominated the little-known viktor zubkov as his new prime minister in a major political shake-up ahead of crucial parliamentary and presidential elections .

but it 's not good news for democracy in the country , she adds . viktor zubkov 's the name of the rabbit that russian president vladmir putin pulled out of his hat .
as is customary for such magic tricks , the public is surprised , says " oh " and " ah " - and marvels .
who is this zubkov ?
not much is known about him .
he 's a finance expert , a putin confidant from the old days in st. petersburg .
he 's an inconspicuous guy in the second row .
a dark horse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz maybe that 's not even so important .
what is important is that putin has shown people the ropes once again .
he 's a politician who likes to present the public with riddles , who throws smoke grenades , who acts in secret and surprises people , showing the world that there 's only one person pulling the strings in russian domestic politics .
vladimir vladimirovich putin - the president with a kgb past .
his second and last term in office will be over in march 2008 , but people will have to continue to include him in the equation .
he 's still far from being out of breath .
putin is already setting the course for the time after his departure .
nothing 's meant to go wrong .
by nominating the bland zubkov , the russian president has shown once again what kind of person he deems capable of leading a country that 's shaped by big economic successes and political problems : it 's either secret intelligence people with dubious pasts or technocrats , apolitical , dry figures , who are experts for something - agriculture , military or finance .
he just does n't want experienced , charismatic and democratically legitimated politicians who care about more than taking care of business .
putin banks on apolitical politicians .
with a bit of good will , it 's possible to write off the events in moscow as " normal procedure . "
of course , outside russia , the reasons for a change of government seem odd .
do you swap out a cabinet when elections are coming up ?
putin said that , ahead of parliamentary and presidential elections , the government should be ready to prepare the country for changes that are bound to happen .
the power structure has to be refreshed , he said .
that 's strange : if things happen in a democratic , free and fair way , a government faces the vote of the people and the population judges the accomplishments of the country 's leading elite , reconfirms it or votes it out of office .
but russia 's pre-election time seems to be a time for political intrigues , tricks and deception .
that bodes ill .

its german head is returning home just months after his appointment . jaap de hoop scheffer is set to ask germany on thursday , sept .
13 , for police trainers to be deployed in southern afghanistan where alliance forces are dealing with an upsurge in violence and suicide bomb attacks by the taliban , al qaeda and local warlords .
the request comes at a time when the eu 's special police training mission is also hampered by complaints of inadequate eu planning and insufficient nato security support .
german head of eu mission to quit this week , the german interior ministry confirmed that brigadier general friedrich eichele is returning to germany just months after he was appointed to head the eu training mission in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich eichele is returning home to germany eichele , a former commander of the german federal police 's elite gsg 9 counter-terrorism unit , is said to be returning to oversee reforms of the domestic police force .
but , according to german newsmagazine der spiegel , tensions with the eu 's special envoy to afghanistan , francesc vendrell , are the actual reasons behind eichele 's early exit .
vendrell reportedly wanted political control of the mission , something that eichele opposed .
the german embassy in kabul described eichele as simply " overburdened , " the magazine said .
mission plagued by trouble eichele 's early departure reflects the difficulties in trying to establish the mission of 190 european trainers in afghanistan at a time when an increase in violence and suicide attacks by the taliban and al qaeda has raised pressure on isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- countries to scale down their afghan troop presence .
last month , three german police officers responsible for protecting the german ambassador to afghanistan died and a fourth was injured when their vehicles were blown up on a road to the east of kabul .
germany has some 3,000 troops stationed in afghanistan , mostly in the relatively stable north of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf soldiers investigate the scene of an explosion that killed three german police officers until a few months ago , germany was considered to be leading the way in training afghan police and border guards .
it was in charge of the police training from 2002 until this year .
that was one of the reasons why , when the eu took over the mission in june , the top post remained in german hands .
like germany , several eu members , some of whom are also part of nato , have police and military working in afghanistan under separate civil and military mandates .
trainers , incentives missing but in recent months , the training mission has faltered , with critics saying it 's been underfunded , understaffed and poorly prepared .
the european commission has still not approved the budget for armored cars , computers and office equipment for the mission headquarters in kabul , according to news reports .
in addition , the mission has gotten off to a slow start , with reports saying not enough european police trainers or afghan participants have turned up .
some 90 trainers were expected to come from 21 nations , but eu member states have so far provided only half the personnel .
germany has promised up to 60 officials but still has n't delivered on its promise .
der spiegel reported last month that officials have not resolved how to keep newly trained afghan police officers and soldiers from joining the taliban , local militia leaders or drug barons , all of whom offer better pay than the government in kabul .
eu ill prepared , poor nato security ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the eu 's efforts to train the afghan army and police are falling short the mission has also been hampered by nato-member turkey 's blocking of an agreement to regulate cooperation between the alliance and the eu in afghanistan .
turkey has tried to curb military cooperation between the two because the european union has refused to guarantee cypriot officers would not participate .
but nato spokesman james appathurai denied suggestions that nato support for the eu police trainers was inadequate .
" nato has been providing support to the european police in afghanistan , and we can not imagine that nato will provide any less support to the eu police than it does to other organizations such as the united nations , " he said .
on wednesday , nato 's top civilian official in afghanistan , daan everts , said the eu is still not fully contributing to international efforts to bring peace and the rule of law to afghanistan , with incompetence and corruption rife among local afghan forces . " that has to be addressed in a more concerted and forceful manner , " everts said during a news conference .
other observers questioned whether the eu was properly prepared to coordinate operations so far away from its national borders .
" it seems that the eu was not really properly prepared for such a complex mission , " ronja kempin , an afghanistan expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told the international herald tribune this week .
" the eu seemed to have rushed into setting up this mission , " kempin said , adding that massive corruption in the afghan interior ministry compounded the troubles . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's survival is threatened since russia decided to pull out . speaking in the german parliament on wednesday , sept .
12 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that germany could not permit the treaty , which is aimed at limiting conventional arms and was developed over a long period of time , to be dissolved .
" i will be just as annoyed as you if this treaty is suspended , " steinmeier told lawmakers , adding that the conference in berlin would try to " rebuild lost trust . "
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 and updated in 1999 .
it limits the number of tanks , artillery , aircraft and helicopters stationed in europe .
russia announced in july that it no longer considered the treaty effective .
moscow said that the failure of nato countries to ratify the latest version of the treaty was the main reason for the decision .
but russian officials also said that a us plan to station parts of a new missile defense system in central european countries also played a role , reuters news service reported .
they consider the system a threat to russia 's national security .
nato members , meanwhile , have said that they will not ratify the latest cfe treaty version until russia withdraws its troops from the former soviet republics of moldova and georgia , which moscow promised to do in 1999 when the treaty was signed . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german embassy in kabul described eichele as simply " overburdened , " the magazine said .
mission plagued by trouble eichele 's early departure reflects the difficulties in trying to establish the mission of 190 european trainers in afghanistan at a time when an increase in violence and suicide attacks by the taliban and al qaeda has raised pressure on isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- countries to scale down their afghan troop presence .

turkey has tried to curb military cooperation between the two because the european union has refused to guarantee cypriot officers would not participate .
but nato spokesman james appathurai denied suggestions that nato support for the eu police trainers was inadequate .
" nato has been providing support to the european police in afghanistan , and we can not imagine that nato will provide any less support to the eu police than it does to other organizations such as the united nations , " he said .
on wednesday , nato 's top civilian official in afghanistan , daan everts , said the eu is still not fully contributing to international efforts to bring peace and the rule of law to afghanistan , with incompetence and corruption rife among local afghan forces . " that has to be addressed in a more concerted and forceful manner , " everts said during a news conference .
other observers questioned whether the eu was properly prepared to coordinate operations so far away from its national borders .
" it seems that the eu was not really properly prepared for such a complex mission , " ronja kempin , an afghanistan expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told the international herald tribune this week .

" nato has been providing support to the european police in afghanistan , and we can not imagine that nato will provide any less support to the eu police than it does to other organizations such as the united nations , " he said .
on wednesday , nato 's top civilian official in afghanistan , daan everts , said the eu is still not fully contributing to international efforts to bring peace and the rule of law to afghanistan , with incompetence and corruption rife among local afghan forces . " that has to be addressed in a more concerted and forceful manner , " everts said during a news conference .
other observers questioned whether the eu was properly prepared to coordinate operations so far away from its national borders .
" it seems that the eu was not really properly prepared for such a complex mission , " ronja kempin , an afghanistan expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told the international herald tribune this week .
" the eu seemed to have rushed into setting up this mission , " kempin said , adding that massive corruption in the afghan interior ministry compounded the troubles . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the faithful storm the myriad big and small churches throughout the city . evangelical churches reinforce traditional african beliefs this religious revival under banners which proclaim " mountain of fire and of wonder " or " redemption from the dead " has become a worldwide symbol for the huge success of evangelical churches in africa . bildunterschrift : lagos is the commercial capital of nigeria and the seat of christendom in africa there are 3.9 million followers of the pentecostal faith in nigeria , the third-highest ranking in the world , according to the world christian database in boston . brazil , which is primarily roman catholic , is the worldwide leader of evangelical pentecostal churches , with more than 24 million followers , while the united states has roughly 6 million adherents . what appeals to church followers is the promise of cures from poverty and disease through god 's blessing . ejiah ndifon , a nigerian engineer founded his own church , the royal kingdom citizen international , based on these ideas . " there are so many people who could have had bigger and better lives , but they could not achieve their destiny , because there was no one to lead them with a vision , " the self-declared prophet said .
" royal kingdom citizen offers this guidance , and brings people together with god . " the faithful believe those who discover the holy spirit will lead transformed lives and that sickness and misfortune can only befall heathens . the success of the pentecostal churches lies with the belief in a god who fights the evil of pandemic disease , according to erhard kamphausen , head of the academy of missions at the university of hamburg . " old superstitions , which were marginalized by more mainstream christian missionaries , have come around full circle , " kamphausen said .
" africans believe in miracles and witchcraft . " german crusader in africa reaches millions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german evangelist reinhard bonnke has led crusades for decades in africa they are n't alone .
german evangelist reinhard bonnke , who is known for his gospel crusades in nigeria , had an epiphany at the age of 9 and decided to devote his life to god . bonnke has held sermons in africa for nearly 30 years , and one of these massive mega-events was attended by 1.6 million followers .
earlier this year , another event was broadcast live on " god tv " by 200 countries , reaching an even broader audience and establishing his reputation as " undoubtedly the most successful missionary of our times . " the web site of the evangelist 's bible association " christ for all nations " sells books and other promotional material on supernatural intervention and miracle cures in seven languages .
a film series on dvd sells for 249 euros -lrb- $ 346 -rrb- . donation to the church tied with god 's blessing ayimah hondeh is a regular at the popular redeemed christian church of god in lagos .
she said she became a true believer on christmas eve 2005 . a young man had shoved her while she was waiting in line at a fast-food restaurant , and not wanting to provoke a fight , she switched to another queue .
shortly afterwards , some armed robbers stormed the restaurant and those in the first queue were injured , but hondeh was unharmed . " i believe it was god 's will , " she said . a few weeks before the pastor had reminded her congregation that god 's blessing was not guaranteed every year . " he said we had to pray twice as hard and double our donation to the church , " hondeh said .
" i quadrupled my contribution to the collection plate every sunday .
i know that god spared me on that day . " a donation tied to god 's blessing is business as usual for evangelical churches .
small wonder that efforts devoted to proselytizing focus on miracle cures , according to kamphausen . islam , christianity battle for african souls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pentecostal-style revival tied to promises of miracles " miracles play a tremendous role , " he said .
" even fairly grounded pentecostal preachers say that there is no day that passes when some small miracle does n't occur . " in principle , chicanery has as much or as little to do with a true belief in the lourdes apparitions or any religion 's professed miracles , but still the theologian warned against such aggressive proselytizing by charismatic churches in africa that capitalize on local superstitions . the repercussions of such religious zeal could unleash conflicts with islam , the dominant faith in northern nigeria .
roughly half of all nigerians are muslim , 40 percent are christian and the remaining 10 percent are members of other faiths . " most churches which carry on their crusades in the north are dangerous and the tension between islam and christianity can only grow , " said kamphausen . thomas mösch , mansour bala bello and geraldo hoffmann -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is also deputy head of the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- core values commission .
dw-world.de : membership of germany 's mainstream parties has been steadily dwindling .
if this trend continues , does it mean their days are numbered ?
thomas meyer : membership is on the decline , so in this respect the role of the mainstream parties is changing .
more parties are needed in order to form government coalitions , and there are more parties in the party system , which inevitably means the system is changing .
does that the fact that the mainstream parties are shrinking mean that the state has a more limited power to act ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's two-party administration is nothing compared to other coalitions no , not directly .
many countries have stable democracies despite having many more parties .
government coalitions might need four or five parties .
the process of forming a coalition might be trickier , but it by no means weakens the state .
the social democrats are suffering the sharpest decline in membership .
why is this ?
right now , the spd 's role is an especially difficult one .
the party is trapped between a christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- which has shifted to the left and appears to be adopting some of the social democrats ' traditional positions , and the new left party which is occupying what used to be the social democrats ' far-left ground .
sandwiched between these two poles , the party is having trouble maintaining its identity and remaining on the offensive .
to what extent is the left party responsible for the crisis within the spd ?
the left party is , to some extent , an expression of this crisis .
it is partly made up of left-wing party members whom the spd was unable to integrate into its policies and political style .
its founding is definitely one of the factors contributing to the spd 's crisis .
are lafontaine and co . -lsb- former spd members who left to establish an alternative party , the left -rsb- luring voters away from the spd ?
definitely , to some extent .
if the left party attracts ten percent of voters then a large part , if not the majority of these voters , are bound to be disappointed spd voters .
on the whole , the left party stands for traditional spd positions while the cdu stands for neo-liberal spd positions .
meanwhile , the greens are further left than the spd on social and economic issues .
is there any political ground the spd can still claim as its own ?
that description is a little too pat .
the cdu is trying to muscle in on some sdp territory , but the neo-liberal elements of the cdu political agenda are still intact .
the left party has moved in on some of the spd past positions , which had become politically untenable .
stuck in the middle , the sdp is unable to assert itself .
but basically , this would not be impossible were the party to better push through its social democratic positions , which are in fact perfectly viable right now .
within the grand coalition , the cdu is increasingly to the left of the spd .
does the cdu have a social conscience ?
the cdu has always been contradictory , poised between the social elements drawn from its catholic social doctrine , and the neo-liberal , political substance based on the party 's economic principles .
it can show either one of these faces according to election results and public opinion .
for now , after the last , very close election , in which the party fared far worse than it had expected to , it is making an effort to show its social face .
does the sdp still have a loyal base ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor unions , seen here on strike , are a traditional spd base yes it does , but all the parties are seeing their bases shrink .
the number of swing voters is on the rise .
that hits other parties as much as it does the spd .
any young people with political ideals no longer join the political parties but ngos instead - as illustrated by the scenes at the g8 we all saw on television .
why are the political parties no longer so attractive to young people ?
many young people prefer smaller-scale organizations , where they feel they might have some effect and which are concerned with just one or two issues they can easily follow .
they feel that the mainstream parties , and large-scale organizations in general , are too anonymous , concerned with too many issues and too willing to compromise .
the result is that young people are not terribly interested in the parties in their current form .
top spd politicians matthias platzeck , peer steinbrück and frank-walter steinmeier recently published their book " auf der höhe der zeit " about social democracy and progress in the 21st century .
one of the key terms in the book is the " careful welfare state . "
what 's new about this concept ?
basically , the idea is to adopt certain elements of the scandinavian welfare state , primarily with more investment in education , more equal opportunities within education , low-risk political strategies which allow people to thrive in today 's changing society and therefore depend on less long-term welfare support .
basically , it 's a very sensible project but not necessarily a new one .
parts of it already featured in the spd 's berlin program in 1989 .
but in this more extensive version it sets new foci and will serve as the cornerstone of the spd 's new party platform .
the spd will unveil its new policy statements in october .
can we expect anything new ?
there will be a number of new foci : the careful welfare state , a strong emphasis on the environment , especially in the area of climate policy , a strong emphasis on europe and globalization policies .
we wo n't be seeing a new spd but there will be a greater , better and more offensive emphasis on building the foundations for social democracy in the age of globalization .
spd chief kurt beck is not doing too well in the popularity stakes .
does the spd need a media star like gerhard schröder to front it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has n't captured germany 's imagination in the past we have seen that politicians such as helmut kohl , did badly in the opinion polls but were still elected because they had certain persuasive characteristics and persuasive platforms .
beck may well find himself in a similar position .
surveys are not the same as elections , and for the time being it remains to be seen whether beck can mobilize support .
but the next elections are still a long way off .
in the last election , observers said that merkel would never be as media savvy as schröder .
but a look at current opinion polls suggests that she has managed to cut an even better figure within the media than her predecessor .
is that true ?
merkel has managed to create a very good media presence .
she 's accepted both by the public and the media .
it 's helped that she 's concentrated heavily on foreign policy .
it 's always easy to boost popularity with foreign policy : it 's not controversial domestically , and it always looks good to be seen with top international politicians .
that also goes to show that certain politicians can grow into their role , and if they are given the opportunity , they can gain unexpected support . interview by fengbo wang -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

within the grand coalition , the cdu is increasingly to the left of the spd .
does the cdu have a social conscience ?
the cdu has always been contradictory , poised between the social elements drawn from its catholic social doctrine , and the neo-liberal , political substance based on the party 's economic principles .
it can show either one of these faces according to election results and public opinion .
for now , after the last , very close election , in which the party fared far worse than it had expected to , it is making an effort to show its social face .
does the sdp still have a loyal base ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor unions , seen here on strike , are a traditional spd base yes it does , but all the parties are seeing their bases shrink .
the number of swing voters is on the rise .
that hits other parties as much as it does the spd .
any young people with political ideals no longer join the political parties but ngos instead - as illustrated by the scenes at the g8 we all saw on television .
why are the political parties no longer so attractive to young people ?
many young people prefer smaller-scale organizations , where they feel they might have some effect and which are concerned with just one or two issues they can easily follow .
they feel that the mainstream parties , and large-scale organizations in general , are too anonymous , concerned with too many issues and too willing to compromise .
the result is that young people are not terribly interested in the parties in their current form .
top spd politicians matthias platzeck , peer steinbrück and frank-walter steinmeier recently published their book " auf der höhe der zeit " about social democracy and progress in the 21st century .
one of the key terms in the book is the " careful welfare state . "
what 's new about this concept ?
basically , the idea is to adopt certain elements of the scandinavian welfare state , primarily with more investment in education , more equal opportunities within education , low-risk political strategies which allow people to thrive in today 's changing society and therefore depend on less long-term welfare support .
basically , it 's a very sensible project but not necessarily a new one .
parts of it already featured in the spd 's berlin program in 1989 .
but in this more extensive version it sets new foci and will serve as the cornerstone of the spd 's new party platform .
the spd will unveil its new policy statements in october .
can we expect anything new ?
there will be a number of new foci : the careful welfare state , a strong emphasis on the environment , especially in the area of climate policy , a strong emphasis on europe and globalization policies .
we wo n't be seeing a new spd but there will be a greater , better and more offensive emphasis on building the foundations for social democracy in the age of globalization .
spd chief kurt beck is not doing too well in the popularity stakes .
does the spd need a media star like gerhard schröder to front it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has n't captured germany 's imagination in the past we have seen that politicians such as helmut kohl , did badly in the opinion polls but were still elected because they had certain persuasive characteristics and persuasive platforms .
beck may well find himself in a similar position .
surveys are not the same as elections , and for the time being it remains to be seen whether beck can mobilize support .
but the next elections are still a long way off .
in the last election , observers said that merkel would never be as media savvy as schröder .
but a look at current opinion polls suggests that she has managed to cut an even better figure within the media than her predecessor .
is that true ?
merkel has managed to create a very good media presence .
she 's accepted both by the public and the media .
it 's helped that she 's concentrated heavily on foreign policy .
it 's always easy to boost popularity with foreign policy : it 's not controversial domestically , and it always looks good to be seen with top international politicians .
that also goes to show that certain politicians can grow into their role , and if they are given the opportunity , they can gain unexpected support . interview by fengbo wang -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is also deputy head of the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- core values commission .
dw-world.de : membership of germany 's mainstream parties has been steadily dwindling .
if this trend continues , does it mean their days are numbered ?
thomas meyer : membership is on the decline , so in this respect the role of the mainstream parties is changing .
more parties are needed in order to form government coalitions , and there are more parties in the party system , which inevitably means the system is changing .
does that the fact that the mainstream parties are shrinking mean that the state has a more limited power to act ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's two-party administration is nothing compared to other coalitions no , not directly .
many countries have stable democracies despite having many more parties .
government coalitions might need four or five parties .
the process of forming a coalition might be trickier , but it by no means weakens the state .
the social democrats are suffering the sharpest decline in membership .
why is this ?
right now , the spd 's role is an especially difficult one .
the party is trapped between a christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- which has shifted to the left and appears to be adopting some of the social democrats ' traditional positions , and the new left party which is occupying what used to be the social democrats ' far-left ground .
sandwiched between these two poles , the party is having trouble maintaining its identity and remaining on the offensive .
to what extent is the left party responsible for the crisis within the spd ?
the left party is , to some extent , an expression of this crisis .
it is partly made up of left-wing party members whom the spd was unable to integrate into its policies and political style .
its founding is definitely one of the factors contributing to the spd 's crisis .
are lafontaine and co . -lsb- former spd members who left to establish an alternative party , the left -rsb- luring voters away from the spd ?
definitely , to some extent .
if the left party attracts ten percent of voters then a large part , if not the majority of these voters , are bound to be disappointed spd voters .
on the whole , the left party stands for traditional spd positions while the cdu stands for neo-liberal spd positions .
meanwhile , the greens are further left than the spd on social and economic issues .
is there any political ground the spd can still claim as its own ?
that description is a little too pat .
the cdu is trying to muscle in on some sdp territory , but the neo-liberal elements of the cdu political agenda are still intact .
the left party has moved in on some of the spd past positions , which had become politically untenable .
stuck in the middle , the sdp is unable to assert itself .
but basically , this would not be impossible were the party to better push through its social democratic positions , which are in fact perfectly viable right now .
within the grand coalition , the cdu is increasingly to the left of the spd .

it is also the seat of the continent 's fastest growing christian missions . from the most obscure , tiny district church to the high-tech cathedral and shopping area in the heart of the city , the charismatic appeal of pentecostal churches is ever present . one of the main features of this kind of church is the use of broadcast , print and the internet in spreading its message .
another is the practice of incorporating elements of traditional african culture , such as upbeat music , loud sermons , and above all , reinforcing deeply held beliefs in witchcraft and demons . every sunday , hundreds of thousands of followers seek spiritual enlightenment .
the faithful storm the myriad big and small churches throughout the city . evangelical churches reinforce traditional african beliefs this religious revival under banners which proclaim " mountain of fire and of wonder " or " redemption from the dead " has become a worldwide symbol for the huge success of evangelical churches in africa . bildunterschrift : lagos is the commercial capital of nigeria and the seat of christendom in africa there are 3.9 million followers of the pentecostal faith in nigeria , the third-highest ranking in the world , according to the world christian database in boston . brazil , which is primarily roman catholic , is the worldwide leader of evangelical pentecostal churches , with more than 24 million followers , while the united states has roughly 6 million adherents . what appeals to church followers is the promise of cures from poverty and disease through god 's blessing . ejiah ndifon , a nigerian engineer founded his own church , the royal kingdom citizen international , based on these ideas . " there are so many people who could have had bigger and better lives , but they could not achieve their destiny , because there was no one to lead them with a vision , " the self-declared prophet said .
" royal kingdom citizen offers this guidance , and brings people together with god . " the faithful believe those who discover the holy spirit will lead transformed lives and that sickness and misfortune can only befall heathens . the success of the pentecostal churches lies with the belief in a god who fights the evil of pandemic disease , according to erhard kamphausen , head of the academy of missions at the university of hamburg . " old superstitions , which were marginalized by more mainstream christian missionaries , have come around full circle , " kamphausen said .
" africans believe in miracles and witchcraft . " german crusader in africa reaches millions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german evangelist reinhard bonnke has led crusades for decades in africa they are n't alone .
german evangelist reinhard bonnke , who is known for his gospel crusades in nigeria , had an epiphany at the age of 9 and decided to devote his life to god . bonnke has held sermons in africa for nearly 30 years , and one of these massive mega-events was attended by 1.6 million followers .
earlier this year , another event was broadcast live on " god tv " by 200 countries , reaching an even broader audience and establishing his reputation as " undoubtedly the most successful missionary of our times . " the web site of the evangelist 's bible association " christ for all nations " sells books and other promotional material on supernatural intervention and miracle cures in seven languages .
a film series on dvd sells for 249 euros -lrb- $ 346 -rrb- . donation to the church tied with god 's blessing ayimah hondeh is a regular at the popular redeemed christian church of god in lagos .
she said she became a true believer on christmas eve 2005 . a young man had shoved her while she was waiting in line at a fast-food restaurant , and not wanting to provoke a fight , she switched to another queue .
shortly afterwards , some armed robbers stormed the restaurant and those in the first queue were injured , but hondeh was unharmed .

the request comes at a time when the eu 's special police training mission is also hampered by complaints of inadequate eu planning and insufficient nato security support .
german head of eu mission to quit this week , the german interior ministry confirmed that brigadier general friedrich eichele is returning to germany just months after he was appointed to head the eu training mission in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich eichele is returning home to germany eichele , a former commander of the german federal police 's elite gsg 9 counter-terrorism unit , is said to be returning to oversee reforms of the domestic police force .
but , according to german newsmagazine der spiegel , tensions with the eu 's special envoy to afghanistan , francesc vendrell , are the actual reasons behind eichele 's early exit .
vendrell reportedly wanted political control of the mission , something that eichele opposed .
the german embassy in kabul described eichele as simply " overburdened , " the magazine said .
mission plagued by trouble eichele 's early departure reflects the difficulties in trying to establish the mission of 190 european trainers in afghanistan at a time when an increase in violence and suicide attacks by the taliban and al qaeda has raised pressure on isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- countries to scale down their afghan troop presence .
last month , three german police officers responsible for protecting the german ambassador to afghanistan died and a fourth was injured when their vehicles were blown up on a road to the east of kabul .
germany has some 3,000 troops stationed in afghanistan , mostly in the relatively stable north of the country .

in addition , the mission has gotten off to a slow start , with reports saying not enough european police trainers or afghan participants have turned up .
some 90 trainers were expected to come from 21 nations , but eu member states have so far provided only half the personnel .
germany has promised up to 60 officials but still has n't delivered on its promise .
der spiegel reported last month that officials have not resolved how to keep newly trained afghan police officers and soldiers from joining the taliban , local militia leaders or drug barons , all of whom offer better pay than the government in kabul .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the eu 's efforts to train the afghan army and police are falling short the mission has also been hampered by nato-member turkey 's blocking of an agreement to regulate cooperation between the alliance and the eu in afghanistan .
turkey has tried to curb military cooperation between the two because the european union has refused to guarantee cypriot officers would not participate .
but nato spokesman james appathurai denied suggestions that nato support for the eu police trainers was inadequate .
" nato has been providing support to the european police in afghanistan , and we can not imagine that nato will provide any less support to the eu police than it does to other organizations such as the united nations , " he said .

that was one of the reasons why , when the eu took over the mission in june , the top post remained in german hands .
like germany , several eu members , some of whom are also part of nato , have police and military working in afghanistan under separate civil and military mandates .
trainers , incentives missing but in recent months , the training mission has faltered , with critics saying it 's been underfunded , understaffed and poorly prepared .
the european commission has still not approved the budget for armored cars , computers and office equipment for the mission headquarters in kabul , according to news reports .
in addition , the mission has gotten off to a slow start , with reports saying not enough european police trainers or afghan participants have turned up .
some 90 trainers were expected to come from 21 nations , but eu member states have so far provided only half the personnel .
germany has promised up to 60 officials but still has n't delivered on its promise .
der spiegel reported last month that officials have not resolved how to keep newly trained afghan police officers and soldiers from joining the taliban , local militia leaders or drug barons , all of whom offer better pay than the government in kabul .
eu ill prepared , poor nato security ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the eu 's efforts to train the afghan army and police are falling short the mission has also been hampered by nato-member turkey 's blocking of an agreement to regulate cooperation between the alliance and the eu in afghanistan .
turkey has tried to curb military cooperation between the two because the european union has refused to guarantee cypriot officers would not participate .
but nato spokesman james appathurai denied suggestions that nato support for the eu police trainers was inadequate .
" nato has been providing support to the european police in afghanistan , and we can not imagine that nato will provide any less support to the eu police than it does to other organizations such as the united nations , " he said .
on wednesday , nato 's top civilian official in afghanistan , daan everts , said the eu is still not fully contributing to international efforts to bring peace and the rule of law to afghanistan , with incompetence and corruption rife among local afghan forces . " that has to be addressed in a more concerted and forceful manner , " everts said during a news conference .
other observers questioned whether the eu was properly prepared to coordinate operations so far away from its national borders .
" it seems that the eu was not really properly prepared for such a complex mission , " ronja kempin , an afghanistan expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told the international herald tribune this week .
" the eu seemed to have rushed into setting up this mission , " kempin said , adding that massive corruption in the afghan interior ministry compounded the troubles . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is also the seat of the continent 's fastest growing christian missions . from the most obscure , tiny district church to the high-tech cathedral and shopping area in the heart of the city , the charismatic appeal of pentecostal churches is ever present . one of the main features of this kind of church is the use of broadcast , print and the internet in spreading its message .
another is the practice of incorporating elements of traditional african culture , such as upbeat music , loud sermons , and above all , reinforcing deeply held beliefs in witchcraft and demons . every sunday , hundreds of thousands of followers seek spiritual enlightenment .
the faithful storm the myriad big and small churches throughout the city . evangelical churches reinforce traditional african beliefs this religious revival under banners which proclaim " mountain of fire and of wonder " or " redemption from the dead " has become a worldwide symbol for the huge success of evangelical churches in africa . bildunterschrift : lagos is the commercial capital of nigeria and the seat of christendom in africa there are 3.9 million followers of the pentecostal faith in nigeria , the third-highest ranking in the world , according to the world christian database in boston . brazil , which is primarily roman catholic , is the worldwide leader of evangelical pentecostal churches , with more than 24 million followers , while the united states has roughly 6 million adherents . what appeals to church followers is the promise of cures from poverty and disease through god 's blessing . ejiah ndifon , a nigerian engineer founded his own church , the royal kingdom citizen international , based on these ideas . " there are so many people who could have had bigger and better lives , but they could not achieve their destiny , because there was no one to lead them with a vision , " the self-declared prophet said .
" royal kingdom citizen offers this guidance , and brings people together with god . " the faithful believe those who discover the holy spirit will lead transformed lives and that sickness and misfortune can only befall heathens . the success of the pentecostal churches lies with the belief in a god who fights the evil of pandemic disease , according to erhard kamphausen , head of the academy of missions at the university of hamburg . " old superstitions , which were marginalized by more mainstream christian missionaries , have come around full circle , " kamphausen said .
" africans believe in miracles and witchcraft . " german crusader in africa reaches millions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german evangelist reinhard bonnke has led crusades for decades in africa they are n't alone .
german evangelist reinhard bonnke , who is known for his gospel crusades in nigeria , had an epiphany at the age of 9 and decided to devote his life to god . bonnke has held sermons in africa for nearly 30 years , and one of these massive mega-events was attended by 1.6 million followers .
earlier this year , another event was broadcast live on " god tv " by 200 countries , reaching an even broader audience and establishing his reputation as " undoubtedly the most successful missionary of our times . " the web site of the evangelist 's bible association " christ for all nations " sells books and other promotional material on supernatural intervention and miracle cures in seven languages .
a film series on dvd sells for 249 euros -lrb- $ 346 -rrb- . donation to the church tied with god 's blessing ayimah hondeh is a regular at the popular redeemed christian church of god in lagos .
she said she became a true believer on christmas eve 2005 . a young man had shoved her while she was waiting in line at a fast-food restaurant , and not wanting to provoke a fight , she switched to another queue .
shortly afterwards , some armed robbers stormed the restaurant and those in the first queue were injured , but hondeh was unharmed . " i believe it was god 's will , " she said . a few weeks before the pastor had reminded her congregation that god 's blessing was not guaranteed every year . " he said we had to pray twice as hard and double our donation to the church , " hondeh said .
" i quadrupled my contribution to the collection plate every sunday .
i know that god spared me on that day . " a donation tied to god 's blessing is business as usual for evangelical churches .
small wonder that efforts devoted to proselytizing focus on miracle cures , according to kamphausen . islam , christianity battle for african souls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pentecostal-style revival tied to promises of miracles " miracles play a tremendous role , " he said .
" even fairly grounded pentecostal preachers say that there is no day that passes when some small miracle does n't occur . " in principle , chicanery has as much or as little to do with a true belief in the lourdes apparitions or any religion 's professed miracles , but still the theologian warned against such aggressive proselytizing by charismatic churches in africa that capitalize on local superstitions . the repercussions of such religious zeal could unleash conflicts with islam , the dominant faith in northern nigeria .
roughly half of all nigerians are muslim , 40 percent are christian and the remaining 10 percent are members of other faiths . " most churches which carry on their crusades in the north are dangerous and the tension between islam and christianity can only grow , " said kamphausen . thomas mösch , mansour bala bello and geraldo hoffmann -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is also deputy head of the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- core values commission .
dw-world.de : membership of germany 's mainstream parties has been steadily dwindling .
if this trend continues , does it mean their days are numbered ?
thomas meyer : membership is on the decline , so in this respect the role of the mainstream parties is changing .
more parties are needed in order to form government coalitions , and there are more parties in the party system , which inevitably means the system is changing .
does that the fact that the mainstream parties are shrinking mean that the state has a more limited power to act ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's two-party administration is nothing compared to other coalitions no , not directly .
many countries have stable democracies despite having many more parties .
government coalitions might need four or five parties .
the process of forming a coalition might be trickier , but it by no means weakens the state .
the social democrats are suffering the sharpest decline in membership .
why is this ?
right now , the spd 's role is an especially difficult one .
the party is trapped between a christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- which has shifted to the left and appears to be adopting some of the social democrats ' traditional positions , and the new left party which is occupying what used to be the social democrats ' far-left ground .
sandwiched between these two poles , the party is having trouble maintaining its identity and remaining on the offensive .
to what extent is the left party responsible for the crisis within the spd ?
the left party is , to some extent , an expression of this crisis .
it is partly made up of left-wing party members whom the spd was unable to integrate into its policies and political style .
its founding is definitely one of the factors contributing to the spd 's crisis .
are lafontaine and co . -lsb- former spd members who left to establish an alternative party , the left -rsb- luring voters away from the spd ?
definitely , to some extent .
if the left party attracts ten percent of voters then a large part , if not the majority of these voters , are bound to be disappointed spd voters .
on the whole , the left party stands for traditional spd positions while the cdu stands for neo-liberal spd positions .
meanwhile , the greens are further left than the spd on social and economic issues .
is there any political ground the spd can still claim as its own ?
that description is a little too pat .
the cdu is trying to muscle in on some sdp territory , but the neo-liberal elements of the cdu political agenda are still intact .
the left party has moved in on some of the spd past positions , which had become politically untenable .
stuck in the middle , the sdp is unable to assert itself .
but basically , this would not be impossible were the party to better push through its social democratic positions , which are in fact perfectly viable right now .
within the grand coalition , the cdu is increasingly to the left of the spd .
does the cdu have a social conscience ?
the cdu has always been contradictory , poised between the social elements drawn from its catholic social doctrine , and the neo-liberal , political substance based on the party 's economic principles .
it can show either one of these faces according to election results and public opinion .
for now , after the last , very close election , in which the party fared far worse than it had expected to , it is making an effort to show its social face .
does the sdp still have a loyal base ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor unions , seen here on strike , are a traditional spd base yes it does , but all the parties are seeing their bases shrink .
the number of swing voters is on the rise .
that hits other parties as much as it does the spd .
any young people with political ideals no longer join the political parties but ngos instead - as illustrated by the scenes at the g8 we all saw on television .
why are the political parties no longer so attractive to young people ?
many young people prefer smaller-scale organizations , where they feel they might have some effect and which are concerned with just one or two issues they can easily follow .
they feel that the mainstream parties , and large-scale organizations in general , are too anonymous , concerned with too many issues and too willing to compromise .
the result is that young people are not terribly interested in the parties in their current form .
top spd politicians matthias platzeck , peer steinbrück and frank-walter steinmeier recently published their book " auf der höhe der zeit " about social democracy and progress in the 21st century .
one of the key terms in the book is the " careful welfare state . "
what 's new about this concept ?
basically , the idea is to adopt certain elements of the scandinavian welfare state , primarily with more investment in education , more equal opportunities within education , low-risk political strategies which allow people to thrive in today 's changing society and therefore depend on less long-term welfare support .
basically , it 's a very sensible project but not necessarily a new one .
parts of it already featured in the spd 's berlin program in 1989 .
but in this more extensive version it sets new foci and will serve as the cornerstone of the spd 's new party platform .
the spd will unveil its new policy statements in october .
can we expect anything new ?
there will be a number of new foci : the careful welfare state , a strong emphasis on the environment , especially in the area of climate policy , a strong emphasis on europe and globalization policies .
we wo n't be seeing a new spd but there will be a greater , better and more offensive emphasis on building the foundations for social democracy in the age of globalization .
spd chief kurt beck is not doing too well in the popularity stakes .
does the spd need a media star like gerhard schröder to front it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has n't captured germany 's imagination in the past we have seen that politicians such as helmut kohl , did badly in the opinion polls but were still elected because they had certain persuasive characteristics and persuasive platforms .
beck may well find himself in a similar position .
surveys are not the same as elections , and for the time being it remains to be seen whether beck can mobilize support .
but the next elections are still a long way off .
in the last election , observers said that merkel would never be as media savvy as schröder .
but a look at current opinion polls suggests that she has managed to cut an even better figure within the media than her predecessor .
is that true ?
merkel has managed to create a very good media presence .
she 's accepted both by the public and the media .
it 's helped that she 's concentrated heavily on foreign policy .
it 's always easy to boost popularity with foreign policy : it 's not controversial domestically , and it always looks good to be seen with top international politicians .
that also goes to show that certain politicians can grow into their role , and if they are given the opportunity , they can gain unexpected support . interview by fengbo wang -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is also deputy head of the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- core values commission .
dw-world.de : membership of germany 's mainstream parties has been steadily dwindling .
if this trend continues , does it mean their days are numbered ?
thomas meyer : membership is on the decline , so in this respect the role of the mainstream parties is changing .
more parties are needed in order to form government coalitions , and there are more parties in the party system , which inevitably means the system is changing .
does that the fact that the mainstream parties are shrinking mean that the state has a more limited power to act ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's two-party administration is nothing compared to other coalitions no , not directly .
many countries have stable democracies despite having many more parties .
government coalitions might need four or five parties .
the process of forming a coalition might be trickier , but it by no means weakens the state .
the social democrats are suffering the sharpest decline in membership .
why is this ?
right now , the spd 's role is an especially difficult one .
the party is trapped between a christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- which has shifted to the left and appears to be adopting some of the social democrats ' traditional positions , and the new left party which is occupying what used to be the social democrats ' far-left ground .
sandwiched between these two poles , the party is having trouble maintaining its identity and remaining on the offensive .
to what extent is the left party responsible for the crisis within the spd ?
the left party is , to some extent , an expression of this crisis .
it is partly made up of left-wing party members whom the spd was unable to integrate into its policies and political style .
its founding is definitely one of the factors contributing to the spd 's crisis .
are lafontaine and co . -lsb- former spd members who left to establish an alternative party , the left -rsb- luring voters away from the spd ?
definitely , to some extent .
if the left party attracts ten percent of voters then a large part , if not the majority of these voters , are bound to be disappointed spd voters .
on the whole , the left party stands for traditional spd positions while the cdu stands for neo-liberal spd positions .
meanwhile , the greens are further left than the spd on social and economic issues .
is there any political ground the spd can still claim as its own ?
that description is a little too pat .
the cdu is trying to muscle in on some sdp territory , but the neo-liberal elements of the cdu political agenda are still intact .
the left party has moved in on some of the spd past positions , which had become politically untenable .
stuck in the middle , the sdp is unable to assert itself .
but basically , this would not be impossible were the party to better push through its social democratic positions , which are in fact perfectly viable right now .
within the grand coalition , the cdu is increasingly to the left of the spd .
does the cdu have a social conscience ?
the cdu has always been contradictory , poised between the social elements drawn from its catholic social doctrine , and the neo-liberal , political substance based on the party 's economic principles .
it can show either one of these faces according to election results and public opinion .
for now , after the last , very close election , in which the party fared far worse than it had expected to , it is making an effort to show its social face .
does the sdp still have a loyal base ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor unions , seen here on strike , are a traditional spd base yes it does , but all the parties are seeing their bases shrink .
the number of swing voters is on the rise .
that hits other parties as much as it does the spd .
any young people with political ideals no longer join the political parties but ngos instead - as illustrated by the scenes at the g8 we all saw on television .
why are the political parties no longer so attractive to young people ?
many young people prefer smaller-scale organizations , where they feel they might have some effect and which are concerned with just one or two issues they can easily follow .
they feel that the mainstream parties , and large-scale organizations in general , are too anonymous , concerned with too many issues and too willing to compromise .
the result is that young people are not terribly interested in the parties in their current form .
top spd politicians matthias platzeck , peer steinbrück and frank-walter steinmeier recently published their book " auf der höhe der zeit " about social democracy and progress in the 21st century .
one of the key terms in the book is the " careful welfare state . "
what 's new about this concept ?
basically , the idea is to adopt certain elements of the scandinavian welfare state , primarily with more investment in education , more equal opportunities within education , low-risk political strategies which allow people to thrive in today 's changing society and therefore depend on less long-term welfare support .
basically , it 's a very sensible project but not necessarily a new one .
parts of it already featured in the spd 's berlin program in 1989 .
but in this more extensive version it sets new foci and will serve as the cornerstone of the spd 's new party platform .
the spd will unveil its new policy statements in october .
can we expect anything new ?
there will be a number of new foci : the careful welfare state , a strong emphasis on the environment , especially in the area of climate policy , a strong emphasis on europe and globalization policies .
we wo n't be seeing a new spd but there will be a greater , better and more offensive emphasis on building the foundations for social democracy in the age of globalization .
spd chief kurt beck is not doing too well in the popularity stakes .
does the spd need a media star like gerhard schröder to front it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has n't captured germany 's imagination in the past we have seen that politicians such as helmut kohl , did badly in the opinion polls but were still elected because they had certain persuasive characteristics and persuasive platforms .
beck may well find himself in a similar position .
surveys are not the same as elections , and for the time being it remains to be seen whether beck can mobilize support .
but the next elections are still a long way off .
in the last election , observers said that merkel would never be as media savvy as schröder .
but a look at current opinion polls suggests that she has managed to cut an even better figure within the media than her predecessor .

he is also deputy head of the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- core values commission .
dw-world.de : membership of germany 's mainstream parties has been steadily dwindling .
if this trend continues , does it mean their days are numbered ?
thomas meyer : membership is on the decline , so in this respect the role of the mainstream parties is changing .
more parties are needed in order to form government coalitions , and there are more parties in the party system , which inevitably means the system is changing .
does that the fact that the mainstream parties are shrinking mean that the state has a more limited power to act ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's two-party administration is nothing compared to other coalitions no , not directly .
many countries have stable democracies despite having many more parties .
government coalitions might need four or five parties .
the process of forming a coalition might be trickier , but it by no means weakens the state .
the social democrats are suffering the sharpest decline in membership .
why is this ?
right now , the spd 's role is an especially difficult one .
the party is trapped between a christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- which has shifted to the left and appears to be adopting some of the social democrats ' traditional positions , and the new left party which is occupying what used to be the social democrats ' far-left ground .
sandwiched between these two poles , the party is having trouble maintaining its identity and remaining on the offensive .
to what extent is the left party responsible for the crisis within the spd ?
the left party is , to some extent , an expression of this crisis .
it is partly made up of left-wing party members whom the spd was unable to integrate into its policies and political style .
its founding is definitely one of the factors contributing to the spd 's crisis .
are lafontaine and co . -lsb- former spd members who left to establish an alternative party , the left -rsb- luring voters away from the spd ?
definitely , to some extent .
if the left party attracts ten percent of voters then a large part , if not the majority of these voters , are bound to be disappointed spd voters .
on the whole , the left party stands for traditional spd positions while the cdu stands for neo-liberal spd positions .
meanwhile , the greens are further left than the spd on social and economic issues .
is there any political ground the spd can still claim as its own ?
that description is a little too pat .
the cdu is trying to muscle in on some sdp territory , but the neo-liberal elements of the cdu political agenda are still intact .
the left party has moved in on some of the spd past positions , which had become politically untenable .
stuck in the middle , the sdp is unable to assert itself .
but basically , this would not be impossible were the party to better push through its social democratic positions , which are in fact perfectly viable right now .
within the grand coalition , the cdu is increasingly to the left of the spd .
does the cdu have a social conscience ?
the cdu has always been contradictory , poised between the social elements drawn from its catholic social doctrine , and the neo-liberal , political substance based on the party 's economic principles .
it can show either one of these faces according to election results and public opinion .
for now , after the last , very close election , in which the party fared far worse than it had expected to , it is making an effort to show its social face .
does the sdp still have a loyal base ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor unions , seen here on strike , are a traditional spd base yes it does , but all the parties are seeing their bases shrink .
the number of swing voters is on the rise .
that hits other parties as much as it does the spd .
any young people with political ideals no longer join the political parties but ngos instead - as illustrated by the scenes at the g8 we all saw on television .
why are the political parties no longer so attractive to young people ?
many young people prefer smaller-scale organizations , where they feel they might have some effect and which are concerned with just one or two issues they can easily follow .
they feel that the mainstream parties , and large-scale organizations in general , are too anonymous , concerned with too many issues and too willing to compromise .
the result is that young people are not terribly interested in the parties in their current form .
top spd politicians matthias platzeck , peer steinbrück and frank-walter steinmeier recently published their book " auf der höhe der zeit " about social democracy and progress in the 21st century .
one of the key terms in the book is the " careful welfare state . "
what 's new about this concept ?
basically , the idea is to adopt certain elements of the scandinavian welfare state , primarily with more investment in education , more equal opportunities within education , low-risk political strategies which allow people to thrive in today 's changing society and therefore depend on less long-term welfare support .
basically , it 's a very sensible project but not necessarily a new one .
parts of it already featured in the spd 's berlin program in 1989 .
but in this more extensive version it sets new foci and will serve as the cornerstone of the spd 's new party platform .
the spd will unveil its new policy statements in october .
can we expect anything new ?
there will be a number of new foci : the careful welfare state , a strong emphasis on the environment , especially in the area of climate policy , a strong emphasis on europe and globalization policies .
we wo n't be seeing a new spd but there will be a greater , better and more offensive emphasis on building the foundations for social democracy in the age of globalization .
spd chief kurt beck is not doing too well in the popularity stakes .
does the spd need a media star like gerhard schröder to front it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has n't captured germany 's imagination in the past we have seen that politicians such as helmut kohl , did badly in the opinion polls but were still elected because they had certain persuasive characteristics and persuasive platforms .
beck may well find himself in a similar position .
surveys are not the same as elections , and for the time being it remains to be seen whether beck can mobilize support .
but the next elections are still a long way off .
in the last election , observers said that merkel would never be as media savvy as schröder .
but a look at current opinion polls suggests that she has managed to cut an even better figure within the media than her predecessor .
is that true ?
merkel has managed to create a very good media presence .
she 's accepted both by the public and the media .
it 's helped that she 's concentrated heavily on foreign policy .
it 's always easy to boost popularity with foreign policy : it 's not controversial domestically , and it always looks good to be seen with top international politicians .
that also goes to show that certain politicians can grow into their role , and if they are given the opportunity , they can gain unexpected support . interview by fengbo wang -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is also the seat of the continent 's fastest growing christian missions . from the most obscure , tiny district church to the high-tech cathedral and shopping area in the heart of the city , the charismatic appeal of pentecostal churches is ever present . one of the main features of this kind of church is the use of broadcast , print and the internet in spreading its message .
another is the practice of incorporating elements of traditional african culture , such as upbeat music , loud sermons , and above all , reinforcing deeply held beliefs in witchcraft and demons . every sunday , hundreds of thousands of followers seek spiritual enlightenment .
the faithful storm the myriad big and small churches throughout the city . evangelical churches reinforce traditional african beliefs this religious revival under banners which proclaim " mountain of fire and of wonder " or " redemption from the dead " has become a worldwide symbol for the huge success of evangelical churches in africa . bildunterschrift : lagos is the commercial capital of nigeria and the seat of christendom in africa there are 3.9 million followers of the pentecostal faith in nigeria , the third-highest ranking in the world , according to the world christian database in boston . brazil , which is primarily roman catholic , is the worldwide leader of evangelical pentecostal churches , with more than 24 million followers , while the united states has roughly 6 million adherents . what appeals to church followers is the promise of cures from poverty and disease through god 's blessing . ejiah ndifon , a nigerian engineer founded his own church , the royal kingdom citizen international , based on these ideas . " there are so many people who could have had bigger and better lives , but they could not achieve their destiny , because there was no one to lead them with a vision , " the self-declared prophet said .
" royal kingdom citizen offers this guidance , and brings people together with god . " the faithful believe those who discover the holy spirit will lead transformed lives and that sickness and misfortune can only befall heathens . the success of the pentecostal churches lies with the belief in a god who fights the evil of pandemic disease , according to erhard kamphausen , head of the academy of missions at the university of hamburg . " old superstitions , which were marginalized by more mainstream christian missionaries , have come around full circle , " kamphausen said .
" africans believe in miracles and witchcraft . " german crusader in africa reaches millions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german evangelist reinhard bonnke has led crusades for decades in africa they are n't alone .
german evangelist reinhard bonnke , who is known for his gospel crusades in nigeria , had an epiphany at the age of 9 and decided to devote his life to god . bonnke has held sermons in africa for nearly 30 years , and one of these massive mega-events was attended by 1.6 million followers .
earlier this year , another event was broadcast live on " god tv " by 200 countries , reaching an even broader audience and establishing his reputation as " undoubtedly the most successful missionary of our times . " the web site of the evangelist 's bible association " christ for all nations " sells books and other promotional material on supernatural intervention and miracle cures in seven languages .
a film series on dvd sells for 249 euros -lrb- $ 346 -rrb- . donation to the church tied with god 's blessing ayimah hondeh is a regular at the popular redeemed christian church of god in lagos .
she said she became a true believer on christmas eve 2005 . a young man had shoved her while she was waiting in line at a fast-food restaurant , and not wanting to provoke a fight , she switched to another queue .
shortly afterwards , some armed robbers stormed the restaurant and those in the first queue were injured , but hondeh was unharmed . " i believe it was god 's will , " she said . a few weeks before the pastor had reminded her congregation that god 's blessing was not guaranteed every year . " he said we had to pray twice as hard and double our donation to the church , " hondeh said .
" i quadrupled my contribution to the collection plate every sunday .
i know that god spared me on that day . " a donation tied to god 's blessing is business as usual for evangelical churches .
small wonder that efforts devoted to proselytizing focus on miracle cures , according to kamphausen . islam , christianity battle for african souls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pentecostal-style revival tied to promises of miracles " miracles play a tremendous role , " he said .
" even fairly grounded pentecostal preachers say that there is no day that passes when some small miracle does n't occur . " in principle , chicanery has as much or as little to do with a true belief in the lourdes apparitions or any religion 's professed miracles , but still the theologian warned against such aggressive proselytizing by charismatic churches in africa that capitalize on local superstitions . the repercussions of such religious zeal could unleash conflicts with islam , the dominant faith in northern nigeria .
roughly half of all nigerians are muslim , 40 percent are christian and the remaining 10 percent are members of other faiths . " most churches which carry on their crusades in the north are dangerous and the tension between islam and christianity can only grow , " said kamphausen . thomas mösch , mansour bala bello and geraldo hoffmann -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its german head is returning home just months after his appointment . jaap de hoop scheffer is set to ask germany on thursday , sept .
13 , for police trainers to be deployed in southern afghanistan where alliance forces are dealing with an upsurge in violence and suicide bomb attacks by the taliban , al qaeda and local warlords .
the request comes at a time when the eu 's special police training mission is also hampered by complaints of inadequate eu planning and insufficient nato security support .
german head of eu mission to quit this week , the german interior ministry confirmed that brigadier general friedrich eichele is returning to germany just months after he was appointed to head the eu training mission in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich eichele is returning home to germany eichele , a former commander of the german federal police 's elite gsg 9 counter-terrorism unit , is said to be returning to oversee reforms of the domestic police force .
but , according to german newsmagazine der spiegel , tensions with the eu 's special envoy to afghanistan , francesc vendrell , are the actual reasons behind eichele 's early exit .
vendrell reportedly wanted political control of the mission , something that eichele opposed .
the german embassy in kabul described eichele as simply " overburdened , " the magazine said .
mission plagued by trouble eichele 's early departure reflects the difficulties in trying to establish the mission of 190 european trainers in afghanistan at a time when an increase in violence and suicide attacks by the taliban and al qaeda has raised pressure on isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- countries to scale down their afghan troop presence .
last month , three german police officers responsible for protecting the german ambassador to afghanistan died and a fourth was injured when their vehicles were blown up on a road to the east of kabul .
germany has some 3,000 troops stationed in afghanistan , mostly in the relatively stable north of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf soldiers investigate the scene of an explosion that killed three german police officers until a few months ago , germany was considered to be leading the way in training afghan police and border guards .
it was in charge of the police training from 2002 until this year .
that was one of the reasons why , when the eu took over the mission in june , the top post remained in german hands .
like germany , several eu members , some of whom are also part of nato , have police and military working in afghanistan under separate civil and military mandates .
trainers , incentives missing but in recent months , the training mission has faltered , with critics saying it 's been underfunded , understaffed and poorly prepared .
the european commission has still not approved the budget for armored cars , computers and office equipment for the mission headquarters in kabul , according to news reports .
in addition , the mission has gotten off to a slow start , with reports saying not enough european police trainers or afghan participants have turned up .
some 90 trainers were expected to come from 21 nations , but eu member states have so far provided only half the personnel .
germany has promised up to 60 officials but still has n't delivered on its promise .
der spiegel reported last month that officials have not resolved how to keep newly trained afghan police officers and soldiers from joining the taliban , local militia leaders or drug barons , all of whom offer better pay than the government in kabul .
eu ill prepared , poor nato security ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the eu 's efforts to train the afghan army and police are falling short the mission has also been hampered by nato-member turkey 's blocking of an agreement to regulate cooperation between the alliance and the eu in afghanistan .
turkey has tried to curb military cooperation between the two because the european union has refused to guarantee cypriot officers would not participate .
but nato spokesman james appathurai denied suggestions that nato support for the eu police trainers was inadequate .
" nato has been providing support to the european police in afghanistan , and we can not imagine that nato will provide any less support to the eu police than it does to other organizations such as the united nations , " he said .
on wednesday , nato 's top civilian official in afghanistan , daan everts , said the eu is still not fully contributing to international efforts to bring peace and the rule of law to afghanistan , with incompetence and corruption rife among local afghan forces . " that has to be addressed in a more concerted and forceful manner , " everts said during a news conference .
other observers questioned whether the eu was properly prepared to coordinate operations so far away from its national borders .
" it seems that the eu was not really properly prepared for such a complex mission , " ronja kempin , an afghanistan expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin told the international herald tribune this week .
" the eu seemed to have rushed into setting up this mission , " kempin said , adding that massive corruption in the afghan interior ministry compounded the troubles . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is also the seat of the continent 's fastest growing christian missions . from the most obscure , tiny district church to the high-tech cathedral and shopping area in the heart of the city , the charismatic appeal of pentecostal churches is ever present . one of the main features of this kind of church is the use of broadcast , print and the internet in spreading its message .
another is the practice of incorporating elements of traditional african culture , such as upbeat music , loud sermons , and above all , reinforcing deeply held beliefs in witchcraft and demons . every sunday , hundreds of thousands of followers seek spiritual enlightenment .
the faithful storm the myriad big and small churches throughout the city . evangelical churches reinforce traditional african beliefs this religious revival under banners which proclaim " mountain of fire and of wonder " or " redemption from the dead " has become a worldwide symbol for the huge success of evangelical churches in africa . bildunterschrift : lagos is the commercial capital of nigeria and the seat of christendom in africa there are 3.9 million followers of the pentecostal faith in nigeria , the third-highest ranking in the world , according to the world christian database in boston . brazil , which is primarily roman catholic , is the worldwide leader of evangelical pentecostal churches , with more than 24 million followers , while the united states has roughly 6 million adherents . what appeals to church followers is the promise of cures from poverty and disease through god 's blessing . ejiah ndifon , a nigerian engineer founded his own church , the royal kingdom citizen international , based on these ideas . " there are so many people who could have had bigger and better lives , but they could not achieve their destiny , because there was no one to lead them with a vision , " the self-declared prophet said .
" royal kingdom citizen offers this guidance , and brings people together with god . " the faithful believe those who discover the holy spirit will lead transformed lives and that sickness and misfortune can only befall heathens . the success of the pentecostal churches lies with the belief in a god who fights the evil of pandemic disease , according to erhard kamphausen , head of the academy of missions at the university of hamburg . " old superstitions , which were marginalized by more mainstream christian missionaries , have come around full circle , " kamphausen said .
" africans believe in miracles and witchcraft . " german crusader in africa reaches millions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german evangelist reinhard bonnke has led crusades for decades in africa they are n't alone .
german evangelist reinhard bonnke , who is known for his gospel crusades in nigeria , had an epiphany at the age of 9 and decided to devote his life to god . bonnke has held sermons in africa for nearly 30 years , and one of these massive mega-events was attended by 1.6 million followers .
earlier this year , another event was broadcast live on " god tv " by 200 countries , reaching an even broader audience and establishing his reputation as " undoubtedly the most successful missionary of our times . " the web site of the evangelist 's bible association " christ for all nations " sells books and other promotional material on supernatural intervention and miracle cures in seven languages .
a film series on dvd sells for 249 euros -lrb- $ 346 -rrb- . donation to the church tied with god 's blessing ayimah hondeh is a regular at the popular redeemed christian church of god in lagos .
she said she became a true believer on christmas eve 2005 . a young man had shoved her while she was waiting in line at a fast-food restaurant , and not wanting to provoke a fight , she switched to another queue .
shortly afterwards , some armed robbers stormed the restaurant and those in the first queue were injured , but hondeh was unharmed . " i believe it was god 's will , " she said . a few weeks before the pastor had reminded her congregation that god 's blessing was not guaranteed every year . " he said we had to pray twice as hard and double our donation to the church , " hondeh said .
" i quadrupled my contribution to the collection plate every sunday .
i know that god spared me on that day . " a donation tied to god 's blessing is business as usual for evangelical churches .
small wonder that efforts devoted to proselytizing focus on miracle cures , according to kamphausen . islam , christianity battle for african souls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pentecostal-style revival tied to promises of miracles " miracles play a tremendous role , " he said .
" even fairly grounded pentecostal preachers say that there is no day that passes when some small miracle does n't occur . " in principle , chicanery has as much or as little to do with a true belief in the lourdes apparitions or any religion 's professed miracles , but still the theologian warned against such aggressive proselytizing by charismatic churches in africa that capitalize on local superstitions . the repercussions of such religious zeal could unleash conflicts with islam , the dominant faith in northern nigeria .
roughly half of all nigerians are muslim , 40 percent are christian and the remaining 10 percent are members of other faiths . " most churches which carry on their crusades in the north are dangerous and the tension between islam and christianity can only grow , " said kamphausen . thomas mösch , mansour bala bello and geraldo hoffmann -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany , however , never makes it anywhere near the top of any such list .
the country 's inhabitants have after all turned moaning and complaining in a national pastime that 's probably best practiced by those living in and around berlin .
southern germans seem to find it rather difficult to truly exceed at whining .
that 's why it 's a bit strange that a school in beautiful , picturesque heidelberg has now become the first one to take on the challenge of turning germans into happier people .
at one of the city 's high schools , some 60 students have started attending classes in happiness .
" we want to teach contentment , self-confidence and personal responsibility , " the school 's director , ernst fritz-schubert , told reporters , adding that often all that 's needed is a change of perspective : instead of saying : " i am lazy , " students should switch to " i 'm thinking about myself . "
the course 's lesson plan includes classes on " physical comfort " and " social competence " and aims to make students aware about themselves , their environment and society as a whole .
an actor and a relaxation therapist will also participate in some of the lesson units .
this would n't be germany , however , if students ' results were n't quantified , and grades will be issued in the happy class .
admittedly , there are two advantages to that : for one thing , " happiness " might help to improve the grade average on people 's high school diplomas .
and secondly , just in case they 're not that great at being happy , they 'll get something to complain about . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there has been pressure on germany to lift this restriction , particularly to allow military instructors to accompany the afghan troops they have trained . germany has also sent six reconnaissance tornado jets to afghanistan to assist isaf operations throughout the country .

13 . he repeated , however , that the alliance would prefer its member countries to put as few restrictions on the use of their troops as possible .
other nato members , including the united states and canada , have requested nations drop restrictions on where troops are deployed . " it is unfair to criticize germany ...
i am realistic , i understand the domestic political situation in germany , " de hoop scheffer said . " and it is not only in southern afghanistan where there is danger .
germany has also had casualties in the north . " two german police officers and a foreign ministry employee were killed by a bomb in kabul in august , bringing the german death toll in afghanistan to 25 soldiers and three police officers .

" we will maintain the predominance of our military presence in the north , and regarding the specific tasks , we will focus on training the afghan army , " steinmeier told reporters after meeting de hoop scheffer . the german army 's afghanistan mandates prevent it from being used in the south , where military casualties are higher .
there has been pressure on germany to lift this restriction , particularly to allow military instructors to accompany the afghan troops they have trained . germany has also sent six reconnaissance tornado jets to afghanistan to assist isaf operations throughout the country .

it 's survival is threatened since russia decided to pull out . speaking in the german parliament on wednesday , sept .
12 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that germany could not permit the treaty , which is aimed at limiting conventional arms and was developed over a long period of time , to be dissolved .
" i will be just as annoyed as you if this treaty is suspended , " steinmeier told lawmakers , adding that the conference in berlin would try to " rebuild lost trust . "
the cfe treaty was signed in 1990 and updated in 1999 .
it limits the number of tanks , artillery , aircraft and helicopters stationed in europe .
russia announced in july that it no longer considered the treaty effective .
moscow said that the failure of nato countries to ratify the latest version of the treaty was the main reason for the decision .
but russian officials also said that a us plan to station parts of a new missile defense system in central european countries also played a role , reuters news service reported .
they consider the system a threat to russia 's national security .
nato members , meanwhile , have said that they will not ratify the latest cfe treaty version until russia withdraws its troops from the former soviet republics of moldova and georgia , which moscow promised to do in 1999 when the treaty was signed . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the groups are requesting the government intervene to reduce pasta prices .
an increase in the price of wheat in recent months has forced pasta manufacturers to pass on the cost .
pasta is a national dish in italy , with each italian eating on average 28 kg -lrb- 62 lb -rrb- of pasta every year .
dearer flour the leader of one consumer association , elio lannutti , said the objective of the pasta strike was to forgo pasta for one day , in order to have more of it in the days to come . "
a plate of pasta probably costs less than an apple " furio bragagnolo , vice president of the italian pasta manufacturers association italian supermarkets may mark up pasta prices by 20 % by the end of this year .
one large producer of the commodity , de cecco , described the strike as symbolic , and said it expected little fluctuation in its market as a result .
" there is no dish that costs less , " furio bragagnolo , the vice president of the italian pasta manufacturers association told associated press agency .
" whoever decides to strike against pasta will spend more on whatever they buy instead .
a plate of pasta probably costs less than an apple . "
global warming and the growing use of durum wheat as a bio-fuel are blamed for the steep rise in pasta prices .
the price for durum flour , the main ingredient for italian pasta , has risen from 0.26 euro per kg -lrb- £ 0.18 -rrb- to 0.45 euro per kg in the last two months .
are you in italy ?
are people supporting the protest ?
will you be eating pasta today ?
are increased wheat prices affecting your country ?
a selection of your comments : here in rome today it seems the outcome of the formula one spy scandal is of more interest to most people .
consumer worries are a constant worry however , especially with autumn price hikes likely for gas and electricity etc .
pasta prices rises are just symptomatic .
philip curnow , rome i support the protest and hope to see the same happening in other countries .
however , being an old fashion ' milanese ' , i eat pasta very rarely and prefer rice instead ; - -rrb- adelaide ajroldi , milan , italy i and most of my friends are not going to eat and to buy pasta today because we are really fed up with continuous price increase for pasta and tomato sauce .
also the prices of pizza have grown really a lot recently .
grasso angelo , torino , italy i did n't know anything about a pasta strike .
yes , today i ate pasta at lunch and i think that increased wheat prices are not affecting our country a lot .
pasta is the base of every italian lunch , very hard to make an italian change this habit , this tradition .
monica , lecce , italy this morning i spoke on the phone with an italian colleague based in rome , and the first thing i asked was ' are you going to give pasta a miss for the day ? '
he laughed quizically .
i explained that i 'd heard on the news that italians were being asked to refrain from pasta for a day .
he laughed again .
he did n't have the foggiest what i was talking about .
obviously it 's bigger news here than in italy .

yes , pasta and bread are increasing - but not only , also gas and electricity .
ingrid simon , messina , sicily i guess we should learn from this ' pasta protest ' .
rice prices has been going up since last year which is a staple food here .
should we also forgo eating rice for a day in protest ?
if this protest brings positive results in lowering the price of pasta , we could possibly go for a similar action .
good luck to the italians .
syeed milky , dhaka , bangladesh italians will pay whatever for their pasta .
the poorest families in sicily eat it 3 times a day .
breakfast , lunch and dinner .
unfortunately we 've got used to the forever increasing prices and have learnt to cough up whatever .
cathrene hume , catania , italy let 's be serious : this protest is just nonsense , if one considers to what extent people 's lives may be actually affected by such a price increase , while this is the country with the highest percentage of mobile phones per person in the world !
that sounds ridiculous , and it 's crystal-clear why .
luca dombrè , parma , italy i am italian , now in london : today i am not eating pasta .
my family in italy approves the strike because not only pasta 's price rised but also bread and whatever made with flour .
doing the shopping is every day more expensive ..
carlotta , verona , italy consumer associations have always organised food strikes , as far back as i can remember , but it has only recently started gaining support with the public .
finally people are hearing about these " stikes " before they take place , thanks to the increase in media coverage .
however it 's still not clear of the impact these strikes have .
" do not eat pasta today " is almost like asking the impossible in italy .
gloria r , milan , italy the reality of the situation is that with so many increases in the cost of living in italy including fuel , most people can not afford to eat anything else but pasta .

in the four decades since it was first built , the rotunda has lived through the 1974 birmingham pub bombings , which affected a pub at its base , and seen off the threat of demolition .
the exterior of the rotunda was revamped to include more glass now , the 265ft -lrb- 81m -rrb- tall building , originally designed to house offices , has undergone an external facelift and work is still continuing to turn its interior into luxury flats .
on wednesday it had the second topping-out ceremony of its lifetime .
in 1993 it survived the threat of demolition as part of a proposed facelift of the bull ring markets and in 2000 was made a grade ii listed building .
professor carl chinn , a birmingham historian , said the rotunda had a special place in many people 's hearts - but it had not always been so popular .
' vibrant city ' " it was quite controversial when it was built because it was so radical , " he said .
" for my generation who 've grown up with it , it 's been part of the birmingham skyline and we 've seen it as part of our heritage .
but for my mother 's generation it was n't particularly welcome at the time .
" it was a symbol of the ' 60s , to show that birmingham was a vibrant city that was developing .
people living in the flats will have views for miles around birmingham " it was seen as something that would have looked more at home in america , and many americans have always seen birmingham as the most us-style uk city . "
when the building 's 230 flats went on sale in october they were all snapped up within two hours by people who had been queuing all night to put down their deposits .
the revamped rotunda , when it opens in spring 2008 , will include one and two-bed apartments on 19 floors , with six penthouses on top .

in the four decades since it was first built , the rotunda has lived through the 1974 birmingham pub bombings , which affected a pub at its base , and seen off the threat of demolition .
the exterior of the rotunda was revamped to include more glass now , the 265ft -lrb- 81m -rrb- tall building , originally designed to house offices , has undergone an external facelift and work is still continuing to turn its interior into luxury flats .
on wednesday it had the second topping-out ceremony of its lifetime .
in 1993 it survived the threat of demolition as part of a proposed facelift of the bull ring markets and in 2000 was made a grade ii listed building .
professor carl chinn , a birmingham historian , said the rotunda had a special place in many people 's hearts - but it had not always been so popular .
' vibrant city ' " it was quite controversial when it was built because it was so radical , " he said .
" for my generation who 've grown up with it , it 's been part of the birmingham skyline and we 've seen it as part of our heritage .
but for my mother 's generation it was n't particularly welcome at the time .
" it was a symbol of the ' 60s , to show that birmingham was a vibrant city that was developing .
people living in the flats will have views for miles around birmingham " it was seen as something that would have looked more at home in america , and many americans have always seen birmingham as the most us-style uk city . "
when the building 's 230 flats went on sale in october they were all snapped up within two hours by people who had been queuing all night to put down their deposits .
the revamped rotunda , when it opens in spring 2008 , will include one and two-bed apartments on 19 floors , with six penthouses on top .
costs ranged from £ 150,000 to £ 500,000 for a penthouse .
original architect developer urban splash , which took over the project in 2006 , has not revealed how much the whole project has cost .
architect glenn howells said the firm had passed a lot of the plans by the rotunda 's original architect , jim roberts , who is now in his 80s .
glenn howells said they had consulted the original architect " when english heritage had problems with what we wanted to do with the building , because it was listed , we spoke to jim , " mr howells said .
" he whipped out the original plan and showed a drawing that was almost identical to ours .
he said he 'd always wanted to have more glass and fewer panels in the design , but money and the technology available then limited him .
" in effect it was his building and we did n't want to do anything he would n't agree with . "
people in the city centre 's rotunda square had mixed views about the building .
' it 's an icon ' abbi simms , 19 , who was moving to manchester from birmingham , said : " it 's pretty horrible .
" you see all the nice clean , white railings and things around the bull ring and it does n't look good .
but it looks a lot better than it did . "
nathan southall and james bandenbury said they were fans her grandmother anne raza , 63 , though was more of a fan .
" i 've grown up with it and it 's always been a part of birmingham to me , " said mrs raza , of northfield .
" it 's one of those things that makes the city and we could be represented by much worse things . "
nineteen-year-olds james bandenbury and nathan southall were also glad the building had been saved and redeveloped .
" it 's an icon , " said mr bandenbury , of perry barr .
" it 's in a prime location for birmingham .

now a little bit of china 's vast army of 2,000-year-old terracotta warriors - built to protect the first emperor qin shihuangdi in the afterlife - has come to the british museum in london .
and the exhibition , the first emperor : china 's terracotta army , looks set to become one of the most successful the museum has ever staged .
last week it was reported nearly 100,000 tickets had been sold for the six-month exhibition .
exhibition curator jane portal said the amount of interest was " fantastic , but not surprising " .
" china has become such an important country to the rest of the world .
it is growing so quickly , and of course it will be holding the olympics next year .
people are interested in it , " she said .
and the china we see today , she says , can trace its roots back to around 220bc , and the reign of the first emperor .
underground palace qin shihuangdi , first emperor of the qin dynasty , is credited with unifying the country , and creating what the museum calls the " oldest surviving political entity in the world " .
although a controversial figure with a reputation for tyranny , he introduced a number of progressive changes that still live on , centuries later .
currency , writing scripts , weights and measures were standardised and a centralised bureaucracy developed to administer the new country .
the name china is thought to derive from " qin " , his home state .
the tomb of emperor qin , positioned on a mound near the ancient city of xian in north-west china , had long been known about .
but when farmers accidentally dug up the head of a warrior while building a well some 2km -lrb- 1.2 miles -rrb- from the tomb site , they had stumbled on something that literally changed our view of history .
more than 7,000 life-size warriors , built out of terracotta and originally brightly painted , had been buried in battle formation in three pits along with their horses , wooden chariots and weapons . "
so little is known about the first emperor outside of china and yet he is such an important figure in chinese history " jane portal exhibition curator archaeologists believe they are the result of one of the earliest examples of mass production , with teams of labourers working on the separate parts of each warrior .
in the last decade , finds in other parts of the tomb complex have since revealed that the first emperor not only sought military protection in his afterlife - he wanted to recreate his entire realm .
terracotta figurines of acrobats and weightlifters as well as musicians and bronze birds are thought to have been designed to entertain him .
stern figures of bureaucrats , with their arms folded under their long sleeves , symbolise his civilian ambitions .
close cooperation these figures are just some of the 120 objects that have been brought over from the museum of the terracotta army in xian to london .
it is the largest collection of artefacts ever to have been loaned abroad by a chinese museum .
they were packed into 46 crates and sent in four batches by air , arriving two weeks ago .
li xiuzhen , of the xian museum who helped oversee delivery of the precious cargo , said the process involved specialist packing and lots of condition checks .
the journey by road from xian to beijing alone took two days , while the terracotta horses had to come on cargo flights via amsterdam because they were so bulky , she added .
the idea for the exhibition came two years ago , while jane portal and the museum 's director neil macgregor were in china as part of official efforts to boost cultural ties between the two countries .
grand vision taking time out to visit the museum in xian , neil macgregor was " bowled over " by what he saw and plans for a temporary exhibition were formed " pretty much there and then " , ms portal said .
ms li said china was also keen on the idea , and both museums have worked closely together over the last two years to turn it into a reality .
" we hope this exhibition will promote a cultural exchange between china and britain , and we also hope that the british people might learn more about china and chinese history , " she told the bbc news website .
ms portal agrees .
" so little is known about the first emperor outside of china and yet he is such an important figure in chinese history .
" i hope that people who come to the exhibition will get a sense of the grand scale of his vision - the fact that he wanted to carry on ruling over the universe , even after his death . "
the first emperor : china 's terracotta army runs from 13 september 2007 to 6 april 2008 at the british museum in london .
a programme about china 's terracotta army will also be broadcast on 15 september 2007 at 2000 bst on bbc two .

the carmaker has come top in the latest study by independent brand research firm superbrands , which questioned more than 2,000 consumers .
in second place was apple 's ipod , followed by video website youtube and danish hi-fi firm bang and olufsen .
back in march , us giant ford sold aston martin to a uk consortium for £ 479m .
' love affair ' " the success of casino royale - and the rekindled love affair between the british public and bond as a result - shows there is a deeply ingrained association with the man and the car in the minds of britons , " said superbrands .
superbrands top 10 1 .
aston martin 2. ipod 3 .
youtube 4 .
bang & olufsen 5 .
google 6 .
sony playstation 7 .
apple 8 .
agent provocateur 9 .
nintendo 10 .
virgin atlantic based in gaydon , warwickshire , aston martin 's current models include the vantage and db9 and this week it is displaying its new flagship , the dbs , at the frankfurt motor show .
the first james bond film to feature an aston martin was goldfinger in 1964 .
superbrands said that in fifth place in its survey was search engine google , followed by the sony playstation games console .
computer-maker apple was seventh , with the remainder of the top 10 being underwear firm agent provocateur , games console firm nintendo and virgin atlantic .
" the top 20 is a reflection of our changing needs , wants and interests , " said stephen cheliotis , chairman of the coolbrands council .
" you could argue that it 's split into two pretty clearly-defined categories - on the one hand , things can become cool by virtue of their necessity or prevalence in your life , like google or amazon .
" on the other , the things you really want , but may know you 'll never get - like a rolex or a ferrari - are considered just as cool . "

it is not certain that ms jones 's legislation will be passed , but she said : " it is estimated that including a sprinkler system adds around 1 % of a new home 's build cost - less than the laying of decent carpets throughout the building .
" there is no reason why the assembly can not take a uk lead by installing sprinklers in all new homes in wales . "
ms jones was " delighted " the assembly government now required sprinklers to be installed in all new school buildings and , wherever practicable , in existing school buildings undergoing renovation in wales .
ms jones won a ballot of backbench ams for the chance to put forward the lco to make it compulsory for automated fire sprinklers to be fitted into all new homes in wales .
' incredibly sophisticated ' if it is conferred by parliament , it will allow the assembly to pass a welsh law , known as an assembly measure .
simon smith , chief fire officer for north wales fire and rescue service , said : " sprinklers attack a fire in its very early stages and can prevent it from spreading and causing injury or loss of life . "
mr smith said the systems were " incredibly sophisticated " , and cases of false activation were extremely rare .
he said it was a myth that all heads of the sprinkler system activated at once .
" in fact , the water released by a sprinkler will cause much less damage to a building than the amount of water used by firefighters tackling an advanced fire , " he said .

ms jones was " delighted " the assembly government now required sprinklers to be installed in all new school buildings and , wherever practicable , in existing school buildings undergoing renovation in wales .
ms jones won a ballot of backbench ams for the chance to put forward the lco to make it compulsory for automated fire sprinklers to be fitted into all new homes in wales .

simon smith , chief fire officer for north wales fire and rescue service , said : " sprinklers attack a fire in its very early stages and can prevent it from spreading and causing injury or loss of life . "
mr smith said the systems were " incredibly sophisticated " , and cases of false activation were extremely rare .

australia 's qantas and japan 's air nippon airways are the latest airlines to halt flights by the planes .
the move , backed by the canadian government , has led to the cancellation of at least 200 flights worldwide .
the move comes after landing gear on two q400s owned by scandinavia 's sas failed on touchdown .
montreal-based bombardier ordered the planes to be grounded after the equipment failures forced emergency landings of the planes in denmark on sunday and lithuania on wednesday .
sas said no-one was seriously hurt in the incidents .
cancellations the order has led to at least 60 planes being grounded worldwide .
both sas and us regional carrier horizon air cancelled more than 100 flights each to inspect the aircraft - the firms own 27 and 19 turboprops respectively .
meanwhile , qantas , lufthansa , flybe , all nippon airways and japan air commuter are also grounding the planes , bombardier said .
" our priority right now is to get the inspections rolling and to ensure that some of the older aircraft with the higher cycles are visually inspected and get back into operation as quickly as possible , " said bombardier spokesman bert cruickshank .
the company added that the groundings were a " precautionary measure " , adding it believed its aircraft were " absolutely safe and reliable " .
safety fears aviation regulators in the us and canada have recently ordered the firm to check wing problems on certain jets used by regional carriers in north america - affecting more than 700 planes .
the q400 turboprop - which carries between 68 and 78 passengers - has been in use since 2000 , and more than 160 of the planes have been delivered around the world .
however , its recent problems are not the first to affect involve the plane 's landing gear .
in march , an all nippon airways q400 plane carrying 56 passengers and four crew landed safely after its nose gear failed to descend .

australia 's qantas and japan 's air nippon airways are the latest airlines to halt flights by the planes .
the move , backed by the canadian government , has led to the cancellation of at least 200 flights worldwide .
the move comes after landing gear on two q400s owned by scandinavia 's sas failed on touchdown .
montreal-based bombardier ordered the planes to be grounded after the equipment failures forced emergency landings of the planes in denmark on sunday and lithuania on wednesday .
sas said no-one was seriously hurt in the incidents .
cancellations the order has led to at least 60 planes being grounded worldwide .
both sas and us regional carrier horizon air cancelled more than 100 flights each to inspect the aircraft - the firms own 27 and 19 turboprops respectively .
meanwhile , qantas , lufthansa , flybe , all nippon airways and japan air commuter are also grounding the planes , bombardier said .
" our priority right now is to get the inspections rolling and to ensure that some of the older aircraft with the higher cycles are visually inspected and get back into operation as quickly as possible , " said bombardier spokesman bert cruickshank .
the company added that the groundings were a " precautionary measure " , adding it believed its aircraft were " absolutely safe and reliable " .
safety fears aviation regulators in the us and canada have recently ordered the firm to check wing problems on certain jets used by regional carriers in north america - affecting more than 700 planes .
the q400 turboprop - which carries between 68 and 78 passengers - has been in use since 2000 , and more than 160 of the planes have been delivered around the world .
however , its recent problems are not the first to affect involve the plane 's landing gear .
in march , an all nippon airways q400 plane carrying 56 passengers and four crew landed safely after its nose gear failed to descend .

the men , who arrived in a vehicle in vaishali district early on thursday , were stopped by villagers who suspected them of being thieves .
the villagers have set up patrols after complaining about a spate of thefts , and the lack of police action .
correspondents say that the incident highlights the widespread problem of mob lynching in india .
bihar home secretary afzal amanullah told the bbc that one man had been injured in the incident in dhelpurwa village and taken to a local hospital .
the surviving man in the group , ranjit keuri , has told the police that they had come to the village to commit thefts , an official said .
no arrests have been made .
brutality a local resident , manjay lall , said police had failed to take action after rising incidents of theft in the village .
" when the police did not act , villagers began patrolling the village .
so they caught these men and lynched them at the spot , " he said .
vaishali police chief s anupama nilekar said an investigation had been launched to determine whether the men were thieves .
" only after a proper probe we can say whether those lynched were thieves or not .
the villagers are saying they were thieves and on the face of it , it seems so , " she said .
bihar chief minister nitish kumar has condemned the incident .
" the people should catch the criminals and hand them over to the police .
they should not take the law into their own hands , " he said .
the eastern state of bihar is considered to be one of india 's most lawless states .
it has seen a number of recent incidents of mob lynching and alleged police brutality .
last month , the local police were filmed joining a mob to punch and kick a man accused of stealing a gold chain in bhagalpur town .
at least two policemen could be seen in the video .
two have been suspended pending an inquiry into the incident .
last week , a mob beat three people suspected of stealing motorcycles in nawada district and gouged out the eyes of one of them .

sir mike said the british royal legion campaign was about acknowledging the value of the armed forces .
he said that wounded soldiers and their families deserved to be treated " fairly and decently " .
the legion says britain is failing in its duty of care to its armed forces and former servicemen and women .
the legion also claims the military covenant - the obligation to support people who fight for their country - is not being honoured .
' bogged down ' sir mike told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " it is not just a question of the ministry of defence or the treasury , it 's also a question of the nation having this sense of value of its servicemen . "
the royal british legion campaign - titled broken covenant - will focus on the need to boost medical care , strengthen the system of coroners ' inquests to ensure swift closure for bereaved families , and provide more compensation - particularly for military personnel who suffer multiple injuries . "
we believe the nation has failed to live up to its commitments under the covenant " frances done , royal british legion the issue of compensation and how it is calculated has been highlighted by a number of cases involving servicemen wounded in iraq and afghanistan .
general sir mike jackson , the former head of the british army , said : " these compensation schemes are hard-fought with the treasury whose heart is perhaps a little stony in these matters .
" people get bogged down in the minutiae of the rules and do n't really look at what the outcomes are . "
' left to struggle ' while the military covenant is not legally binding , the legion says it been enshrined through convention and custom , and represents " the nation 's moral commitment to its armed forces . "
speaking at the campaign launch , frances done , director general of the royal british legion , said : " we believe the nation has failed to live up to its commitments under the covenant , with the consequence that some people have been left to struggle alone once they leave the services .
" charities such as the legion are increasingly being called upon to fill the gap . "
armed forces minister bob ainsworth welcomed the campaign but said neither he nor military chiefs believed the covenant is broken .
he said : " there are areas where we have already made significant progress , but we acknowledge that we must do more .
these areas include mental healthcare for veterans , compensation , inquests and accommodation . "
he added the government was working with the nhs to develop a new model of community-based mental health care for veterans .

the legion says britain is failing in its duty of care to its armed forces and former servicemen and women .
the legion also claims the military covenant - the obligation to support people who fight for their country - is not being honoured .
' bogged down ' sir mike told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " it is not just a question of the ministry of defence or the treasury , it 's also a question of the nation having this sense of value of its servicemen . "
the royal british legion campaign - titled broken covenant - will focus on the need to boost medical care , strengthen the system of coroners ' inquests to ensure swift closure for bereaved families , and provide more compensation - particularly for military personnel who suffer multiple injuries .

" charities such as the legion are increasingly being called upon to fill the gap . "
armed forces minister bob ainsworth welcomed the campaign but said neither he nor military chiefs believed the covenant is broken .
he said : " there are areas where we have already made significant progress , but we acknowledge that we must do more .
these areas include mental healthcare for veterans , compensation , inquests and accommodation . "

sir mike said the british royal legion campaign was about acknowledging the value of the armed forces .
he said that wounded soldiers and their families deserved to be treated " fairly and decently " .
the legion says britain is failing in its duty of care to its armed forces and former servicemen and women .
the legion also claims the military covenant - the obligation to support people who fight for their country - is not being honoured .
' bogged down ' sir mike told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " it is not just a question of the ministry of defence or the treasury , it 's also a question of the nation having this sense of value of its servicemen . "
the royal british legion campaign - titled broken covenant - will focus on the need to boost medical care , strengthen the system of coroners ' inquests to ensure swift closure for bereaved families , and provide more compensation - particularly for military personnel who suffer multiple injuries .

general sir mike jackson , the former head of the british army , said : " these compensation schemes are hard-fought with the treasury whose heart is perhaps a little stony in these matters .
" people get bogged down in the minutiae of the rules and do n't really look at what the outcomes are . "

" charities such as the legion are increasingly being called upon to fill the gap . "
armed forces minister bob ainsworth welcomed the campaign but said neither he nor military chiefs believed the covenant is broken .
he said : " there are areas where we have already made significant progress , but we acknowledge that we must do more .
these areas include mental healthcare for veterans , compensation , inquests and accommodation . "

the coming-of-age film tells the story of four australian boys who head off on holiday and find themselves competing to be adopted by a couple they meet at the seaside .
it is the third orphan radcliffe has played on screen , having also starred in a bbc adaptation of charles dickens 's david copperfield .
but the actor is quick to point out that his december boys ' character , maps , is very different to jk rowling 's famous wizard .
" harry wears his heart on his sleeve and is very , very vocal about how he feels , " he says .
by contrast , maps is " very quiet , and for the first quarter of the film does n't say much " .
indeed , radcliffe found his main challenge playing maps was " having to communicate the same as with any other character , but with less dialogue " .
worldwide fame the film marks the 18-year-old 's first big screen role outside of the potter series .
radcliffe says he chose december boys for many of the usual reasons - namely that it was the right script at the right time .
but he admits his choice was influenced by an anonymous director .
the director 's advice to radcliffe was to choose an ensemble piece , rather than a film dependent on his individual performance .
nonetheless , radcliffe is aware media attention will initially be focused on him and his performance .
it 's just a question of establishing myself as an actor , not a character daniel radcliffe but he hopes " once they -lsb- the press -rsb- get in there , they will look at the film as a whole rather than just analysing my performance " .
radcliffe has earned worldwide fame as the boy wizard harry potter , a role he has been playing since the age of 12 .
but he admits he is still nervous about the critical reaction to his performance in december boys .
his way of dealing with critics is " not to think about it " .
" once you start worrying about reviews , you end up being self-conscious and neurotic , " says radcliffe .
serious actor december boys also sees radcliffe 's first on-screen love scene alongside australian actress teresa palmer .
but the teenage star claims he had " a sufficient amount of experience " to fall back on .
since baring all on stage in the london production of equus , love scenes have not proved a problem for the young actor .
radcliffe is hoping to take equus to broadway next year however , he graciously adds that things may have been different if it was n't for his co-star palmer , calling her " the seasoned pro " when it comes to playing love scenes .
perhaps surprisingly - given his early film success - radcliffe has been having one-on-one drama coaching for the past two years .
" i need to establish with people in the industry that i absolutely want to make a career out of this , " he explains .
although he is " incredibly proud " of the potter series , he realises " it 's just a question of establishing myself as an actor , not a character " .
' daunting ' despite his long-term involvement with the boy wizard , radcliffe says he finds it " surprisingly easy " to detach himself from quidditch-playing harry when reading the popular books .
but his inside knowledge still gives him a headstart on other potter fans .
with harry potter and the deathly hallows only recently published , radcliffe claims he " worked out the ending " to the final instalment in the series , " based on fragments of conversation with jo rowling " .
a part of him admits he will be relieved when the harry potter films are concluded , but he adds that it will also be " quite daunting " , as he will no longer be in the " harry potter world " .
in the meantime , he can return to his comfort zone , with filming of the sixth instalment - harry potter and the half-blood prince - due to start later this month .
december boys is released in cinemas across the uk on 14 september .

the coming-of-age film tells the story of four australian boys who head off on holiday and find themselves competing to be adopted by a couple they meet at the seaside .
it is the third orphan radcliffe has played on screen , having also starred in a bbc adaptation of charles dickens 's david copperfield .
but the actor is quick to point out that his december boys ' character , maps , is very different to jk rowling 's famous wizard .
" harry wears his heart on his sleeve and is very , very vocal about how he feels , " he says .
by contrast , maps is " very quiet , and for the first quarter of the film does n't say much " .
indeed , radcliffe found his main challenge playing maps was " having to communicate the same as with any other character , but with less dialogue " .
worldwide fame the film marks the 18-year-old 's first big screen role outside of the potter series .
radcliffe says he chose december boys for many of the usual reasons - namely that it was the right script at the right time .
but he admits his choice was influenced by an anonymous director .
the director 's advice to radcliffe was to choose an ensemble piece , rather than a film dependent on his individual performance .
nonetheless , radcliffe is aware media attention will initially be focused on him and his performance .
it 's just a question of establishing myself as an actor , not a character daniel radcliffe but he hopes " once they -lsb- the press -rsb- get in there , they will look at the film as a whole rather than just analysing my performance " .
radcliffe has earned worldwide fame as the boy wizard harry potter , a role he has been playing since the age of 12 .
but he admits he is still nervous about the critical reaction to his performance in december boys .
his way of dealing with critics is " not to think about it " .
" once you start worrying about reviews , you end up being self-conscious and neurotic , " says radcliffe .
serious actor december boys also sees radcliffe 's first on-screen love scene alongside australian actress teresa palmer .
but the teenage star claims he had " a sufficient amount of experience " to fall back on .
since baring all on stage in the london production of equus , love scenes have not proved a problem for the young actor .
radcliffe is hoping to take equus to broadway next year however , he graciously adds that things may have been different if it was n't for his co-star palmer , calling her " the seasoned pro " when it comes to playing love scenes .
perhaps surprisingly - given his early film success - radcliffe has been having one-on-one drama coaching for the past two years .
" i need to establish with people in the industry that i absolutely want to make a career out of this , " he explains .
although he is " incredibly proud " of the potter series , he realises " it 's just a question of establishing myself as an actor , not a character " .
' daunting ' despite his long-term involvement with the boy wizard , radcliffe says he finds it " surprisingly easy " to detach himself from quidditch-playing harry when reading the popular books .
but his inside knowledge still gives him a headstart on other potter fans .
with harry potter and the deathly hallows only recently published , radcliffe claims he " worked out the ending " to the final instalment in the series , " based on fragments of conversation with jo rowling " .
a part of him admits he will be relieved when the harry potter films are concluded , but he adds that it will also be " quite daunting " , as he will no longer be in the " harry potter world " .
in the meantime , he can return to his comfort zone , with filming of the sixth instalment - harry potter and the half-blood prince - due to start later this month .
december boys is released in cinemas across the uk on 14 september .

the remaining members of the legendary rock group will play a one-off show at the 20,000-capacity o2 arena in london on 26 november , they said on wednesday .
the concert 's website has struggled to cope with demand , and organisers have asked fans to be patient .
registration for the £ 125 tickets closes at midday bst on monday .
tickets for the show will be allocated by public ballot - a move promoter harvey goldsmith hopes will deter touts .
fans warned " we just hope and pray that those people who get a ticket in a ballot are just going to act accordingly , " he said goldsmith also warned fans who turned to internet auction sites like ebay or other unauthorised sources that they would have their tickets cancelled .
" they might have paid the money but they ai n't going to get the ticket , " he said .
led zeppelin have sold more than 100 million albums in the us alone led zeppelin were one of the most popular and influential rock acts of the 1970s , setting the template for heavy metal and shocking the press with their debauched lifestyle .
best known for songs like stairway to heaven , whole lotta love and kashmir , they sold more than 300 million albums around the world .
they split in 1980 after drummer john bonham died , and have only regrouped for a handful of shows and award ceremonies since .
bonham 's son jason will join the three remaining members - singer robert plant , guitarist jimmy page and bassist john paul jones - for the forthcoming concert .
it is being held in tribute to music mogul ahmet ertegun , who co-founded atlantic records and signed led zeppelin in 1968 .
he died in 2006 after a fall at a rolling stones concert .
other acts lined up for the show include pete townshend , bill wyman and the rhythm kings , paolo nutini and foreigner .
letter the idea for the tribute show came from his widow , according to goldsmith , who then set about persuading led zeppelin to headline .
have your say i am not even from the uk and i will be making this my life 's pilgrimage .
zeppelin and ahmet will live forever felice maihem , melbourne , australia send us your comments " i wrote to everybody and in particular to robert and jimmy and john paul , and said : ' look this is an opportunity for you to come together and really pay homage to your mentor and mine , and would you do it ? '
" much to my amazement they came back and said yes , " he said .
according to the nme , goldsmith said the band " have no plans to tour but hopes they will " .
profits from the concert will go towards scholarships in ertegun 's name in uk , the usa and turkey , the country of his birth .

today he is outgoing and confident and his parents put the dramatic personality change down to his hearing aids , which he wears each day .
joe was born with a severe , but undiagnosed hearing loss .
about 840 babies , like joe , are born each year in england with hearing loss in both ears and 500 with a loss in one ear .
problems spotted sooner but a system gradually phased in to screen each child at birth was not introduced until 2001 , a year after joe was born .
under the old system the health visitor checked hearing at about 10 months , but many children 's problems were not picked up until the 18 month tests and some , like joe , not until much later .
within six months of getting the hearing aids he was coming on in leaps and bounds suzanne duffill by this time many of the children had language and speech problems and had fallen behind their peers at school .
now , as a result of the programme , hearing impairment and deafness is typically identified in children within four months of birth and the average time to hearing aid fitting is now under five months .
the nhs newborn screening programme is currently celebrating its two millionth screened child in england and more than 3,400 babies have now been identified as having permanent hearing impairment or deafness .
joe 's mum suzanne said she wished the screening , which is also available in the rest of the uk , had been available for her son .
" if we had this hearing test his problems would have probably been spotted .
i think these tests are such a good idea . "
suzanne , a student nurse from bridgend , wales , said they were not unduly worried about joe 's progress as a baby , despite a history of later-onset hearing loss in the males of the family .
" he was a lot quieter than his older sister , but we just put that down to all children developing differently . "
language delays he passed his hearing test at 10 months , but at the age of one was still struggling to speak .
and when he started school at the age of three-and-a-half he was still unable to speak properly .
" he was still doing baby babble so we were referred to the audiologist , " suzanne recalls .
his tests took a year to confirm the level of his hearing problems and tests revealed he also had glue ear - where the eustachian tubes at the back of the inner ear fill with fluid .
he needed grommets -lrb- small drains -rrb- fitted to release the pressure .
but by the time he was four-and-a-half joe had his hearing aids fitted and started to catch up with his classmates .
at first he needed extra support with reading , but now suzanne said joe has matched his peers .
parents are offered a newborn hearing test " before he got the hearing aids he was very isolated and did not mix .
" but within six months of getting the hearing aids he was coming on in leaps and bounds .
" i could really see him change .
he needed some speech therapy .
his speech is now really good .
" he is really confident .

the only thing joe has a problem with is hearing on the telephone , but his parents plan to get him a special one when he is older .
full diagnosis professor adrian davis , programme director of the nhs newborn hearing screening programme , who called the two millionth screening " one of the biggest achievements in children 's audiology over the last 40 years " , said the new test meant more children getting their hearing losses spotted and treated earlier .
" deafness and hearing impairment can have a major impact on a child 's communication skills and development .
" early identification , as a result of the programme , gives these babies better prospects of developing those essential skills .
it also gives more opportunity for babies to bond within the family and experience social and emotional interaction from an early age , " he said .
health minister ivan lewis said : " the programme has made a huge impact with babies being identified with a hearing loss on average one , if not sometimes , two years earlier than before , providing the potential to bring about an incredible change for these children and their families . "
angela king , audiologist for the rnid , said the new screening test meant most children have full diagnosis of hearing loss within a few months of birth .
" the screening is just that .
it points out whether there is a problem and whether further tests are needed . "
but she added that children and adults can develop hearing loss at any time , so it should be regularly monitored .

today he is outgoing and confident and his parents put the dramatic personality change down to his hearing aids , which he wears each day .
joe was born with a severe , but undiagnosed hearing loss .
about 840 babies , like joe , are born each year in england with hearing loss in both ears and 500 with a loss in one ear .
problems spotted sooner but a system gradually phased in to screen each child at birth was not introduced until 2001 , a year after joe was born .
under the old system the health visitor checked hearing at about 10 months , but many children 's problems were not picked up until the 18 month tests and some , like joe , not until much later .
within six months of getting the hearing aids he was coming on in leaps and bounds suzanne duffill by this time many of the children had language and speech problems and had fallen behind their peers at school .
now , as a result of the programme , hearing impairment and deafness is typically identified in children within four months of birth and the average time to hearing aid fitting is now under five months .
the nhs newborn screening programme is currently celebrating its two millionth screened child in england and more than 3,400 babies have now been identified as having permanent hearing impairment or deafness .
joe 's mum suzanne said she wished the screening , which is also available in the rest of the uk , had been available for her son .
" if we had this hearing test his problems would have probably been spotted .
i think these tests are such a good idea . "
suzanne , a student nurse from bridgend , wales , said they were not unduly worried about joe 's progress as a baby , despite a history of later-onset hearing loss in the males of the family .
" he was a lot quieter than his older sister , but we just put that down to all children developing differently . "
language delays he passed his hearing test at 10 months , but at the age of one was still struggling to speak .
and when he started school at the age of three-and-a-half he was still unable to speak properly .
" he was still doing baby babble so we were referred to the audiologist , " suzanne recalls .
his tests took a year to confirm the level of his hearing problems and tests revealed he also had glue ear - where the eustachian tubes at the back of the inner ear fill with fluid .
he needed grommets -lrb- small drains -rrb- fitted to release the pressure .
but by the time he was four-and-a-half joe had his hearing aids fitted and started to catch up with his classmates .
at first he needed extra support with reading , but now suzanne said joe has matched his peers .
parents are offered a newborn hearing test " before he got the hearing aids he was very isolated and did not mix .
" but within six months of getting the hearing aids he was coming on in leaps and bounds .
" i could really see him change .
he needed some speech therapy .
his speech is now really good .
" he is really confident .
he is the only one at the school with a hearing aid , but everyone is lovely and if he ca n't hear what someone has said he is now confident enough to ask them to repeat it . "

alcatel blamed reduced investment by us customers for lower sales .
shares in alcatel fell by more than 9 % on the news , the latest in a series of negative announcements from the firm .
the company was formed when alcatel took over us rival lucent in 2006 and analysts say this merger is still creating difficulties .
rough ride per lindberg , an analyst at dresdner bank. said the merger of alcatel and lucent had not dispelled underlying problems that both companies already faced .
" this is the merger of shared dilemmas .
neither alcatel nor lucent could compete on its own . "
mr lindberg said .
the company started 2007 with a warning that costs resulting from the merger would hit annual results .

madeline o 'brien , who plays the missing girl in gone baby gone , bears a close resemblance to madeleine mccann , who disappeared in portugal on 3 may .
we do n't want to release the movie if it is going to touch a nerve or inflame anybody 's sensitivities ben affleck buena vista and its subsidiary miramax said they were " sensitive to the depth of feeling surrounding the disappearance of madeleine mccann " .
" we have been closely following the case and have decided to delay the release of the film in the uk , " a statement said .
the organisers of next month 's london film festival have cancelled a gala screening of gone baby gone on 26 october , which was to have been attended by ben affleck .

' acutely aware ' gone baby gone was based on a 1998 novel by dennis lehane and was filmed last year , before madeleine 's disappearance , the film companies said .
ben affleck -lrb- left -rrb- directed the film , which stars his brother casey speaking at the recent deauville film festival in france , affleck said he had been made " acutely aware of the situation " regarding madeleine mccann .

" we do n't want to release the movie if it is going to touch a nerve or inflame anybody 's sensitivities . "
the film follows two boston private detectives who are called in to assist a police investigation into a missing child .

his comments come after the most recent data from the bank of england showed that borrowing by uk individuals now totals a record £ 1.35 trillion .
this figure includes everything from mortgages to other loans and credit cards .
as the uk 's debt mountain becomes ever more of a hot topic , below are some of your recent e-mails detailing your experiences of coping with life in the red .
i was in a lot of debt 10 years ago .
i was a single working parent who lost my job .
my creditors put me through the mill , i lost my car , house and family .
i am still paying the price now .
debt is not an easy option if you do not manage it well , or if you fall on hard times .
it is still very much a stigma .
i have never been able to get back on the housing ladder , despite the fact i am working hard and live within my means .
the credit system needs reforming before it collapses .
es , west yorkshire i 'm still paying off my debts .
i had citizens advice help some three years ago to get all the interest charges stopped and payment plans put in place .
but at my current rate , i 'll only be clear in some 15 years .
the alternative was bankruptcy , but i was n't too keen on that as it bars you from so many things and can make job-hunting far , far harder .
anonymous i 'm 28 , of course i 'm in debt , i do n't know a person my age who is n't .
we own our own home , and have been affected by rate rises to the tune of £ 120 a month .
we are getting married soon and would hope to start a family .
however we feel it will become increasingly difficult to afford children , let alone a comfortable family home .
we are working to clear loans , have no credit cards , and have 12 months on housing furniture credit .
our parents helped us out a lot , i pity those less fortunate !
dave , northumberland it 's too easy to get into debt .
i now have defaults with one particular lender that is n't interested in working out payment by instalments .
so i am having to contact the court before they do .
i have to buy the cheapest of clothes and eat the 12p beans to live , but you can only learn from mistakes .
chris , edinburgh at the age of 18 , i was flooded with offers from student bank accounts , overdrafts , credit cards and store cards .
being young , naive and overwhelmed with the opportunity of all this cash , i took up almost every offer that was thrown my way - much to my deepest regret .
i see now that i was extremely stupid , yet the way the interest-free overdrafts and " do n't pay anything for 12 months " was sold to me , it was hard to resist .
i finished university this year and i now have extreme amounts of debt .
i let my overdrafts get overdrawn , and the charges have amounted to thousands .
at the same time , my credit card charges have amounted to hundreds .
and these are just a small example of the problem i am in .
i am 22 and have been advised to declare bankruptcy .
devastated .
jessica , liverpool i am rather ashamed to admit this , but i was so desperate to get money to pay off all my other debts , i lied to get a loan .
when i received a letter from my bank saying i could apply for a £ 25,000 loan , i thought what the heck , i will give it a go .
i never thought they would say yes !
they asked me what my occupation was and how much i was making , to which i replied £ 23,000 a year - a lie .
i am angry now that they let me take out that loan because if they had checked my bank statements they would see that i was on income support , and that my bank account at that time was well overdrawn .
and i have been left to struggle to pay back £ 427 a month back !
i am still on benefits and i hardly have any money left at all .
susan , london in june , i was forced to sell my home as i simply could not afford bills , credit card repayments etc .
a loan was secured on my property which i had to clear upon completion , which left me with no equity .
i am now living in rented accommodation and am still struggling .
i have three credit cards which i simply can not afford to repay , nor can i afford the minimum payments .
each creditor does not seem to care about my circumstances , just about being repaid .
as i have been unable to repay any minimum payments , my credit rating has suffered and the chances of me obtaining a mortgage in the future are bleak .
it is a day to day struggle financially and i constantly worry about debt .
i have lost a home that i loved and am in debt , not a position i thought i would be in at 28 years old .
lisa butler , manchester i 'm only 21 years old and already in more than £ 10,000 worth of debt .
i even work for a bank !
i just kept increasing my loans and overdrafts thinking that i could pay it back in the future , but now it has got to the point that i ca n't afford to have a social life .
i 'm even on anti-depressants now to help me with the stress .
i am now having to go through a debt company .
they will charge me monthly admin fees , but my repayments will be less as it is being stretched over a longer period of time .
