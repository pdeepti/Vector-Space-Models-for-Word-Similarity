" girls out-perform boys at school and more women enter the labor market with a university degree than men , but a pay gap of 15 percent persists , " vladimir spidla , european commissioner for employment and social affairs said wednesday .
" this is an absurd situation and needs to change . " the czech commissioner said the " uneven division of duties in families " was partially responsible for the gap .
spidla was considering mandatory paternity leave as a way of promoting equality at home and the workplace , the associated press reported , citing anonymous commission sources . " it is not possible to reduce the gender pay gap if -lsb- men -rsb- do not help out more at home , " spindla said at a press conference , adding that eu statistics show men , regardless of whether employed full or part-time , do less work at home than women . germany among worst offenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german women earn an average of 22 percent less than male coworkers as a way of promoting paternity leave , germany instituted a new system in january that allows parents to take home 14 instead of 12 months worth of benefits if they both divide the time away from their workplaces .
the extra two months have earned the name " father months " as the most common division sees mothers taking 12 months of leave and father two . women in germany earn an average of 22 percent less than similarly qualified men , according to an eu study .
in the 27-member bloc only cyprus , estonia and slovakia have larger gender pay gaps than germany . " the fact that women in many fields of employment are still paid less than men for the same work is scandalous , " johannes singhammer , the christian social union 's spokesman for women 's issues , said in a statement . laws need to be applied he said germany already has sufficient laws to avoid such a gap , but that they " were obviously not being implemented as we would like . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it would n't kill men to do more work in the house as well plugging the pay gap should be an integral part of governments ' employment policies and that pressure must also be put on employers to ensure there is no discrimination against women , spidla said . " the pay gap is a complex issue with multiple causes , " he said .
" sometimes we see pure discrimination .
but often reasons are hidden .
women do more unpaid work , like taking care of the household and dependants . " different value for same work the commissioner also pointed out that women did more part-time work and said that women-dominated jobs and sectors were on a lower pay scale . a commission report , which showed the pay gap in europe had not decreased in over a decade , said a main cause of discrimination was that women 's competences were less valued then men 's . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite equally long training , nurses are often paid less than police as a result , jobs requiring similar qualifications or experience tended to be paid less when they were dominated by women than by men . " for example , in some countries nannies earn less than car mechanics , supermarket cashiers less than warehouse workers , nurses less than the police , " said the commission . seniority-based pay slammed the eu executive said that the pay gap also reflected inequalities in the labor market , especially the difficulties in reconciling work with private life . women with part-time jobs and those who took frequent career breaks because of children were less likely to hold managerial positions and encounter more obstacles and resistance as they proceed along their career paths , the commission report said . " as a consequence , women 's career paths are more often interrupted , slower and shorter , and hence less well paid than men 's , " it said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

britain expelled four russian diplomats on monday after russia refused to extradite andrei lugovoi , a suspect in the murder of kremlin critic and former kgb agent alexander litvinenko , who was poisoned with radioactive material in london last november .
shortly after the expulsion , british diplomats turned to the eu for support - and came up against a wall of indifference in most cases .
the british foreign office had looked towards the portuguese eu presidency for a statement of support on monday but by wednesday there had still not been an adequate response .
by wednesday evening , portuguese prime minister jose socrates had still not been able to extract enough support for the british stance from other eu leaders .
eventual eu statement lacks weight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis amado delivered the eu 's lukewarm response a statement eventually materialized thursday , but portuguese foreign minister luis amado 's assertion that the diplomatic row was " disappointing " and " a bilateral issue " between britain and russia hardly threw the bloc 's weight behind the brits .
the statement by the portuguese did however say the issue " raises important questions of common interest to eu member states , " adding that litvinenko 's murder was " a grave and reckless crime . "
surprisingly , given their level of animosity over issues both serious and trivial throughout history , the french were the most vocal when it came to supporting british prime minister gordon brown 's decision to throw the russians out .
" the murder of a british national on his home soil , using a substance that put at risk the lives of thousands of others is a particularly serious matter , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
" given the gravity of the matter , we stand alongside the united kingdom in its concern that justice be done .
" we call on moscow to respond to the demands of british justice in a constructive manner ... so that the perpetrators of this crime are brought to justice and punished , " he added .
russia promptly responded on thursday by expelling four british diplomats from moscow , in what alexander grushkov , russia 's deputy foreign minister , said was a " targeted and appropriate " response .
" britain appeals for eu solidarity , " grushkov said in his statement .
" we hope that common sense will prevail within the eu and that its members will not give in to attempts to turn relations between russia and the eu into a tool to achieve unilateral political goals .
these have nothing in common with eu and russia 's real partnership interests . "
germany says britain " overreacted " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown wanted merkel 's support ; he did n't get it germany was one of the many other eu nations which viewed the situation from a distance .
despite prime minister brown 's visit in person to berlin to press chancellor angela merkel for her support , germany remained firmly on the fence but did say that it thought britain had " overreacted " by expelling the four russian diplomats and freezing bilateral negotiations on visas .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will meet in berlin on friday to discuss the diplomatic row .
german foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said the meeting would involve " brief but intensive talks " .
steinmeier on wednesday had expressed his hope that the row would not be allowed to escalate into " a crisis . "
in terms of relations with russia , germany is the main player in the european union and therefore has the most to lose from coming down on the side of the brits .
russia considers germany to be its most important economic partner in the eu and the statistics on trade between the two nations confirms this view .
trade between the two countries increased by almost 40 percent in 2006 while german exports to russia went up by 35 percent .
germany and russia are also driving europe 's energy agenda and if the bloc is to secure its supply from the east , then relations between the two sides have to be good .
russia warns eu to stay out of row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia has a lot of leverage over the eu russia for its part has warned the eu to stay out of the row and vladimir chizhov , russia 's eu representative in brussels called the eu presidency 's lukewarm statement on wednesday " an unpleasant surprise for us . "
despite the lack of any real commitment on europe 's part , chizhov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency that the eu statement would " affect relations between the eu and russia . "
while disappointed by europe 's relatively non-committal stance in the row , british foreign minister david miliband is unlikely to give up trying to garner support .
he is expected to lobby his eu counterparts at the next eu foreign minister meeting in brussels on monday but observers believe that unless russia reacts again , and more strongly this time , the eu will continue to sit out the row on the sidelines . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

britain expelled four russian diplomats on monday after russia refused to extradite andrei lugovoi , a suspect in the murder of kremlin critic and former kgb agent alexander litvinenko , who was poisoned with radioactive material in london last november .
shortly after the expulsion , british diplomats turned to the eu for support - and came up against a wall of indifference in most cases .
the british foreign office had looked towards the portuguese eu presidency for a statement of support on monday but by wednesday there had still not been an adequate response .
by wednesday evening , portuguese prime minister jose socrates had still not been able to extract enough support for the british stance from other eu leaders .
eventual eu statement lacks weight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis amado delivered the eu 's lukewarm response a statement eventually materialized thursday , but portuguese foreign minister luis amado 's assertion that the diplomatic row was " disappointing " and " a bilateral issue " between britain and russia hardly threw the bloc 's weight behind the brits .
the statement by the portuguese did however say the issue " raises important questions of common interest to eu member states , " adding that litvinenko 's murder was " a grave and reckless crime . "
surprisingly , given their level of animosity over issues both serious and trivial throughout history , the french were the most vocal when it came to supporting british prime minister gordon brown 's decision to throw the russians out .
" the murder of a british national on his home soil , using a substance that put at risk the lives of thousands of others is a particularly serious matter , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
" given the gravity of the matter , we stand alongside the united kingdom in its concern that justice be done .
" we call on moscow to respond to the demands of british justice in a constructive manner ... so that the perpetrators of this crime are brought to justice and punished , " he added .
russia promptly responded on thursday by expelling four british diplomats from moscow , in what alexander grushkov , russia 's deputy foreign minister , said was a " targeted and appropriate " response .
" britain appeals for eu solidarity , " grushkov said in his statement .
" we hope that common sense will prevail within the eu and that its members will not give in to attempts to turn relations between russia and the eu into a tool to achieve unilateral political goals .
these have nothing in common with eu and russia 's real partnership interests . "
germany says britain " overreacted " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown wanted merkel 's support ; he did n't get it germany was one of the many other eu nations which viewed the situation from a distance .
despite prime minister brown 's visit in person to berlin to press chancellor angela merkel for her support , germany remained firmly on the fence but did say that it thought britain had " overreacted " by expelling the four russian diplomats and freezing bilateral negotiations on visas .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will meet in berlin on friday to discuss the diplomatic row .
german foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said the meeting would involve " brief but intensive talks " .
steinmeier on wednesday had expressed his hope that the row would not be allowed to escalate into " a crisis . "
in terms of relations with russia , germany is the main player in the european union and therefore has the most to lose from coming down on the side of the brits .
russia considers germany to be its most important economic partner in the eu and the statistics on trade between the two nations confirms this view .
trade between the two countries increased by almost 40 percent in 2006 while german exports to russia went up by 35 percent .
germany and russia are also driving europe 's energy agenda and if the bloc is to secure its supply from the east , then relations between the two sides have to be good .
russia warns eu to stay out of row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia has a lot of leverage over the eu russia for its part has warned the eu to stay out of the row and vladimir chizhov , russia 's eu representative in brussels called the eu presidency 's lukewarm statement on wednesday " an unpleasant surprise for us . "
despite the lack of any real commitment on europe 's part , chizhov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency that the eu statement would " affect relations between the eu and russia . "
while disappointed by europe 's relatively non-committal stance in the row , british foreign minister david miliband is unlikely to give up trying to garner support .
he is expected to lobby his eu counterparts at the next eu foreign minister meeting in brussels on monday but observers believe that unless russia reacts again , and more strongly this time , the eu will continue to sit out the row on the sidelines . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new agreement will provide the us department of homeland security -lrb- dhs -rrb- with 19 categories of data about european air travelers flying to the united states .
the dhs will be allowed to keep the information in its database for 15 years and share details with other law enforcement agencies under certain conditions .
the eu reached an " understanding " on elements of the deal late last month but certain " reservations " had to be reviewed by some of the bloc 's 27 member states who are obliged to pass the accord through their national parliaments .
the agreement will significantly lower the number of categories of data available to the dhs as stated in the previous agreement between the eu and us .

11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington , the eu and the us signed an agreement under which the eu agreed to grant us authorities access to up to 34 categories of information on passengers on all flights to the us taking off from eu member states .
these included names , addresses , phone numbers and credit card numbers of travelers .
that agreement , which was set to expire on july 31 , stirred unease among eu lawmakers amid concerns that civil liberties were being eroded in the fight against global terrorism .
the eu-wide concerns over data privacy led to the agreement being annulled by the european court of justice in luxembourg in may .
the eu and the us then reached an interim agreement as the eu warned that airlines would be vulnerable to privacy complaints if no replacement deal had been reached before the interim one expired .
the new deal will affect the tens of thousands of european passengers who fly to the us every day .
despite the reduction of categories , it 's likely to reignite the controversy over potential infringements of privacy . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" public funds are being more than just questioned , " said peter danckert , head of the german parliament 's sports committee .
" that applies to cycling in general and for other types of sports as well . " germany two largest publicly funded broadcasters , which have the german rights to live tour de france broadcasts , stopped their coverage of the event wednesday . in a joint statement ard and zdf said they would not be resuming their coverage of the tour " until clarification of the patrik sinkewitz case . "
about a million germans are estimated to have been following the competition live on tv . " it 's a warning to cycling and to every other sport , " zdf chief producer nikolaus brender said . does scandal extend beyond cycling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if doping is prevalent only in cycling meanwhile , the director of rundfunk berlin-brandenburg -lrb- rbb -rrb- said that there could be implications for other sports after the decision taken by the ard and zdf . " these decisions could also follow suit for other sports .
one can not really imagine that doping is restricted to cycling , " dagmar reim said . uwe schulz , manager of association of german cycle racing organizers , said cutting funds and stopping coverage of events where many innocent athletes also compete " is not an effective way to fight against doping in sports . " private sponsors waiting till end of tour to make decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile and its predecessor telekom have featured prominently in the doping scandal t-mobile , which sponsor 's the team most directly involved in the doping allegations , would be reconsidering its sport sponsoring program at the next supervisory board meeting , deputy board chairman ado wilhelm told thursday 's daily süddeutsche zeitung . t-mobile communications director christian frommert , however , said german broadcasters - and the public - should wait for results from sinkewitz 's second blood test before passing judgment on the team . " no one is served by making hasty conclusions , " he said , adding that meetings with the team 's riders , coaches and management would take place after the race 's conclusion . gerolsteiner , a german beverage company that sponsors another tour de france team , also said it would wait until august to decide whether to continue sponsoring cycling , chief spokesperson stefan göbel said . tour punished for investigating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrik sinkewitz has already returned to germany the tour de france 's parent company , amaury sports organization , said the german broadcasters were placing blame at the wrong people 's feet , according to company ceo patrice clerc . " the tour de france is being sanctioned , but should we sanction an event that is actually doing its best to weed out drugs cheats ? "
clerc told reporters .
" cheats are being found , and german tv is playing the ' empty chair ' policy .
if we do n't look for banned substances , we wo n't find them . " a lot of sports do n't look for anything .
we 've decided to take another attitude , we 're fighting against doping - and we 're being sanctioned because cheats are being found !
maybe german tv expects us not to track them down . " the high cost of doping former head of germany 's cycling federation sylvia schenk , however , said broadcasters were right to interrupt their coverage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : less money could make athletes think twice before doping , schenk said " doping costs a lot of money , " she said in an interview with rbb on thursday .
" it 's money that sponsors and broadcasters bring to the sport .
obviously you have to take the money out to make people think and to take away the financial possibility to dope . " sinkewitz has denied accusations of using testosterone or other doping agents to enhance his performance .
he has been suspended pending the results of a second blood test and is already back in germany after dropping out of the tour sunday due to a collision with a spectator , if sinkewitz 's second blood sample also comes back positive , t-mobile team boss bob stapleton said he would fire the rider immediately .
the team dismissed jan ullrich shortly before the 2006 tour de france for his alleged involvement in a doping scandal , and other riders for t-mobile , including 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis and erik zabel , have admitted to doping . " our stance is that we encourage targeted testing , out of competition testing .
it 's consistent with our view that if you do n't do the right thing you get caught and suffer the consequences , " added stapleton .

the new agreement will provide the us department of homeland security -lrb- dhs -rrb- with 19 categories of data about european air travelers flying to the united states .
the dhs will be allowed to keep the information in its database for 15 years and share details with other law enforcement agencies under certain conditions .
the eu reached an " understanding " on elements of the deal late last month but certain " reservations " had to be reviewed by some of the bloc 's 27 member states who are obliged to pass the accord through their national parliaments .
the agreement will significantly lower the number of categories of data available to the dhs as stated in the previous agreement between the eu and us .

11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington , the eu and the us signed an agreement under which the eu agreed to grant us authorities access to up to 34 categories of information on passengers on all flights to the us taking off from eu member states .
these included names , addresses , phone numbers and credit card numbers of travelers .
that agreement , which was set to expire on july 31 , stirred unease among eu lawmakers amid concerns that civil liberties were being eroded in the fight against global terrorism .
the eu-wide concerns over data privacy led to the agreement being annulled by the european court of justice in luxembourg in may .
the eu and the us then reached an interim agreement as the eu warned that airlines would be vulnerable to privacy complaints if no replacement deal had been reached before the interim one expired .

polls predict a new victory of the governing ak party , but the parliament 's composition is the issue that 's really suspenseful : will it still be made up of two factions that get beyond the 10-percent hurdle or will the nationalistic mhp also manage to get in ?
i think that 's the real question and i 'm somewhat worried when it comes to the latter party . premier erdogan has said that he will bid farewell to politics if he does n't win the election .
what do you think about this statement ? it 's a sign of great confidence , because erdogan wants to do everything except bid farewell to politics .
he 's certain that he 'll remain , because he counts on winning the election . as the chairman of the foreign affairs committee in parliament , you 're dealing with turkey a lot and you 're an expert on turkey .
does turkey still have a chance to move towards europe , especially considering that the reforms have virtually come to a standstill ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan wants to bring his country into the eu i think that also depends a bit on the internal difficulties during the pre-election campaign .
i hope that turkish voters will bring about a straightforward situation in parliament .
turkey definitely needs a government that 's capable of acting and is backed by a large majority in parliament .
it 's written nowhere that the reform process can not continue .
people just have to want it .
i 'm convinced that erdogan wants to continue on the way to europe .
he has to overcome resistance .
opinion polls in turkey have become skeptical .
maybe there 's also more skepticism in his own party that he has to deal with , but i think that he 's right to connect the economic upswing turkey has experienced under his government with the route to europe .
it 's certainly the right conclusion to draw . germany and several other states have concerns when it comes to full eu membership for turkey .
do you think that turkey could be convinced to accept a privileged partnership after all ? i do n't think that 's a question that needs to be answered today or tomorrow .
the eu has made a clear decision to initiate accession negotiations .
it was noted , however , that the outcome can not be predicted .
the negotiations are happening with an open end , but with the goal of membership .
it 's clear that full membership requires turkey to fulfill all criteria not only on paper but also in practice .
we know that there 's still a long way to go in some respects .
on the other hand , we 've seen in the case of the cyprus question that turkey struggles with this .
you can not join a club if you do n't recognize a club member .
these are questions that turkey needs to face in the coming years .
but they can be solved in principle . baha güngör , the head of dw-radio 's turkish service , interviewed ruprecht polenz -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" public funds are being more than just questioned , " said peter danckert , head of the german parliament 's sports committee .
" that applies to cycling in general and for other types of sports as well . " germany two largest publicly funded broadcasters , which have the german rights to live tour de france broadcasts , stopped their coverage of the event wednesday . in a joint statement ard and zdf said they would not be resuming their coverage of the tour " until clarification of the patrik sinkewitz case . "
about a million germans are estimated to have been following the competition live on tv . " it 's a warning to cycling and to every other sport , " zdf chief producer nikolaus brender said . does scandal extend beyond cycling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if doping is prevalent only in cycling meanwhile , the director of rundfunk berlin-brandenburg -lrb- rbb -rrb- said that there could be implications for other sports after the decision taken by the ard and zdf . " these decisions could also follow suit for other sports .
one can not really imagine that doping is restricted to cycling , " dagmar reim said . uwe schulz , manager of association of german cycle racing organizers , said cutting funds and stopping coverage of events where many innocent athletes also compete " is not an effective way to fight against doping in sports . " private sponsors waiting till end of tour to make decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile and its predecessor telekom have featured prominently in the doping scandal t-mobile , which sponsor 's the team most directly involved in the doping allegations , would be reconsidering its sport sponsoring program at the next supervisory board meeting , deputy board chairman ado wilhelm told thursday 's daily süddeutsche zeitung . t-mobile communications director christian frommert , however , said german broadcasters - and the public - should wait for results from sinkewitz 's second blood test before passing judgment on the team . " no one is served by making hasty conclusions , " he said , adding that meetings with the team 's riders , coaches and management would take place after the race 's conclusion . gerolsteiner , a german beverage company that sponsors another tour de france team , also said it would wait until august to decide whether to continue sponsoring cycling , chief spokesperson stefan göbel said . tour punished for investigating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrik sinkewitz has already returned to germany the tour de france 's parent company , amaury sports organization , said the german broadcasters were placing blame at the wrong people 's feet , according to company ceo patrice clerc . " the tour de france is being sanctioned , but should we sanction an event that is actually doing its best to weed out drugs cheats ? "
clerc told reporters .
" cheats are being found , and german tv is playing the ' empty chair ' policy .
if we do n't look for banned substances , we wo n't find them . " a lot of sports do n't look for anything .
we 've decided to take another attitude , we 're fighting against doping - and we 're being sanctioned because cheats are being found !
maybe german tv expects us not to track them down . " the high cost of doping former head of germany 's cycling federation sylvia schenk , however , said broadcasters were right to interrupt their coverage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : less money could make athletes think twice before doping , schenk said " doping costs a lot of money , " she said in an interview with rbb on thursday .
" it 's money that sponsors and broadcasters bring to the sport .
obviously you have to take the money out to make people think and to take away the financial possibility to dope . " sinkewitz has denied accusations of using testosterone or other doping agents to enhance his performance .
he has been suspended pending the results of a second blood test and is already back in germany after dropping out of the tour sunday due to a collision with a spectator , if sinkewitz 's second blood sample also comes back positive , t-mobile team boss bob stapleton said he would fire the rider immediately .
the team dismissed jan ullrich shortly before the 2006 tour de france for his alleged involvement in a doping scandal , and other riders for t-mobile , including 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis and erik zabel , have admitted to doping . " our stance is that we encourage targeted testing , out of competition testing .
it 's consistent with our view that if you do n't do the right thing you get caught and suffer the consequences , " added stapleton .

" girls out-perform boys at school and more women enter the labor market with a university degree than men , but a pay gap of 15 percent persists , " vladimir spidla , european commissioner for employment and social affairs said wednesday .
" this is an absurd situation and needs to change . " the czech commissioner said the " uneven division of duties in families " was partially responsible for the gap .
spidla was considering mandatory paternity leave as a way of promoting equality at home and the workplace , the associated press reported , citing anonymous commission sources . " it is not possible to reduce the gender pay gap if -lsb- men -rsb- do not help out more at home , " spindla said at a press conference , adding that eu statistics show men , regardless of whether employed full or part-time , do less work at home than women . germany among worst offenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german women earn an average of 22 percent less than male coworkers as a way of promoting paternity leave , germany instituted a new system in january that allows parents to take home 14 instead of 12 months worth of benefits if they both divide the time away from their workplaces .
the extra two months have earned the name " father months " as the most common division sees mothers taking 12 months of leave and father two . women in germany earn an average of 22 percent less than similarly qualified men , according to an eu study .
in the 27-member bloc only cyprus , estonia and slovakia have larger gender pay gaps than germany . " the fact that women in many fields of employment are still paid less than men for the same work is scandalous , " johannes singhammer , the christian social union 's spokesman for women 's issues , said in a statement . laws need to be applied he said germany already has sufficient laws to avoid such a gap , but that they " were obviously not being implemented as we would like . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it would n't kill men to do more work in the house as well plugging the pay gap should be an integral part of governments ' employment policies and that pressure must also be put on employers to ensure there is no discrimination against women , spidla said . " the pay gap is a complex issue with multiple causes , " he said .
" sometimes we see pure discrimination .
but often reasons are hidden .
women do more unpaid work , like taking care of the household and dependants . " different value for same work the commissioner also pointed out that women did more part-time work and said that women-dominated jobs and sectors were on a lower pay scale . a commission report , which showed the pay gap in europe had not decreased in over a decade , said a main cause of discrimination was that women 's competences were less valued then men 's . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite equally long training , nurses are often paid less than police as a result , jobs requiring similar qualifications or experience tended to be paid less when they were dominated by women than by men . " for example , in some countries nannies earn less than car mechanics , supermarket cashiers less than warehouse workers , nurses less than the police , " said the commission . seniority-based pay slammed the eu executive said that the pay gap also reflected inequalities in the labor market , especially the difficulties in reconciling work with private life . women with part-time jobs and those who took frequent career breaks because of children were less likely to hold managerial positions and encounter more obstacles and resistance as they proceed along their career paths , the commission report said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 19.07.2007 eu wary of being dragged into britain-russia diplomatic row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is reluctant to take sides in the dispute between britain and russia despite a statement saying it was " disappointed " by russian failure to cooperate with the uk , the european union is staying firmly on the sidelines in the escalating diplomatic row between london and moscow . as relations between britain and russia reach the lowest point since the cold war , the european union stands to one side , unwilling to get involved in what could turn out to be one of the most serious diplomatic spats between east and west in over a decade .
britain expelled four russian diplomats on monday after russia refused to extradite andrei lugovoi , a suspect in the murder of kremlin critic and former kgb agent alexander litvinenko , who was poisoned with radioactive material in london last november .
shortly after the expulsion , british diplomats turned to the eu for support - and came up against a wall of indifference in most cases .
the british foreign office had looked towards the portuguese eu presidency for a statement of support on monday but by wednesday there had still not been an adequate response .
by wednesday evening , portuguese prime minister jose socrates had still not been able to extract enough support for the british stance from other eu leaders .
eventual eu statement lacks weight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis amado delivered the eu 's lukewarm response a statement eventually materialized thursday , but portuguese foreign minister luis amado 's assertion that the diplomatic row was " disappointing " and " a bilateral issue " between britain and russia hardly threw the bloc 's weight behind the brits .
the statement by the portuguese did however say the issue " raises important questions of common interest to eu member states , " adding that litvinenko 's murder was " a grave and reckless crime . "
surprisingly , given their level of animosity over issues both serious and trivial throughout history , the french were the most vocal when it came to supporting british prime minister gordon brown 's decision to throw the russians out .
" the murder of a british national on his home soil , using a substance that put at risk the lives of thousands of others is a particularly serious matter , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
" given the gravity of the matter , we stand alongside the united kingdom in its concern that justice be done .
" we call on moscow to respond to the demands of british justice in a constructive manner ... so that the perpetrators of this crime are brought to justice and punished , " he added .
russia promptly responded on thursday by expelling four british diplomats from moscow , in what alexander grushkov , russia 's deputy foreign minister , said was a " targeted and appropriate " response .
" britain appeals for eu solidarity , " grushkov said in his statement .
" we hope that common sense will prevail within the eu and that its members will not give in to attempts to turn relations between russia and the eu into a tool to achieve unilateral political goals .
these have nothing in common with eu and russia 's real partnership interests . "
germany says britain " overreacted " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown wanted merkel 's support ; he did n't get it germany was one of the many other eu nations which viewed the situation from a distance .
despite prime minister brown 's visit in person to berlin to press chancellor angela merkel for her support , germany remained firmly on the fence but did say that it thought britain had " overreacted " by expelling the four russian diplomats and freezing bilateral negotiations on visas .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will meet in berlin on friday to discuss the diplomatic row .
german foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said the meeting would involve " brief but intensive talks " .
steinmeier on wednesday had expressed his hope that the row would not be allowed to escalate into " a crisis . "
in terms of relations with russia , germany is the main player in the european union and therefore has the most to lose from coming down on the side of the brits .
russia considers germany to be its most important economic partner in the eu and the statistics on trade between the two nations confirms this view .
trade between the two countries increased by almost 40 percent in 2006 while german exports to russia went up by 35 percent .
germany and russia are also driving europe 's energy agenda and if the bloc is to secure its supply from the east , then relations between the two sides have to be good .
russia warns eu to stay out of row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia has a lot of leverage over the eu russia for its part has warned the eu to stay out of the row and vladimir chizhov , russia 's eu representative in brussels called the eu presidency 's lukewarm statement on wednesday " an unpleasant surprise for us . "
despite the lack of any real commitment on europe 's part , chizhov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency that the eu statement would " affect relations between the eu and russia . "
while disappointed by europe 's relatively non-committal stance in the row , british foreign minister david miliband is unlikely to give up trying to garner support .
he is expected to lobby his eu counterparts at the next eu foreign minister meeting in brussels on monday but observers believe that unless russia reacts again , and more strongly this time , the eu will continue to sit out the row on the sidelines . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now it offers visitors a chance to venture into the middle ages .
when you go , be sure to look for the stone face pictured below . " location , location , location " is nothing new - and the 12th century builders of eltz castle picked a good one . perched high up on a rock crag within a green valley , eltz castle is surrounded not only by hills on all sides , but the eltzbach river makes a hairpin turn just around the mansion 's rocky nest , encompassing it on three sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castle is well located and was never destroyed this triple protection is one of the reasons the mansion was never destroyed . it also makes it a challenge for visitors to get there today .
it 's best to come by car and be prepared for a steep but short walk to the castle grounds . the eltz family was n't only thinking about safety , they also had money in mind when constructing their residence over 800 years ago .
the castle is situated between the moselle river , one of the most important trade routes in the german empire , and the fertile eifel and maifeld regions . royal condo construction on the castle stretched over 500 years and many generations , which explains the spectrum of romanesque to early baroque styles that can be found there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tours begin in the inner courtyard after the eltz family split into separate clans in 1268 in order to avoid an inheritance feud , the residence was inhabited by several family lines simultaneously - like a kind of giant medieval condominium .
since each group was responsible for its own section of the home , several residential towers in slightly different styles were built , snugly packed in along the small central courtyard . bratwurst , moose and armor visitors to the castle are free to wander the grounds , enjoy the view of the river and meadow below and enjoy a bratwurst or a piece of cake at one of the two reasonably priced food counters . for many , it 's enough just to take in the scenery , but those who choose to go on a tour will only pay a few euros to catch a glimpse of shining medieval armor , filigree frescos , an original kitchen from the middle ages , paintings by lucas cranach , the elder - and even a 20th century alaskan moose trophy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 150 people lived in the castle knights hall and a gothic living room one highlight of the tour is the knights hall , one of the largest rooms in the castle .
a 17th century french tapestry and a 60-pound suit of armor await visitors in what used to by the meeting room . lucas cranach , the elder 's " madonna with child and grapes " can be seen in the rübenach hall .
used as a living room , the hall also boasts a high-tech gothic fireplace , which was capable of heating two rooms at once , even long after the fire had gone out . english tours available for an extra fee , visitors can continue their tour into the treasure vault , which contains over 500 objects from eight centuries .
gold and silver pieces , valuable crossbows , the prince elector 's ring , and 18th century porcelain from vienna are among the items on display , all of which belonged to the eltz family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can you find this face ?

now it offers visitors a chance to venture into the middle ages .
when you go , be sure to look for the stone face pictured below . " location , location , location " is nothing new - and the 12th century builders of eltz castle picked a good one . perched high up on a rock crag within a green valley , eltz castle is surrounded not only by hills on all sides , but the eltzbach river makes a hairpin turn just around the mansion 's rocky nest , encompassing it on three sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castle is well located and was never destroyed this triple protection is one of the reasons the mansion was never destroyed . it also makes it a challenge for visitors to get there today .
it 's best to come by car and be prepared for a steep but short walk to the castle grounds . the eltz family was n't only thinking about safety , they also had money in mind when constructing their residence over 800 years ago .
the castle is situated between the moselle river , one of the most important trade routes in the german empire , and the fertile eifel and maifeld regions . royal condo construction on the castle stretched over 500 years and many generations , which explains the spectrum of romanesque to early baroque styles that can be found there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tours begin in the inner courtyard after the eltz family split into separate clans in 1268 in order to avoid an inheritance feud , the residence was inhabited by several family lines simultaneously - like a kind of giant medieval condominium .
since each group was responsible for its own section of the home , several residential towers in slightly different styles were built , snugly packed in along the small central courtyard . bratwurst , moose and armor visitors to the castle are free to wander the grounds , enjoy the view of the river and meadow below and enjoy a bratwurst or a piece of cake at one of the two reasonably priced food counters . for many , it 's enough just to take in the scenery , but those who choose to go on a tour will only pay a few euros to catch a glimpse of shining medieval armor , filigree frescos , an original kitchen from the middle ages , paintings by lucas cranach , the elder - and even a 20th century alaskan moose trophy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 150 people lived in the castle knights hall and a gothic living room one highlight of the tour is the knights hall , one of the largest rooms in the castle .
a 17th century french tapestry and a 60-pound suit of armor await visitors in what used to by the meeting room . lucas cranach , the elder 's " madonna with child and grapes " can be seen in the rübenach hall .
used as a living room , the hall also boasts a high-tech gothic fireplace , which was capable of heating two rooms at once , even long after the fire had gone out . english tours available for an extra fee , visitors can continue their tour into the treasure vault , which contains over 500 objects from eight centuries .
gold and silver pieces , valuable crossbows , the prince elector 's ring , and 18th century porcelain from vienna are among the items on display , all of which belonged to the eltz family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can you find this face ?
tours begin every 10 to 15 minutes and last about 40 minutes .
they cost six euros for adults and combined tours including the treasure vault are available for eight euros .
group tours and tours in english , french and dutch can be arranged .

it ended with a scandal , sackings and a criminal investigation into an illegal meat operation . some zoos are n't as lucky as the one in berlin .
most do n't have superstar polar bear cubs and the potential to exploit cuteness through marketing deals and promotions which would make even david beckham seem like a media-shy hermit with no business sense .
there are no tie-ins , no plush toys flying off the shelves , no hordes of expectant children and insatiable paparazzi stampeding through the turnstiles .
for those zoos lacking star-quality , life is bleak .
the future is under-funded and the staff and animals suffer accordingly .
however , some animals - like those at erfurt zoo - suffer more than others .
for these poor creatures , their suffering was not caused by a reduction of enclosure space due to a budget cut or an enforced diet due to spiraling feed costs .
no , it came courtesy of those unscrupulous members of staff who , instead of looking after the beasts , were killing them and shipping their carcasses out the back door as meat .
while other establishments were relying on merchandise to boost income , the evil workers at erfurt were lining their own pockets with a grisly sideline in exotic animal flesh .
bambi steaks could be tip of meat iceberg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more buck for your buck : deer meat proved very popular apparently , the staff responsible had been turning petting zoo deer into venison as part of a clandestine business for a number of years .
now it is feared that bambi steaks will turn out to be just one specialty on the macabre menu .
" we are worried this is only the tip of the iceberg , " said wolfgang apel , president of the german animal protection league , who also called for a thorough review of controls at the zoo and at all other institutions with animals in the eastern state of thuringia .
the secret meat trade was revealed after an anonymous zoo employee noticed that the number of animals was declining .
" it was high time something was done about it , " the whistleblower said , as quoted in a report in die zeit newspaper .
after hearing of the scandal , erfurt 's mayor filed charges against workers at the zoo and fired the zoo 's director .
" the case is now being handled by state prosecutors , " said a spokeswoman for the mayor 's office in a statement to the press , declining to give further details . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

polls predict a new victory of the governing ak party , but the parliament 's composition is the issue that 's really suspenseful : will it still be made up of two factions that get beyond the 10-percent hurdle or will the nationalistic mhp also manage to get in ?
i think that 's the real question and i 'm somewhat worried when it comes to the latter party . premier erdogan has said that he will bid farewell to politics if he does n't win the election .
what do you think about this statement ? it 's a sign of great confidence , because erdogan wants to do everything except bid farewell to politics .
he 's certain that he 'll remain , because he counts on winning the election . as the chairman of the foreign affairs committee in parliament , you 're dealing with turkey a lot and you 're an expert on turkey .
does turkey still have a chance to move towards europe , especially considering that the reforms have virtually come to a standstill ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan wants to bring his country into the eu i think that also depends a bit on the internal difficulties during the pre-election campaign .
i hope that turkish voters will bring about a straightforward situation in parliament .
turkey definitely needs a government that 's capable of acting and is backed by a large majority in parliament .
it 's written nowhere that the reform process can not continue .
people just have to want it .
i 'm convinced that erdogan wants to continue on the way to europe .
he has to overcome resistance .
opinion polls in turkey have become skeptical .
maybe there 's also more skepticism in his own party that he has to deal with , but i think that he 's right to connect the economic upswing turkey has experienced under his government with the route to europe .
it 's certainly the right conclusion to draw . germany and several other states have concerns when it comes to full eu membership for turkey .
do you think that turkey could be convinced to accept a privileged partnership after all ? i do n't think that 's a question that needs to be answered today or tomorrow .
the eu has made a clear decision to initiate accession negotiations .
it was noted , however , that the outcome can not be predicted .
the negotiations are happening with an open end , but with the goal of membership .
it 's clear that full membership requires turkey to fulfill all criteria not only on paper but also in practice .
we know that there 's still a long way to go in some respects .
on the other hand , we 've seen in the case of the cyprus question that turkey struggles with this .
you can not join a club if you do n't recognize a club member .
these are questions that turkey needs to face in the coming years .
but they can be solved in principle . baha güngör , the head of dw-radio 's turkish service , interviewed ruprecht polenz -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

british ambassador to russia tony brenton said he was summoned to the russian foreign ministry and given " certain messages " to deliver to london .

russia 's eu envoy vladimir chizhov told interfax that while british investigators were quickly given permission to travel to russia as part of their probe , russian authorities were prevented from entering britain for some time . mikhail kamynin said earlier that diplomatic sanctions announced by britain earlier this week would have " the most serious consequences " for relations between moscow and london . " the position towards russia taken by the new labour government of great britain is based on anything but common sense or pragmatism and respect of law , which is so typical of real britons , " kamynin added on thursday .
russia was also going to stop issuing visas to british officials , kamynin said , adding that shared security and terrorism efforts would also be affected .
" to our regret , cooperation between russia and britain on issues of fighting terrorism becomes impossible , " he said , describing russia 's response as " targeted , balanced and the minimum necessary .

merkel 's coalition made up of the christian democrats and social democrats took office in november 2005 . the chancellor said the government was " looking at mechanisms ... both on a european and german level " to deal with the influence of the funds . " we have started a discussion that is still ongoing , " she said . politicians in germany have expressed fears in recent months that newly rich state corporate behemoths in russia and china could take over key industrial sectors in europe 's biggest economy . possible political power merkel added that it was possible that such investments could be used not just to attain high returns on capital but also as a lever to gain political influence . " we mus n't be naive , " she said .
" state-owned funds can also have politico-strategic aims in mind that could be problematic in sensitive areas .

" a general ban is with certainty not the right answer , " said merkel , who warned two weeks ago that major german companies could possibly fall into the hands of hostile states through investments by foreign government-operated funds . easy prey for takeovers german finance minister peer steinbrück recently commented in similar fashion , saying that berlin was considering ways of protecting domestic companies in key industries such as telecommunications , banking , postal services , logistics and energy from foreign investors . the growing power of investment funds has caused concern in germany because the relatively low market valuation of significant companies makes them relatively easy prey for takeovers . the funds are estimated to have more than 800 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.1 trillion -rrb- at their disposal .
this estimation does not include the substantial foreign currency reserves of middle eastern and east asian countries . china , for instance , has foreign currency reserves of about $ 1.2 trillion dollars , some of which has been earmarked to buy western companies . however , last month , bert rürup , a top economic adviser to the german government said he opposed introducing new forms of protectionism to stop foreign countries wielding excessive influence over domestic companies .

the new agreement will provide the us department of homeland security -lrb- dhs -rrb- with 19 categories of data about european air travelers flying to the united states .
the dhs will be allowed to keep the information in its database for 15 years and share details with other law enforcement agencies under certain conditions .
the eu reached an " understanding " on elements of the deal late last month but certain " reservations " had to be reviewed by some of the bloc 's 27 member states who are obliged to pass the accord through their national parliaments .
the agreement will significantly lower the number of categories of data available to the dhs as stated in the previous agreement between the eu and us .
post-9/11 deal saw 34 categories shared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions to 9/11 included stricter controls on data following the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington , the eu and the us signed an agreement under which the eu agreed to grant us authorities access to up to 34 categories of information on passengers on all flights to the us taking off from eu member states .
these included names , addresses , phone numbers and credit card numbers of travelers .
that agreement , which was set to expire on july 31 , stirred unease among eu lawmakers amid concerns that civil liberties were being eroded in the fight against global terrorism .
the eu-wide concerns over data privacy led to the agreement being annulled by the european court of justice in luxembourg in may .
the eu and the us then reached an interim agreement as the eu warned that airlines would be vulnerable to privacy complaints if no replacement deal had been reached before the interim one expired .
the new deal will affect the tens of thousands of european passengers who fly to the us every day .
despite the reduction of categories , it 's likely to reignite the controversy over potential infringements of privacy . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes after the uk expelled four russians monday . russian foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin on thursday said four british embassy staff in moscow are now persona non grata and they should leave the territory of the russian federation within 10 days . he did not identify the diplomats .
british ambassador to russia tony brenton said he was summoned to the russian foreign ministry and given " certain messages " to deliver to london .
" i met with deputy minister -lsb- alexander -rsb- grushko , and we of course discussed the litvinenko case , " the interfax news agency reported brenton as saying .
" he gave me several notices for me to pass on to london . "
brenton would not comment on the messages ' contents , the russian agency reported .
britain has been waiting for the " appropriate response " russia promised to deliver after four russian diplomats were expelled on monday .
the diplomatic clash began last week when russia refused to extradite andrei lugovoi , a suspect in the murder of kremlin critic and former kgb agent alexander litvinenko .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kamynin said russia 's move was the minimum necessary according to the british public prosecutor , ex-kgb officer lugovoi is said to have killed litvinenko by poisoning him with radioactive polonium-210 in november 2006 .
lugovoi has denied involvement in the case .
russia , however , rejected european union assertions that moscow had not cooperated with british authorities in the litvinenko case .
russia 's eu envoy vladimir chizhov told interfax that while british investigators were quickly given permission to travel to russia as part of their probe , russian authorities were prevented from entering britain for some time . mikhail kamynin said earlier that diplomatic sanctions announced by britain earlier this week would have " the most serious consequences " for relations between moscow and london . " the position towards russia taken by the new labour government of great britain is based on anything but common sense or pragmatism and respect of law , which is so typical of real britons , " kamynin added on thursday .
russia was also going to stop issuing visas to british officials , kamynin said , adding that shared security and terrorism efforts would also be affected .
" to our regret , cooperation between russia and britain on issues of fighting terrorism becomes impossible , " he said , describing russia 's response as " targeted , balanced and the minimum necessary . " the british foreign office had earlier said that no retaliation by russia would be justified , and officials from both countries , however , said on tuesday that the current row , which the russian pressed has termed a " diplomatic war " would not affect economic ties . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" girls out-perform boys at school and more women enter the labor market with a university degree than men , but a pay gap of 15 percent persists , " vladimir spidla , european commissioner for employment and social affairs said wednesday .
" this is an absurd situation and needs to change . " the czech commissioner said the " uneven division of duties in families " was partially responsible for the gap .
spidla was considering mandatory paternity leave as a way of promoting equality at home and the workplace , the associated press reported , citing anonymous commission sources . " it is not possible to reduce the gender pay gap if -lsb- men -rsb- do not help out more at home , " spindla said at a press conference , adding that eu statistics show men , regardless of whether employed full or part-time , do less work at home than women . germany among worst offenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german women earn an average of 22 percent less than male coworkers as a way of promoting paternity leave , germany instituted a new system in january that allows parents to take home 14 instead of 12 months worth of benefits if they both divide the time away from their workplaces .
the extra two months have earned the name " father months " as the most common division sees mothers taking 12 months of leave and father two . women in germany earn an average of 22 percent less than similarly qualified men , according to an eu study .
in the 27-member bloc only cyprus , estonia and slovakia have larger gender pay gaps than germany . " the fact that women in many fields of employment are still paid less than men for the same work is scandalous , " johannes singhammer , the christian social union 's spokesman for women 's issues , said in a statement . laws need to be applied he said germany already has sufficient laws to avoid such a gap , but that they " were obviously not being implemented as we would like . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it would n't kill men to do more work in the house as well plugging the pay gap should be an integral part of governments ' employment policies and that pressure must also be put on employers to ensure there is no discrimination against women , spidla said . " the pay gap is a complex issue with multiple causes , " he said .
" sometimes we see pure discrimination .
but often reasons are hidden .
women do more unpaid work , like taking care of the household and dependants . " different value for same work the commissioner also pointed out that women did more part-time work and said that women-dominated jobs and sectors were on a lower pay scale . a commission report , which showed the pay gap in europe had not decreased in over a decade , said a main cause of discrimination was that women 's competences were less valued then men 's . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite equally long training , nurses are often paid less than police as a result , jobs requiring similar qualifications or experience tended to be paid less when they were dominated by women than by men . " for example , in some countries nannies earn less than car mechanics , supermarket cashiers less than warehouse workers , nurses less than the police , " said the commission . seniority-based pay slammed the eu executive said that the pay gap also reflected inequalities in the labor market , especially the difficulties in reconciling work with private life . women with part-time jobs and those who took frequent career breaks because of children were less likely to hold managerial positions and encounter more obstacles and resistance as they proceed along their career paths , the commission report said . " as a consequence , women 's career paths are more often interrupted , slower and shorter , and hence less well paid than men 's , " it said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 19.07.2007 russia expels four british diplomats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an on-going row escalated as russia said it would no longer issue visas to british officials in a tit-for-tat action reminiscent of cold war politics , moscow told four british diplomats on thursday that they are no longer welcome to stay in russia .
the move comes after the uk expelled four russians monday . russian foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin on thursday said four british embassy staff in moscow are now persona non grata and they should leave the territory of the russian federation within 10 days . he did not identify the diplomats .
british ambassador to russia tony brenton said he was summoned to the russian foreign ministry and given " certain messages " to deliver to london .
" i met with deputy minister -lsb- alexander -rsb- grushko , and we of course discussed the litvinenko case , " the interfax news agency reported brenton as saying .
" he gave me several notices for me to pass on to london . "
brenton would not comment on the messages ' contents , the russian agency reported .
britain has been waiting for the " appropriate response " russia promised to deliver after four russian diplomats were expelled on monday .
the diplomatic clash began last week when russia refused to extradite andrei lugovoi , a suspect in the murder of kremlin critic and former kgb agent alexander litvinenko .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kamynin said russia 's move was the minimum necessary according to the british public prosecutor , ex-kgb officer lugovoi is said to have killed litvinenko by poisoning him with radioactive polonium-210 in november 2006 .
lugovoi has denied involvement in the case .
russia , however , rejected european union assertions that moscow had not cooperated with british authorities in the litvinenko case .
russia 's eu envoy vladimir chizhov told interfax that while british investigators were quickly given permission to travel to russia as part of their probe , russian authorities were prevented from entering britain for some time . mikhail kamynin said earlier that diplomatic sanctions announced by britain earlier this week would have " the most serious consequences " for relations between moscow and london . " the position towards russia taken by the new labour government of great britain is based on anything but common sense or pragmatism and respect of law , which is so typical of real britons , " kamynin added on thursday .
russia was also going to stop issuing visas to british officials , kamynin said , adding that shared security and terrorism efforts would also be affected .
" to our regret , cooperation between russia and britain on issues of fighting terrorism becomes impossible , " he said , describing russia 's response as " targeted , balanced and the minimum necessary . " the british foreign office had earlier said that no retaliation by russia would be justified , and officials from both countries , however , said on tuesday that the current row , which the russian pressed has termed a " diplomatic war " would not affect economic ties . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new agreement will provide the us department of homeland security -lrb- dhs -rrb- with 19 categories of data about european air travelers flying to the united states .
the dhs will be allowed to keep the information in its database for 15 years and share details with other law enforcement agencies under certain conditions .
the eu reached an " understanding " on elements of the deal late last month but certain " reservations " had to be reviewed by some of the bloc 's 27 member states who are obliged to pass the accord through their national parliaments .

that agreement , which was set to expire on july 31 , stirred unease among eu lawmakers amid concerns that civil liberties were being eroded in the fight against global terrorism .
the eu-wide concerns over data privacy led to the agreement being annulled by the european court of justice in luxembourg in may .
the eu and the us then reached an interim agreement as the eu warned that airlines would be vulnerable to privacy complaints if no replacement deal had been reached before the interim one expired .

" public funds are being more than just questioned , " said peter danckert , head of the german parliament 's sports committee .
" that applies to cycling in general and for other types of sports as well . " germany two largest publicly funded broadcasters , which have the german rights to live tour de france broadcasts , stopped their coverage of the event wednesday . in a joint statement ard and zdf said they would not be resuming their coverage of the tour " until clarification of the patrik sinkewitz case . "
about a million germans are estimated to have been following the competition live on tv . " it 's a warning to cycling and to every other sport , " zdf chief producer nikolaus brender said . does scandal extend beyond cycling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if doping is prevalent only in cycling meanwhile , the director of rundfunk berlin-brandenburg -lrb- rbb -rrb- said that there could be implications for other sports after the decision taken by the ard and zdf . " these decisions could also follow suit for other sports .
one can not really imagine that doping is restricted to cycling , " dagmar reim said . uwe schulz , manager of association of german cycle racing organizers , said cutting funds and stopping coverage of events where many innocent athletes also compete " is not an effective way to fight against doping in sports . " private sponsors waiting till end of tour to make decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile and its predecessor telekom have featured prominently in the doping scandal t-mobile , which sponsor 's the team most directly involved in the doping allegations , would be reconsidering its sport sponsoring program at the next supervisory board meeting , deputy board chairman ado wilhelm told thursday 's daily süddeutsche zeitung . t-mobile communications director christian frommert , however , said german broadcasters - and the public - should wait for results from sinkewitz 's second blood test before passing judgment on the team . " no one is served by making hasty conclusions , " he said , adding that meetings with the team 's riders , coaches and management would take place after the race 's conclusion . gerolsteiner , a german beverage company that sponsors another tour de france team , also said it would wait until august to decide whether to continue sponsoring cycling , chief spokesperson stefan göbel said . tour punished for investigating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrik sinkewitz has already returned to germany the tour de france 's parent company , amaury sports organization , said the german broadcasters were placing blame at the wrong people 's feet , according to company ceo patrice clerc . " the tour de france is being sanctioned , but should we sanction an event that is actually doing its best to weed out drugs cheats ? "
clerc told reporters .
" cheats are being found , and german tv is playing the ' empty chair ' policy .
if we do n't look for banned substances , we wo n't find them . " a lot of sports do n't look for anything .
we 've decided to take another attitude , we 're fighting against doping - and we 're being sanctioned because cheats are being found !
maybe german tv expects us not to track them down . " the high cost of doping former head of germany 's cycling federation sylvia schenk , however , said broadcasters were right to interrupt their coverage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : less money could make athletes think twice before doping , schenk said " doping costs a lot of money , " she said in an interview with rbb on thursday .
" it 's money that sponsors and broadcasters bring to the sport .
obviously you have to take the money out to make people think and to take away the financial possibility to dope . " sinkewitz has denied accusations of using testosterone or other doping agents to enhance his performance .
he has been suspended pending the results of a second blood test and is already back in germany after dropping out of the tour sunday due to a collision with a spectator , if sinkewitz 's second blood sample also comes back positive , t-mobile team boss bob stapleton said he would fire the rider immediately .
the team dismissed jan ullrich shortly before the 2006 tour de france for his alleged involvement in a doping scandal , and other riders for t-mobile , including 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis and erik zabel , have admitted to doping . " our stance is that we encourage targeted testing , out of competition testing .
it 's consistent with our view that if you do n't do the right thing you get caught and suffer the consequences , " added stapleton .

the new agreement will provide the us department of homeland security -lrb- dhs -rrb- with 19 categories of data about european air travelers flying to the united states .
the dhs will be allowed to keep the information in its database for 15 years and share details with other law enforcement agencies under certain conditions .
the eu reached an " understanding " on elements of the deal late last month but certain " reservations " had to be reviewed by some of the bloc 's 27 member states who are obliged to pass the accord through their national parliaments .
the agreement will significantly lower the number of categories of data available to the dhs as stated in the previous agreement between the eu and us .
post-9/11 deal saw 34 categories shared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions to 9/11 included stricter controls on data following the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington , the eu and the us signed an agreement under which the eu agreed to grant us authorities access to up to 34 categories of information on passengers on all flights to the us taking off from eu member states .
these included names , addresses , phone numbers and credit card numbers of travelers .
that agreement , which was set to expire on july 31 , stirred unease among eu lawmakers amid concerns that civil liberties were being eroded in the fight against global terrorism .
the eu-wide concerns over data privacy led to the agreement being annulled by the european court of justice in luxembourg in may .
the eu and the us then reached an interim agreement as the eu warned that airlines would be vulnerable to privacy complaints if no replacement deal had been reached before the interim one expired .
the new deal will affect the tens of thousands of european passengers who fly to the us every day .
despite the reduction of categories , it 's likely to reignite the controversy over potential infringements of privacy . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes after the uk expelled four russians monday . russian foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin on thursday said four british embassy staff in moscow are now persona non grata and they should leave the territory of the russian federation within 10 days . he did not identify the diplomats .
british ambassador to russia tony brenton said he was summoned to the russian foreign ministry and given " certain messages " to deliver to london .

it ended with a scandal , sackings and a criminal investigation into an illegal meat operation . some zoos are n't as lucky as the one in berlin .

spidla was considering mandatory paternity leave as a way of promoting equality at home and the workplace , the associated press reported , citing anonymous commission sources . " it is not possible to reduce the gender pay gap if -lsb- men -rsb- do not help out more at home , " spindla said at a press conference , adding that eu statistics show men , regardless of whether employed full or part-time , do less work at home than women . germany among worst offenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german women earn an average of 22 percent less than male coworkers as a way of promoting paternity leave , germany instituted a new system in january that allows parents to take home 14 instead of 12 months worth of benefits if they both divide the time away from their workplaces .

in the 27-member bloc only cyprus , estonia and slovakia have larger gender pay gaps than germany . " the fact that women in many fields of employment are still paid less than men for the same work is scandalous , " johannes singhammer , the christian social union 's spokesman for women 's issues , said in a statement . laws need to be applied he said germany already has sufficient laws to avoid such a gap , but that they " were obviously not being implemented as we would like .

merkel 's coalition made up of the christian democrats and social democrats took office in november 2005 . the chancellor said the government was " looking at mechanisms ... both on a european and german level " to deal with the influence of the funds . " we have started a discussion that is still ongoing , " she said . politicians in germany have expressed fears in recent months that newly rich state corporate behemoths in russia and china could take over key industrial sectors in europe 's biggest economy . possible political power merkel added that it was possible that such investments could be used not just to attain high returns on capital but also as a lever to gain political influence . " we mus n't be naive , " she said .
" state-owned funds can also have politico-strategic aims in mind that could be problematic in sensitive areas . " she said she wanted a wide-ranging discussion on the issue , including drawing on the expertise of the business industry , which has long experience in dealing with foreign capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and french president sarkozy this week in toulouse merkel said she had recently spoken with french president nicolas sarkozy about the matter . the chancellor said she also favored discussions among the eu 's 27 members for a uniform definition of " strategic industries " which might be covered by such mechanisms . she stressed she did not want to block such funds , but favored the introduction of transparent control mechanisms like those in force in the united states . " a general ban is with certainty not the right answer , " said merkel , who warned two weeks ago that major german companies could possibly fall into the hands of hostile states through investments by foreign government-operated funds . easy prey for takeovers german finance minister peer steinbrück recently commented in similar fashion , saying that berlin was considering ways of protecting domestic companies in key industries such as telecommunications , banking , postal services , logistics and energy from foreign investors . the growing power of investment funds has caused concern in germany because the relatively low market valuation of significant companies makes them relatively easy prey for takeovers . the funds are estimated to have more than 800 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.1 trillion -rrb- at their disposal .
this estimation does not include the substantial foreign currency reserves of middle eastern and east asian countries . china , for instance , has foreign currency reserves of about $ 1.2 trillion dollars , some of which has been earmarked to buy western companies . however , last month , bert rürup , a top economic adviser to the german government said he opposed introducing new forms of protectionism to stop foreign countries wielding excessive influence over domestic companies . " i do not think much of sealing off the german capital market , " rürup told the handelsblatt newspaper . cashing in on economic upturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany economy on its way up merkel said her government would do everything in its power to prolong the economic upturn that germany is currently enjoying in order to ensure that more people reap its benefits . " the greater the upswing is , the more influence we will have in shaping the international framework that is necessary to ensure that our traditional market economy continues to prosper , " she said . germany has been experiencing a steady drop in unemployment and many economists now project german economic growth in 2007 to match or possibly surpass last year 's 2.8 percent . article compiled from wire reports -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now it offers visitors a chance to venture into the middle ages .
when you go , be sure to look for the stone face pictured below . " location , location , location " is nothing new - and the 12th century builders of eltz castle picked a good one . perched high up on a rock crag within a green valley , eltz castle is surrounded not only by hills on all sides , but the eltzbach river makes a hairpin turn just around the mansion 's rocky nest , encompassing it on three sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castle is well located and was never destroyed this triple protection is one of the reasons the mansion was never destroyed . it also makes it a challenge for visitors to get there today .
it 's best to come by car and be prepared for a steep but short walk to the castle grounds . the eltz family was n't only thinking about safety , they also had money in mind when constructing their residence over 800 years ago .
the castle is situated between the moselle river , one of the most important trade routes in the german empire , and the fertile eifel and maifeld regions . royal condo construction on the castle stretched over 500 years and many generations , which explains the spectrum of romanesque to early baroque styles that can be found there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tours begin in the inner courtyard after the eltz family split into separate clans in 1268 in order to avoid an inheritance feud , the residence was inhabited by several family lines simultaneously - like a kind of giant medieval condominium .

a 17th century french tapestry and a 60-pound suit of armor await visitors in what used to by the meeting room . lucas cranach , the elder 's " madonna with child and grapes " can be seen in the rübenach hall .
used as a living room , the hall also boasts a high-tech gothic fireplace , which was capable of heating two rooms at once , even long after the fire had gone out . english tours available for an extra fee , visitors can continue their tour into the treasure vault , which contains over 500 objects from eight centuries .
gold and silver pieces , valuable crossbows , the prince elector 's ring , and 18th century porcelain from vienna are among the items on display , all of which belonged to the eltz family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can you find this face ?

now it offers visitors a chance to venture into the middle ages .
when you go , be sure to look for the stone face pictured below . " location , location , location " is nothing new - and the 12th century builders of eltz castle picked a good one . perched high up on a rock crag within a green valley , eltz castle is surrounded not only by hills on all sides , but the eltzbach river makes a hairpin turn just around the mansion 's rocky nest , encompassing it on three sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castle is well located and was never destroyed this triple protection is one of the reasons the mansion was never destroyed . it also makes it a challenge for visitors to get there today .
it 's best to come by car and be prepared for a steep but short walk to the castle grounds . the eltz family was n't only thinking about safety , they also had money in mind when constructing their residence over 800 years ago .
the castle is situated between the moselle river , one of the most important trade routes in the german empire , and the fertile eifel and maifeld regions . royal condo construction on the castle stretched over 500 years and many generations , which explains the spectrum of romanesque to early baroque styles that can be found there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tours begin in the inner courtyard after the eltz family split into separate clans in 1268 in order to avoid an inheritance feud , the residence was inhabited by several family lines simultaneously - like a kind of giant medieval condominium .
since each group was responsible for its own section of the home , several residential towers in slightly different styles were built , snugly packed in along the small central courtyard . bratwurst , moose and armor visitors to the castle are free to wander the grounds , enjoy the view of the river and meadow below and enjoy a bratwurst or a piece of cake at one of the two reasonably priced food counters . for many , it 's enough just to take in the scenery , but those who choose to go on a tour will only pay a few euros to catch a glimpse of shining medieval armor , filigree frescos , an original kitchen from the middle ages , paintings by lucas cranach , the elder - and even a 20th century alaskan moose trophy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 150 people lived in the castle knights hall and a gothic living room one highlight of the tour is the knights hall , one of the largest rooms in the castle .
a 17th century french tapestry and a 60-pound suit of armor await visitors in what used to by the meeting room . lucas cranach , the elder 's " madonna with child and grapes " can be seen in the rübenach hall .
used as a living room , the hall also boasts a high-tech gothic fireplace , which was capable of heating two rooms at once , even long after the fire had gone out . english tours available for an extra fee , visitors can continue their tour into the treasure vault , which contains over 500 objects from eight centuries .
gold and silver pieces , valuable crossbows , the prince elector 's ring , and 18th century porcelain from vienna are among the items on display , all of which belonged to the eltz family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can you find this face ?
tours begin every 10 to 15 minutes and last about 40 minutes .
they cost six euros for adults and combined tours including the treasure vault are available for eight euros .
group tours and tours in english , french and dutch can be arranged .

it ended with a scandal , sackings and a criminal investigation into an illegal meat operation . some zoos are n't as lucky as the one in berlin .
most do n't have superstar polar bear cubs and the potential to exploit cuteness through marketing deals and promotions which would make even david beckham seem like a media-shy hermit with no business sense .
there are no tie-ins , no plush toys flying off the shelves , no hordes of expectant children and insatiable paparazzi stampeding through the turnstiles .
for those zoos lacking star-quality , life is bleak .
the future is under-funded and the staff and animals suffer accordingly .
however , some animals - like those at erfurt zoo - suffer more than others .
for these poor creatures , their suffering was not caused by a reduction of enclosure space due to a budget cut or an enforced diet due to spiraling feed costs .
no , it came courtesy of those unscrupulous members of staff who , instead of looking after the beasts , were killing them and shipping their carcasses out the back door as meat .
while other establishments were relying on merchandise to boost income , the evil workers at erfurt were lining their own pockets with a grisly sideline in exotic animal flesh .
bambi steaks could be tip of meat iceberg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more buck for your buck : deer meat proved very popular apparently , the staff responsible had been turning petting zoo deer into venison as part of a clandestine business for a number of years .
now it is feared that bambi steaks will turn out to be just one specialty on the macabre menu .
" we are worried this is only the tip of the iceberg , " said wolfgang apel , president of the german animal protection league , who also called for a thorough review of controls at the zoo and at all other institutions with animals in the eastern state of thuringia .
the secret meat trade was revealed after an anonymous zoo employee noticed that the number of animals was declining .
" it was high time something was done about it , " the whistleblower said , as quoted in a report in die zeit newspaper .
after hearing of the scandal , erfurt 's mayor filed charges against workers at the zoo and fired the zoo 's director .
" the case is now being handled by state prosecutors , " said a spokeswoman for the mayor 's office in a statement to the press , declining to give further details . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 19.07.2007 eu wary of being dragged into britain-russia diplomatic row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is reluctant to take sides in the dispute between britain and russia despite a statement saying it was " disappointed " by russian failure to cooperate with the uk , the european union is staying firmly on the sidelines in the escalating diplomatic row between london and moscow . as relations between britain and russia reach the lowest point since the cold war , the european union stands to one side , unwilling to get involved in what could turn out to be one of the most serious diplomatic spats between east and west in over a decade .
britain expelled four russian diplomats on monday after russia refused to extradite andrei lugovoi , a suspect in the murder of kremlin critic and former kgb agent alexander litvinenko , who was poisoned with radioactive material in london last november .
shortly after the expulsion , british diplomats turned to the eu for support - and came up against a wall of indifference in most cases .
the british foreign office had looked towards the portuguese eu presidency for a statement of support on monday but by wednesday there had still not been an adequate response .
by wednesday evening , portuguese prime minister jose socrates had still not been able to extract enough support for the british stance from other eu leaders .
eventual eu statement lacks weight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis amado delivered the eu 's lukewarm response a statement eventually materialized thursday , but portuguese foreign minister luis amado 's assertion that the diplomatic row was " disappointing " and " a bilateral issue " between britain and russia hardly threw the bloc 's weight behind the brits .
the statement by the portuguese did however say the issue " raises important questions of common interest to eu member states , " adding that litvinenko 's murder was " a grave and reckless crime . "
surprisingly , given their level of animosity over issues both serious and trivial throughout history , the french were the most vocal when it came to supporting british prime minister gordon brown 's decision to throw the russians out .
" the murder of a british national on his home soil , using a substance that put at risk the lives of thousands of others is a particularly serious matter , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
" given the gravity of the matter , we stand alongside the united kingdom in its concern that justice be done .
" we call on moscow to respond to the demands of british justice in a constructive manner ... so that the perpetrators of this crime are brought to justice and punished , " he added .
russia promptly responded on thursday by expelling four british diplomats from moscow , in what alexander grushkov , russia 's deputy foreign minister , said was a " targeted and appropriate " response .
" britain appeals for eu solidarity , " grushkov said in his statement .
" we hope that common sense will prevail within the eu and that its members will not give in to attempts to turn relations between russia and the eu into a tool to achieve unilateral political goals .
these have nothing in common with eu and russia 's real partnership interests . "
germany says britain " overreacted " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown wanted merkel 's support ; he did n't get it germany was one of the many other eu nations which viewed the situation from a distance .
despite prime minister brown 's visit in person to berlin to press chancellor angela merkel for her support , germany remained firmly on the fence but did say that it thought britain had " overreacted " by expelling the four russian diplomats and freezing bilateral negotiations on visas .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will meet in berlin on friday to discuss the diplomatic row .
german foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said the meeting would involve " brief but intensive talks " .
steinmeier on wednesday had expressed his hope that the row would not be allowed to escalate into " a crisis . "
in terms of relations with russia , germany is the main player in the european union and therefore has the most to lose from coming down on the side of the brits .
russia considers germany to be its most important economic partner in the eu and the statistics on trade between the two nations confirms this view .
trade between the two countries increased by almost 40 percent in 2006 while german exports to russia went up by 35 percent .
germany and russia are also driving europe 's energy agenda and if the bloc is to secure its supply from the east , then relations between the two sides have to be good .
russia warns eu to stay out of row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia has a lot of leverage over the eu russia for its part has warned the eu to stay out of the row and vladimir chizhov , russia 's eu representative in brussels called the eu presidency 's lukewarm statement on wednesday " an unpleasant surprise for us . "
despite the lack of any real commitment on europe 's part , chizhov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency that the eu statement would " affect relations between the eu and russia . "
while disappointed by europe 's relatively non-committal stance in the row , british foreign minister david miliband is unlikely to give up trying to garner support .
he is expected to lobby his eu counterparts at the next eu foreign minister meeting in brussels on monday but observers believe that unless russia reacts again , and more strongly this time , the eu will continue to sit out the row on the sidelines . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

britain expelled four russian diplomats on monday after russia refused to extradite andrei lugovoi , a suspect in the murder of kremlin critic and former kgb agent alexander litvinenko , who was poisoned with radioactive material in london last november .
shortly after the expulsion , british diplomats turned to the eu for support - and came up against a wall of indifference in most cases .
the british foreign office had looked towards the portuguese eu presidency for a statement of support on monday but by wednesday there had still not been an adequate response .
by wednesday evening , portuguese prime minister jose socrates had still not been able to extract enough support for the british stance from other eu leaders .
eventual eu statement lacks weight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis amado delivered the eu 's lukewarm response a statement eventually materialized thursday , but portuguese foreign minister luis amado 's assertion that the diplomatic row was " disappointing " and " a bilateral issue " between britain and russia hardly threw the bloc 's weight behind the brits .
the statement by the portuguese did however say the issue " raises important questions of common interest to eu member states , " adding that litvinenko 's murder was " a grave and reckless crime . "
surprisingly , given their level of animosity over issues both serious and trivial throughout history , the french were the most vocal when it came to supporting british prime minister gordon brown 's decision to throw the russians out .
" the murder of a british national on his home soil , using a substance that put at risk the lives of thousands of others is a particularly serious matter , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
" given the gravity of the matter , we stand alongside the united kingdom in its concern that justice be done .
" we call on moscow to respond to the demands of british justice in a constructive manner ... so that the perpetrators of this crime are brought to justice and punished , " he added .
russia promptly responded on thursday by expelling four british diplomats from moscow , in what alexander grushkov , russia 's deputy foreign minister , said was a " targeted and appropriate " response .
" britain appeals for eu solidarity , " grushkov said in his statement .
" we hope that common sense will prevail within the eu and that its members will not give in to attempts to turn relations between russia and the eu into a tool to achieve unilateral political goals .
these have nothing in common with eu and russia 's real partnership interests . "
germany says britain " overreacted " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown wanted merkel 's support ; he did n't get it germany was one of the many other eu nations which viewed the situation from a distance .
despite prime minister brown 's visit in person to berlin to press chancellor angela merkel for her support , germany remained firmly on the fence but did say that it thought britain had " overreacted " by expelling the four russian diplomats and freezing bilateral negotiations on visas .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will meet in berlin on friday to discuss the diplomatic row .
german foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said the meeting would involve " brief but intensive talks " .
steinmeier on wednesday had expressed his hope that the row would not be allowed to escalate into " a crisis . "
in terms of relations with russia , germany is the main player in the european union and therefore has the most to lose from coming down on the side of the brits .
russia considers germany to be its most important economic partner in the eu and the statistics on trade between the two nations confirms this view .
trade between the two countries increased by almost 40 percent in 2006 while german exports to russia went up by 35 percent .
germany and russia are also driving europe 's energy agenda and if the bloc is to secure its supply from the east , then relations between the two sides have to be good .
russia warns eu to stay out of row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia has a lot of leverage over the eu russia for its part has warned the eu to stay out of the row and vladimir chizhov , russia 's eu representative in brussels called the eu presidency 's lukewarm statement on wednesday " an unpleasant surprise for us . "
despite the lack of any real commitment on europe 's part , chizhov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency that the eu statement would " affect relations between the eu and russia . "
while disappointed by europe 's relatively non-committal stance in the row , british foreign minister david miliband is unlikely to give up trying to garner support .
he is expected to lobby his eu counterparts at the next eu foreign minister meeting in brussels on monday but observers believe that unless russia reacts again , and more strongly this time , the eu will continue to sit out the row on the sidelines . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's coalition made up of the christian democrats and social democrats took office in november 2005 . the chancellor said the government was " looking at mechanisms ... both on a european and german level " to deal with the influence of the funds . " we have started a discussion that is still ongoing , " she said . politicians in germany have expressed fears in recent months that newly rich state corporate behemoths in russia and china could take over key industrial sectors in europe 's biggest economy . possible political power merkel added that it was possible that such investments could be used not just to attain high returns on capital but also as a lever to gain political influence .

two germans and several afghans were allegedly abducted by taliban fighters in central afghanistan .
german and afghan officials are working to find out more about the hostages and the kidnappers . the group was traveling on the highway that connects the capital kabul with the southern city of kandahar when armed taliban fighters stopped the car and kidnapped them .
" armed men took over their vehicle , disarmed the police and drove away the seven , leaving the empty-handed police in the area , " a local police chief told afp news service .
other reports have said that a total of eight people had been kidnapped .
unknown hostages , kidnappers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban fighters a spokesman for the afghan interior ministry said that a search operation has been launched , but that it remains unclear who kidnapped the group .
german officials said that the german embassy in kabul was also working to find out what happened .
while some officials said that taliban fighters must have been involved , a taliban spokesman , zabihullah mujahid , told afp via phone from an unknown location that he could not confirm this .
un spokesman adrian edwards in kabul meanwhile denied that the germans had been working for the world organization .
germans targeted the kidnapping comes less than a month after a german and his afghan translator were kidnapped in southwestern afghanistan and released unharmed about a week later .

merkel 's coalition made up of the christian democrats and social democrats took office in november 2005 . the chancellor said the government was " looking at mechanisms ... both on a european and german level " to deal with the influence of the funds . " we have started a discussion that is still ongoing , " she said . politicians in germany have expressed fears in recent months that newly rich state corporate behemoths in russia and china could take over key industrial sectors in europe 's biggest economy . possible political power merkel added that it was possible that such investments could be used not just to attain high returns on capital but also as a lever to gain political influence . " we mus n't be naive , " she said .
" state-owned funds can also have politico-strategic aims in mind that could be problematic in sensitive areas . " she said she wanted a wide-ranging discussion on the issue , including drawing on the expertise of the business industry , which has long experience in dealing with foreign capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and french president sarkozy this week in toulouse merkel said she had recently spoken with french president nicolas sarkozy about the matter . the chancellor said she also favored discussions among the eu 's 27 members for a uniform definition of " strategic industries " which might be covered by such mechanisms . she stressed she did not want to block such funds , but favored the introduction of transparent control mechanisms like those in force in the united states . " a general ban is with certainty not the right answer , " said merkel , who warned two weeks ago that major german companies could possibly fall into the hands of hostile states through investments by foreign government-operated funds . easy prey for takeovers german finance minister peer steinbrück recently commented in similar fashion , saying that berlin was considering ways of protecting domestic companies in key industries such as telecommunications , banking , postal services , logistics and energy from foreign investors . the growing power of investment funds has caused concern in germany because the relatively low market valuation of significant companies makes them relatively easy prey for takeovers . the funds are estimated to have more than 800 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.1 trillion -rrb- at their disposal .
this estimation does not include the substantial foreign currency reserves of middle eastern and east asian countries . china , for instance , has foreign currency reserves of about $ 1.2 trillion dollars , some of which has been earmarked to buy western companies . however , last month , bert rürup , a top economic adviser to the german government said he opposed introducing new forms of protectionism to stop foreign countries wielding excessive influence over domestic companies . " i do not think much of sealing off the german capital market , " rürup told the handelsblatt newspaper . cashing in on economic upturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany economy on its way up merkel said her government would do everything in its power to prolong the economic upturn that germany is currently enjoying in order to ensure that more people reap its benefits . " the greater the upswing is , the more influence we will have in shaping the international framework that is necessary to ensure that our traditional market economy continues to prosper , " she said . germany has been experiencing a steady drop in unemployment and many economists now project german economic growth in 2007 to match or possibly surpass last year 's 2.8 percent . article compiled from wire reports -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 19.07.2007 eu wary of being dragged into britain-russia diplomatic row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is reluctant to take sides in the dispute between britain and russia despite a statement saying it was " disappointed " by russian failure to cooperate with the uk , the european union is staying firmly on the sidelines in the escalating diplomatic row between london and moscow . as relations between britain and russia reach the lowest point since the cold war , the european union stands to one side , unwilling to get involved in what could turn out to be one of the most serious diplomatic spats between east and west in over a decade .
britain expelled four russian diplomats on monday after russia refused to extradite andrei lugovoi , a suspect in the murder of kremlin critic and former kgb agent alexander litvinenko , who was poisoned with radioactive material in london last november .
shortly after the expulsion , british diplomats turned to the eu for support - and came up against a wall of indifference in most cases .
the british foreign office had looked towards the portuguese eu presidency for a statement of support on monday but by wednesday there had still not been an adequate response .
by wednesday evening , portuguese prime minister jose socrates had still not been able to extract enough support for the british stance from other eu leaders .
eventual eu statement lacks weight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis amado delivered the eu 's lukewarm response a statement eventually materialized thursday , but portuguese foreign minister luis amado 's assertion that the diplomatic row was " disappointing " and " a bilateral issue " between britain and russia hardly threw the bloc 's weight behind the brits .
the statement by the portuguese did however say the issue " raises important questions of common interest to eu member states , " adding that litvinenko 's murder was " a grave and reckless crime . "
surprisingly , given their level of animosity over issues both serious and trivial throughout history , the french were the most vocal when it came to supporting british prime minister gordon brown 's decision to throw the russians out .
" the murder of a british national on his home soil , using a substance that put at risk the lives of thousands of others is a particularly serious matter , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
" given the gravity of the matter , we stand alongside the united kingdom in its concern that justice be done .
" we call on moscow to respond to the demands of british justice in a constructive manner ... so that the perpetrators of this crime are brought to justice and punished , " he added .
russia promptly responded on thursday by expelling four british diplomats from moscow , in what alexander grushkov , russia 's deputy foreign minister , said was a " targeted and appropriate " response .
" britain appeals for eu solidarity , " grushkov said in his statement .
" we hope that common sense will prevail within the eu and that its members will not give in to attempts to turn relations between russia and the eu into a tool to achieve unilateral political goals .
these have nothing in common with eu and russia 's real partnership interests . "
germany says britain " overreacted " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown wanted merkel 's support ; he did n't get it germany was one of the many other eu nations which viewed the situation from a distance .
despite prime minister brown 's visit in person to berlin to press chancellor angela merkel for her support , germany remained firmly on the fence but did say that it thought britain had " overreacted " by expelling the four russian diplomats and freezing bilateral negotiations on visas .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will meet in berlin on friday to discuss the diplomatic row .
german foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said the meeting would involve " brief but intensive talks " .
steinmeier on wednesday had expressed his hope that the row would not be allowed to escalate into " a crisis . "
in terms of relations with russia , germany is the main player in the european union and therefore has the most to lose from coming down on the side of the brits .
russia considers germany to be its most important economic partner in the eu and the statistics on trade between the two nations confirms this view .
trade between the two countries increased by almost 40 percent in 2006 while german exports to russia went up by 35 percent .
germany and russia are also driving europe 's energy agenda and if the bloc is to secure its supply from the east , then relations between the two sides have to be good .
russia warns eu to stay out of row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia has a lot of leverage over the eu russia for its part has warned the eu to stay out of the row and vladimir chizhov , russia 's eu representative in brussels called the eu presidency 's lukewarm statement on wednesday " an unpleasant surprise for us . "
despite the lack of any real commitment on europe 's part , chizhov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency that the eu statement would " affect relations between the eu and russia . "
while disappointed by europe 's relatively non-committal stance in the row , british foreign minister david miliband is unlikely to give up trying to garner support .
he is expected to lobby his eu counterparts at the next eu foreign minister meeting in brussels on monday but observers believe that unless russia reacts again , and more strongly this time , the eu will continue to sit out the row on the sidelines . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

britain expelled four russian diplomats on monday after russia refused to extradite andrei lugovoi , a suspect in the murder of kremlin critic and former kgb agent alexander litvinenko , who was poisoned with radioactive material in london last november .
shortly after the expulsion , british diplomats turned to the eu for support - and came up against a wall of indifference in most cases .
the british foreign office had looked towards the portuguese eu presidency for a statement of support on monday but by wednesday there had still not been an adequate response .
by wednesday evening , portuguese prime minister jose socrates had still not been able to extract enough support for the british stance from other eu leaders .
eventual eu statement lacks weight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis amado delivered the eu 's lukewarm response a statement eventually materialized thursday , but portuguese foreign minister luis amado 's assertion that the diplomatic row was " disappointing " and " a bilateral issue " between britain and russia hardly threw the bloc 's weight behind the brits .
the statement by the portuguese did however say the issue " raises important questions of common interest to eu member states , " adding that litvinenko 's murder was " a grave and reckless crime . "
surprisingly , given their level of animosity over issues both serious and trivial throughout history , the french were the most vocal when it came to supporting british prime minister gordon brown 's decision to throw the russians out .
" the murder of a british national on his home soil , using a substance that put at risk the lives of thousands of others is a particularly serious matter , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
" given the gravity of the matter , we stand alongside the united kingdom in its concern that justice be done .
" we call on moscow to respond to the demands of british justice in a constructive manner ... so that the perpetrators of this crime are brought to justice and punished , " he added .
russia promptly responded on thursday by expelling four british diplomats from moscow , in what alexander grushkov , russia 's deputy foreign minister , said was a " targeted and appropriate " response .
" britain appeals for eu solidarity , " grushkov said in his statement .
" we hope that common sense will prevail within the eu and that its members will not give in to attempts to turn relations between russia and the eu into a tool to achieve unilateral political goals .
these have nothing in common with eu and russia 's real partnership interests . "
germany says britain " overreacted " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown wanted merkel 's support ; he did n't get it germany was one of the many other eu nations which viewed the situation from a distance .
despite prime minister brown 's visit in person to berlin to press chancellor angela merkel for her support , germany remained firmly on the fence but did say that it thought britain had " overreacted " by expelling the four russian diplomats and freezing bilateral negotiations on visas .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will meet in berlin on friday to discuss the diplomatic row .
german foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said the meeting would involve " brief but intensive talks " .
steinmeier on wednesday had expressed his hope that the row would not be allowed to escalate into " a crisis . "
in terms of relations with russia , germany is the main player in the european union and therefore has the most to lose from coming down on the side of the brits .
russia considers germany to be its most important economic partner in the eu and the statistics on trade between the two nations confirms this view .
trade between the two countries increased by almost 40 percent in 2006 while german exports to russia went up by 35 percent .
germany and russia are also driving europe 's energy agenda and if the bloc is to secure its supply from the east , then relations between the two sides have to be good .
russia warns eu to stay out of row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia has a lot of leverage over the eu russia for its part has warned the eu to stay out of the row and vladimir chizhov , russia 's eu representative in brussels called the eu presidency 's lukewarm statement on wednesday " an unpleasant surprise for us . "
despite the lack of any real commitment on europe 's part , chizhov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency that the eu statement would " affect relations between the eu and russia . "
while disappointed by europe 's relatively non-committal stance in the row , british foreign minister david miliband is unlikely to give up trying to garner support .
he is expected to lobby his eu counterparts at the next eu foreign minister meeting in brussels on monday but observers believe that unless russia reacts again , and more strongly this time , the eu will continue to sit out the row on the sidelines . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

britain expelled four russian diplomats on monday after russia refused to extradite andrei lugovoi , a suspect in the murder of kremlin critic and former kgb agent alexander litvinenko , who was poisoned with radioactive material in london last november .
shortly after the expulsion , british diplomats turned to the eu for support - and came up against a wall of indifference in most cases .
the british foreign office had looked towards the portuguese eu presidency for a statement of support on monday but by wednesday there had still not been an adequate response .
by wednesday evening , portuguese prime minister jose socrates had still not been able to extract enough support for the british stance from other eu leaders .
eventual eu statement lacks weight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis amado delivered the eu 's lukewarm response a statement eventually materialized thursday , but portuguese foreign minister luis amado 's assertion that the diplomatic row was " disappointing " and " a bilateral issue " between britain and russia hardly threw the bloc 's weight behind the brits .
the statement by the portuguese did however say the issue " raises important questions of common interest to eu member states , " adding that litvinenko 's murder was " a grave and reckless crime . "
surprisingly , given their level of animosity over issues both serious and trivial throughout history , the french were the most vocal when it came to supporting british prime minister gordon brown 's decision to throw the russians out .
" the murder of a british national on his home soil , using a substance that put at risk the lives of thousands of others is a particularly serious matter , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
" given the gravity of the matter , we stand alongside the united kingdom in its concern that justice be done .
" we call on moscow to respond to the demands of british justice in a constructive manner ... so that the perpetrators of this crime are brought to justice and punished , " he added .
russia promptly responded on thursday by expelling four british diplomats from moscow , in what alexander grushkov , russia 's deputy foreign minister , said was a " targeted and appropriate " response .
" britain appeals for eu solidarity , " grushkov said in his statement .
" we hope that common sense will prevail within the eu and that its members will not give in to attempts to turn relations between russia and the eu into a tool to achieve unilateral political goals .
these have nothing in common with eu and russia 's real partnership interests . "
germany says britain " overreacted " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown wanted merkel 's support ; he did n't get it germany was one of the many other eu nations which viewed the situation from a distance .
despite prime minister brown 's visit in person to berlin to press chancellor angela merkel for her support , germany remained firmly on the fence but did say that it thought britain had " overreacted " by expelling the four russian diplomats and freezing bilateral negotiations on visas .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will meet in berlin on friday to discuss the diplomatic row .
german foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said the meeting would involve " brief but intensive talks " .
steinmeier on wednesday had expressed his hope that the row would not be allowed to escalate into " a crisis . "
in terms of relations with russia , germany is the main player in the european union and therefore has the most to lose from coming down on the side of the brits .
russia considers germany to be its most important economic partner in the eu and the statistics on trade between the two nations confirms this view .
trade between the two countries increased by almost 40 percent in 2006 while german exports to russia went up by 35 percent .
germany and russia are also driving europe 's energy agenda and if the bloc is to secure its supply from the east , then relations between the two sides have to be good .
russia warns eu to stay out of row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia has a lot of leverage over the eu russia for its part has warned the eu to stay out of the row and vladimir chizhov , russia 's eu representative in brussels called the eu presidency 's lukewarm statement on wednesday " an unpleasant surprise for us . "
despite the lack of any real commitment on europe 's part , chizhov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency that the eu statement would " affect relations between the eu and russia . "
while disappointed by europe 's relatively non-committal stance in the row , british foreign minister david miliband is unlikely to give up trying to garner support .
he is expected to lobby his eu counterparts at the next eu foreign minister meeting in brussels on monday but observers believe that unless russia reacts again , and more strongly this time , the eu will continue to sit out the row on the sidelines . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new agreement will provide the us department of homeland security -lrb- dhs -rrb- with 19 categories of data about european air travelers flying to the united states .
the dhs will be allowed to keep the information in its database for 15 years and share details with other law enforcement agencies under certain conditions .
the eu reached an " understanding " on elements of the deal late last month but certain " reservations " had to be reviewed by some of the bloc 's 27 member states who are obliged to pass the accord through their national parliaments .
the agreement will significantly lower the number of categories of data available to the dhs as stated in the previous agreement between the eu and us .
post-9/11 deal saw 34 categories shared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions to 9/11 included stricter controls on data following the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington , the eu and the us signed an agreement under which the eu agreed to grant us authorities access to up to 34 categories of information on passengers on all flights to the us taking off from eu member states .
these included names , addresses , phone numbers and credit card numbers of travelers .
that agreement , which was set to expire on july 31 , stirred unease among eu lawmakers amid concerns that civil liberties were being eroded in the fight against global terrorism .
the eu-wide concerns over data privacy led to the agreement being annulled by the european court of justice in luxembourg in may .
the eu and the us then reached an interim agreement as the eu warned that airlines would be vulnerable to privacy complaints if no replacement deal had been reached before the interim one expired .
the new deal will affect the tens of thousands of european passengers who fly to the us every day .
despite the reduction of categories , it 's likely to reignite the controversy over potential infringements of privacy . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now it offers visitors a chance to venture into the middle ages .
when you go , be sure to look for the stone face pictured below . " location , location , location " is nothing new - and the 12th century builders of eltz castle picked a good one . perched high up on a rock crag within a green valley , eltz castle is surrounded not only by hills on all sides , but the eltzbach river makes a hairpin turn just around the mansion 's rocky nest , encompassing it on three sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castle is well located and was never destroyed this triple protection is one of the reasons the mansion was never destroyed . it also makes it a challenge for visitors to get there today .
it 's best to come by car and be prepared for a steep but short walk to the castle grounds . the eltz family was n't only thinking about safety , they also had money in mind when constructing their residence over 800 years ago .
the castle is situated between the moselle river , one of the most important trade routes in the german empire , and the fertile eifel and maifeld regions . royal condo construction on the castle stretched over 500 years and many generations , which explains the spectrum of romanesque to early baroque styles that can be found there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tours begin in the inner courtyard after the eltz family split into separate clans in 1268 in order to avoid an inheritance feud , the residence was inhabited by several family lines simultaneously - like a kind of giant medieval condominium .
since each group was responsible for its own section of the home , several residential towers in slightly different styles were built , snugly packed in along the small central courtyard . bratwurst , moose and armor visitors to the castle are free to wander the grounds , enjoy the view of the river and meadow below and enjoy a bratwurst or a piece of cake at one of the two reasonably priced food counters . for many , it 's enough just to take in the scenery , but those who choose to go on a tour will only pay a few euros to catch a glimpse of shining medieval armor , filigree frescos , an original kitchen from the middle ages , paintings by lucas cranach , the elder - and even a 20th century alaskan moose trophy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as many as 150 people lived in the castle knights hall and a gothic living room one highlight of the tour is the knights hall , one of the largest rooms in the castle .
a 17th century french tapestry and a 60-pound suit of armor await visitors in what used to by the meeting room . lucas cranach , the elder 's " madonna with child and grapes " can be seen in the rübenach hall .
used as a living room , the hall also boasts a high-tech gothic fireplace , which was capable of heating two rooms at once , even long after the fire had gone out . english tours available for an extra fee , visitors can continue their tour into the treasure vault , which contains over 500 objects from eight centuries .
gold and silver pieces , valuable crossbows , the prince elector 's ring , and 18th century porcelain from vienna are among the items on display , all of which belonged to the eltz family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can you find this face ?
tours begin every 10 to 15 minutes and last about 40 minutes .
they cost six euros for adults and combined tours including the treasure vault are available for eight euros .
group tours and tours in english , french and dutch can be arranged .
please see the link below for more information about opening times and prices . are you planning a trip to burg eltz ?

now it offers visitors a chance to venture into the middle ages .
when you go , be sure to look for the stone face pictured below . " location , location , location " is nothing new - and the 12th century builders of eltz castle picked a good one . perched high up on a rock crag within a green valley , eltz castle is surrounded not only by hills on all sides , but the eltzbach river makes a hairpin turn just around the mansion 's rocky nest , encompassing it on three sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castle is well located and was never destroyed this triple protection is one of the reasons the mansion was never destroyed . it also makes it a challenge for visitors to get there today .
it 's best to come by car and be prepared for a steep but short walk to the castle grounds . the eltz family was n't only thinking about safety , they also had money in mind when constructing their residence over 800 years ago .
the castle is situated between the moselle river , one of the most important trade routes in the german empire , and the fertile eifel and maifeld regions . royal condo construction on the castle stretched over 500 years and many generations , which explains the spectrum of romanesque to early baroque styles that can be found there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tours begin in the inner courtyard after the eltz family split into separate clans in 1268 in order to avoid an inheritance feud , the residence was inhabited by several family lines simultaneously - like a kind of giant medieval condominium .

a 17th century french tapestry and a 60-pound suit of armor await visitors in what used to by the meeting room . lucas cranach , the elder 's " madonna with child and grapes " can be seen in the rübenach hall .
used as a living room , the hall also boasts a high-tech gothic fireplace , which was capable of heating two rooms at once , even long after the fire had gone out . english tours available for an extra fee , visitors can continue their tour into the treasure vault , which contains over 500 objects from eight centuries .
gold and silver pieces , valuable crossbows , the prince elector 's ring , and 18th century porcelain from vienna are among the items on display , all of which belonged to the eltz family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can you find this face ?

" girls out-perform boys at school and more women enter the labor market with a university degree than men , but a pay gap of 15 percent persists , " vladimir spidla , european commissioner for employment and social affairs said wednesday .
" this is an absurd situation and needs to change . " the czech commissioner said the " uneven division of duties in families " was partially responsible for the gap .

merkel 's coalition made up of the christian democrats and social democrats took office in november 2005 . the chancellor said the government was " looking at mechanisms ... both on a european and german level " to deal with the influence of the funds . " we have started a discussion that is still ongoing , " she said . politicians in germany have expressed fears in recent months that newly rich state corporate behemoths in russia and china could take over key industrial sectors in europe 's biggest economy . possible political power merkel added that it was possible that such investments could be used not just to attain high returns on capital but also as a lever to gain political influence . " we mus n't be naive , " she said .
" state-owned funds can also have politico-strategic aims in mind that could be problematic in sensitive areas . " she said she wanted a wide-ranging discussion on the issue , including drawing on the expertise of the business industry , which has long experience in dealing with foreign capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and french president sarkozy this week in toulouse merkel said she had recently spoken with french president nicolas sarkozy about the matter . the chancellor said she also favored discussions among the eu 's 27 members for a uniform definition of " strategic industries " which might be covered by such mechanisms . she stressed she did not want to block such funds , but favored the introduction of transparent control mechanisms like those in force in the united states . " a general ban is with certainty not the right answer , " said merkel , who warned two weeks ago that major german companies could possibly fall into the hands of hostile states through investments by foreign government-operated funds . easy prey for takeovers german finance minister peer steinbrück recently commented in similar fashion , saying that berlin was considering ways of protecting domestic companies in key industries such as telecommunications , banking , postal services , logistics and energy from foreign investors . the growing power of investment funds has caused concern in germany because the relatively low market valuation of significant companies makes them relatively easy prey for takeovers . the funds are estimated to have more than 800 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.1 trillion -rrb- at their disposal .
this estimation does not include the substantial foreign currency reserves of middle eastern and east asian countries . china , for instance , has foreign currency reserves of about $ 1.2 trillion dollars , some of which has been earmarked to buy western companies . however , last month , bert rürup , a top economic adviser to the german government said he opposed introducing new forms of protectionism to stop foreign countries wielding excessive influence over domestic companies .

" girls out-perform boys at school and more women enter the labor market with a university degree than men , but a pay gap of 15 percent persists , " vladimir spidla , european commissioner for employment and social affairs said wednesday .
" this is an absurd situation and needs to change . " the czech commissioner said the " uneven division of duties in families " was partially responsible for the gap .
spidla was considering mandatory paternity leave as a way of promoting equality at home and the workplace , the associated press reported , citing anonymous commission sources . " it is not possible to reduce the gender pay gap if -lsb- men -rsb- do not help out more at home , " spindla said at a press conference , adding that eu statistics show men , regardless of whether employed full or part-time , do less work at home than women . germany among worst offenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german women earn an average of 22 percent less than male coworkers as a way of promoting paternity leave , germany instituted a new system in january that allows parents to take home 14 instead of 12 months worth of benefits if they both divide the time away from their workplaces .
the extra two months have earned the name " father months " as the most common division sees mothers taking 12 months of leave and father two . women in germany earn an average of 22 percent less than similarly qualified men , according to an eu study .
in the 27-member bloc only cyprus , estonia and slovakia have larger gender pay gaps than germany . " the fact that women in many fields of employment are still paid less than men for the same work is scandalous , " johannes singhammer , the christian social union 's spokesman for women 's issues , said in a statement . laws need to be applied he said germany already has sufficient laws to avoid such a gap , but that they " were obviously not being implemented as we would like . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it would n't kill men to do more work in the house as well plugging the pay gap should be an integral part of governments ' employment policies and that pressure must also be put on employers to ensure there is no discrimination against women , spidla said . " the pay gap is a complex issue with multiple causes , " he said .
" sometimes we see pure discrimination .
but often reasons are hidden .
women do more unpaid work , like taking care of the household and dependants . " different value for same work the commissioner also pointed out that women did more part-time work and said that women-dominated jobs and sectors were on a lower pay scale . a commission report , which showed the pay gap in europe had not decreased in over a decade , said a main cause of discrimination was that women 's competences were less valued then men 's . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite equally long training , nurses are often paid less than police as a result , jobs requiring similar qualifications or experience tended to be paid less when they were dominated by women than by men . " for example , in some countries nannies earn less than car mechanics , supermarket cashiers less than warehouse workers , nurses less than the police , " said the commission . seniority-based pay slammed the eu executive said that the pay gap also reflected inequalities in the labor market , especially the difficulties in reconciling work with private life . women with part-time jobs and those who took frequent career breaks because of children were less likely to hold managerial positions and encounter more obstacles and resistance as they proceed along their career paths , the commission report said . " as a consequence , women 's career paths are more often interrupted , slower and shorter , and hence less well paid than men 's , " it said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new agreement will provide the us department of homeland security -lrb- dhs -rrb- with 19 categories of data about european air travelers flying to the united states .
the dhs will be allowed to keep the information in its database for 15 years and share details with other law enforcement agencies under certain conditions .
the eu reached an " understanding " on elements of the deal late last month but certain " reservations " had to be reviewed by some of the bloc 's 27 member states who are obliged to pass the accord through their national parliaments .
the agreement will significantly lower the number of categories of data available to the dhs as stated in the previous agreement between the eu and us .
post-9/11 deal saw 34 categories shared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions to 9/11 included stricter controls on data following the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington , the eu and the us signed an agreement under which the eu agreed to grant us authorities access to up to 34 categories of information on passengers on all flights to the us taking off from eu member states .
these included names , addresses , phone numbers and credit card numbers of travelers .
that agreement , which was set to expire on july 31 , stirred unease among eu lawmakers amid concerns that civil liberties were being eroded in the fight against global terrorism .
the eu-wide concerns over data privacy led to the agreement being annulled by the european court of justice in luxembourg in may .
the eu and the us then reached an interim agreement as the eu warned that airlines would be vulnerable to privacy complaints if no replacement deal had been reached before the interim one expired .
the new deal will affect the tens of thousands of european passengers who fly to the us every day .
despite the reduction of categories , it 's likely to reignite the controversy over potential infringements of privacy . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now it offers visitors a chance to venture into the middle ages .
when you go , be sure to look for the stone face pictured below . " location , location , location " is nothing new - and the 12th century builders of eltz castle picked a good one . perched high up on a rock crag within a green valley , eltz castle is surrounded not only by hills on all sides , but the eltzbach river makes a hairpin turn just around the mansion 's rocky nest , encompassing it on three sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castle is well located and was never destroyed this triple protection is one of the reasons the mansion was never destroyed . it also makes it a challenge for visitors to get there today .
it 's best to come by car and be prepared for a steep but short walk to the castle grounds . the eltz family was n't only thinking about safety , they also had money in mind when constructing their residence over 800 years ago .
the castle is situated between the moselle river , one of the most important trade routes in the german empire , and the fertile eifel and maifeld regions . royal condo construction on the castle stretched over 500 years and many generations , which explains the spectrum of romanesque to early baroque styles that can be found there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tours begin in the inner courtyard after the eltz family split into separate clans in 1268 in order to avoid an inheritance feud , the residence was inhabited by several family lines simultaneously - like a kind of giant medieval condominium .

used as a living room , the hall also boasts a high-tech gothic fireplace , which was capable of heating two rooms at once , even long after the fire had gone out . english tours available for an extra fee , visitors can continue their tour into the treasure vault , which contains over 500 objects from eight centuries .
gold and silver pieces , valuable crossbows , the prince elector 's ring , and 18th century porcelain from vienna are among the items on display , all of which belonged to the eltz family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can you find this face ?

" girls out-perform boys at school and more women enter the labor market with a university degree than men , but a pay gap of 15 percent persists , " vladimir spidla , european commissioner for employment and social affairs said wednesday .
" this is an absurd situation and needs to change . " the czech commissioner said the " uneven division of duties in families " was partially responsible for the gap .
spidla was considering mandatory paternity leave as a way of promoting equality at home and the workplace , the associated press reported , citing anonymous commission sources . " it is not possible to reduce the gender pay gap if -lsb- men -rsb- do not help out more at home , " spindla said at a press conference , adding that eu statistics show men , regardless of whether employed full or part-time , do less work at home than women . germany among worst offenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german women earn an average of 22 percent less than male coworkers as a way of promoting paternity leave , germany instituted a new system in january that allows parents to take home 14 instead of 12 months worth of benefits if they both divide the time away from their workplaces .

" the pay gap is a complex issue with multiple causes , " he said .
" sometimes we see pure discrimination .
but often reasons are hidden .
women do more unpaid work , like taking care of the household and dependants . " different value for same work the commissioner also pointed out that women did more part-time work and said that women-dominated jobs and sectors were on a lower pay scale . a commission report , which showed the pay gap in europe had not decreased in over a decade , said a main cause of discrimination was that women 's competences were less valued then men 's . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite equally long training , nurses are often paid less than police as a result , jobs requiring similar qualifications or experience tended to be paid less when they were dominated by women than by men . " for example , in some countries nannies earn less than car mechanics , supermarket cashiers less than warehouse workers , nurses less than the police , " said the commission . seniority-based pay slammed the eu executive said that the pay gap also reflected inequalities in the labor market , especially the difficulties in reconciling work with private life . women with part-time jobs and those who took frequent career breaks because of children were less likely to hold managerial positions and encounter more obstacles and resistance as they proceed along their career paths , the commission report said .

it ended with a scandal , sackings and a criminal investigation into an illegal meat operation . some zoos are n't as lucky as the one in berlin .
most do n't have superstar polar bear cubs and the potential to exploit cuteness through marketing deals and promotions which would make even david beckham seem like a media-shy hermit with no business sense .
there are no tie-ins , no plush toys flying off the shelves , no hordes of expectant children and insatiable paparazzi stampeding through the turnstiles .
for those zoos lacking star-quality , life is bleak .
the future is under-funded and the staff and animals suffer accordingly .
however , some animals - like those at erfurt zoo - suffer more than others .
for these poor creatures , their suffering was not caused by a reduction of enclosure space due to a budget cut or an enforced diet due to spiraling feed costs .
no , it came courtesy of those unscrupulous members of staff who , instead of looking after the beasts , were killing them and shipping their carcasses out the back door as meat .
while other establishments were relying on merchandise to boost income , the evil workers at erfurt were lining their own pockets with a grisly sideline in exotic animal flesh .
bambi steaks could be tip of meat iceberg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more buck for your buck : deer meat proved very popular apparently , the staff responsible had been turning petting zoo deer into venison as part of a clandestine business for a number of years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 19.07.2007 russia expels four british diplomats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an on-going row escalated as russia said it would no longer issue visas to british officials in a tit-for-tat action reminiscent of cold war politics , moscow told four british diplomats on thursday that they are no longer welcome to stay in russia .
the move comes after the uk expelled four russians monday . russian foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin on thursday said four british embassy staff in moscow are now persona non grata and they should leave the territory of the russian federation within 10 days . he did not identify the diplomats .
british ambassador to russia tony brenton said he was summoned to the russian foreign ministry and given " certain messages " to deliver to london .
" i met with deputy minister -lsb- alexander -rsb- grushko , and we of course discussed the litvinenko case , " the interfax news agency reported brenton as saying .
" he gave me several notices for me to pass on to london . "
brenton would not comment on the messages ' contents , the russian agency reported .
britain has been waiting for the " appropriate response " russia promised to deliver after four russian diplomats were expelled on monday .
the diplomatic clash began last week when russia refused to extradite andrei lugovoi , a suspect in the murder of kremlin critic and former kgb agent alexander litvinenko .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kamynin said russia 's move was the minimum necessary according to the british public prosecutor , ex-kgb officer lugovoi is said to have killed litvinenko by poisoning him with radioactive polonium-210 in november 2006 .
lugovoi has denied involvement in the case .
russia , however , rejected european union assertions that moscow had not cooperated with british authorities in the litvinenko case .
russia 's eu envoy vladimir chizhov told interfax that while british investigators were quickly given permission to travel to russia as part of their probe , russian authorities were prevented from entering britain for some time . mikhail kamynin said earlier that diplomatic sanctions announced by britain earlier this week would have " the most serious consequences " for relations between moscow and london . " the position towards russia taken by the new labour government of great britain is based on anything but common sense or pragmatism and respect of law , which is so typical of real britons , " kamynin added on thursday .
russia was also going to stop issuing visas to british officials , kamynin said , adding that shared security and terrorism efforts would also be affected .
" to our regret , cooperation between russia and britain on issues of fighting terrorism becomes impossible , " he said , describing russia 's response as " targeted , balanced and the minimum necessary . " the british foreign office had earlier said that no retaliation by russia would be justified , and officials from both countries , however , said on tuesday that the current row , which the russian pressed has termed a " diplomatic war " would not affect economic ties . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" girls out-perform boys at school and more women enter the labor market with a university degree than men , but a pay gap of 15 percent persists , " vladimir spidla , european commissioner for employment and social affairs said wednesday .
" this is an absurd situation and needs to change . " the czech commissioner said the " uneven division of duties in families " was partially responsible for the gap .
spidla was considering mandatory paternity leave as a way of promoting equality at home and the workplace , the associated press reported , citing anonymous commission sources . " it is not possible to reduce the gender pay gap if -lsb- men -rsb- do not help out more at home , " spindla said at a press conference , adding that eu statistics show men , regardless of whether employed full or part-time , do less work at home than women . germany among worst offenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german women earn an average of 22 percent less than male coworkers as a way of promoting paternity leave , germany instituted a new system in january that allows parents to take home 14 instead of 12 months worth of benefits if they both divide the time away from their workplaces .
the extra two months have earned the name " father months " as the most common division sees mothers taking 12 months of leave and father two . women in germany earn an average of 22 percent less than similarly qualified men , according to an eu study .
in the 27-member bloc only cyprus , estonia and slovakia have larger gender pay gaps than germany . " the fact that women in many fields of employment are still paid less than men for the same work is scandalous , " johannes singhammer , the christian social union 's spokesman for women 's issues , said in a statement . laws need to be applied he said germany already has sufficient laws to avoid such a gap , but that they " were obviously not being implemented as we would like . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it would n't kill men to do more work in the house as well plugging the pay gap should be an integral part of governments ' employment policies and that pressure must also be put on employers to ensure there is no discrimination against women , spidla said . " the pay gap is a complex issue with multiple causes , " he said .
" sometimes we see pure discrimination .
but often reasons are hidden .
women do more unpaid work , like taking care of the household and dependants . " different value for same work the commissioner also pointed out that women did more part-time work and said that women-dominated jobs and sectors were on a lower pay scale . a commission report , which showed the pay gap in europe had not decreased in over a decade , said a main cause of discrimination was that women 's competences were less valued then men 's . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite equally long training , nurses are often paid less than police as a result , jobs requiring similar qualifications or experience tended to be paid less when they were dominated by women than by men . " for example , in some countries nannies earn less than car mechanics , supermarket cashiers less than warehouse workers , nurses less than the police , " said the commission . seniority-based pay slammed the eu executive said that the pay gap also reflected inequalities in the labor market , especially the difficulties in reconciling work with private life . women with part-time jobs and those who took frequent career breaks because of children were less likely to hold managerial positions and encounter more obstacles and resistance as they proceed along their career paths , the commission report said . " as a consequence , women 's career paths are more often interrupted , slower and shorter , and hence less well paid than men 's , " it said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" girls out-perform boys at school and more women enter the labor market with a university degree than men , but a pay gap of 15 percent persists , " vladimir spidla , european commissioner for employment and social affairs said wednesday .
" this is an absurd situation and needs to change . " the czech commissioner said the " uneven division of duties in families " was partially responsible for the gap .
spidla was considering mandatory paternity leave as a way of promoting equality at home and the workplace , the associated press reported , citing anonymous commission sources . " it is not possible to reduce the gender pay gap if -lsb- men -rsb- do not help out more at home , " spindla said at a press conference , adding that eu statistics show men , regardless of whether employed full or part-time , do less work at home than women . germany among worst offenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german women earn an average of 22 percent less than male coworkers as a way of promoting paternity leave , germany instituted a new system in january that allows parents to take home 14 instead of 12 months worth of benefits if they both divide the time away from their workplaces .
the extra two months have earned the name " father months " as the most common division sees mothers taking 12 months of leave and father two . women in germany earn an average of 22 percent less than similarly qualified men , according to an eu study .
in the 27-member bloc only cyprus , estonia and slovakia have larger gender pay gaps than germany . " the fact that women in many fields of employment are still paid less than men for the same work is scandalous , " johannes singhammer , the christian social union 's spokesman for women 's issues , said in a statement . laws need to be applied he said germany already has sufficient laws to avoid such a gap , but that they " were obviously not being implemented as we would like . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it would n't kill men to do more work in the house as well plugging the pay gap should be an integral part of governments ' employment policies and that pressure must also be put on employers to ensure there is no discrimination against women , spidla said . " the pay gap is a complex issue with multiple causes , " he said .
" sometimes we see pure discrimination .
but often reasons are hidden .
women do more unpaid work , like taking care of the household and dependants . " different value for same work the commissioner also pointed out that women did more part-time work and said that women-dominated jobs and sectors were on a lower pay scale . a commission report , which showed the pay gap in europe had not decreased in over a decade , said a main cause of discrimination was that women 's competences were less valued then men 's . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite equally long training , nurses are often paid less than police as a result , jobs requiring similar qualifications or experience tended to be paid less when they were dominated by women than by men .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 19.07.2007 eu wary of being dragged into britain-russia diplomatic row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is reluctant to take sides in the dispute between britain and russia despite a statement saying it was " disappointed " by russian failure to cooperate with the uk , the european union is staying firmly on the sidelines in the escalating diplomatic row between london and moscow . as relations between britain and russia reach the lowest point since the cold war , the european union stands to one side , unwilling to get involved in what could turn out to be one of the most serious diplomatic spats between east and west in over a decade .
britain expelled four russian diplomats on monday after russia refused to extradite andrei lugovoi , a suspect in the murder of kremlin critic and former kgb agent alexander litvinenko , who was poisoned with radioactive material in london last november .
shortly after the expulsion , british diplomats turned to the eu for support - and came up against a wall of indifference in most cases .
the british foreign office had looked towards the portuguese eu presidency for a statement of support on monday but by wednesday there had still not been an adequate response .
by wednesday evening , portuguese prime minister jose socrates had still not been able to extract enough support for the british stance from other eu leaders .
eventual eu statement lacks weight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis amado delivered the eu 's lukewarm response a statement eventually materialized thursday , but portuguese foreign minister luis amado 's assertion that the diplomatic row was " disappointing " and " a bilateral issue " between britain and russia hardly threw the bloc 's weight behind the brits .
the statement by the portuguese did however say the issue " raises important questions of common interest to eu member states , " adding that litvinenko 's murder was " a grave and reckless crime . "
surprisingly , given their level of animosity over issues both serious and trivial throughout history , the french were the most vocal when it came to supporting british prime minister gordon brown 's decision to throw the russians out .

the british foreign office had looked towards the portuguese eu presidency for a statement of support on monday but by wednesday there had still not been an adequate response .
by wednesday evening , portuguese prime minister jose socrates had still not been able to extract enough support for the british stance from other eu leaders .
eventual eu statement lacks weight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis amado delivered the eu 's lukewarm response a statement eventually materialized thursday , but portuguese foreign minister luis amado 's assertion that the diplomatic row was " disappointing " and " a bilateral issue " between britain and russia hardly threw the bloc 's weight behind the brits .
the statement by the portuguese did however say the issue " raises important questions of common interest to eu member states , " adding that litvinenko 's murder was " a grave and reckless crime . "
surprisingly , given their level of animosity over issues both serious and trivial throughout history , the french were the most vocal when it came to supporting british prime minister gordon brown 's decision to throw the russians out .
" the murder of a british national on his home soil , using a substance that put at risk the lives of thousands of others is a particularly serious matter , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
" given the gravity of the matter , we stand alongside the united kingdom in its concern that justice be done .
" we call on moscow to respond to the demands of british justice in a constructive manner ... so that the perpetrators of this crime are brought to justice and punished , " he added .
russia promptly responded on thursday by expelling four british diplomats from moscow , in what alexander grushkov , russia 's deputy foreign minister , said was a " targeted and appropriate " response .
" britain appeals for eu solidarity , " grushkov said in his statement .
" we hope that common sense will prevail within the eu and that its members will not give in to attempts to turn relations between russia and the eu into a tool to achieve unilateral political goals .
these have nothing in common with eu and russia 's real partnership interests . "
germany says britain " overreacted " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown wanted merkel 's support ; he did n't get it germany was one of the many other eu nations which viewed the situation from a distance .
despite prime minister brown 's visit in person to berlin to press chancellor angela merkel for her support , germany remained firmly on the fence but did say that it thought britain had " overreacted " by expelling the four russian diplomats and freezing bilateral negotiations on visas .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will meet in berlin on friday to discuss the diplomatic row .
german foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said the meeting would involve " brief but intensive talks " .
steinmeier on wednesday had expressed his hope that the row would not be allowed to escalate into " a crisis . "
in terms of relations with russia , germany is the main player in the european union and therefore has the most to lose from coming down on the side of the brits .
russia considers germany to be its most important economic partner in the eu and the statistics on trade between the two nations confirms this view .
trade between the two countries increased by almost 40 percent in 2006 while german exports to russia went up by 35 percent .
germany and russia are also driving europe 's energy agenda and if the bloc is to secure its supply from the east , then relations between the two sides have to be good .
russia warns eu to stay out of row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia has a lot of leverage over the eu russia for its part has warned the eu to stay out of the row and vladimir chizhov , russia 's eu representative in brussels called the eu presidency 's lukewarm statement on wednesday " an unpleasant surprise for us . "
despite the lack of any real commitment on europe 's part , chizhov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency that the eu statement would " affect relations between the eu and russia . "
while disappointed by europe 's relatively non-committal stance in the row , british foreign minister david miliband is unlikely to give up trying to garner support .
he is expected to lobby his eu counterparts at the next eu foreign minister meeting in brussels on monday but observers believe that unless russia reacts again , and more strongly this time , the eu will continue to sit out the row on the sidelines . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

polls predict a new victory of the governing ak party , but the parliament 's composition is the issue that 's really suspenseful : will it still be made up of two factions that get beyond the 10-percent hurdle or will the nationalistic mhp also manage to get in ?
i think that 's the real question and i 'm somewhat worried when it comes to the latter party . premier erdogan has said that he will bid farewell to politics if he does n't win the election .
what do you think about this statement ? it 's a sign of great confidence , because erdogan wants to do everything except bid farewell to politics .
he 's certain that he 'll remain , because he counts on winning the election . as the chairman of the foreign affairs committee in parliament , you 're dealing with turkey a lot and you 're an expert on turkey .
does turkey still have a chance to move towards europe , especially considering that the reforms have virtually come to a standstill ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan wants to bring his country into the eu i think that also depends a bit on the internal difficulties during the pre-election campaign .
i hope that turkish voters will bring about a straightforward situation in parliament .
turkey definitely needs a government that 's capable of acting and is backed by a large majority in parliament .
it 's written nowhere that the reform process can not continue .
people just have to want it .
i 'm convinced that erdogan wants to continue on the way to europe .
he has to overcome resistance .
opinion polls in turkey have become skeptical .
maybe there 's also more skepticism in his own party that he has to deal with , but i think that he 's right to connect the economic upswing turkey has experienced under his government with the route to europe .
it 's certainly the right conclusion to draw . germany and several other states have concerns when it comes to full eu membership for turkey .
do you think that turkey could be convinced to accept a privileged partnership after all ? i do n't think that 's a question that needs to be answered today or tomorrow .
the eu has made a clear decision to initiate accession negotiations .
it was noted , however , that the outcome can not be predicted .
the negotiations are happening with an open end , but with the goal of membership .
it 's clear that full membership requires turkey to fulfill all criteria not only on paper but also in practice .
we know that there 's still a long way to go in some respects .
on the other hand , we 've seen in the case of the cyprus question that turkey struggles with this .
you can not join a club if you do n't recognize a club member .
these are questions that turkey needs to face in the coming years .
but they can be solved in principle . baha güngör , the head of dw-radio 's turkish service , interviewed ruprecht polenz -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

polls predict a new victory of the governing ak party , but the parliament 's composition is the issue that 's really suspenseful : will it still be made up of two factions that get beyond the 10-percent hurdle or will the nationalistic mhp also manage to get in ?
i think that 's the real question and i 'm somewhat worried when it comes to the latter party . premier erdogan has said that he will bid farewell to politics if he does n't win the election .
what do you think about this statement ? it 's a sign of great confidence , because erdogan wants to do everything except bid farewell to politics .
he 's certain that he 'll remain , because he counts on winning the election . as the chairman of the foreign affairs committee in parliament , you 're dealing with turkey a lot and you 're an expert on turkey .
does turkey still have a chance to move towards europe , especially considering that the reforms have virtually come to a standstill ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan wants to bring his country into the eu i think that also depends a bit on the internal difficulties during the pre-election campaign .
i hope that turkish voters will bring about a straightforward situation in parliament .
turkey definitely needs a government that 's capable of acting and is backed by a large majority in parliament .
it 's written nowhere that the reform process can not continue .
people just have to want it .
i 'm convinced that erdogan wants to continue on the way to europe .
he has to overcome resistance .
opinion polls in turkey have become skeptical .
maybe there 's also more skepticism in his own party that he has to deal with , but i think that he 's right to connect the economic upswing turkey has experienced under his government with the route to europe .
it 's certainly the right conclusion to draw . germany and several other states have concerns when it comes to full eu membership for turkey .
do you think that turkey could be convinced to accept a privileged partnership after all ? i do n't think that 's a question that needs to be answered today or tomorrow .
the eu has made a clear decision to initiate accession negotiations .
it was noted , however , that the outcome can not be predicted .
the negotiations are happening with an open end , but with the goal of membership .
it 's clear that full membership requires turkey to fulfill all criteria not only on paper but also in practice .
we know that there 's still a long way to go in some respects .
on the other hand , we 've seen in the case of the cyprus question that turkey struggles with this .
you can not join a club if you do n't recognize a club member .
these are questions that turkey needs to face in the coming years .
but they can be solved in principle . baha güngör , the head of dw-radio 's turkish service , interviewed ruprecht polenz -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's coalition made up of the christian democrats and social democrats took office in november 2005 . the chancellor said the government was " looking at mechanisms ... both on a european and german level " to deal with the influence of the funds . " we have started a discussion that is still ongoing , " she said . politicians in germany have expressed fears in recent months that newly rich state corporate behemoths in russia and china could take over key industrial sectors in europe 's biggest economy . possible political power merkel added that it was possible that such investments could be used not just to attain high returns on capital but also as a lever to gain political influence . " we mus n't be naive , " she said .
" state-owned funds can also have politico-strategic aims in mind that could be problematic in sensitive areas . " she said she wanted a wide-ranging discussion on the issue , including drawing on the expertise of the business industry , which has long experience in dealing with foreign capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and french president sarkozy this week in toulouse merkel said she had recently spoken with french president nicolas sarkozy about the matter . the chancellor said she also favored discussions among the eu 's 27 members for a uniform definition of " strategic industries " which might be covered by such mechanisms . she stressed she did not want to block such funds , but favored the introduction of transparent control mechanisms like those in force in the united states . " a general ban is with certainty not the right answer , " said merkel , who warned two weeks ago that major german companies could possibly fall into the hands of hostile states through investments by foreign government-operated funds . easy prey for takeovers german finance minister peer steinbrück recently commented in similar fashion , saying that berlin was considering ways of protecting domestic companies in key industries such as telecommunications , banking , postal services , logistics and energy from foreign investors . the growing power of investment funds has caused concern in germany because the relatively low market valuation of significant companies makes them relatively easy prey for takeovers . the funds are estimated to have more than 800 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.1 trillion -rrb- at their disposal .
this estimation does not include the substantial foreign currency reserves of middle eastern and east asian countries . china , for instance , has foreign currency reserves of about $ 1.2 trillion dollars , some of which has been earmarked to buy western companies . however , last month , bert rürup , a top economic adviser to the german government said he opposed introducing new forms of protectionism to stop foreign countries wielding excessive influence over domestic companies . " i do not think much of sealing off the german capital market , " rürup told the handelsblatt newspaper . cashing in on economic upturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany economy on its way up merkel said her government would do everything in its power to prolong the economic upturn that germany is currently enjoying in order to ensure that more people reap its benefits . " the greater the upswing is , the more influence we will have in shaping the international framework that is necessary to ensure that our traditional market economy continues to prosper , " she said . germany has been experiencing a steady drop in unemployment and many economists now project german economic growth in 2007 to match or possibly surpass last year 's 2.8 percent . article compiled from wire reports -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one can not really imagine that doping is restricted to cycling , " dagmar reim said . uwe schulz , manager of association of german cycle racing organizers , said cutting funds and stopping coverage of events where many innocent athletes also compete " is not an effective way to fight against doping in sports .

" no one is served by making hasty conclusions , " he said , adding that meetings with the team 's riders , coaches and management would take place after the race 's conclusion . gerolsteiner , a german beverage company that sponsors another tour de france team , also said it would wait until august to decide whether to continue sponsoring cycling , chief spokesperson stefan göbel said . tour punished for investigating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrik sinkewitz has already returned to germany the tour de france 's parent company , amaury sports organization , said the german broadcasters were placing blame at the wrong people 's feet , according to company ceo patrice clerc .

he has been suspended pending the results of a second blood test and is already back in germany after dropping out of the tour sunday due to a collision with a spectator , if sinkewitz 's second blood sample also comes back positive , t-mobile team boss bob stapleton said he would fire the rider immediately .

the move comes after the uk expelled four russians monday . russian foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin on thursday said four british embassy staff in moscow are now persona non grata and they should leave the territory of the russian federation within 10 days . he did not identify the diplomats .
british ambassador to russia tony brenton said he was summoned to the russian foreign ministry and given " certain messages " to deliver to london .
" i met with deputy minister -lsb- alexander -rsb- grushko , and we of course discussed the litvinenko case , " the interfax news agency reported brenton as saying .
" he gave me several notices for me to pass on to london . "
brenton would not comment on the messages ' contents , the russian agency reported .
britain has been waiting for the " appropriate response " russia promised to deliver after four russian diplomats were expelled on monday .
the diplomatic clash began last week when russia refused to extradite andrei lugovoi , a suspect in the murder of kremlin critic and former kgb agent alexander litvinenko .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kamynin said russia 's move was the minimum necessary according to the british public prosecutor , ex-kgb officer lugovoi is said to have killed litvinenko by poisoning him with radioactive polonium-210 in november 2006 .
lugovoi has denied involvement in the case .
russia , however , rejected european union assertions that moscow had not cooperated with british authorities in the litvinenko case .
russia 's eu envoy vladimir chizhov told interfax that while british investigators were quickly given permission to travel to russia as part of their probe , russian authorities were prevented from entering britain for some time . mikhail kamynin said earlier that diplomatic sanctions announced by britain earlier this week would have " the most serious consequences " for relations between moscow and london . " the position towards russia taken by the new labour government of great britain is based on anything but common sense or pragmatism and respect of law , which is so typical of real britons , " kamynin added on thursday .
russia was also going to stop issuing visas to british officials , kamynin said , adding that shared security and terrorism efforts would also be affected .
" to our regret , cooperation between russia and britain on issues of fighting terrorism becomes impossible , " he said , describing russia 's response as " targeted , balanced and the minimum necessary . " the british foreign office had earlier said that no retaliation by russia would be justified , and officials from both countries , however , said on tuesday that the current row , which the russian pressed has termed a " diplomatic war " would not affect economic ties . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one can not really imagine that doping is restricted to cycling , " dagmar reim said . uwe schulz , manager of association of german cycle racing organizers , said cutting funds and stopping coverage of events where many innocent athletes also compete " is not an effective way to fight against doping in sports . " private sponsors waiting till end of tour to make decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile and its predecessor telekom have featured prominently in the doping scandal t-mobile , which sponsor 's the team most directly involved in the doping allegations , would be reconsidering its sport sponsoring program at the next supervisory board meeting , deputy board chairman ado wilhelm told thursday 's daily süddeutsche zeitung . t-mobile communications director christian frommert , however , said german broadcasters - and the public - should wait for results from sinkewitz 's second blood test before passing judgment on the team . " no one is served by making hasty conclusions , " he said , adding that meetings with the team 's riders , coaches and management would take place after the race 's conclusion . gerolsteiner , a german beverage company that sponsors another tour de france team , also said it would wait until august to decide whether to continue sponsoring cycling , chief spokesperson stefan göbel said . tour punished for investigating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrik sinkewitz has already returned to germany the tour de france 's parent company , amaury sports organization , said the german broadcasters were placing blame at the wrong people 's feet , according to company ceo patrice clerc . " the tour de france is being sanctioned , but should we sanction an event that is actually doing its best to weed out drugs cheats ? "
clerc told reporters .
" cheats are being found , and german tv is playing the ' empty chair ' policy .
if we do n't look for banned substances , we wo n't find them . " a lot of sports do n't look for anything .
we 've decided to take another attitude , we 're fighting against doping - and we 're being sanctioned because cheats are being found !
maybe german tv expects us not to track them down . " the high cost of doping former head of germany 's cycling federation sylvia schenk , however , said broadcasters were right to interrupt their coverage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : less money could make athletes think twice before doping , schenk said " doping costs a lot of money , " she said in an interview with rbb on thursday .
" it 's money that sponsors and broadcasters bring to the sport .
obviously you have to take the money out to make people think and to take away the financial possibility to dope . " sinkewitz has denied accusations of using testosterone or other doping agents to enhance his performance .
he has been suspended pending the results of a second blood test and is already back in germany after dropping out of the tour sunday due to a collision with a spectator , if sinkewitz 's second blood sample also comes back positive , t-mobile team boss bob stapleton said he would fire the rider immediately .
the team dismissed jan ullrich shortly before the 2006 tour de france for his alleged involvement in a doping scandal , and other riders for t-mobile , including 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis and erik zabel , have admitted to doping . " our stance is that we encourage targeted testing , out of competition testing .
it 's consistent with our view that if you do n't do the right thing you get caught and suffer the consequences , " added stapleton .

merkel 's coalition made up of the christian democrats and social democrats took office in november 2005 . the chancellor said the government was " looking at mechanisms ... both on a european and german level " to deal with the influence of the funds . " we have started a discussion that is still ongoing , " she said . politicians in germany have expressed fears in recent months that newly rich state corporate behemoths in russia and china could take over key industrial sectors in europe 's biggest economy . possible political power merkel added that it was possible that such investments could be used not just to attain high returns on capital but also as a lever to gain political influence . " we mus n't be naive , " she said .
" state-owned funds can also have politico-strategic aims in mind that could be problematic in sensitive areas . " she said she wanted a wide-ranging discussion on the issue , including drawing on the expertise of the business industry , which has long experience in dealing with foreign capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and french president sarkozy this week in toulouse merkel said she had recently spoken with french president nicolas sarkozy about the matter . the chancellor said she also favored discussions among the eu 's 27 members for a uniform definition of " strategic industries " which might be covered by such mechanisms . she stressed she did not want to block such funds , but favored the introduction of transparent control mechanisms like those in force in the united states . " a general ban is with certainty not the right answer , " said merkel , who warned two weeks ago that major german companies could possibly fall into the hands of hostile states through investments by foreign government-operated funds . easy prey for takeovers german finance minister peer steinbrück recently commented in similar fashion , saying that berlin was considering ways of protecting domestic companies in key industries such as telecommunications , banking , postal services , logistics and energy from foreign investors . the growing power of investment funds has caused concern in germany because the relatively low market valuation of significant companies makes them relatively easy prey for takeovers . the funds are estimated to have more than 800 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.1 trillion -rrb- at their disposal .
this estimation does not include the substantial foreign currency reserves of middle eastern and east asian countries . china , for instance , has foreign currency reserves of about $ 1.2 trillion dollars , some of which has been earmarked to buy western companies . however , last month , bert rürup , a top economic adviser to the german government said he opposed introducing new forms of protectionism to stop foreign countries wielding excessive influence over domestic companies . " i do not think much of sealing off the german capital market , " rürup told the handelsblatt newspaper . cashing in on economic upturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany economy on its way up merkel said her government would do everything in its power to prolong the economic upturn that germany is currently enjoying in order to ensure that more people reap its benefits . " the greater the upswing is , the more influence we will have in shaping the international framework that is necessary to ensure that our traditional market economy continues to prosper , " she said . germany has been experiencing a steady drop in unemployment and many economists now project german economic growth in 2007 to match or possibly surpass last year 's 2.8 percent . article compiled from wire reports -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's coalition made up of the christian democrats and social democrats took office in november 2005 . the chancellor said the government was " looking at mechanisms ... both on a european and german level " to deal with the influence of the funds . " we have started a discussion that is still ongoing , " she said . politicians in germany have expressed fears in recent months that newly rich state corporate behemoths in russia and china could take over key industrial sectors in europe 's biggest economy . possible political power merkel added that it was possible that such investments could be used not just to attain high returns on capital but also as a lever to gain political influence . " we mus n't be naive , " she said .
" state-owned funds can also have politico-strategic aims in mind that could be problematic in sensitive areas . " she said she wanted a wide-ranging discussion on the issue , including drawing on the expertise of the business industry , which has long experience in dealing with foreign capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and french president sarkozy this week in toulouse merkel said she had recently spoken with french president nicolas sarkozy about the matter . the chancellor said she also favored discussions among the eu 's 27 members for a uniform definition of " strategic industries " which might be covered by such mechanisms . she stressed she did not want to block such funds , but favored the introduction of transparent control mechanisms like those in force in the united states . " a general ban is with certainty not the right answer , " said merkel , who warned two weeks ago that major german companies could possibly fall into the hands of hostile states through investments by foreign government-operated funds . easy prey for takeovers german finance minister peer steinbrück recently commented in similar fashion , saying that berlin was considering ways of protecting domestic companies in key industries such as telecommunications , banking , postal services , logistics and energy from foreign investors . the growing power of investment funds has caused concern in germany because the relatively low market valuation of significant companies makes them relatively easy prey for takeovers . the funds are estimated to have more than 800 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.1 trillion -rrb- at their disposal .
this estimation does not include the substantial foreign currency reserves of middle eastern and east asian countries . china , for instance , has foreign currency reserves of about $ 1.2 trillion dollars , some of which has been earmarked to buy western companies . however , last month , bert rürup , a top economic adviser to the german government said he opposed introducing new forms of protectionism to stop foreign countries wielding excessive influence over domestic companies . " i do not think much of sealing off the german capital market , " rürup told the handelsblatt newspaper . cashing in on economic upturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany economy on its way up merkel said her government would do everything in its power to prolong the economic upturn that germany is currently enjoying in order to ensure that more people reap its benefits . " the greater the upswing is , the more influence we will have in shaping the international framework that is necessary to ensure that our traditional market economy continues to prosper , " she said . germany has been experiencing a steady drop in unemployment and many economists now project german economic growth in 2007 to match or possibly surpass last year 's 2.8 percent . article compiled from wire reports -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two germans and several afghans were allegedly abducted by taliban fighters in central afghanistan .
german and afghan officials are working to find out more about the hostages and the kidnappers . the group was traveling on the highway that connects the capital kabul with the southern city of kandahar when armed taliban fighters stopped the car and kidnapped them .

while some officials said that taliban fighters must have been involved , a taliban spokesman , zabihullah mujahid , told afp via phone from an unknown location that he could not confirm this .
un spokesman adrian edwards in kabul meanwhile denied that the germans had been working for the world organization .
germans targeted the kidnapping comes less than a month after a german and his afghan translator were kidnapped in southwestern afghanistan and released unharmed about a week later .

if we do n't look for banned substances , we wo n't find them . " a lot of sports do n't look for anything .
we 've decided to take another attitude , we 're fighting against doping - and we 're being sanctioned because cheats are being found !
maybe german tv expects us not to track them down . " the high cost of doping former head of germany 's cycling federation sylvia schenk , however , said broadcasters were right to interrupt their coverage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : less money could make athletes think twice before doping , schenk said " doping costs a lot of money , " she said in an interview with rbb on thursday .
" it 's money that sponsors and broadcasters bring to the sport .
obviously you have to take the money out to make people think and to take away the financial possibility to dope . " sinkewitz has denied accusations of using testosterone or other doping agents to enhance his performance .
he has been suspended pending the results of a second blood test and is already back in germany after dropping out of the tour sunday due to a collision with a spectator , if sinkewitz 's second blood sample also comes back positive , t-mobile team boss bob stapleton said he would fire the rider immediately .
the team dismissed jan ullrich shortly before the 2006 tour de france for his alleged involvement in a doping scandal , and other riders for t-mobile , including 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis and erik zabel , have admitted to doping . " our stance is that we encourage targeted testing , out of competition testing .
it 's consistent with our view that if you do n't do the right thing you get caught and suffer the consequences , " added stapleton .

" girls out-perform boys at school and more women enter the labor market with a university degree than men , but a pay gap of 15 percent persists , " vladimir spidla , european commissioner for employment and social affairs said wednesday .
" this is an absurd situation and needs to change . " the czech commissioner said the " uneven division of duties in families " was partially responsible for the gap .
spidla was considering mandatory paternity leave as a way of promoting equality at home and the workplace , the associated press reported , citing anonymous commission sources . " it is not possible to reduce the gender pay gap if -lsb- men -rsb- do not help out more at home , " spindla said at a press conference , adding that eu statistics show men , regardless of whether employed full or part-time , do less work at home than women . germany among worst offenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german women earn an average of 22 percent less than male coworkers as a way of promoting paternity leave , germany instituted a new system in january that allows parents to take home 14 instead of 12 months worth of benefits if they both divide the time away from their workplaces .
the extra two months have earned the name " father months " as the most common division sees mothers taking 12 months of leave and father two . women in germany earn an average of 22 percent less than similarly qualified men , according to an eu study .
in the 27-member bloc only cyprus , estonia and slovakia have larger gender pay gaps than germany . " the fact that women in many fields of employment are still paid less than men for the same work is scandalous , " johannes singhammer , the christian social union 's spokesman for women 's issues , said in a statement . laws need to be applied he said germany already has sufficient laws to avoid such a gap , but that they " were obviously not being implemented as we would like . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it would n't kill men to do more work in the house as well plugging the pay gap should be an integral part of governments ' employment policies and that pressure must also be put on employers to ensure there is no discrimination against women , spidla said . " the pay gap is a complex issue with multiple causes , " he said .
" sometimes we see pure discrimination .
but often reasons are hidden .
women do more unpaid work , like taking care of the household and dependants . " different value for same work the commissioner also pointed out that women did more part-time work and said that women-dominated jobs and sectors were on a lower pay scale . a commission report , which showed the pay gap in europe had not decreased in over a decade , said a main cause of discrimination was that women 's competences were less valued then men 's . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite equally long training , nurses are often paid less than police as a result , jobs requiring similar qualifications or experience tended to be paid less when they were dominated by women than by men . " for example , in some countries nannies earn less than car mechanics , supermarket cashiers less than warehouse workers , nurses less than the police , " said the commission . seniority-based pay slammed the eu executive said that the pay gap also reflected inequalities in the labor market , especially the difficulties in reconciling work with private life . women with part-time jobs and those who took frequent career breaks because of children were less likely to hold managerial positions and encounter more obstacles and resistance as they proceed along their career paths , the commission report said . " as a consequence , women 's career paths are more often interrupted , slower and shorter , and hence less well paid than men 's , " it said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" girls out-perform boys at school and more women enter the labor market with a university degree than men , but a pay gap of 15 percent persists , " vladimir spidla , european commissioner for employment and social affairs said wednesday .
" this is an absurd situation and needs to change . " the czech commissioner said the " uneven division of duties in families " was partially responsible for the gap .
spidla was considering mandatory paternity leave as a way of promoting equality at home and the workplace , the associated press reported , citing anonymous commission sources . " it is not possible to reduce the gender pay gap if -lsb- men -rsb- do not help out more at home , " spindla said at a press conference , adding that eu statistics show men , regardless of whether employed full or part-time , do less work at home than women . germany among worst offenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german women earn an average of 22 percent less than male coworkers as a way of promoting paternity leave , germany instituted a new system in january that allows parents to take home 14 instead of 12 months worth of benefits if they both divide the time away from their workplaces .
the extra two months have earned the name " father months " as the most common division sees mothers taking 12 months of leave and father two . women in germany earn an average of 22 percent less than similarly qualified men , according to an eu study .
in the 27-member bloc only cyprus , estonia and slovakia have larger gender pay gaps than germany . " the fact that women in many fields of employment are still paid less than men for the same work is scandalous , " johannes singhammer , the christian social union 's spokesman for women 's issues , said in a statement . laws need to be applied he said germany already has sufficient laws to avoid such a gap , but that they " were obviously not being implemented as we would like . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it would n't kill men to do more work in the house as well plugging the pay gap should be an integral part of governments ' employment policies and that pressure must also be put on employers to ensure there is no discrimination against women , spidla said . " the pay gap is a complex issue with multiple causes , " he said .
" sometimes we see pure discrimination .
but often reasons are hidden .
women do more unpaid work , like taking care of the household and dependants . " different value for same work the commissioner also pointed out that women did more part-time work and said that women-dominated jobs and sectors were on a lower pay scale . a commission report , which showed the pay gap in europe had not decreased in over a decade , said a main cause of discrimination was that women 's competences were less valued then men 's . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite equally long training , nurses are often paid less than police as a result , jobs requiring similar qualifications or experience tended to be paid less when they were dominated by women than by men . " for example , in some countries nannies earn less than car mechanics , supermarket cashiers less than warehouse workers , nurses less than the police , " said the commission . seniority-based pay slammed the eu executive said that the pay gap also reflected inequalities in the labor market , especially the difficulties in reconciling work with private life . women with part-time jobs and those who took frequent career breaks because of children were less likely to hold managerial positions and encounter more obstacles and resistance as they proceed along their career paths , the commission report said . " as a consequence , women 's career paths are more often interrupted , slower and shorter , and hence less well paid than men 's , " it said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's coalition made up of the christian democrats and social democrats took office in november 2005 . the chancellor said the government was " looking at mechanisms ... both on a european and german level " to deal with the influence of the funds . " we have started a discussion that is still ongoing , " she said . politicians in germany have expressed fears in recent months that newly rich state corporate behemoths in russia and china could take over key industrial sectors in europe 's biggest economy . possible political power merkel added that it was possible that such investments could be used not just to attain high returns on capital but also as a lever to gain political influence . " we mus n't be naive , " she said .
" state-owned funds can also have politico-strategic aims in mind that could be problematic in sensitive areas . " she said she wanted a wide-ranging discussion on the issue , including drawing on the expertise of the business industry , which has long experience in dealing with foreign capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and french president sarkozy this week in toulouse merkel said she had recently spoken with french president nicolas sarkozy about the matter . the chancellor said she also favored discussions among the eu 's 27 members for a uniform definition of " strategic industries " which might be covered by such mechanisms . she stressed she did not want to block such funds , but favored the introduction of transparent control mechanisms like those in force in the united states . " a general ban is with certainty not the right answer , " said merkel , who warned two weeks ago that major german companies could possibly fall into the hands of hostile states through investments by foreign government-operated funds . easy prey for takeovers german finance minister peer steinbrück recently commented in similar fashion , saying that berlin was considering ways of protecting domestic companies in key industries such as telecommunications , banking , postal services , logistics and energy from foreign investors . the growing power of investment funds has caused concern in germany because the relatively low market valuation of significant companies makes them relatively easy prey for takeovers . the funds are estimated to have more than 800 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.1 trillion -rrb- at their disposal .
this estimation does not include the substantial foreign currency reserves of middle eastern and east asian countries . china , for instance , has foreign currency reserves of about $ 1.2 trillion dollars , some of which has been earmarked to buy western companies . however , last month , bert rürup , a top economic adviser to the german government said he opposed introducing new forms of protectionism to stop foreign countries wielding excessive influence over domestic companies . " i do not think much of sealing off the german capital market , " rürup told the handelsblatt newspaper . cashing in on economic upturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany economy on its way up merkel said her government would do everything in its power to prolong the economic upturn that germany is currently enjoying in order to ensure that more people reap its benefits . " the greater the upswing is , the more influence we will have in shaping the international framework that is necessary to ensure that our traditional market economy continues to prosper , " she said . germany has been experiencing a steady drop in unemployment and many economists now project german economic growth in 2007 to match or possibly surpass last year 's 2.8 percent . article compiled from wire reports -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes after the uk expelled four russians monday . russian foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin on thursday said four british embassy staff in moscow are now persona non grata and they should leave the territory of the russian federation within 10 days . he did not identify the diplomats .
british ambassador to russia tony brenton said he was summoned to the russian foreign ministry and given " certain messages " to deliver to london .
" i met with deputy minister -lsb- alexander -rsb- grushko , and we of course discussed the litvinenko case , " the interfax news agency reported brenton as saying .
" he gave me several notices for me to pass on to london . "
brenton would not comment on the messages ' contents , the russian agency reported .
britain has been waiting for the " appropriate response " russia promised to deliver after four russian diplomats were expelled on monday .
the diplomatic clash began last week when russia refused to extradite andrei lugovoi , a suspect in the murder of kremlin critic and former kgb agent alexander litvinenko .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kamynin said russia 's move was the minimum necessary according to the british public prosecutor , ex-kgb officer lugovoi is said to have killed litvinenko by poisoning him with radioactive polonium-210 in november 2006 .
lugovoi has denied involvement in the case .
russia , however , rejected european union assertions that moscow had not cooperated with british authorities in the litvinenko case .
russia 's eu envoy vladimir chizhov told interfax that while british investigators were quickly given permission to travel to russia as part of their probe , russian authorities were prevented from entering britain for some time . mikhail kamynin said earlier that diplomatic sanctions announced by britain earlier this week would have " the most serious consequences " for relations between moscow and london . " the position towards russia taken by the new labour government of great britain is based on anything but common sense or pragmatism and respect of law , which is so typical of real britons , " kamynin added on thursday .
russia was also going to stop issuing visas to british officials , kamynin said , adding that shared security and terrorism efforts would also be affected .
" to our regret , cooperation between russia and britain on issues of fighting terrorism becomes impossible , " he said , describing russia 's response as " targeted , balanced and the minimum necessary . " the british foreign office had earlier said that no retaliation by russia would be justified , and officials from both countries , however , said on tuesday that the current row , which the russian pressed has termed a " diplomatic war " would not affect economic ties . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 19.07.2007 eu wary of being dragged into britain-russia diplomatic row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is reluctant to take sides in the dispute between britain and russia despite a statement saying it was " disappointed " by russian failure to cooperate with the uk , the european union is staying firmly on the sidelines in the escalating diplomatic row between london and moscow . as relations between britain and russia reach the lowest point since the cold war , the european union stands to one side , unwilling to get involved in what could turn out to be one of the most serious diplomatic spats between east and west in over a decade .
britain expelled four russian diplomats on monday after russia refused to extradite andrei lugovoi , a suspect in the murder of kremlin critic and former kgb agent alexander litvinenko , who was poisoned with radioactive material in london last november .
shortly after the expulsion , british diplomats turned to the eu for support - and came up against a wall of indifference in most cases .
the british foreign office had looked towards the portuguese eu presidency for a statement of support on monday but by wednesday there had still not been an adequate response .
by wednesday evening , portuguese prime minister jose socrates had still not been able to extract enough support for the british stance from other eu leaders .
eventual eu statement lacks weight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis amado delivered the eu 's lukewarm response a statement eventually materialized thursday , but portuguese foreign minister luis amado 's assertion that the diplomatic row was " disappointing " and " a bilateral issue " between britain and russia hardly threw the bloc 's weight behind the brits .
the statement by the portuguese did however say the issue " raises important questions of common interest to eu member states , " adding that litvinenko 's murder was " a grave and reckless crime . "
surprisingly , given their level of animosity over issues both serious and trivial throughout history , the french were the most vocal when it came to supporting british prime minister gordon brown 's decision to throw the russians out .
" the murder of a british national on his home soil , using a substance that put at risk the lives of thousands of others is a particularly serious matter , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
" given the gravity of the matter , we stand alongside the united kingdom in its concern that justice be done .
" we call on moscow to respond to the demands of british justice in a constructive manner ... so that the perpetrators of this crime are brought to justice and punished , " he added .
russia promptly responded on thursday by expelling four british diplomats from moscow , in what alexander grushkov , russia 's deputy foreign minister , said was a " targeted and appropriate " response .
" britain appeals for eu solidarity , " grushkov said in his statement .
" we hope that common sense will prevail within the eu and that its members will not give in to attempts to turn relations between russia and the eu into a tool to achieve unilateral political goals .
these have nothing in common with eu and russia 's real partnership interests . "
germany says britain " overreacted " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown wanted merkel 's support ; he did n't get it germany was one of the many other eu nations which viewed the situation from a distance .
despite prime minister brown 's visit in person to berlin to press chancellor angela merkel for her support , germany remained firmly on the fence but did say that it thought britain had " overreacted " by expelling the four russian diplomats and freezing bilateral negotiations on visas .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will meet in berlin on friday to discuss the diplomatic row .
german foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said the meeting would involve " brief but intensive talks " .
steinmeier on wednesday had expressed his hope that the row would not be allowed to escalate into " a crisis . "
in terms of relations with russia , germany is the main player in the european union and therefore has the most to lose from coming down on the side of the brits .
russia considers germany to be its most important economic partner in the eu and the statistics on trade between the two nations confirms this view .
trade between the two countries increased by almost 40 percent in 2006 while german exports to russia went up by 35 percent .
germany and russia are also driving europe 's energy agenda and if the bloc is to secure its supply from the east , then relations between the two sides have to be good .
russia warns eu to stay out of row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia has a lot of leverage over the eu russia for its part has warned the eu to stay out of the row and vladimir chizhov , russia 's eu representative in brussels called the eu presidency 's lukewarm statement on wednesday " an unpleasant surprise for us . "
despite the lack of any real commitment on europe 's part , chizhov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency that the eu statement would " affect relations between the eu and russia . "
while disappointed by europe 's relatively non-committal stance in the row , british foreign minister david miliband is unlikely to give up trying to garner support .
he is expected to lobby his eu counterparts at the next eu foreign minister meeting in brussels on monday but observers believe that unless russia reacts again , and more strongly this time , the eu will continue to sit out the row on the sidelines . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's coalition made up of the christian democrats and social democrats took office in november 2005 . the chancellor said the government was " looking at mechanisms ... both on a european and german level " to deal with the influence of the funds . " we have started a discussion that is still ongoing , " she said . politicians in germany have expressed fears in recent months that newly rich state corporate behemoths in russia and china could take over key industrial sectors in europe 's biggest economy . possible political power merkel added that it was possible that such investments could be used not just to attain high returns on capital but also as a lever to gain political influence . " we mus n't be naive , " she said .

" public funds are being more than just questioned , " said peter danckert , head of the german parliament 's sports committee .
" that applies to cycling in general and for other types of sports as well . " germany two largest publicly funded broadcasters , which have the german rights to live tour de france broadcasts , stopped their coverage of the event wednesday . in a joint statement ard and zdf said they would not be resuming their coverage of the tour " until clarification of the patrik sinkewitz case . "
about a million germans are estimated to have been following the competition live on tv . " it 's a warning to cycling and to every other sport , " zdf chief producer nikolaus brender said . does scandal extend beyond cycling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if doping is prevalent only in cycling meanwhile , the director of rundfunk berlin-brandenburg -lrb- rbb -rrb- said that there could be implications for other sports after the decision taken by the ard and zdf . " these decisions could also follow suit for other sports .
one can not really imagine that doping is restricted to cycling , " dagmar reim said . uwe schulz , manager of association of german cycle racing organizers , said cutting funds and stopping coverage of events where many innocent athletes also compete " is not an effective way to fight against doping in sports . " private sponsors waiting till end of tour to make decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile and its predecessor telekom have featured prominently in the doping scandal t-mobile , which sponsor 's the team most directly involved in the doping allegations , would be reconsidering its sport sponsoring program at the next supervisory board meeting , deputy board chairman ado wilhelm told thursday 's daily süddeutsche zeitung . t-mobile communications director christian frommert , however , said german broadcasters - and the public - should wait for results from sinkewitz 's second blood test before passing judgment on the team . " no one is served by making hasty conclusions , " he said , adding that meetings with the team 's riders , coaches and management would take place after the race 's conclusion . gerolsteiner , a german beverage company that sponsors another tour de france team , also said it would wait until august to decide whether to continue sponsoring cycling , chief spokesperson stefan göbel said . tour punished for investigating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrik sinkewitz has already returned to germany the tour de france 's parent company , amaury sports organization , said the german broadcasters were placing blame at the wrong people 's feet , according to company ceo patrice clerc . " the tour de france is being sanctioned , but should we sanction an event that is actually doing its best to weed out drugs cheats ? "
clerc told reporters .
" cheats are being found , and german tv is playing the ' empty chair ' policy .
if we do n't look for banned substances , we wo n't find them . " a lot of sports do n't look for anything .
we 've decided to take another attitude , we 're fighting against doping - and we 're being sanctioned because cheats are being found !
maybe german tv expects us not to track them down . " the high cost of doping former head of germany 's cycling federation sylvia schenk , however , said broadcasters were right to interrupt their coverage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : less money could make athletes think twice before doping , schenk said " doping costs a lot of money , " she said in an interview with rbb on thursday .
" it 's money that sponsors and broadcasters bring to the sport .
obviously you have to take the money out to make people think and to take away the financial possibility to dope . " sinkewitz has denied accusations of using testosterone or other doping agents to enhance his performance .
he has been suspended pending the results of a second blood test and is already back in germany after dropping out of the tour sunday due to a collision with a spectator , if sinkewitz 's second blood sample also comes back positive , t-mobile team boss bob stapleton said he would fire the rider immediately .
the team dismissed jan ullrich shortly before the 2006 tour de france for his alleged involvement in a doping scandal , and other riders for t-mobile , including 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis and erik zabel , have admitted to doping . " our stance is that we encourage targeted testing , out of competition testing .
it 's consistent with our view that if you do n't do the right thing you get caught and suffer the consequences , " added stapleton .

" public funds are being more than just questioned , " said peter danckert , head of the german parliament 's sports committee .
" that applies to cycling in general and for other types of sports as well . " germany two largest publicly funded broadcasters , which have the german rights to live tour de france broadcasts , stopped their coverage of the event wednesday . in a joint statement ard and zdf said they would not be resuming their coverage of the tour " until clarification of the patrik sinkewitz case . "
about a million germans are estimated to have been following the competition live on tv . " it 's a warning to cycling and to every other sport , " zdf chief producer nikolaus brender said . does scandal extend beyond cycling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if doping is prevalent only in cycling meanwhile , the director of rundfunk berlin-brandenburg -lrb- rbb -rrb- said that there could be implications for other sports after the decision taken by the ard and zdf . " these decisions could also follow suit for other sports .
one can not really imagine that doping is restricted to cycling , " dagmar reim said . uwe schulz , manager of association of german cycle racing organizers , said cutting funds and stopping coverage of events where many innocent athletes also compete " is not an effective way to fight against doping in sports . " private sponsors waiting till end of tour to make decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile and its predecessor telekom have featured prominently in the doping scandal t-mobile , which sponsor 's the team most directly involved in the doping allegations , would be reconsidering its sport sponsoring program at the next supervisory board meeting , deputy board chairman ado wilhelm told thursday 's daily süddeutsche zeitung . t-mobile communications director christian frommert , however , said german broadcasters - and the public - should wait for results from sinkewitz 's second blood test before passing judgment on the team . " no one is served by making hasty conclusions , " he said , adding that meetings with the team 's riders , coaches and management would take place after the race 's conclusion . gerolsteiner , a german beverage company that sponsors another tour de france team , also said it would wait until august to decide whether to continue sponsoring cycling , chief spokesperson stefan göbel said . tour punished for investigating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrik sinkewitz has already returned to germany the tour de france 's parent company , amaury sports organization , said the german broadcasters were placing blame at the wrong people 's feet , according to company ceo patrice clerc . " the tour de france is being sanctioned , but should we sanction an event that is actually doing its best to weed out drugs cheats ? "
clerc told reporters .
" cheats are being found , and german tv is playing the ' empty chair ' policy .
if we do n't look for banned substances , we wo n't find them . " a lot of sports do n't look for anything .
we 've decided to take another attitude , we 're fighting against doping - and we 're being sanctioned because cheats are being found !
maybe german tv expects us not to track them down . " the high cost of doping former head of germany 's cycling federation sylvia schenk , however , said broadcasters were right to interrupt their coverage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : less money could make athletes think twice before doping , schenk said " doping costs a lot of money , " she said in an interview with rbb on thursday .
" it 's money that sponsors and broadcasters bring to the sport .
obviously you have to take the money out to make people think and to take away the financial possibility to dope . " sinkewitz has denied accusations of using testosterone or other doping agents to enhance his performance .
he has been suspended pending the results of a second blood test and is already back in germany after dropping out of the tour sunday due to a collision with a spectator , if sinkewitz 's second blood sample also comes back positive , t-mobile team boss bob stapleton said he would fire the rider immediately .
the team dismissed jan ullrich shortly before the 2006 tour de france for his alleged involvement in a doping scandal , and other riders for t-mobile , including 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis and erik zabel , have admitted to doping . " our stance is that we encourage targeted testing , out of competition testing .
it 's consistent with our view that if you do n't do the right thing you get caught and suffer the consequences , " added stapleton .
" when cycling cleans itself up , this kind of thing happens . " article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" girls out-perform boys at school and more women enter the labor market with a university degree than men , but a pay gap of 15 percent persists , " vladimir spidla , european commissioner for employment and social affairs said wednesday .
" this is an absurd situation and needs to change . " the czech commissioner said the " uneven division of duties in families " was partially responsible for the gap .
spidla was considering mandatory paternity leave as a way of promoting equality at home and the workplace , the associated press reported , citing anonymous commission sources . " it is not possible to reduce the gender pay gap if -lsb- men -rsb- do not help out more at home , " spindla said at a press conference , adding that eu statistics show men , regardless of whether employed full or part-time , do less work at home than women . germany among worst offenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german women earn an average of 22 percent less than male coworkers as a way of promoting paternity leave , germany instituted a new system in january that allows parents to take home 14 instead of 12 months worth of benefits if they both divide the time away from their workplaces .
the extra two months have earned the name " father months " as the most common division sees mothers taking 12 months of leave and father two . women in germany earn an average of 22 percent less than similarly qualified men , according to an eu study .
in the 27-member bloc only cyprus , estonia and slovakia have larger gender pay gaps than germany . " the fact that women in many fields of employment are still paid less than men for the same work is scandalous , " johannes singhammer , the christian social union 's spokesman for women 's issues , said in a statement . laws need to be applied he said germany already has sufficient laws to avoid such a gap , but that they " were obviously not being implemented as we would like .

the new agreement will provide the us department of homeland security -lrb- dhs -rrb- with 19 categories of data about european air travelers flying to the united states .
the dhs will be allowed to keep the information in its database for 15 years and share details with other law enforcement agencies under certain conditions .

that agreement , which was set to expire on july 31 , stirred unease among eu lawmakers amid concerns that civil liberties were being eroded in the fight against global terrorism .
the eu-wide concerns over data privacy led to the agreement being annulled by the european court of justice in luxembourg in may .
the eu and the us then reached an interim agreement as the eu warned that airlines would be vulnerable to privacy complaints if no replacement deal had been reached before the interim one expired .

the move comes after the uk expelled four russians monday . russian foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin on thursday said four british embassy staff in moscow are now persona non grata and they should leave the territory of the russian federation within 10 days . he did not identify the diplomats .
british ambassador to russia tony brenton said he was summoned to the russian foreign ministry and given " certain messages " to deliver to london .
" i met with deputy minister -lsb- alexander -rsb- grushko , and we of course discussed the litvinenko case , " the interfax news agency reported brenton as saying .

russia was also going to stop issuing visas to british officials , kamynin said , adding that shared security and terrorism efforts would also be affected .
" to our regret , cooperation between russia and britain on issues of fighting terrorism becomes impossible , " he said , describing russia 's response as " targeted , balanced and the minimum necessary .

the move comes after the uk expelled four russians monday . russian foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin on thursday said four british embassy staff in moscow are now persona non grata and they should leave the territory of the russian federation within 10 days . he did not identify the diplomats .
british ambassador to russia tony brenton said he was summoned to the russian foreign ministry and given " certain messages " to deliver to london .

it ended with a scandal , sackings and a criminal investigation into an illegal meat operation . some zoos are n't as lucky as the one in berlin .
most do n't have superstar polar bear cubs and the potential to exploit cuteness through marketing deals and promotions which would make even david beckham seem like a media-shy hermit with no business sense .
there are no tie-ins , no plush toys flying off the shelves , no hordes of expectant children and insatiable paparazzi stampeding through the turnstiles .
for those zoos lacking star-quality , life is bleak .
the future is under-funded and the staff and animals suffer accordingly .
however , some animals - like those at erfurt zoo - suffer more than others .
for these poor creatures , their suffering was not caused by a reduction of enclosure space due to a budget cut or an enforced diet due to spiraling feed costs .
no , it came courtesy of those unscrupulous members of staff who , instead of looking after the beasts , were killing them and shipping their carcasses out the back door as meat .
while other establishments were relying on merchandise to boost income , the evil workers at erfurt were lining their own pockets with a grisly sideline in exotic animal flesh .
bambi steaks could be tip of meat iceberg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more buck for your buck : deer meat proved very popular apparently , the staff responsible had been turning petting zoo deer into venison as part of a clandestine business for a number of years .
now it is feared that bambi steaks will turn out to be just one specialty on the macabre menu .
" we are worried this is only the tip of the iceberg , " said wolfgang apel , president of the german animal protection league , who also called for a thorough review of controls at the zoo and at all other institutions with animals in the eastern state of thuringia .
the secret meat trade was revealed after an anonymous zoo employee noticed that the number of animals was declining .
" it was high time something was done about it , " the whistleblower said , as quoted in a report in die zeit newspaper .
after hearing of the scandal , erfurt 's mayor filed charges against workers at the zoo and fired the zoo 's director .
" the case is now being handled by state prosecutors , " said a spokeswoman for the mayor 's office in a statement to the press , declining to give further details . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 19.07.2007 eu wary of being dragged into britain-russia diplomatic row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is reluctant to take sides in the dispute between britain and russia despite a statement saying it was " disappointed " by russian failure to cooperate with the uk , the european union is staying firmly on the sidelines in the escalating diplomatic row between london and moscow . as relations between britain and russia reach the lowest point since the cold war , the european union stands to one side , unwilling to get involved in what could turn out to be one of the most serious diplomatic spats between east and west in over a decade .
britain expelled four russian diplomats on monday after russia refused to extradite andrei lugovoi , a suspect in the murder of kremlin critic and former kgb agent alexander litvinenko , who was poisoned with radioactive material in london last november .
shortly after the expulsion , british diplomats turned to the eu for support - and came up against a wall of indifference in most cases .
the british foreign office had looked towards the portuguese eu presidency for a statement of support on monday but by wednesday there had still not been an adequate response .
by wednesday evening , portuguese prime minister jose socrates had still not been able to extract enough support for the british stance from other eu leaders .
eventual eu statement lacks weight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis amado delivered the eu 's lukewarm response a statement eventually materialized thursday , but portuguese foreign minister luis amado 's assertion that the diplomatic row was " disappointing " and " a bilateral issue " between britain and russia hardly threw the bloc 's weight behind the brits .
the statement by the portuguese did however say the issue " raises important questions of common interest to eu member states , " adding that litvinenko 's murder was " a grave and reckless crime . "
surprisingly , given their level of animosity over issues both serious and trivial throughout history , the french were the most vocal when it came to supporting british prime minister gordon brown 's decision to throw the russians out .
" the murder of a british national on his home soil , using a substance that put at risk the lives of thousands of others is a particularly serious matter , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
" given the gravity of the matter , we stand alongside the united kingdom in its concern that justice be done .
" we call on moscow to respond to the demands of british justice in a constructive manner ... so that the perpetrators of this crime are brought to justice and punished , " he added .
russia promptly responded on thursday by expelling four british diplomats from moscow , in what alexander grushkov , russia 's deputy foreign minister , said was a " targeted and appropriate " response .
" britain appeals for eu solidarity , " grushkov said in his statement .
" we hope that common sense will prevail within the eu and that its members will not give in to attempts to turn relations between russia and the eu into a tool to achieve unilateral political goals .
these have nothing in common with eu and russia 's real partnership interests . "
germany says britain " overreacted " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown wanted merkel 's support ; he did n't get it germany was one of the many other eu nations which viewed the situation from a distance .
despite prime minister brown 's visit in person to berlin to press chancellor angela merkel for her support , germany remained firmly on the fence but did say that it thought britain had " overreacted " by expelling the four russian diplomats and freezing bilateral negotiations on visas .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will meet in berlin on friday to discuss the diplomatic row .
german foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said the meeting would involve " brief but intensive talks " .
steinmeier on wednesday had expressed his hope that the row would not be allowed to escalate into " a crisis . "
in terms of relations with russia , germany is the main player in the european union and therefore has the most to lose from coming down on the side of the brits .
russia considers germany to be its most important economic partner in the eu and the statistics on trade between the two nations confirms this view .
trade between the two countries increased by almost 40 percent in 2006 while german exports to russia went up by 35 percent .
germany and russia are also driving europe 's energy agenda and if the bloc is to secure its supply from the east , then relations between the two sides have to be good .
russia warns eu to stay out of row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia has a lot of leverage over the eu russia for its part has warned the eu to stay out of the row and vladimir chizhov , russia 's eu representative in brussels called the eu presidency 's lukewarm statement on wednesday " an unpleasant surprise for us . "

britain expelled four russian diplomats on monday after russia refused to extradite andrei lugovoi , a suspect in the murder of kremlin critic and former kgb agent alexander litvinenko , who was poisoned with radioactive material in london last november .
shortly after the expulsion , british diplomats turned to the eu for support - and came up against a wall of indifference in most cases .
the british foreign office had looked towards the portuguese eu presidency for a statement of support on monday but by wednesday there had still not been an adequate response .
by wednesday evening , portuguese prime minister jose socrates had still not been able to extract enough support for the british stance from other eu leaders .
eventual eu statement lacks weight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis amado delivered the eu 's lukewarm response a statement eventually materialized thursday , but portuguese foreign minister luis amado 's assertion that the diplomatic row was " disappointing " and " a bilateral issue " between britain and russia hardly threw the bloc 's weight behind the brits .
the statement by the portuguese did however say the issue " raises important questions of common interest to eu member states , " adding that litvinenko 's murder was " a grave and reckless crime . "
surprisingly , given their level of animosity over issues both serious and trivial throughout history , the french were the most vocal when it came to supporting british prime minister gordon brown 's decision to throw the russians out .
" the murder of a british national on his home soil , using a substance that put at risk the lives of thousands of others is a particularly serious matter , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
" given the gravity of the matter , we stand alongside the united kingdom in its concern that justice be done .
" we call on moscow to respond to the demands of british justice in a constructive manner ... so that the perpetrators of this crime are brought to justice and punished , " he added .
russia promptly responded on thursday by expelling four british diplomats from moscow , in what alexander grushkov , russia 's deputy foreign minister , said was a " targeted and appropriate " response .
" britain appeals for eu solidarity , " grushkov said in his statement .
" we hope that common sense will prevail within the eu and that its members will not give in to attempts to turn relations between russia and the eu into a tool to achieve unilateral political goals .
these have nothing in common with eu and russia 's real partnership interests . "
germany says britain " overreacted " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown wanted merkel 's support ; he did n't get it germany was one of the many other eu nations which viewed the situation from a distance .
despite prime minister brown 's visit in person to berlin to press chancellor angela merkel for her support , germany remained firmly on the fence but did say that it thought britain had " overreacted " by expelling the four russian diplomats and freezing bilateral negotiations on visas .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will meet in berlin on friday to discuss the diplomatic row .
german foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said the meeting would involve " brief but intensive talks " .
steinmeier on wednesday had expressed his hope that the row would not be allowed to escalate into " a crisis . "
in terms of relations with russia , germany is the main player in the european union and therefore has the most to lose from coming down on the side of the brits .
russia considers germany to be its most important economic partner in the eu and the statistics on trade between the two nations confirms this view .
trade between the two countries increased by almost 40 percent in 2006 while german exports to russia went up by 35 percent .
germany and russia are also driving europe 's energy agenda and if the bloc is to secure its supply from the east , then relations between the two sides have to be good .

russia considers germany to be its most important economic partner in the eu and the statistics on trade between the two nations confirms this view .
trade between the two countries increased by almost 40 percent in 2006 while german exports to russia went up by 35 percent .
germany and russia are also driving europe 's energy agenda and if the bloc is to secure its supply from the east , then relations between the two sides have to be good .
russia warns eu to stay out of row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia has a lot of leverage over the eu russia for its part has warned the eu to stay out of the row and vladimir chizhov , russia 's eu representative in brussels called the eu presidency 's lukewarm statement on wednesday " an unpleasant surprise for us . "
despite the lack of any real commitment on europe 's part , chizhov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency that the eu statement would " affect relations between the eu and russia . "
while disappointed by europe 's relatively non-committal stance in the row , british foreign minister david miliband is unlikely to give up trying to garner support .
he is expected to lobby his eu counterparts at the next eu foreign minister meeting in brussels on monday but observers believe that unless russia reacts again , and more strongly this time , the eu will continue to sit out the row on the sidelines . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now it offers visitors a chance to venture into the middle ages .
when you go , be sure to look for the stone face pictured below . " location , location , location " is nothing new - and the 12th century builders of eltz castle picked a good one . perched high up on a rock crag within a green valley , eltz castle is surrounded not only by hills on all sides , but the eltzbach river makes a hairpin turn just around the mansion 's rocky nest , encompassing it on three sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castle is well located and was never destroyed this triple protection is one of the reasons the mansion was never destroyed . it also makes it a challenge for visitors to get there today .
it 's best to come by car and be prepared for a steep but short walk to the castle grounds . the eltz family was n't only thinking about safety , they also had money in mind when constructing their residence over 800 years ago .
the castle is situated between the moselle river , one of the most important trade routes in the german empire , and the fertile eifel and maifeld regions . royal condo construction on the castle stretched over 500 years and many generations , which explains the spectrum of romanesque to early baroque styles that can be found there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tours begin in the inner courtyard after the eltz family split into separate clans in 1268 in order to avoid an inheritance feud , the residence was inhabited by several family lines simultaneously - like a kind of giant medieval condominium .

a 17th century french tapestry and a 60-pound suit of armor await visitors in what used to by the meeting room . lucas cranach , the elder 's " madonna with child and grapes " can be seen in the rübenach hall .
used as a living room , the hall also boasts a high-tech gothic fireplace , which was capable of heating two rooms at once , even long after the fire had gone out . english tours available for an extra fee , visitors can continue their tour into the treasure vault , which contains over 500 objects from eight centuries .
gold and silver pieces , valuable crossbows , the prince elector 's ring , and 18th century porcelain from vienna are among the items on display , all of which belonged to the eltz family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can you find this face ?

the new agreement will provide the us department of homeland security -lrb- dhs -rrb- with 19 categories of data about european air travelers flying to the united states .
the dhs will be allowed to keep the information in its database for 15 years and share details with other law enforcement agencies under certain conditions .
the eu reached an " understanding " on elements of the deal late last month but certain " reservations " had to be reviewed by some of the bloc 's 27 member states who are obliged to pass the accord through their national parliaments .
the agreement will significantly lower the number of categories of data available to the dhs as stated in the previous agreement between the eu and us .
post-9/11 deal saw 34 categories shared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions to 9/11 included stricter controls on data following the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington , the eu and the us signed an agreement under which the eu agreed to grant us authorities access to up to 34 categories of information on passengers on all flights to the us taking off from eu member states .
these included names , addresses , phone numbers and credit card numbers of travelers .
that agreement , which was set to expire on july 31 , stirred unease among eu lawmakers amid concerns that civil liberties were being eroded in the fight against global terrorism .
the eu-wide concerns over data privacy led to the agreement being annulled by the european court of justice in luxembourg in may .
the eu and the us then reached an interim agreement as the eu warned that airlines would be vulnerable to privacy complaints if no replacement deal had been reached before the interim one expired .

polls predict a new victory of the governing ak party , but the parliament 's composition is the issue that 's really suspenseful : will it still be made up of two factions that get beyond the 10-percent hurdle or will the nationalistic mhp also manage to get in ?
i think that 's the real question and i 'm somewhat worried when it comes to the latter party . premier erdogan has said that he will bid farewell to politics if he does n't win the election .
what do you think about this statement ? it 's a sign of great confidence , because erdogan wants to do everything except bid farewell to politics .
he 's certain that he 'll remain , because he counts on winning the election . as the chairman of the foreign affairs committee in parliament , you 're dealing with turkey a lot and you 're an expert on turkey .
does turkey still have a chance to move towards europe , especially considering that the reforms have virtually come to a standstill ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan wants to bring his country into the eu i think that also depends a bit on the internal difficulties during the pre-election campaign .
i hope that turkish voters will bring about a straightforward situation in parliament .
turkey definitely needs a government that 's capable of acting and is backed by a large majority in parliament .
it 's written nowhere that the reform process can not continue .
people just have to want it .
i 'm convinced that erdogan wants to continue on the way to europe .
he has to overcome resistance .
opinion polls in turkey have become skeptical .
maybe there 's also more skepticism in his own party that he has to deal with , but i think that he 's right to connect the economic upswing turkey has experienced under his government with the route to europe .
it 's certainly the right conclusion to draw . germany and several other states have concerns when it comes to full eu membership for turkey .
do you think that turkey could be convinced to accept a privileged partnership after all ? i do n't think that 's a question that needs to be answered today or tomorrow .
the eu has made a clear decision to initiate accession negotiations .
it was noted , however , that the outcome can not be predicted .
the negotiations are happening with an open end , but with the goal of membership .
it 's clear that full membership requires turkey to fulfill all criteria not only on paper but also in practice .
we know that there 's still a long way to go in some respects .
on the other hand , we 've seen in the case of the cyprus question that turkey struggles with this .
you can not join a club if you do n't recognize a club member .
these are questions that turkey needs to face in the coming years .
but they can be solved in principle . baha güngör , the head of dw-radio 's turkish service , interviewed ruprecht polenz -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's coalition made up of the christian democrats and social democrats took office in november 2005 . the chancellor said the government was " looking at mechanisms ... both on a european and german level " to deal with the influence of the funds . " we have started a discussion that is still ongoing , " she said . politicians in germany have expressed fears in recent months that newly rich state corporate behemoths in russia and china could take over key industrial sectors in europe 's biggest economy . possible political power merkel added that it was possible that such investments could be used not just to attain high returns on capital but also as a lever to gain political influence . " we mus n't be naive , " she said .
" state-owned funds can also have politico-strategic aims in mind that could be problematic in sensitive areas . " she said she wanted a wide-ranging discussion on the issue , including drawing on the expertise of the business industry , which has long experience in dealing with foreign capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and french president sarkozy this week in toulouse merkel said she had recently spoken with french president nicolas sarkozy about the matter . the chancellor said she also favored discussions among the eu 's 27 members for a uniform definition of " strategic industries " which might be covered by such mechanisms . she stressed she did not want to block such funds , but favored the introduction of transparent control mechanisms like those in force in the united states . " a general ban is with certainty not the right answer , " said merkel , who warned two weeks ago that major german companies could possibly fall into the hands of hostile states through investments by foreign government-operated funds . easy prey for takeovers german finance minister peer steinbrück recently commented in similar fashion , saying that berlin was considering ways of protecting domestic companies in key industries such as telecommunications , banking , postal services , logistics and energy from foreign investors . the growing power of investment funds has caused concern in germany because the relatively low market valuation of significant companies makes them relatively easy prey for takeovers . the funds are estimated to have more than 800 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.1 trillion -rrb- at their disposal .
this estimation does not include the substantial foreign currency reserves of middle eastern and east asian countries . china , for instance , has foreign currency reserves of about $ 1.2 trillion dollars , some of which has been earmarked to buy western companies . however , last month , bert rürup , a top economic adviser to the german government said he opposed introducing new forms of protectionism to stop foreign countries wielding excessive influence over domestic companies . " i do not think much of sealing off the german capital market , " rürup told the handelsblatt newspaper . cashing in on economic upturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany economy on its way up merkel said her government would do everything in its power to prolong the economic upturn that germany is currently enjoying in order to ensure that more people reap its benefits . " the greater the upswing is , the more influence we will have in shaping the international framework that is necessary to ensure that our traditional market economy continues to prosper , " she said . germany has been experiencing a steady drop in unemployment and many economists now project german economic growth in 2007 to match or possibly surpass last year 's 2.8 percent . article compiled from wire reports -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's coalition made up of the christian democrats and social democrats took office in november 2005 . the chancellor said the government was " looking at mechanisms ... both on a european and german level " to deal with the influence of the funds . " we have started a discussion that is still ongoing , " she said . politicians in germany have expressed fears in recent months that newly rich state corporate behemoths in russia and china could take over key industrial sectors in europe 's biggest economy . possible political power merkel added that it was possible that such investments could be used not just to attain high returns on capital but also as a lever to gain political influence . " we mus n't be naive , " she said .
" state-owned funds can also have politico-strategic aims in mind that could be problematic in sensitive areas . " she said she wanted a wide-ranging discussion on the issue , including drawing on the expertise of the business industry , which has long experience in dealing with foreign capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and french president sarkozy this week in toulouse merkel said she had recently spoken with french president nicolas sarkozy about the matter . the chancellor said she also favored discussions among the eu 's 27 members for a uniform definition of " strategic industries " which might be covered by such mechanisms . she stressed she did not want to block such funds , but favored the introduction of transparent control mechanisms like those in force in the united states . " a general ban is with certainty not the right answer , " said merkel , who warned two weeks ago that major german companies could possibly fall into the hands of hostile states through investments by foreign government-operated funds . easy prey for takeovers german finance minister peer steinbrück recently commented in similar fashion , saying that berlin was considering ways of protecting domestic companies in key industries such as telecommunications , banking , postal services , logistics and energy from foreign investors . the growing power of investment funds has caused concern in germany because the relatively low market valuation of significant companies makes them relatively easy prey for takeovers . the funds are estimated to have more than 800 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.1 trillion -rrb- at their disposal .
this estimation does not include the substantial foreign currency reserves of middle eastern and east asian countries . china , for instance , has foreign currency reserves of about $ 1.2 trillion dollars , some of which has been earmarked to buy western companies . however , last month , bert rürup , a top economic adviser to the german government said he opposed introducing new forms of protectionism to stop foreign countries wielding excessive influence over domestic companies . " i do not think much of sealing off the german capital market , " rürup told the handelsblatt newspaper . cashing in on economic upturn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany economy on its way up merkel said her government would do everything in its power to prolong the economic upturn that germany is currently enjoying in order to ensure that more people reap its benefits . " the greater the upswing is , the more influence we will have in shaping the international framework that is necessary to ensure that our traditional market economy continues to prosper , " she said . germany has been experiencing a steady drop in unemployment and many economists now project german economic growth in 2007 to match or possibly surpass last year 's 2.8 percent . article compiled from wire reports -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" girls out-perform boys at school and more women enter the labor market with a university degree than men , but a pay gap of 15 percent persists , " vladimir spidla , european commissioner for employment and social affairs said wednesday .
" this is an absurd situation and needs to change . " the czech commissioner said the " uneven division of duties in families " was partially responsible for the gap .
spidla was considering mandatory paternity leave as a way of promoting equality at home and the workplace , the associated press reported , citing anonymous commission sources . " it is not possible to reduce the gender pay gap if -lsb- men -rsb- do not help out more at home , " spindla said at a press conference , adding that eu statistics show men , regardless of whether employed full or part-time , do less work at home than women . germany among worst offenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german women earn an average of 22 percent less than male coworkers as a way of promoting paternity leave , germany instituted a new system in january that allows parents to take home 14 instead of 12 months worth of benefits if they both divide the time away from their workplaces .
the extra two months have earned the name " father months " as the most common division sees mothers taking 12 months of leave and father two . women in germany earn an average of 22 percent less than similarly qualified men , according to an eu study .
in the 27-member bloc only cyprus , estonia and slovakia have larger gender pay gaps than germany . " the fact that women in many fields of employment are still paid less than men for the same work is scandalous , " johannes singhammer , the christian social union 's spokesman for women 's issues , said in a statement . laws need to be applied he said germany already has sufficient laws to avoid such a gap , but that they " were obviously not being implemented as we would like . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it would n't kill men to do more work in the house as well plugging the pay gap should be an integral part of governments ' employment policies and that pressure must also be put on employers to ensure there is no discrimination against women , spidla said . " the pay gap is a complex issue with multiple causes , " he said .
" sometimes we see pure discrimination .
but often reasons are hidden .
women do more unpaid work , like taking care of the household and dependants . " different value for same work the commissioner also pointed out that women did more part-time work and said that women-dominated jobs and sectors were on a lower pay scale . a commission report , which showed the pay gap in europe had not decreased in over a decade , said a main cause of discrimination was that women 's competences were less valued then men 's . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite equally long training , nurses are often paid less than police as a result , jobs requiring similar qualifications or experience tended to be paid less when they were dominated by women than by men . " for example , in some countries nannies earn less than car mechanics , supermarket cashiers less than warehouse workers , nurses less than the police , " said the commission . seniority-based pay slammed the eu executive said that the pay gap also reflected inequalities in the labor market , especially the difficulties in reconciling work with private life . women with part-time jobs and those who took frequent career breaks because of children were less likely to hold managerial positions and encounter more obstacles and resistance as they proceed along their career paths , the commission report said . " as a consequence , women 's career paths are more often interrupted , slower and shorter , and hence less well paid than men 's , " it said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 19.07.2007 eu wary of being dragged into britain-russia diplomatic row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is reluctant to take sides in the dispute between britain and russia despite a statement saying it was " disappointed " by russian failure to cooperate with the uk , the european union is staying firmly on the sidelines in the escalating diplomatic row between london and moscow . as relations between britain and russia reach the lowest point since the cold war , the european union stands to one side , unwilling to get involved in what could turn out to be one of the most serious diplomatic spats between east and west in over a decade .
britain expelled four russian diplomats on monday after russia refused to extradite andrei lugovoi , a suspect in the murder of kremlin critic and former kgb agent alexander litvinenko , who was poisoned with radioactive material in london last november .
shortly after the expulsion , british diplomats turned to the eu for support - and came up against a wall of indifference in most cases .
the british foreign office had looked towards the portuguese eu presidency for a statement of support on monday but by wednesday there had still not been an adequate response .
by wednesday evening , portuguese prime minister jose socrates had still not been able to extract enough support for the british stance from other eu leaders .
eventual eu statement lacks weight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis amado delivered the eu 's lukewarm response a statement eventually materialized thursday , but portuguese foreign minister luis amado 's assertion that the diplomatic row was " disappointing " and " a bilateral issue " between britain and russia hardly threw the bloc 's weight behind the brits .
the statement by the portuguese did however say the issue " raises important questions of common interest to eu member states , " adding that litvinenko 's murder was " a grave and reckless crime . "
surprisingly , given their level of animosity over issues both serious and trivial throughout history , the french were the most vocal when it came to supporting british prime minister gordon brown 's decision to throw the russians out .
" the murder of a british national on his home soil , using a substance that put at risk the lives of thousands of others is a particularly serious matter , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
" given the gravity of the matter , we stand alongside the united kingdom in its concern that justice be done .
" we call on moscow to respond to the demands of british justice in a constructive manner ... so that the perpetrators of this crime are brought to justice and punished , " he added .
russia promptly responded on thursday by expelling four british diplomats from moscow , in what alexander grushkov , russia 's deputy foreign minister , said was a " targeted and appropriate " response .
" britain appeals for eu solidarity , " grushkov said in his statement .
" we hope that common sense will prevail within the eu and that its members will not give in to attempts to turn relations between russia and the eu into a tool to achieve unilateral political goals .
these have nothing in common with eu and russia 's real partnership interests . "
germany says britain " overreacted " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown wanted merkel 's support ; he did n't get it germany was one of the many other eu nations which viewed the situation from a distance .
despite prime minister brown 's visit in person to berlin to press chancellor angela merkel for her support , germany remained firmly on the fence but did say that it thought britain had " overreacted " by expelling the four russian diplomats and freezing bilateral negotiations on visas .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will meet in berlin on friday to discuss the diplomatic row .
german foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said the meeting would involve " brief but intensive talks " .
steinmeier on wednesday had expressed his hope that the row would not be allowed to escalate into " a crisis . "
in terms of relations with russia , germany is the main player in the european union and therefore has the most to lose from coming down on the side of the brits .
russia considers germany to be its most important economic partner in the eu and the statistics on trade between the two nations confirms this view .
trade between the two countries increased by almost 40 percent in 2006 while german exports to russia went up by 35 percent .
germany and russia are also driving europe 's energy agenda and if the bloc is to secure its supply from the east , then relations between the two sides have to be good .
russia warns eu to stay out of row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia has a lot of leverage over the eu russia for its part has warned the eu to stay out of the row and vladimir chizhov , russia 's eu representative in brussels called the eu presidency 's lukewarm statement on wednesday " an unpleasant surprise for us . "
despite the lack of any real commitment on europe 's part , chizhov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency that the eu statement would " affect relations between the eu and russia . "
while disappointed by europe 's relatively non-committal stance in the row , british foreign minister david miliband is unlikely to give up trying to garner support .
he is expected to lobby his eu counterparts at the next eu foreign minister meeting in brussels on monday but observers believe that unless russia reacts again , and more strongly this time , the eu will continue to sit out the row on the sidelines . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

britain expelled four russian diplomats on monday after russia refused to extradite andrei lugovoi , a suspect in the murder of kremlin critic and former kgb agent alexander litvinenko , who was poisoned with radioactive material in london last november .
shortly after the expulsion , british diplomats turned to the eu for support - and came up against a wall of indifference in most cases .
the british foreign office had looked towards the portuguese eu presidency for a statement of support on monday but by wednesday there had still not been an adequate response .
by wednesday evening , portuguese prime minister jose socrates had still not been able to extract enough support for the british stance from other eu leaders .
eventual eu statement lacks weight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis amado delivered the eu 's lukewarm response a statement eventually materialized thursday , but portuguese foreign minister luis amado 's assertion that the diplomatic row was " disappointing " and " a bilateral issue " between britain and russia hardly threw the bloc 's weight behind the brits .
the statement by the portuguese did however say the issue " raises important questions of common interest to eu member states , " adding that litvinenko 's murder was " a grave and reckless crime . "
surprisingly , given their level of animosity over issues both serious and trivial throughout history , the french were the most vocal when it came to supporting british prime minister gordon brown 's decision to throw the russians out .
" the murder of a british national on his home soil , using a substance that put at risk the lives of thousands of others is a particularly serious matter , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
" given the gravity of the matter , we stand alongside the united kingdom in its concern that justice be done .
" we call on moscow to respond to the demands of british justice in a constructive manner ... so that the perpetrators of this crime are brought to justice and punished , " he added .
russia promptly responded on thursday by expelling four british diplomats from moscow , in what alexander grushkov , russia 's deputy foreign minister , said was a " targeted and appropriate " response .
" britain appeals for eu solidarity , " grushkov said in his statement .
" we hope that common sense will prevail within the eu and that its members will not give in to attempts to turn relations between russia and the eu into a tool to achieve unilateral political goals .
these have nothing in common with eu and russia 's real partnership interests . "
germany says britain " overreacted " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown wanted merkel 's support ; he did n't get it germany was one of the many other eu nations which viewed the situation from a distance .
despite prime minister brown 's visit in person to berlin to press chancellor angela merkel for her support , germany remained firmly on the fence but did say that it thought britain had " overreacted " by expelling the four russian diplomats and freezing bilateral negotiations on visas .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will meet in berlin on friday to discuss the diplomatic row .
german foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said the meeting would involve " brief but intensive talks " .
steinmeier on wednesday had expressed his hope that the row would not be allowed to escalate into " a crisis . "
in terms of relations with russia , germany is the main player in the european union and therefore has the most to lose from coming down on the side of the brits .
russia considers germany to be its most important economic partner in the eu and the statistics on trade between the two nations confirms this view .
trade between the two countries increased by almost 40 percent in 2006 while german exports to russia went up by 35 percent .
germany and russia are also driving europe 's energy agenda and if the bloc is to secure its supply from the east , then relations between the two sides have to be good .
russia warns eu to stay out of row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia has a lot of leverage over the eu russia for its part has warned the eu to stay out of the row and vladimir chizhov , russia 's eu representative in brussels called the eu presidency 's lukewarm statement on wednesday " an unpleasant surprise for us . "
despite the lack of any real commitment on europe 's part , chizhov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency that the eu statement would " affect relations between the eu and russia . "
while disappointed by europe 's relatively non-committal stance in the row , british foreign minister david miliband is unlikely to give up trying to garner support .
he is expected to lobby his eu counterparts at the next eu foreign minister meeting in brussels on monday but observers believe that unless russia reacts again , and more strongly this time , the eu will continue to sit out the row on the sidelines . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 19.07.2007 eu wary of being dragged into britain-russia diplomatic row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is reluctant to take sides in the dispute between britain and russia despite a statement saying it was " disappointed " by russian failure to cooperate with the uk , the european union is staying firmly on the sidelines in the escalating diplomatic row between london and moscow . as relations between britain and russia reach the lowest point since the cold war , the european union stands to one side , unwilling to get involved in what could turn out to be one of the most serious diplomatic spats between east and west in over a decade .
britain expelled four russian diplomats on monday after russia refused to extradite andrei lugovoi , a suspect in the murder of kremlin critic and former kgb agent alexander litvinenko , who was poisoned with radioactive material in london last november .
shortly after the expulsion , british diplomats turned to the eu for support - and came up against a wall of indifference in most cases .
the british foreign office had looked towards the portuguese eu presidency for a statement of support on monday but by wednesday there had still not been an adequate response .
by wednesday evening , portuguese prime minister jose socrates had still not been able to extract enough support for the british stance from other eu leaders .
eventual eu statement lacks weight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis amado delivered the eu 's lukewarm response a statement eventually materialized thursday , but portuguese foreign minister luis amado 's assertion that the diplomatic row was " disappointing " and " a bilateral issue " between britain and russia hardly threw the bloc 's weight behind the brits .
the statement by the portuguese did however say the issue " raises important questions of common interest to eu member states , " adding that litvinenko 's murder was " a grave and reckless crime . "
surprisingly , given their level of animosity over issues both serious and trivial throughout history , the french were the most vocal when it came to supporting british prime minister gordon brown 's decision to throw the russians out .
" the murder of a british national on his home soil , using a substance that put at risk the lives of thousands of others is a particularly serious matter , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
" given the gravity of the matter , we stand alongside the united kingdom in its concern that justice be done .
" we call on moscow to respond to the demands of british justice in a constructive manner ... so that the perpetrators of this crime are brought to justice and punished , " he added .
russia promptly responded on thursday by expelling four british diplomats from moscow , in what alexander grushkov , russia 's deputy foreign minister , said was a " targeted and appropriate " response .
" britain appeals for eu solidarity , " grushkov said in his statement .
" we hope that common sense will prevail within the eu and that its members will not give in to attempts to turn relations between russia and the eu into a tool to achieve unilateral political goals .
these have nothing in common with eu and russia 's real partnership interests . "
germany says britain " overreacted " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown wanted merkel 's support ; he did n't get it germany was one of the many other eu nations which viewed the situation from a distance .
despite prime minister brown 's visit in person to berlin to press chancellor angela merkel for her support , germany remained firmly on the fence but did say that it thought britain had " overreacted " by expelling the four russian diplomats and freezing bilateral negotiations on visas .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will meet in berlin on friday to discuss the diplomatic row .
german foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said the meeting would involve " brief but intensive talks " .
steinmeier on wednesday had expressed his hope that the row would not be allowed to escalate into " a crisis . "
in terms of relations with russia , germany is the main player in the european union and therefore has the most to lose from coming down on the side of the brits .
russia considers germany to be its most important economic partner in the eu and the statistics on trade between the two nations confirms this view .
trade between the two countries increased by almost 40 percent in 2006 while german exports to russia went up by 35 percent .
germany and russia are also driving europe 's energy agenda and if the bloc is to secure its supply from the east , then relations between the two sides have to be good .
russia warns eu to stay out of row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's russia has a lot of leverage over the eu russia for its part has warned the eu to stay out of the row and vladimir chizhov , russia 's eu representative in brussels called the eu presidency 's lukewarm statement on wednesday " an unpleasant surprise for us . "
despite the lack of any real commitment on europe 's part , chizhov was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency that the eu statement would " affect relations between the eu and russia . "
while disappointed by europe 's relatively non-committal stance in the row , british foreign minister david miliband is unlikely to give up trying to garner support .
he is expected to lobby his eu counterparts at the next eu foreign minister meeting in brussels on monday but observers believe that unless russia reacts again , and more strongly this time , the eu will continue to sit out the row on the sidelines . article based on news reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de dw-world : russia expels four british diplomats in a tit-for-tat action reminiscent of cold war politics , moscow told four british diplomats on thursday that they are no longer welcome to stay in russia .

the building is the garden 's largest new attraction since it opened in 2000 and it is already home to thousands of palms , orchids and giant leaves .
guest of honour is the new york-based architect , welsh-born john belle .
his projects include make-overs for the rockefeller centre and grand central terminal in new york .
garden director kevin lamb said the official opening marked a new chapter in the garden 's history .
four years ago the £ 43m tourist attraction , which had been opened by prince charles in 2000 , was within hours of having to call in the administrators .
but at the last minute , a rescue package was put together and the garden has slowly seen its fortunes blossom .
mr lamb said : " not only is this a fabulous and important moment in the garden 's short history - it is also a proud moment for wales .
welshman changing new york born in 1932 in pontcanna , cardiff , john belle moved to new york in 1959 to launch his career in architecture three of his projects - ellis island , grand central terminal and the delaware aqueduct - received the presidential design award , the usa 's highest prize for public architecture other projects include refurbishments to the chrysler building and rockefeller centre in new york in 2003 he was made an honorary fellow of the royal society of architects in wales " this further enhances the garden 's worldwide reputation as a millennium project of global significance . "
the glasshouse was mr belle 's first project in wales and he provided his services free .
he said : " designing the tropical house - a building that is all about the connection between the world of plants and the realm of architecture - provided a wonderful opportunity for me to reconnect with my roots .
" i do n't think there could have been a more appropriate project for me at this stage in my career . "
horticulturists from the garden have visited colleagues and collectors across the uk to source plants for the glasshouse .
laura davies said : " we have visited colleagues at kew , edinburgh and glasgow botanic gardens and never came away empty handed .
" we will be growing an amazing range of plants from throughout the tropics - majestic palms , beautiful orchids , giant leaves and unusual flowers .
" i hope visitors will be as excited as we are . "

it came despite government measures in the first six months of the year to cool the economy , which had grown 11.1 % in the three months to march .
government spokesman li xiaochao said the government would " improve macro controls " to rein in the economy .
the rapid growth has pushed inflation to a 33-month high .
' overheated ' a boom in production , fuelled by strong exports and investment , is contributing to the inflationary risks the country now faces .

" economic growth is overheated now , " said fu chunjiang , an analyst with sinolink securities in shanghai .
" i think investment and cpi growth have gone beyond the government 's comfort zone and the authorities will issue more tightening measures and strengthen the implementation of previous ones . "
' industrial structure ' the new figures show that china 's factories have continued to speed up production , with industrial output up 18.5 % in the first half of 2007 .
fixed asset investment , a measure of mostly government spending in infrastructure , rose 25.9 % in the six months .
national bureau of statistics spokesman li xiaochao said the government " will continue to strengthen and improve macro-control measures " .
he added : " we will continue to enhance the adjustment of the industrial structure to change the growth pattern and to enable the economy to grow healthily and quickly . "
last week china said the trade surplus for the first half of the year had soared to $ 112.5bn.

plans also include measures to encourage young mothers to continue living with their parents .
the proposals are part of a new strategy to help teen parents cope with the demands of bringing up children .
government figures show one fifth of teenage pregnancies involve girls under 18 who already have a child .
families minister beverley hughes said teenage pregnancy rates were being tackled , but more needed to be done to target the " isolation " suffered by many young parents .
" we must now do more to address the reality of teenagers who become parents , " she said .
dropping out under the plans , access to contraception for young mothers and fathers will be improved " to prevent repeat , unplanned pregnancies " .
teenage fathers will also be encouraged to feel more " welcome " and involved , the strategy said .
young parents and their children are more likely to suffer problems with health as well as being more likely to drop out of school than their peers , government research shows .
by addressing this issue now , not only will we be able to improve the lives of young parents , we can also help prevent repeat pregnancies families minister beverley hughes figures also reveal the children of teenage mothers are more likely to become young parents themselves .
they also have 60 % higher rates of infant mortality than those born to mothers between the ages of 20 and 39 .
" by addressing this issue now , not only will we be able to improve the lives of young parents , we can also help prevent repeat pregnancies and reduce the negative outcomes associated with the children of teenagers , " said ms hughes .
tailored services , friendly professionals and long-term support were all essential , she said .
" as part of our drive to narrow inequalities , they are a key group who deserve our help , commitment and support , " she added .
the independent advisory group on teenage pregnancy welcomed the government 's new plans .
chairwoman gill frances said : " access to contraceptive advice and help must be improved and if the current trend of cutting community contraceptive services continues , no progress will be made on helping young mothers avoid second pregnancies , which is a critical issue . "
the uk has some of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in europe .
office for national statistics figures for england and wales revealed earlier this year the overall conception rate in under 18s remained virtually stable from 42,198 in 2004 to 42,187 in 2005 .
the government wants to bring the figure down using information campaigns on contraception and safe sex .

will harry die ?
where do snape 's loyalties really lie ?
and will ron and hermione get it together in hogwarts ' great hall ?
for many devotees , the only way to keep up-to-date with the latest potter news is to download and listen to podcasts - basically radio shows for your mp3 player .
according to one directory , there are more than 150 such programmes being made around the world .
the most popular , mugglecast , is listened to by a staggering 55,000 people every week .
with a relaxed atmosphere and chatty hosts , the best potter podcasts bring to mind a breakfast show with the energy and wit of chris moyles - only with wizard rock on the playlist , and every item devoted to harry potter .
humble beginnings people say we 're like their best harry potter friends andrew sims , mugglecast -lrb- right -rrb- among the top-rated is the us-based pottercast , produced via the leaky cauldron fan site , which has recently clocked up its 101st episode .
host melissa anelli admits that , in the beginning " we did n't even know what a podcast was " , and says the initial programmes were " a nightmare " .
" we had no personality on air , " she recalls .
" we were recording in my room-mate 's house at four in the morning , and it was all sounding terrible .
" finally , john -lsb- noe , co-presenter -rsb- yelled at me and said ' go and have a glass of wine ' .
" i did , and the next take was the one we used in the show ! "
andrew sims , the 18-year-old anchor of mugglecast , says his team had similar teething troubles .
" the first episodes were very informative , but they were n't entertaining , " he says .
the plot twists of the last book will be discussed in-depth " now we have great chemistry , there 's a flow .
we 've nailed down our personalities . "
" fans even say they have developed a relationship with us .
people say we 're like their best harry potter friends . "
' panic attack ' these days , the hosts of mugglecast and pottercast are minor celebrities in their own right , signing autographs at premieres and fan conventions .
both shows are marking the launch of harry potter and the deathly hallows by hosting a series of live shows across the uk and us this summer .
up to 500 people turn up to the recordings , something which anelli admits is a " little crazy " .
" the first time , i had a little panic attack .
i had to marshal the confidence to go out there . "
and is there enough fresh material to fill the shows ?
" a lot of people ask us that question , " says sims , " especially people who do n't know a lot about the books " .
" there 's always so much to talk about because harry potter is so in depth .
when the cover for the new book came out , we discussed that for two-and-a-half weeks ! "
adult show actor chris barlow plays several characters in snapecast 's sketches while pottercast and mugglecast cater for the mainstream fans , there are other , more esoteric , podcasts out there .
snapecast , for example , is an adult-orientated show dedicated to menacing hogwarts stalwart , potions master severus snape .
" he 's one of the more enigmatic , complex characters in the series , " explains chris barlow , one of the show 's contributors - and the voice of snape in various sketches and parodies .
" even though he 's cruel at times , there 's a lot of humour as well .
if you 're tuned in to snarky , sarcastic humour , there 's a lot of fun to be had . "
author tim o 'donnell has also serialised his potter parody , harry putter and the chamber of cheesecakes , as a podcast .
based on a book he wrote with his children as part of a home schooling project , it features the entire family in the voice cast - although o 'donnell says he would " prefer not to have to do the women 's voices " .
the staff of mugglecast and pottercast host live events the shows are made using a cheap microphone and free audio recording software .
o 'donnell has sourced copyright-free sound effects from the internet , while his son plays the theme tune on his guitar .
' hard work ' but the more popular podcasts have bigger overheads , covering the cost of running websites , phone bills , and travel .
" ultimately it 's about $ 100 -lrb- £ 50 -rrb- a month , " says kim newsome at spinnerscast .
" we have a little fund that comes out of my salary and we get a few donations . "
mugglecast , a much larger concern , relies on advertising to fund its shows .
but it is commitment , not cost , that poses the biggest problem .
kim newsome is a tv producer when she is n't making spinnerscast " people do n't realise how hard it is to work with others , " says newsome , who has produced 42 episodes of spinnerscast since september 2006 .
" somebody 's got to be the leader , and somebody 's got to push you through even when you do n't want to record .
" a lot of this is just not fun . "
the rewards of perseverance include tickets to premieres and book launches , interviews with the stars of the films , and meeting fellow harry hounds around the world .
" we have people contacting us saying ' i listen to the podcast on the way to school with my 13-year-old and it 's the only thing we can talk about together , " ' says newsome .
" if you do n't have any friends who talk about harry potter , mugglecast is a great source , " agrees sims .
" and it 's a once in a lifetime opportunity for us .
" who knows the next time we 'll have the chance to put on a radio show that will have so many listeners ? "

for many devotees , the only way to keep up-to-date with the latest potter news is to download and listen to podcasts - basically radio shows for your mp3 player .
according to one directory , there are more than 150 such programmes being made around the world .
the most popular , mugglecast , is listened to by a staggering 55,000 people every week .
with a relaxed atmosphere and chatty hosts , the best potter podcasts bring to mind a breakfast show with the energy and wit of chris moyles - only with wizard rock on the playlist , and every item devoted to harry potter .

andrew sims , the 18-year-old anchor of mugglecast , says his team had similar teething troubles .

adult show actor chris barlow plays several characters in snapecast 's sketches while pottercast and mugglecast cater for the mainstream fans , there are other , more esoteric , podcasts out there .
snapecast , for example , is an adult-orientated show dedicated to menacing hogwarts stalwart , potions master severus snape .
" he 's one of the more enigmatic , complex characters in the series , " explains chris barlow , one of the show 's contributors - and the voice of snape in various sketches and parodies .

if you 're tuned in to snarky , sarcastic humour , there 's a lot of fun to be had . "
author tim o 'donnell has also serialised his potter parody , harry putter and the chamber of cheesecakes , as a podcast .
based on a book he wrote with his children as part of a home schooling project , it features the entire family in the voice cast - although o 'donnell says he would " prefer not to have to do the women 's voices " .
the staff of mugglecast and pottercast host live events the shows are made using a cheap microphone and free audio recording software .
o 'donnell has sourced copyright-free sound effects from the internet , while his son plays the theme tune on his guitar .

" we have a little fund that comes out of my salary and we get a few donations . "

will harry die ?
where do snape 's loyalties really lie ?
and will ron and hermione get it together in hogwarts ' great hall ?
for many devotees , the only way to keep up-to-date with the latest potter news is to download and listen to podcasts - basically radio shows for your mp3 player .
according to one directory , there are more than 150 such programmes being made around the world .
the most popular , mugglecast , is listened to by a staggering 55,000 people every week .
with a relaxed atmosphere and chatty hosts , the best potter podcasts bring to mind a breakfast show with the energy and wit of chris moyles - only with wizard rock on the playlist , and every item devoted to harry potter .
humble beginnings people say we 're like their best harry potter friends andrew sims , mugglecast -lrb- right -rrb- among the top-rated is the us-based pottercast , produced via the leaky cauldron fan site , which has recently clocked up its 101st episode .
host melissa anelli admits that , in the beginning " we did n't even know what a podcast was " , and says the initial programmes were " a nightmare " .
" we had no personality on air , " she recalls .
" we were recording in my room-mate 's house at four in the morning , and it was all sounding terrible .
" finally , john -lsb- noe , co-presenter -rsb- yelled at me and said ' go and have a glass of wine ' .
" i did , and the next take was the one we used in the show ! "
andrew sims , the 18-year-old anchor of mugglecast , says his team had similar teething troubles .
" the first episodes were very informative , but they were n't entertaining , " he says .
the plot twists of the last book will be discussed in-depth " now we have great chemistry , there 's a flow .
we 've nailed down our personalities . "
" fans even say they have developed a relationship with us .
people say we 're like their best harry potter friends . "
' panic attack ' these days , the hosts of mugglecast and pottercast are minor celebrities in their own right , signing autographs at premieres and fan conventions .
both shows are marking the launch of harry potter and the deathly hallows by hosting a series of live shows across the uk and us this summer .
up to 500 people turn up to the recordings , something which anelli admits is a " little crazy " .
" the first time , i had a little panic attack .
i had to marshal the confidence to go out there . "
and is there enough fresh material to fill the shows ?
" a lot of people ask us that question , " says sims , " especially people who do n't know a lot about the books " .
" there 's always so much to talk about because harry potter is so in depth .
when the cover for the new book came out , we discussed that for two-and-a-half weeks ! "
adult show actor chris barlow plays several characters in snapecast 's sketches while pottercast and mugglecast cater for the mainstream fans , there are other , more esoteric , podcasts out there .
snapecast , for example , is an adult-orientated show dedicated to menacing hogwarts stalwart , potions master severus snape .
" he 's one of the more enigmatic , complex characters in the series , " explains chris barlow , one of the show 's contributors - and the voice of snape in various sketches and parodies .
" even though he 's cruel at times , there 's a lot of humour as well .
if you 're tuned in to snarky , sarcastic humour , there 's a lot of fun to be had . "
author tim o 'donnell has also serialised his potter parody , harry putter and the chamber of cheesecakes , as a podcast .
based on a book he wrote with his children as part of a home schooling project , it features the entire family in the voice cast - although o 'donnell says he would " prefer not to have to do the women 's voices " .
the staff of mugglecast and pottercast host live events the shows are made using a cheap microphone and free audio recording software .
o 'donnell has sourced copyright-free sound effects from the internet , while his son plays the theme tune on his guitar .
' hard work ' but the more popular podcasts have bigger overheads , covering the cost of running websites , phone bills , and travel .
" ultimately it 's about $ 100 -lrb- £ 50 -rrb- a month , " says kim newsome at spinnerscast .
" we have a little fund that comes out of my salary and we get a few donations . "
mugglecast , a much larger concern , relies on advertising to fund its shows .
but it is commitment , not cost , that poses the biggest problem .
kim newsome is a tv producer when she is n't making spinnerscast " people do n't realise how hard it is to work with others , " says newsome , who has produced 42 episodes of spinnerscast since september 2006 .
" somebody 's got to be the leader , and somebody 's got to push you through even when you do n't want to record .
" a lot of this is just not fun . "
the rewards of perseverance include tickets to premieres and book launches , interviews with the stars of the films , and meeting fellow harry hounds around the world .

the item was found by auctioneers as they were clearing out a house after the death of its owner .
the 1633 book entitled herbal - general history of plants by thomas johnson will be auctioned off at wyaston , near ashbourne , on thursday .
auctioneer charles hanson said it was expected to fetch more than £ 3,000 in the sale .
' important book ' he said that it was likely the previous owner never knew how much the book was worth .
it contains hand painted pictures of plants and describes their history and medicinal properties .
mr hanson said : " it 's quite remarkable .
we wander into these homes across derbyshire and here was this book sitting on a bookcase unbeknown to the owner .

opinions on drugs are sharply divided within parliament by admitting smoking cannabis while she was a student , home secretary jacqui smith is the latest in a series of british politicians to find themselves in the spotlight over their alleged youthful use of soft drugs .
from former conservative chairman francis maude to former home secretary charles clarke a procession of high-profile figures have admitted puffing cannabis in the past .
more recently , on becoming the minister for drugs policy , vernon coaker admitted having " one or two puffs of marijuana " while a student .
on the other hand , tory leader david cameron has never admitted previous drug use .
but the issue of whether he smoked cannabis while a student has dogged him since he joined the tory leadership race two years ago .
back then , when questioned by observer journalist andrew rawnsley at a party conference fringe meeting , he said : " i had a normal university experience , if i can put it like that . "
in a later television interview , he said : " i did lots of things before i came into politics which i should n't have done .
we all did . "
' understandable stance ' later he repeated his current non-committal stance when he told bbc one 's question time : " i 'm allowed to have had a private life before politics in which we make mistakes and we do things that we should not and we are all human and we err and stray " .
commentators at the time said mr cameron 's reluctance to admit any " indiscretions " were understandable given he was in the midst of a fierce leadership contest .
mr rawnsley said at the time that , far from ending speculation , owning up to any recreational drug use would lead to more questions such as " what did he take ? " and " how much ? " .
the danger , mr rawnsley said , is that mr cameron would appear " evasive " - an image he could not afford to see take hold among voters .
mr cameron has faced continuing questions over drugs several of mr cameron 's conservative colleagues - including his leadership rival ken clarke - backed his right to remain silent .
but even with politicians increasingly calling for a " mature debate " on the drugs issue - and previously taboo subjects such as homosexuality increasingly acceptable in westminster - drugs remains a tricky area .
drug abuse and its impact on society remain current and often controversial political issues .
when in 2000 , then shadow home secretary ann widdecombe came up with the idea of £ 100 fines for people caught with even the smallest amount of cannabis , the policy was instantly undermined by a parade of shadow cabinet ministers owning up to past drug use .
i was offered it on occasion and enjoyed it tim yeo , mp eight members came out as having used cannabis , including francis maude , shadow industry secretary david willetts and shadow environment secretary oliver letwin .
tim yeo , then agriculture spokesman but now a backbencher , told the times : " i was offered it on occasion and enjoyed it .
i think it can have a much pleasanter experience than having too much to drink . "
his career did not seem to suffer a permanent hangover , as he later became party spokesman on both health and education .
coming clean labour 's charles clarke admitted in 1997 , the year he became an mp , that he had taken drugs " a couple of times in my late teens " .
he later became home secretary .
in 2002 , having left politics , the late mo mowlam wrote in her autobiography that she had tried cannabis .
then drugs czar keith halliwell said he advised ms mowlam to come clean about her youthful experimentation after learning she was involved with drugs at university .
in 2003 caroline flint , as the newly appointed government minister responsible for drugs policy , admitted she took cannabis as a student but did not like it .
' no inhalation ' altogether , at least 32 current mps have gone public over previous drugs use .
but like much else in politics , a lot depends on the timing and context of any admission - and whether there has been attempt at a cover-up .
the highest-profile politicians - the leaders or would-be leaders - still tend to remain coy , or adamant in denial .
former us president bill clinton famously admitted using cannabis , but not inhaling .
former prime minister tony blair was criticised in some quarters for inviting unashamed drug user noel gallagher to number 10 .
but on the subject of whether he has ever taken illegal drugs himself , mr blair remained silent .
mr cameron is clearly determined to follow his example and remain tight-lipped on the subject .

opinions on drugs are sharply divided within parliament by admitting smoking cannabis while she was a student , home secretary jacqui smith is the latest in a series of british politicians to find themselves in the spotlight over their alleged youthful use of soft drugs .
from former conservative chairman francis maude to former home secretary charles clarke a procession of high-profile figures have admitted puffing cannabis in the past .
more recently , on becoming the minister for drugs policy , vernon coaker admitted having " one or two puffs of marijuana " while a student .
on the other hand , tory leader david cameron has never admitted previous drug use .
but the issue of whether he smoked cannabis while a student has dogged him since he joined the tory leadership race two years ago .
back then , when questioned by observer journalist andrew rawnsley at a party conference fringe meeting , he said : " i had a normal university experience , if i can put it like that . "
in a later television interview , he said : " i did lots of things before i came into politics which i should n't have done .
we all did . "
' understandable stance ' later he repeated his current non-committal stance when he told bbc one 's question time : " i 'm allowed to have had a private life before politics in which we make mistakes and we do things that we should not and we are all human and we err and stray " .
commentators at the time said mr cameron 's reluctance to admit any " indiscretions " were understandable given he was in the midst of a fierce leadership contest .
mr rawnsley said at the time that , far from ending speculation , owning up to any recreational drug use would lead to more questions such as " what did he take ? " and " how much ? " .
the danger , mr rawnsley said , is that mr cameron would appear " evasive " - an image he could not afford to see take hold among voters .
mr cameron has faced continuing questions over drugs several of mr cameron 's conservative colleagues - including his leadership rival ken clarke - backed his right to remain silent .
but even with politicians increasingly calling for a " mature debate " on the drugs issue - and previously taboo subjects such as homosexuality increasingly acceptable in westminster - drugs remains a tricky area .
drug abuse and its impact on society remain current and often controversial political issues .
when in 2000 , then shadow home secretary ann widdecombe came up with the idea of £ 100 fines for people caught with even the smallest amount of cannabis , the policy was instantly undermined by a parade of shadow cabinet ministers owning up to past drug use .
i was offered it on occasion and enjoyed it tim yeo , mp eight members came out as having used cannabis , including francis maude , shadow industry secretary david willetts and shadow environment secretary oliver letwin .
tim yeo , then agriculture spokesman but now a backbencher , told the times : " i was offered it on occasion and enjoyed it .
i think it can have a much pleasanter experience than having too much to drink . "
his career did not seem to suffer a permanent hangover , as he later became party spokesman on both health and education .
coming clean labour 's charles clarke admitted in 1997 , the year he became an mp , that he had taken drugs " a couple of times in my late teens " .
he later became home secretary .
in 2002 , having left politics , the late mo mowlam wrote in her autobiography that she had tried cannabis .
then drugs czar keith halliwell said he advised ms mowlam to come clean about her youthful experimentation after learning she was involved with drugs at university .
in 2003 caroline flint , as the newly appointed government minister responsible for drugs policy , admitted she took cannabis as a student but did not like it .
' no inhalation ' altogether , at least 32 current mps have gone public over previous drugs use .
but like much else in politics , a lot depends on the timing and context of any admission - and whether there has been attempt at a cover-up .
the highest-profile politicians - the leaders or would-be leaders - still tend to remain coy , or adamant in denial .
former us president bill clinton famously admitted using cannabis , but not inhaling .
former prime minister tony blair was criticised in some quarters for inviting unashamed drug user noel gallagher to number 10 .
but on the subject of whether he has ever taken illegal drugs himself , mr blair remained silent .
mr cameron is clearly determined to follow his example and remain tight-lipped on the subject .

opinions on drugs are sharply divided within parliament by admitting smoking cannabis while she was a student , home secretary jacqui smith is the latest in a series of british politicians to find themselves in the spotlight over their alleged youthful use of soft drugs .
from former conservative chairman francis maude to former home secretary charles clarke a procession of high-profile figures have admitted puffing cannabis in the past .
more recently , on becoming the minister for drugs policy , vernon coaker admitted having " one or two puffs of marijuana " while a student .
on the other hand , tory leader david cameron has never admitted previous drug use .
but the issue of whether he smoked cannabis while a student has dogged him since he joined the tory leadership race two years ago .
back then , when questioned by observer journalist andrew rawnsley at a party conference fringe meeting , he said : " i had a normal university experience , if i can put it like that . "
in a later television interview , he said : " i did lots of things before i came into politics which i should n't have done .
we all did . "
' understandable stance ' later he repeated his current non-committal stance when he told bbc one 's question time : " i 'm allowed to have had a private life before politics in which we make mistakes and we do things that we should not and we are all human and we err and stray " .
commentators at the time said mr cameron 's reluctance to admit any " indiscretions " were understandable given he was in the midst of a fierce leadership contest .
mr rawnsley said at the time that , far from ending speculation , owning up to any recreational drug use would lead to more questions such as " what did he take ? " and " how much ? " .
the danger , mr rawnsley said , is that mr cameron would appear " evasive " - an image he could not afford to see take hold among voters .
mr cameron has faced continuing questions over drugs several of mr cameron 's conservative colleagues - including his leadership rival ken clarke - backed his right to remain silent .
but even with politicians increasingly calling for a " mature debate " on the drugs issue - and previously taboo subjects such as homosexuality increasingly acceptable in westminster - drugs remains a tricky area .
drug abuse and its impact on society remain current and often controversial political issues .
when in 2000 , then shadow home secretary ann widdecombe came up with the idea of £ 100 fines for people caught with even the smallest amount of cannabis , the policy was instantly undermined by a parade of shadow cabinet ministers owning up to past drug use .
i was offered it on occasion and enjoyed it tim yeo , mp eight members came out as having used cannabis , including francis maude , shadow industry secretary david willetts and shadow environment secretary oliver letwin .
tim yeo , then agriculture spokesman but now a backbencher , told the times : " i was offered it on occasion and enjoyed it .
i think it can have a much pleasanter experience than having too much to drink . "
his career did not seem to suffer a permanent hangover , as he later became party spokesman on both health and education .
coming clean labour 's charles clarke admitted in 1997 , the year he became an mp , that he had taken drugs " a couple of times in my late teens " .
he later became home secretary .
in 2002 , having left politics , the late mo mowlam wrote in her autobiography that she had tried cannabis .
then drugs czar keith halliwell said he advised ms mowlam to come clean about her youthful experimentation after learning she was involved with drugs at university .
in 2003 caroline flint , as the newly appointed government minister responsible for drugs policy , admitted she took cannabis as a student but did not like it .
' no inhalation ' altogether , at least 32 current mps have gone public over previous drugs use .
but like much else in politics , a lot depends on the timing and context of any admission - and whether there has been attempt at a cover-up .
the highest-profile politicians - the leaders or would-be leaders - still tend to remain coy , or adamant in denial .
former us president bill clinton famously admitted using cannabis , but not inhaling .
former prime minister tony blair was criticised in some quarters for inviting unashamed drug user noel gallagher to number 10 .
but on the subject of whether he has ever taken illegal drugs himself , mr blair remained silent .
mr cameron is clearly determined to follow his example and remain tight-lipped on the subject .

sales rose 0.2 % in june , down from an increase of 0.4 % in may , the office for national statistics -lrb- ons -rrb- said .
on an annual basis , sales rose 3.4 % in june , the ons added .
however , analysts said that while sales growth had slowed , it was probably still too strong to deter the bank of england from raising interest rates .
' dismal conditions ' the ons figures showed that supermarkets were hit particularly hard as food sales fell 1.1 % in june because customers turned away from summer products as the rain and wind made barbecues and picnics less than appealing .
however , department store sales rose sharply from a year ago - which the ons said was because summer discounting had begun earlier than in 2006 .
analysts said sales growth was still strong enough to merit higher interest rates later this year .
uk interest rates are now at 5.75 % , after having been increased five times since last august to try and rein in inflation .
" consumer demand is very strong , bank credit growth remains robust and money supply expansion is running far too fast , " said david brown of bear sterns .
" uk interest rates still have 6 % written all over them in the next few months . "
and royal bank of scotland analyst ross walker added that " the upside risks for interest rates remain in place " .
" overall , uk consumer demand remains fairly resilient in the face of an income squeeze and dismal weather conditions . "

by 2005 , the figure had risen to 19.2 .
' self-confidence ' proposals in the mps ' report , called novice drivers , include : people learning to drive from the age of 17 , but not taking the test until they are 18 drivers completing a set minimum number of lessons with a structured syllabus extending hazard-perception training using computer simulators to encourage better habits in young drivers-to-be a zero alcohol limit for all drivers for a year after passing their test banning drivers from carrying passengers aged between 10 and 20 from 11pm to 5am for a year after passing their test " we can not continue to waste young lives " gwyneth dunwoody mp transport committee chairman gwyneth dunwoody , labour mp for crewe and nantwich , said : " the time has come for a revolutionary change . "
she added : " i think some males would like to drive at 11 .
but the reality is that we are n't talking about people having the odd crunch ... but about people killing themselves and killing others .
" the other side is a rise in the number of young people killing young people in the same car . "
but the move has not been welcomed by all young people .
lauren coles , 18 , from spalding in lincolnshire , told the bbc news website : " this is stupid .
i 've been driving over a year now and i need my driving licence because i live in the middle of nowhere .
" i 've lost two friends in accidents but i would n't change the law on the driving age . "

president evo morales said the deal was the largest foreign investment in the south american country .
the area to be mined , on mount el muntun near the border with brazil , has 40 billion tons of iron and 10 billion tons of magnesium , bolivia said .
bolivia hopes the deal will develop the eastern region and create local jobs .
in the long term , bolivia hopes it will lead to 12,000 jobs in the border city of puerto suarez , a poor and underdeveloped area .
' tough talks ' the deal - which involves plans for both a mine and a steel plant - comes after more than a year of talks .
while the deal was initially signed in june 2006 , failure to agree on the amount jindal would pay for access to bolivian natural gas needed to run the steel plant had delayed the agreement .
bolivian president evo morales said the joint deal came after " very tough " negotiations .
the project is expected to provide bolivia with some $ 200m in tax revenues on an annual basis .

at five o 'clock most mornings , the elite of kayseri are already up and working out .
in the hills that surround the city they take a brisk two-hour hike to start the day .
" we always start very early , " one man puffs .
striding alongside him are the city 's mayor , its business leaders and its police chief .
" that 's the anatolian people .
they have lots of energy , " he says .
kayseri is a clean-living city , and it is also devout .
in turkey today it is pious places like this that are on the rise .
on the outskirts of the neat and tidy town , ahmet hasyuncu runs a successful yarn business .
he 's also head of an industrial estate that has doubled in size in four years and now houses more than 700 companies , most of them home-grown .
at its centre is a vast mosque .
each factory here has at least one prayer room for its workers .
" kayseri is known as a conservative city , but it 's entrepreneurial too , " mr hasyuncu says , surrounded by swirling reels of white cotton on his factory floor .
" our businessmen are reformist - open to change - and we keep our religion out of our work . "
most of ahmet 's trade is with the west .
once a backwater , central turkey - or anatolia - seized advantage of the economic liberalisation of the 1980s to develop into a driving force of the national economy .
local businesses have become known as the " anatolian tigers " .
the region has always been religious .
but now people like mr hasyuncu are prospering they are creating a new , conservative middle class and becoming more prominent .
' worrying ' symbol in strictly secular turkey , that makes some people nervous .
" are we really a threat to the system ? " asks mr hasyuncu , laughing at the suggestion .
" secular turks are trying to label us as something we 're not .
it 's like they 're seeing nightmares . "
if there is a symbol of all that worries secular turks , it is the islamic headscarf and in conservative kayseri covered women are a common sight .
have your say " the only promise of opposition parties seems to be staunchly secular politics " ipek ruacan , ankara , turkey send us your comments turkish voters ' views in one room of a smartly refurbished centre run by the city council , three girls study islamic art , their flat-nibbed pens scratching across the paper .
they say they cover their heads as an expression of their personal faith .
but away from here , less religious turks are convinced the headscarf represents an islamic political agenda .
" we face this kind of attitude very often and it makes us very uncomfortable , " emine says .
" i do n't think my scarf is a threat to anyone .
but what can we do ?
it would take a miracle to change things here . "
at the last election , 54 % of voters here helped elect the ak party into office .
foreign minister abdullah gul is a local .
kayseri promotes itself as proof that you can be a devout muslim and still be secular and modern .
but the fact that religious conservatives have political power now worries some people elsewhere in the country .
that worry is felt in izmir on the west coast , where in the summer locals pack the nightclubs and the bars .
women wear miniskirts and low-cut tops here without a second thought .
and there 's alcohol .
modern lifestyle but izmir people call themselves modern muslims too and for them , it is secularism that is sacred - as introduced by mustafa kemal ataturk .
he banished religion from politics when he founded the republic .
" we need to protect our modern lifestyle .
we do n't want very religious or conservative people to govern us , " says club manager ali korur , as loud music pumps out across the bay from his 24-hour beach club .
mr korur believes the secular system guarantees his freedom .
the most popular political party here in his town is the republican opposition chp .
" we need a leader that takes us to the west not to the east , " he explains .
back in town , hanri benazus sorts through photographs of the leader who first turned turkey to face the west .
" ataturk really was a great man .
everything that is contemporary in turkey is down to him , " he says , pointing out pictures of ataturk in a smart suit and hat , or skimpy swimming shorts .
" some people worry his revolution is in danger , but i think people who are used to modern life will never return to the age of ignorance . "
but that fear is real for some .
when the ak party tried to put a devout man in the presidency , thousands took to the streets in protest carrying enormous national flags .
one of the largest demonstrations was here in izmir .
the government was forced to back down for now .
but some suggest the crisis over the presidential election exposed a deeper division here .
" there may be two turkeys in terms of lifestyle , " concedes professor tanju tosun of izmir 's ege university .
" but step by step we are absorbing democratic values and learning to live together . "
it is a delicate balancing act .
the two turkeys have lived side by side for eight decades .
but now power is swinging towards more religious-minded turks , the country 's secular system - and its democracy - are being tested .

turkey 's two lifestyles : one religious , one secular at five o 'clock most mornings , the elite of kayseri are already up and working out .
in the hills that surround the city they take a brisk two-hour hike to start the day .
" we always start very early , " one man puffs .
striding alongside him are the city 's mayor , its business leaders and its police chief .
" that 's the anatolian people .
they have lots of energy , " he says .
kayseri is a clean-living city , and it is also devout .
in turkey today it is pious places like this that are on the rise .
on the outskirts of the neat and tidy town , ahmet hasyuncu runs a successful yarn business .
he 's also head of an industrial estate that has doubled in size in four years and now houses more than 700 companies , most of them home-grown .
at its centre is a vast mosque .
each factory here has at least one prayer room for its workers .
" kayseri is known as a conservative city , but it 's entrepreneurial too , " mr hasyuncu says , surrounded by swirling reels of white cotton on his factory floor .
" our businessmen are reformist - open to change - and we keep our religion out of our work . "
most of ahmet 's trade is with the west .
pious places like the town of kayseri are on the rise once a backwater , central turkey - or anatolia - seized advantage of the economic liberalisation of the 1980s to develop into a driving force of the national economy .
local businesses have become known as the " anatolian tigers " .
the region has always been religious .
but now people like mr hasyuncu are prospering they are creating a new , conservative middle class and becoming more prominent .
' worrying ' symbol in strictly secular turkey , that makes some people nervous .
" are we really a threat to the system ? " asks mr hasyuncu , laughing at the suggestion .
" secular turks are trying to label us as something we 're not .
it 's like they 're seeing nightmares . "
if there is a symbol of all that worries secular turks , it is the islamic headscarf and in conservative kayseri covered women are a common sight .
have your say the only promise of opposition parties seems to be staunchly secular politics ipek ruacan , ankara , turkey send us your comments turkish voters ' views in one room of a smartly refurbished centre run by the city council , three girls study islamic art , their flat-nibbed pens scratching across the paper .
they say they cover their heads as an expression of their personal faith .
but away from here , less religious turks are convinced the headscarf represents an islamic political agenda .
" we face this kind of attitude very often and it makes us very uncomfortable , " emine says .
" i do n't think my scarf is a threat to anyone .
but what can we do ?
it would take a miracle to change things here . "
at the last election , 54 % of voters here helped elect the ak party into office .
foreign minister abdullah gul is a local .
kayseri promotes itself as proof that you can be a devout muslim and still be secular and modern .
in places like izmir , secularism is sacred but the fact that religious conservatives have political power now worries some people elsewhere in the country .
that worry is felt in izmir on the west coast , where in the summer locals pack the nightclubs and the bars .
women wear miniskirts and low-cut tops here without a second thought .
and there 's alcohol .
modern lifestyle but izmir people call themselves modern muslims too and for them , it is secularism that is sacred - as introduced by mustafa kemal ataturk .
he banished religion from politics when he founded the republic .
" we need to protect our modern lifestyle .
we do n't want very religious or conservative people to govern us , " says club manager ali korur , as loud music pumps out across the bay from his 24-hour beach club .
mr korur believes the secular system guarantees his freedom .
the most popular political party here in his town is the republican opposition chp .
" we need a leader that takes us to the west not to the east , " he explains .
back in town , hanri benazus sorts through photographs of the leader who first turned turkey to face the west .
" ataturk really was a great man .
everything that is contemporary in turkey is down to him , " he says , pointing out pictures of ataturk in a smart suit and hat , or skimpy swimming shorts .
a young woman sports a poster of ataturk at a rally in izmir " some people worry his revolution is in danger , but i think people who are used to modern life will never return to the age of ignorance . "
but that fear is real for some .

more than 50 teams are in the running , with 30 expected to start the race .

the umbrella body added that the gap was not surprising because more people from less well-off backgrounds went into higher education in scotland .
the statistics showed that the university of stirling was one of the best in scotland for student retention , with only 2.8 % of students dropping out of courses in their first year .
